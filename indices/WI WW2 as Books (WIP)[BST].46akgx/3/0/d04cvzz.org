Not likely, for at least two reasons:

1) historical research - I'll have to understand not only WW2 but the preceding decades, and guess their likely response.

2) plotting - I am unsure what would be the major conflict and which historical figures I would be focusing my time on.

I do have a broad idea of what would happen....The story of WW2 would get ignored as fiction.

But as time passed and certain prediction came true(WW1), coupled with the wealth of scientific and engineering information contained within will lead people to consult and believe in it.

The rights revolution will happen faster, because this book will spread across the globe and be translated into many languages and be read by people across all ages and gender, even as people are offended(white, Japanese, queen's sons, etc).

Some lessons will be not be learned, but it is compensated for by being written by the greatest writers in the history of man. The holocaust would be portrayed, as was Hitler's final moments.
