*As an author:*

When uploading a story, something to automatically split out a large document into chapters would be awesome. I'd rather upload one document than manually split out each chapter. That requires people to format their documents properly, though.

Make the "upload a new version of a chapter / story" workflow as blindingly obvious and simple as possible.

Google Docs integration would be nice. If I could share a story with your service and have it be automatically ingested, that would be pretty cool. I'd want to manually control when it updated, of course. In practice, this isn't much different from just uploading files, but it suggests a particular technology that's good for beta readers. Low priority.

(Unless you make something as good as Google Docs, I don't want to edit my work in your interface.)

A preview system for a new story or new chapter. I've had stories that I had to republish four times to get it right. Not terribly professional. If I could preview them instead, that would be a lot nicer for me.

Horizontal rules. I understand that LibreOffice doesn't do real horizontal rules; it just does paragraphs with a "horizontal rule" style. Whatever you can do.

*As a reader:*

RSS feeds for each story and author. (I'm such a big fan of RSS that I made my own RSS reader.)

Ability to download epubs. I had to write my own script to do this eventually (which, on a good day, works on portkey.org, fanfiction.net, and spacebattles forums).

Failing that, semantic CSS classes. I don't want to find the first H1 tag, grab the story name from that, look for the third <select>, get the chapter list from that, etc. I want to be able to search for "div.story" and "h1.title" and "select.chapter" or something simple like that. Also, predictable (or at least discoverable) URLs for each chapter in a story. No Javascript to look up the document ID of chapter N+1.

A dedicated space for author's notes. I want to be able to include them or exclude them from epub generation, or at least have them in a standardized format.

Something better than "sort by number of reviews". If I review a story, it might be to give feedback to the author about a chapter. It might be because the story is terrible and I want to warn people away. ffnet has the "favorite" button to handle this, but I think it would be more effective if it had a "review and favorite" option in addition.

Roll up a succession of chapter reviews by one person into one effective post. I go to fanfiction.net or portkey.org reviews, and I see one person with fifty one-line reviews, one for each chapter. It's a nuisance. Alternatively, only show the reviews for one chapter at a time, but that would be kind of annoying too. Or separate chapter reviews from story reviews, but that's troublesome too.
