Seeing a negative number is discouraging.

If I were doing it, my first hack would have a number of points for each story. An upvote gets you points. A person reading a chapter gets you points. A downvote subtracts points from your future gains, not from your current total. So no story ever sees its point total go down, ever.

You never see the number of points you have; you just see an indicator bar indicating your story's percentile compared with others -- either on the site or in that fandom.

Maybe I'm putting too much emphasis on not discouraging authors. I dunno. Maybe it would be enough to just give X points for each upvote and -Y for each downvote, where Y < X. Maybe raw vote counts would be good. Or just accepting upvotes and displaying upvotes divided by the number of readers.
