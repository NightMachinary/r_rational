I'd like something that did wiki markup, automatic forward and back links from an automatically generated table of contents page... but the author should be able to edit the ToC as well (perhaps with metadata on the chapter) so you can get things like:

<image> Chapter 23, Rational Cannibals (wherein our heroes discover that they taste really good with ketchup)

Intra-story links should be maintained contextually, so if the author needs to rearrange chapters they stay consistent.

Minimal decoration, or the ability for the reader to request a minimally decorated view. Because some of us have eyes that aren't as young as they used to be.
