I always thought that reviews of writing it simply makes so much sense for them to be able to blown up to take the writing.

Especially since you can get some serious in depth stuff. It doesn't have to be but it would be cool.

A delimitation of reviews and comments is something that I feel is very important that FF.net (along with many other things) lacks.

Also this is something that might be too wild but I really think some sort of ability to add a soundtrack to the story by the author would be fantastic. Obviously this can have issues but if when I start reading the action sequence (or more likely when I scroll to a certain place or press a certain button) for some specifically chosen music to set the atmosphere it would be simply amazing.

I know on FF.net many people will often suggest a song for you to go open which works as a stopgap. There was one story I read which was set in a Western theme where the music seriously added to the story, and another that was about car racing or something that had fantastic metal.
