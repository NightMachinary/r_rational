Comment section per chapter, review section per chapter, reviews should be commentable, preferably acting like it itself is a chapter in terms of keeping consistent look.

Comment section should be sortable, as should reviews. Comment section should be like reddit, not sure if you need downvotes, but the default sorting should be age. Comment trees should be possible.
