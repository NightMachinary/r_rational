That is a very interesting idea, I was actually thinking about it. Do you think if I would create something like a basic blogging platform writers would be interested in using it?

I was also thinking that in the future I could provide a store functionality. So that writers could setup their blogs/profiles, write stories, get a lot of subscribers, and then use their pages to sell their ebooks. Do you think this would be useful? Would you want to have a blog like that? What other feature would be important to you?
