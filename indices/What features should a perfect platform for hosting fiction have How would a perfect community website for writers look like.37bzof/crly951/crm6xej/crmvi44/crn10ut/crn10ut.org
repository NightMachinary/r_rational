Agree with [[/u/alexanderwales]] --- github is just not made for this. Using /git/ as a backend would be good, being able to /clone/ or /export/ (to Github, Bitbucket, whatever) the underlying repo would be great, but using Github directly is going to add more friction than benefits.

Plus, how would you handle the private side of things? An author writes drafts and shares them with select betas, proofreaders, etc, /before/ publishing... having it all on a public Github repo would make it all public, that's a no-go. Having some of it in a private repo and some of it in a public repo would cost a lot, and splitting up the repos is going to be clunky.

If you just use git as a backend instead, there's also various features of /git/ that are not used in GitHub that could be useful, such as the "Signed-off-by" lines, and the difference between "author" and "commiter". Not sure about the exact semantics you could apply there, but for example for corrections, you could have a random community member "author" a correction, then a beta or more reputed proof-reader "signs off" on the correction, and finally the author "commits" the change.
