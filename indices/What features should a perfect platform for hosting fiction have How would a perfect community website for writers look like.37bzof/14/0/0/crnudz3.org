Please do not require markdown. Your default format should be HTML. Everything on the planet can spit out HTML -- Word, Google Docs, *Office, etc -- so it gives you the widest format support all in one go. It also allows for very rich styling options for those who know what they're doing.

Also, when you're getting started, just take whatever people upload and display it. Don't try to check for malware or strip links or whatever. Wait until those things are problems before trying to address them and, when you do, please don't use FFN's bigger hammer approach.
