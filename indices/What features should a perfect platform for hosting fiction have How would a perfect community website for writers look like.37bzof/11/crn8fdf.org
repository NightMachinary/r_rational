Don't know if this would be good for a "professional" fiction site, but I've long wished Fanfiction.net or ArchiveOfOurOwn had a sorting algorithm that would factor "favs per total viewers", possibly adjusted for length too. As it stands, fics that are older, longer, and "more mainstream" are the ones that sort to the top when sorted by favs.
