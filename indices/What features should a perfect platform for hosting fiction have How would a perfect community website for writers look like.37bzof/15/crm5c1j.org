*As a reader*

- Having a digest sent every week (with the day selectable, for me that would be friday or saturday) of all updates that occurred (story updates, new stories in collections I follow, new stories by authors I follow, etc) in that past week.
- FF.net theming controls are fine, could afford to be more obvious and have more / better fonts.
- A clean reading UI.
- A lot of stories have very long chapters, which is great, but I'd love to be able to keep my place /within/ a chapter (page scroll) when switching computers/devices.
- A way to hide the authors' notes, and also a way to read only the authors' notes.
- Good search within the entire site, with a rich syntax and some kind of "relevancy index" and/or "quality index" (think Github/Google/ElasticSearch).
- Full text search within a story. This is something I'm really missing right now, and relying on google/extraction tools for.
- Related to the above, full text search with the story /except the stuff I haven't already read/.
- Blacklisting of entire categories, for example harry-ron romance, or Fate/Stay fanfic for the spoilers...
- /Reader tags./ So instead of the author having full control over (forgetting to) tag their story, delegate a bit of that to the community. Mark author tags as special/immutable, but allow the readers to add stuff. There would need to be some kind of restriction or control on this, so maybe...
- Reputation a la Stack Overflow. Certainly not for ranking authors (let reviews/comments/favs/stats/etc do that) but for allowing good readers/reviewers/community members to have access to some tag editing and moderation tools.

*As a writer*

- Simple formatting, but more than FF.net and also more than Medium. I don't want the full range of formatting options, but bold, italic, underline, alignment, section separators, whitespace control (for poetry, mostly) as a minimum.
- *Stable* formatting. FF.net had the reputation of changing formatting rules without notice at some point, making many stories' formatting implode. Medium mangles some formatting, most often I observe it has trouble with whitespace.
- If writing my stories directly on the site, I like to have a "distraction-free" environment, maybe behind a button/setting, and optionally a "Hemingway" mode that doesn't allow editing until you finish writing a draft.
- Also related to writing directly on the site, a good autosave that never lets me lose anything. See Medium, for example: if my computer is hit by lightning, I expect to at most loose a paragraph.
- Still related to that, an offline mode, for obvious reasons.
- As expressed by others, an easy way to add metadata (author notes) to a story, and differentiate between displaying some "before chapter" and "after chapter" if required.
- Links within metadata.
- Syndication to other sites, as audiences won't move so easily... so being able to publish once on the service, and have it syndicated to FF.net/AO3/Fictionaut (for short pieces)/etc.
- Easy licensing options (Creative Commons, Public Domain, All Right Reserved, others?)
- Import from other sites.
- Ability to host and sell access to /paid/ stories.
- A queue to post things at certain times without manual intervention.

*Generally*

- Competent moderators.
- Maybe separate comment and review systems? I'd love a site where there is a culture of critical and/or constructive /reviews/, but also "I like it"-style /comments/ and questions.
- QA sections for each story, at the author's opt-in, to provide an out-of-story but well-organised way to answer reader questions.
- QA events, AMA-style but maybe more organised, with a group of authors, or authors in a genre, or inversely, with select readers/reviewers/etc.
- Collaborative writing is Hardâ„¢ but if someone can figure out a good UX for it, that would be neat.
- Open source.
- Ability to donate to authors, possibly through a partnership or integration with Patreon or Gratipay.
