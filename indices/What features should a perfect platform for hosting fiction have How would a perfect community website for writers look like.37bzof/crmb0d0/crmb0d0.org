I like the design of fimfiction.net and think it would be a far better baseline to strive for than fanfiction.net's. I recommend checking it out. Really wish it contained more than just pony stuff. Some features:

- great search function
- each fic can be downloaded in a selection of formats
- bookmarks can be set within chapters of each fic, which is really neat if you have to stop in the middle of a huge chapter.
- If you view a story, on the side are a lot of recommendations of stories that are similar, by the same author or also read by others who read this one
- You get feeds from authors you follow, which you can divide into getting just stories, or blog posts etc.
- Probably a few more nifty things I don't think of at the moment
- I'm pretty sure I read a story where part of it was written in crayon by Pinkie Pie, but that might have been a dream.

Here's a story you can check it out with. On the bottom right you will notice that it is featured in the lesswrong group.
