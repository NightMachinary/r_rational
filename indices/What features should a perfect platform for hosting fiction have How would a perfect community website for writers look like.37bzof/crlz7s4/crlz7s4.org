I miss something like github-style forking and pull requests. A lot of fanfics I enjoy have little to no editorial support and it shows. Being able to easily help fix things like typos, misapplied/misrepresented concepts or grammatical idiosyncrasies would be awesome. Not to mention having a decent way to actually collaborate on a story. There are people good at dishing out amazing concepts and others who are good at turning those into elegant prose. The system could be designed to very visibly highlight the heritage of each story, maybe even on paragraph-level.
