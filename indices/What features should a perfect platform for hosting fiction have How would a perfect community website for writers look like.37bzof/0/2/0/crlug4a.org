If you open dev tools, search for the equivalent of =-webkit-user-select: none;= and remove it, you'll be able to select text and copy it again. It's just some silly CSS.

The reason that disabling JavaScript allows you to copy is because that inline style is added via Javascript that checks for a cookie. It's in combo.js:

#+begin_example
  a.css("-webkit-touch-callout","none");
  a.css("-webkit-user-select","none");
  a.css("-khtml-user-select","none");
  a.css("-moz-user-select","none");
  a.css("-ms-user-select","none");
  a.css("user-select","none");
#+end_example
