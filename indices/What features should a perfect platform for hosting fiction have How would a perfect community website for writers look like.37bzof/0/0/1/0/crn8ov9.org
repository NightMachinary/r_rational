Interesting. What fandoms are you in? I feel like I get a good amount of activity but I was writing mostly Harry Potter on FFnet before I sort of faded from that and am writing mostly Homestuck on Ao3, so it may be a fandom thing rather than an archive thing.

EDIT: Also, what would a new and improved comment/review system look like? I don't have any complaints with Ao3, so I'm wondering what I may be overlooking.
