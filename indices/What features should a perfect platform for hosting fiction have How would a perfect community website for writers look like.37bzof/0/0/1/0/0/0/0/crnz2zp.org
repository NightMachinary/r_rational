  That seems to be more a problem of the culture. Even a New&Improved site might get that issue (although having an explicit star rating as, say, Rational Reads has, might help).

I wouldn't really call it a "problem with the culture" - I think that FFN's review system is optimized really well for author feedback on each chapter - and so that's what it's used for. When I write a "review", I expect it will, at best, be seen by maybe two prospective readers before it's buried. As a result, I use it as a way to give feedback to the author, in such a manner that the author can but does not feel obligated to respond. Which is how 99% of people use it - if you look at the FFN reviews, they're all addressing the author, not prospective readers.

When I view reviews on Amazon, I see a summary of star ratings, I see the distribution (to see if the 3.7 star rating is because it's polarizing or because it's just plain mediocre), and it includes a view to see the "Most helpful positive reviews" and "most helpful critical reviews". As a result, I can usually find a summary written by some community member that accurately outlines its good and bad points.

I like how RationalReads allows for star ratings, but the "most helpful review" feature is what I truly find valuable.
