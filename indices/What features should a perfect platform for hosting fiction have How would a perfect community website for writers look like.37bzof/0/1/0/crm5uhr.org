I would say that reviews can't be responded to, period. As you say, the 'response' consists of sending a PM, which is not the same thing as responding in public to a statement made in public.

I had one reviewer who read through the first ~20 or so chapters of 2YE (all that was up at the time), leaving profane and insulting reviews on every single one. (Oddly, most of those reviews ended with something like "really enjoying it!") The problem was that most of what he was calling out related to things that he had misunderstood, misread, or not read at all. I would very much have liked to leave responses saying "thank you for the input, please try not to be so profane and personal, and you actually missed a bit here" so that people reading the reviews would get both sides.
