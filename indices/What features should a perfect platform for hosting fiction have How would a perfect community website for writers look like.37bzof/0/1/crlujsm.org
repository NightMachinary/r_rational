+1 to all this, and to add a bit more detail to my biggest grievance, the terrible review system:

- Reviews can't be responded to if written by guest accounts.

- Reviews are responded to as private messages in interface

- Responses to reviews can't be seen by others.

Would love to see a publishing platform that allowed for more dynamic and organized author-audience interaction.
