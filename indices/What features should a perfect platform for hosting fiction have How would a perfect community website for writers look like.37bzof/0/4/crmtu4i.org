Thank you very much for your reply!

- Copy-pasting text and adding links will not be a problem =)
- Stoiries will be written in simple markdown, it seems to be the most elegant way. I'll think about how I can add more interesting formatting features. Is there anything you find specifically important?
- Publishing process will be as simple as writing or copy pasting markdown. In the future I am planning to add github integration.
- Reviews and discovery system will be similar to reddit.
- I'm still thinking about organizing 'meta' stuff, I'll make sure to make it as good as possible.

I'll need to think about commenting specific lines. Maybe there will be some clever way to do this.

But yeah, I'm definitely planning to fix all the problems you've outlined.
