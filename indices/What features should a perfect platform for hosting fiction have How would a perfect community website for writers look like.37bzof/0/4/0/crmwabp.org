Markdown is great. The one thing that I'd request are keyboard shortcuts, so that =ctrl + i= will give me asterisks around my selection, or throw down two asterisks with the cursor in the middle of them (which is the current behavior of [[http://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite]]). But then, I love keyboard shortcuts.

Live Preview would also be a definite plus (also currently implemented by [[http://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite]]).
