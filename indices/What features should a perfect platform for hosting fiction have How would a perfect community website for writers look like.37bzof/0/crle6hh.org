  What features do you miss on fanfiction.net?
#+end_quote

My problems with ff.net:

- Inability to copy+paste text
- Inability to do much in the way of formatting
- Publishing is a multi-stage process from Doc Manager to publication - should just be a single screen
- Docs go "out of date", which makes editing or reworking old stuff a pain
- Terrible review system
- Inability to link to a review
- Inability to add a link within a story
- Clunky method of doing "meta" stuff like author's notes, FAQ, etc.
- Terrible "discovery" system

Pretty much all those complaints apply to FictionPress as well.

I really like how Google Docs allows comments directly on the page, but that's definitely a technical challenge (and should probably start disabled if you want to share works). Having people be able to point to a line and say "this would make it better" is a godsend.
