Given the maturity level displayed by the internet at large, I sort of wonder whether author-audience interactions would go so well. Even with the current system as it is, I've seen authors calling out reviewers in the header of a chapter as "haters". Hell, this has happened in the real world with best-selling authors, and the big difference is that there's almost never someone holding a (mostly) anonymous fanfic author back and telling them that it's not a good idea to start a flame war about how awesome your work of fiction is.

I mean, I'm a pretty level-headed guy, but when I get a review that says something like, "I wish I could teleport the author to me so I could punch him in the face" I do feel the urge to say something in response.

On the other hand, I love schadenfreude.
