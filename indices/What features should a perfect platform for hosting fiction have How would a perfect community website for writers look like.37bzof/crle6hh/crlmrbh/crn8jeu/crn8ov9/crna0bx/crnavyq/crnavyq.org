  However, I often want to leave an actual review, like: "Cool ideas, horrible grammar, follows canon religiously which I hate but might be your thing, overall 3/5 stars". I also want to read such reviews. Amazon's review system would work really well for this sort of thing. If you tried that on FFN, you'd only make the author cry, and your review would quickly get buried under 25 reviews for chapter 31 saying "ha ha yay update".

That seems to be more a problem of the culture. Even a New&Improved site might get that issue (although having an explicit star rating as, say, Rational Reads has, might help).

  My other complaint with AO3: you can't run exclusions for pairing types. You can search "Gen", but that will show you fics that are tagged "Gen", PLUS fics tagged "Gen and M/F and Multi" for example. I'm usually trying to filter out pairings, not filter in.

I've also had trouble with excluding things. Alas.
