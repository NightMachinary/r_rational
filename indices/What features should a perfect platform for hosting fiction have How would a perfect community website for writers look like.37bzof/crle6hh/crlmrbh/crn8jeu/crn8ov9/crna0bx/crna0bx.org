Sorting by kudos sorts by popularity, which is not the same thing as quality. It's still quite useful, but I'll give Kudos to anything I "enjoyed", even if I wouldn't give it "5 stars".

I feel like Reviews, Comments, and Feedback To The Author are three fundamentally different things. AO3 has comments, and its format works very well for both comments and author feedback, and the [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/551606][occasional]] [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/394694][roleplay]]. FFN's reviews are really just for author feedback.

However, I often want to leave an /actual review/, like: "Cool ideas, horrible grammar, follows canon religiously which I hate but might be your thing, overall 3/5 stars". I also want to read such reviews. Amazon's review system would work really well for this sort of thing. If you tried that on FFN, you'd only make the author cry, and your review would quickly get buried under 25 reviews for chapter 31 saying "ha ha yay update".

I'm in the Homestuck and Naruto fandoms, mainly. I'd love to read Avengers fics if there were better ways to sift out the slash. I mostly try to read action/comedy, but AO3 is literally 90% slash - I have no problem, but it's not my thing.

Complaints with AO3: it's easier to search by tag, but harder to search by genre. Authors can throw as many genre tags as they want, which has pros and cons, and sometimes you get competing tags (for example, "MS Paint Adventures" and "Homestuck", before the system started knowing they really mean the same thing 95% of the time)

My other complaint with AO3: you can't run exclusions for pairing types. You can search "Gen", but that will show you fics that are tagged "Gen", PLUS fics tagged "Gen and M/F and Multi" for example. I'm usually trying to filter /out/ pairings, not filter /in/.
