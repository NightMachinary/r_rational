There's a lot of good suggestions about interface and features for both readers and authors, so I'll add something different.

With the TPP coming up and copyright generally being an enormous pain, I'd love to see some clarity around sharing rules. Specifically, instead of the usual garbage terms of service - just make works pick a creative commons license.

CC-BY-NC-ND is actually a better deal than most hosts offer, to start with! Others encourage more community interaction, promote openness, and there's the advantage that unlike normal terms people actually understand what these options mean.
