Yup. I have stuff on ff.net at this very moment which contains errors I've never fixed, because the process for it is basically:

- Read review that points out error.
- Go into doc manager, load up the chapter.
- Find error.
- Fix error.
- Save.
- Go into story manager.
- Update chapter.

This is fine if there are one or two things, but if there are more, it makes the unpleasant-but-necessary janitorial work of writing really arduous. In Google Docs, it's literally a single click to fix something that's wrong.
