Markdown is fine - I write in Scrivener, but haven't yet made the switch to using exclusively Markdown there (though I should).

I personally wouldn't use github for writing, because there's not usually much cause for me to fork/merge/revert, and I think github is overcomplicating things if you just have one single file (or even set of files) that would be represented in source control as a single unbroken chain. But I don't do much in the way of collaboration. The use case might be for users to make corrections, but ... I'd have to see the workflow for that.
