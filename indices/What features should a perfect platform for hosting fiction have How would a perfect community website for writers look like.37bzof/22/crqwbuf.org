As far as I'm concerned what will make or break your platform is tagging and searching. AO3 is the best I'm aware of on this front but even they're not quite where I'd like them to be. As far as fanfiction goes you'll want to have dedicated tagging categories for:

- Fandoms
- Major Characters (AO3 only has a general character category but this runs into problems since people tend to tag every character that is even mentioned. If I search for Hermione Granger I want stories /focused/ on Hermione. Seperating major and minor characters avoids this)
- Minor Characters
- Relationships (Serious friendships, romantic relationships, technical Homestuck shipping, etc)
- You could consider having categories for genres (drama, romcom, horror, etc) and classifications (oneshot, gen, slash, crack, etc)
- A rating system
- A specifier for the genders in the romantic focus (straight, girl/girl, boy/boy, other, poly, etc)
- A set of standard warnings for things that seriously bother people (NonCon, Character Death, Violence, etc)
- Additional tags to their heart's desire

For original fiction not all of the above will be useful but you'll definitely want a dedicated genre tagging section. As far as searching is concerned you'll want two methods:

- A user friendly setup like AO3's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/search][search page]] that allows you to easily specify several metrics and search for them
- A option for advanced users that uses logical notation, parentheses for grouping, and wildcards to allow you to fully specify what you're looking for. For example I want to be able to search =(Fandoms:(Homestuck && ~(Puella Magi Madoka Magica)) || Major Characters:(Aranea Serket && Meenah Peixes)) && Rating:(>=Teen && <=Explicit)= Which should return works with ratings between Teen and Explicit inclusive that either are in the Homestuck fandom but not the Puella Magi Madoka Magica one or feature Aranea Serket and Meenah Peixes as major characters
