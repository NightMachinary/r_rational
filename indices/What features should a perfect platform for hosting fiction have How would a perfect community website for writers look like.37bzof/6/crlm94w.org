Look at Archive Of Our Own ([[http://www.archiveofourown.org][www.archiveofourown.org]]) for a good example. It has a much, much easier interface than fanfiction.net, its tagging system is rich and has a lot of advantages, it has nice features like letting you group stories into collections, you can reply to reader comments with proper discussion threads, etc.

Some features I'd like: * For readers: a feature to auto-recommend stories based on the currently viewed story or your pattern of likes, sort of like Amazon does. ("people who liked this story also like", "people who liked works you like also liked this new story", etc.) * For authors: a way to upload chapters and have them published automatically at preset dates/times. Good for serial fiction. AO3 lets you upload chapters in advance, but you have to manually press a button when you want to publish them (and manually edit the publish date for it to be the pub date rather than the upload date).
