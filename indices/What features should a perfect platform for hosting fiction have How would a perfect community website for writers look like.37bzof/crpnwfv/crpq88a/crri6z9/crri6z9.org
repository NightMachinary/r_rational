I personally wouldn't use it, but if what you're suggesting would be a bit like Deviant Art's profiles / artist blog page / whatever they're called, it could work?

But probably don't try to reinvent yet another blogging platform. Simple "profile posts" as a lightweight fallback for those who don't want or need anything else, maybe. But what could be interesting is an integration with other blogging platforms, so people who already have wordpress/ghost/etc blogs can show their posts on their profiles or something.

The store functionality would be great, requires a lot more thought/design though I'm sure ;)
