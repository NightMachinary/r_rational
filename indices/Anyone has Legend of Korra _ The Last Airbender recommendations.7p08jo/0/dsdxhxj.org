Hydrogen. Helium. Lithium. Beryllium. <list goes on for a while>. Tennessine. Oganesson.

Long ago, the 118 nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.

Only the Avatar, master of all 118 elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished.

A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, a nitrogenbender named Aang, and although his nitrogenbending skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

But I believe Aang can figure out what the heck is up with those fire benders. I mean fire is not even an element. And how do they do that lightning thing. What's that got to do with fire? I really hope Aang can figure that out. Oh, and save the world.
