The three reviews that I've watched (or, at least, the ones I remember watching---I think I may have forgotten one)---[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1ekVcFsa2A][The Mysterious Mr. Enter's one video on Season 1]] (53 minutes), [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmKaQqinWKY][E;R's four videos on the series in general]] (89 minutes), and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5gGEWqO_Ag][E;R's four videos on the Avatar Wan episodes in particular]] (103 minutes)---point out many holes in the setting, IIRC.

(After being thoroughly put off by the first three or four episodes many years ago, I never bothered to seek out any other episodes, so I have no independent opinion.)
