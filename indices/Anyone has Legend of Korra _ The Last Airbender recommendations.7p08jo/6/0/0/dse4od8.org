Woof. Ok, do you want me to just get into the things most likely pertinent to your fic, I.E. the problems with the setting and backstory, or would you prefer I really go all in on my problems with it(characters mainly, I'll try to hold back on story criticism because it really doesn't matter if you're making a rational fic)? Because I could do either, but I don't want to go too off topic if you don't feel like it OP.
