I feel like Embers is in some ways like korra, flawed in character while having immense potential in setting and worldbuilding. If anything, maybe it needs a rational rewrite as well.

For those who haven't managed to get through it, Embers has an expanded worldbuilding to TLA, with major focuses being spirit interaction (and old conspiracies), international politics, and cultural differences. I think a lot of the fic is pandering, and the gaang characterization is bad, but the worldbuilding is really good.
