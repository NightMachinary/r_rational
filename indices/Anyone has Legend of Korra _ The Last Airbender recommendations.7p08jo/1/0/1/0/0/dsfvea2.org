No worries, I understand.

And the reason I disagree is because isn't that kind of the point of rational fiction? To take the conventions of a story and extrapolate them out to their logically consistent conclusion?

HPMOR did this with tons of HP lore that was definitely meant to be there to simply enrich the story, as opposed to being consistent/accurate and it was lauded for it.

Metropolitan Man does this with Superman by throwing in all of the side effects we rarely see in the main stories, such as the political implications, the fact that Lois and Lex are perplexed by his 9-5, etc. Superman being Clark Kent was all for the purpose of story; it was to make him relatable and human, for all that he was not.

Pretty much every ratfic out there is guilty of this; of taking elements of a work that were simply put there to aid/enrich/brighten/enhance//insert adjective here/ and deconstructing it. So it's a bit unfair to accuse Embers of doing the same thing.

It's also worth noting that the soldiers Aang tossed over didn't die but they definitely came pretty close to it; that's why Zuko was so pissed. Not so much because Aang attacked his soldiers; they were on opposing sides and Embers!Zuko is big on honor and all that, but because of how innately hypocritical his actions are. He claims to be a pacifist and not want to hurt/kill anyone yet throws tanks off of thousand foot cliffs and bonds with a spirit to kill hundreds, if not thousands, of Fire Nation soliders (And it's worth noting that Embers characters, for the most part, looks on using spirits in war the same way we look at using nukes which, if you've seen the end of Book 1 in canon, is a pretty damn accurate comparison)

Again, Zuko's main issue isn't that Aang killed (or tried to kill) so many of his people, though I won't say he's pleased about that. He's angry at the sheer hypocrisy of Aang's ideals based on his actions.
