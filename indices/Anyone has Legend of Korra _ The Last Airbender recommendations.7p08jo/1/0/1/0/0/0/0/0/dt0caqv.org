He's naive and immature, but also wise and genuinely concerned with the well being of other people. Ember exaggerates one side of his personality and downplays the other. It takes away all his virtues and then turns around and bitches about what an awful person he is. When I say his actions weren't rational, I don't mean "he acted irrationally," that's a given, I mean it's not rational to /write/ him acting that way.
