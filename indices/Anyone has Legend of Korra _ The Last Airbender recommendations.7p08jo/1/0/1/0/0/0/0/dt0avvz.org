But Aang is not rational, nor he's meant to be. Both in canon and in Ember. He is a young kid, raised by monks and never exposed to violence and its consequences, who thinks that others kids are the same as him while (in the fanfic) they come from a place where surviving requires killing (animals) and mad and dangerous people are left to die on the permafrost. His friends never feel they have to correct him as they too think he must know the same reality when in fact he does not. It's a much more realistic take on cultural clashes, I think.
