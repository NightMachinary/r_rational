No one is saying the Fire Nation's actions are just and noble; what they're saying is that the Fire Lord was nuts and the nation had to follow along with it, for the most part. Even canon does this, showing us more and more that the Fire Nation is just that; a nation. With all kinds of people. But most of them just want to live their lives and be happy as opposed to burn down the world.

No one says Aang is evil. Aang is definitely treated as childish and selfish but, canonically, that's exactly what he is. Especially considering the fic starts at the beginning of Book 2, before a lot of his character development. He's also treated as ignorant and naive which...he is. And that's not a bad thing or unexpected; he's a twelve year old monk from a century in the past. It would be more shocking if he wasn't a fish out of water.

Zuko is definitely the main protagonist of the story but he is by no means the world's principal protagonist.
