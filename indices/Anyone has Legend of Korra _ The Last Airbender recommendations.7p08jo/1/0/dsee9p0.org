I've seen Embers recommended frequently. I tried it and could not enjoy it. I felt like it took a really interesting concept, adding nuance to the ethical situation of the people involved in the Fire Nation war, and took it to bizarre extremes. Suddenly all characters in the world agree that the Fire Nation is noble and just, while the Avatar and his few supporters are selfish and evil.

I could understand if this was shown to be the perspective of characters on the Fire Nation's side of the war. But from what I read before I gave up, the author seemed to be attempting to present this as the objective reality of the story, seemingly due to being a Zuko fan and wanting to make Zuko into the world's principal protagonist.
