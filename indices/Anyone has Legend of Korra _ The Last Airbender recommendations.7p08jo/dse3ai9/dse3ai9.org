There is a great Zuko centric fanfic somewhere on Fanfic.net - found it! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers]]

Been a while since I read it! But hasa ton of really great background details based on canon facts, fantastic worldbuilding.

We follow Zuko in his exile as a prince, and what would happen if he was not as consumed by demons of the past - Zuko is more powerful, plans more, looks out for his people and has more powerful allies. While Aang is still an airhead and screws everything up with his /good intentions/. Zukos rants at Aangs stupidity are quite entertaining.
