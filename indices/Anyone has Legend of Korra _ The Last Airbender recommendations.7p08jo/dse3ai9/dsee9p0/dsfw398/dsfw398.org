I personally found the perpetual Katara bashing to be a very novel and refreshing perspective. It reminded me of a /Harry Potter/ story (I don't remember which one; it wasn't a particular stand-out, IIRC) in which Hermione was portrayed as a mean know-it-all who actually /did/ deserve to have no friends.
