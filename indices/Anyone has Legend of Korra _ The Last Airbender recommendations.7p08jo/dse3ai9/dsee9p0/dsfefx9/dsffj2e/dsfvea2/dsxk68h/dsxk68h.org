that hypocrisy only exists because the author tried to make a setting with more realistic consequences without altering the actions of any non-Zuko characters. If canon Aang lived in a world without cartoon physics, he wouldn't throw people off cliffs or into freezing water. Or if he did, he would treat it seriously, like he did with the Koizilla incident in canon. Basically the author insisted on the Gaang adhering to the Stations of Canon when it wasn't remotely rational in context.
