Yeah, I've seen fics that do this kind of thing, and I never like it.

In canon, the idea is that characters never accidentally kill anyone in combat (unless it's part of an arc about how some character is reckless and ready to endanger civilian lives or something). So those fire nation soldiers Aaang throws in the water are perfectly fine. This isn't meant to be realistic, it's meant to be an abstraction: the characters don't kill unless they want to; people do die in the war, and clearly characters like Azula can and do kill people on occasion (offscreen).

You can move away from canon, and go for a more realistic "there's no such thing as a nonlethal weapon", but then you have to update all your characters accordingly, not just your protagonists. So either Aang accepts that sometimes killing your enemy is inevitable, or he goes the extra mile to keep them safe (fish them out of water, or even get them medical attention) and is torn apart whenever doing that conflicts with his greater goals.

Keeping Aang's actions the same while changing the consequences of these actions technically /is/ "bringing conventions from the show to logical extremes", but it feels dishonest to me. I think this is an area where the "If you give Frodo a Lightsaber, Sauron gets a Death Star" principle applies for me. If you make a character more able to detect the setting's inconsistencies, then you have to make the setting more consistent in response; else you're not making a good rational fic, you're just engaging in "I'm right and everyone else is insane" power fantasy.
