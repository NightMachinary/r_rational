If I recall correctly, the fic took the cartoon conventions from the show and brought them to logical extremes.

It argues that Aang's technically a pacifist because he doesn't /directly/ kill, only lets people die after putting them in a deadly situation. Which, just, c'mon. That's ascribing some immense stupidity to him and everyone who follows him.

Those fire nation soldiers Aang floods off Zuko's ship in the first episode? They froze to death in the water. That sort of thing pops up again and again, and it did ultimately make me stop reading the fic.

The idea was interesting, and there were some actually decent arguments for the Gaang's lack of responsibility, but the fic rode a relatively small detail - that was pretty clearly meant to make the story work in a children's cartoon format - pretty damn hard.
