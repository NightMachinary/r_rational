Eugh, would it be off topic for me to rant a bit about the many problems I think Korra has? I want you to know them if you're going to actually make a fic, because... there's a lot.

And I don't just mean story problems, or character problems, no those could be fixed. I'm talking about some problems with the setting itself, and how little it makes sense.
