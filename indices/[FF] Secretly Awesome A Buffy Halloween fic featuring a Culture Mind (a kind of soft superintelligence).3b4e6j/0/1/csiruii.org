I don't think my portrayal of the /SA/ is particularly violent. The ship had no idea how much time was left and was pretty sure Ethan wouldn't talk unless terrified. Force was justified. I've written 6 chapters so far, and this is the /only/ time in those chapters where the ship actually hurts someone.
