I will explicitly state that I do /not/ endorse all of the Culture's morality. Here's what I do think:

- The Culture is still awesome for other reasons, at least as a civilization to tell stories about.
- Minds do not appear to be depicted as being as strongly intelligent as, say, CelestAI, etc., and I will honor that depiction.
- The Culture's morality is closer to correct that almost everyone else's that I've read depicted in professionally published fiction. (If you have any published examples of better morality, combined with kick-ass, please let me know!)
- If you read carefully between the lines, Culture Minds are actually /not/ utilitarian optimizers. They would probably argue that pure utilitarian optimizers are "boring," just like Hegemonizing Swarms. In this sense, by strict multiplication, they are evil, though they would argue that this is a bad standard for morality.

For what it's worth, do consider that the /Secretly Awesome/ is a Mind version of a girl that likes to imagine herself as a Mind. This means, for example, that /SA/ is not offended by humans wanting to be Minds. We'll see that this Mind is actually very "liberal."
