As for why they didn't read his mind, that's actually mentioned (obliquely) in the text. There is a strong cultural aversion to mindreading (mind raping).

Dyson-swarming the universe is Strongly Disapproved of among the 'elder' races. There is a a nanobot-swarm-type thing that exists in Culture and the races go out of the way to eliminate them. Races are supposed to adhere to reasonable expansion rates. They generally end up subliming before this becomes an issue.

They DO practice mass-uploading. It's not enforced. They're liberal enough to let people make their own choices.
