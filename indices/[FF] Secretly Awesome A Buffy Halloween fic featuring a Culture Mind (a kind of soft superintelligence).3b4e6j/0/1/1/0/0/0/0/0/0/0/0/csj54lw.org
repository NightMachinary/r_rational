I don't know.

I was going with the assumption that the spell just tried to do a "straight copy", but it couldn't find the actual Mind because the Mind was in hyperspace and the spell didn't know about that or couldn't find a local equivalent, so what it got was basically a big local cache plus a bunch of high-speed network interchanges plus the equivalent of dangling cables and a smoking hole, and some inert hardware operating on a theory of physics that no longer holds.

I don't know how precisely the spell works. Would Force techniques work? Would ancient Sith techniques to suck out all life on the planet work? Is there an "energy limit"? If so, a Culture vessel would pretty much crash straight into it with the symbolic force of a nuclear bomb hitting a mosquito on the way down.

[edit] If you want to be more upbeat about it, the Ship noticed in the first second after arrival that its mere operation was overloading physics and shut itself down to avoid damaging the spell, leaving the Avatar to figure things out.

Oh, also? "Gods, and from the far side." Ethan is in a coma due to Janus suffering from an acute case of power exhaustion, it's taking basically all his will to keep the Secretly Awesome from suffering a spontaneous existence failure. Not gonna figure things out /that/ easily.

[edit edit] I fucking hate it when I edit a comment and Reddit eats an earlier change I made. I've lost so much text to that over time. Really gotta remember to reload the page before making any changes.
