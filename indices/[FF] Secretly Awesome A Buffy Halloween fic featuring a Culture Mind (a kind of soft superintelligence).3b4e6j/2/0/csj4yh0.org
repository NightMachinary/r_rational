  The fact that they communicate to their dissociated hosts as an independent awareness is frankly nightmarish. As an independent awareness, the nonchalance with which the hosts treat this is out of character.

If I understand this, you're asking why the originals are treating their possible mergers with such nonchalance? First, it's not clear to the characters that there will actually be a merge. The idea of a merge seems at this point to be merely a far-fetched hope of Zander, who doesn't want to die. Second, the originals have access to all of the thoughts of their possessors, and they can see quite starkly how similar they are. This whole evening, though we haven't been able to see it, they've been both disturbed and impressed with the actions of their guests. It's as though someone handed you a cheat-sheet to being a more awesome version of yourself, complete with source code. Scary and rapey? Absolutely. Possible death of personality? Very much not.

This is terminology taken directly from the Culture books, and it's something that Willow Rosenberg would know of and choose to say here.

  The entire exchange beginning with 'do you trust me?' and ending with 'thank you again' is bizarre and wouldn't really happen...

Yep. Deleted it and made some minor changes to the area. The original idea was that /SA/ was using this weird question to convince the others to hold off on discussing the problem.
