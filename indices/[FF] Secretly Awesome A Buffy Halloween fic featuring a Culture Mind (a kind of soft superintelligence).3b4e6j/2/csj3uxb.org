The fact that they communicate to their dissociated hosts as an independent awareness is frankly nightmarish. As an independent awareness, the nonchalance with which the hosts treat this is out of character. Buffy especially would not care for not being able to control her own body, her resignation is especially out of character. The dialogue is weird. "premise-state clones?" What does that even mean? And what the hell is going on in the last section?

The entire exchange beginning with 'do you trust me?' and ending with 'thank you again' is bizarre and wouldn't really happen, considering that this was somehow an unresolved feeling of a lack of trust (that a Mind wouldn't be able to detect the refutation of on their own) that wasn't already dealt with in their long tenure in their own universe itself. Its presence seems motivated entirely for the purpose of expositing their relationships with each other, /to/ each other, for the benefit of the reader. This is akin to describing a character by having him look in a mirror and describe himself to himself. It doesn't make sense in the context of the story and it's a stilted, awkward way of communicating information to the reader. By TheAzreal:

  Buffi and Zander's characterization also isn't immediately striking, and their comments about the years they've spent with Willo end off coming just a little flat and unimpressive
