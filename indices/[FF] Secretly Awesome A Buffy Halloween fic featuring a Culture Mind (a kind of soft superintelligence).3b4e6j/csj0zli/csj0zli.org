By the way, you can read the first seven Culture books [[http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/More_Books_and_Reports/The_Culture_Novels-Iain_M_Bainks-Anarchist_Science_Fiction/][here]]. In 1997, the year when this story takes place, the first five (through /Excession/, as I hint at in the story) have been published. Willow has read all of them, Xander some, and Buffy none.
