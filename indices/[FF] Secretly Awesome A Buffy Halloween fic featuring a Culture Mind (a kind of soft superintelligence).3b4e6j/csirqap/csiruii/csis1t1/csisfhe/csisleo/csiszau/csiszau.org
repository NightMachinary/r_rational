I'm trying to set up a sustainable writing/publishing cycle. I also find that I need to edit earlier chapters to account for new things I've learned in writing later chapters. This is particularly important when writing a Mind, since you'll often realize several steps downplot that what's going on is something that the Mind should have forseen and prepared for, and you have to change the plot accordingly.
