Cultural aversions are things for times when you weren't just copied into a new universe and discovered that you were fictional, imo.

  Dyson-swarming the universe is Strongly Disapproved of among the 'elder' races.

None of which, as far as seems, exist in this universe. There's no reason to stick to a precommitment made with societies who no longer exist.

Sure, with a strong cultural pressure towards 300ish. Cultural pressure as exerted /by Minds/ is honestly far worse to me than "mere" mindreading.

  There is a a nanobot-swarm-type thing that exists in Culture and the races go out of the way to eliminate them.

You know, if I was a superintelligence who just got copied out of fiction, I'd take a good hard look at my most cherished beliefs and wonder which ones were good ideas and which ones were author bias. If a Mind were to do this, they might come to the conclusion that the "no mindreading" and all the focus on human beings was really obviously just a way to have useful human characters in a story with Superintelligences. And then it might go "well then" and solve the entire plot in two seconds, because /outside of a story/, there's no reason not to.

I don't know. In general, your Minds read like People with Omnipotence, not Superintelligences. By your own explanation, the cognitive ability a Mind can bring to bear on a problem outstrips that of entire civilizations, and you're telling me the best way to go about it was to /walk/ somewhere and /cut some dude's arm off/? That's what "a century of thought by an entire civilization" in equivalent cognitive power came up with?

To be fair, Banks' Minds also have this problem. If mere authors could write a plausible Superintelligence, we wouldn't need MIRI. It's just unusually noticeable here.
