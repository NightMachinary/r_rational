  I assume rethinking core philosophies is not high on the to-do list in this kind of situation.
#+end_quote

It should be somewhere on the to-do list, which means a Mind should get to it within at the very worst the first second after arriving. Cognitive capacity equivalent to civilizations, right?

#+begin_quote
  There's no solid evidence for that either way presented.
#+end_quote

Admittedly not by the time the decision for how to proceed was made. But I remind you that this is a planet where /the Culture books are real/. Once the Mind caught whiff of that, it should have been a matter of milliseconds to acquire a copy. That's pretty strong cause to move "reevaluate core beliefs" up the priority list.

#+begin_quote
  I agree that it is difficult to write an entity with attributes ascribed to the Culture Minds. I don't think Banks does an unreasonable job of it.
#+end_quote

Banks mostly does a reasonable job of it by keeping Minds in the background. When they come to the fore, there's a lot of bluster and not that much to show for it.

#+begin_quote
  Just because characters don't act as you would doesn't mean they are wrong, stupid, or poorly written.
#+end_quote

No, but when Superintelligent characters act in apparently vastly suboptimal ways in a situation that warrants speedy and decisive action, /without explanation/, I tend to doubt their prowess.

Cognitive capacity /equivalent to a civilization/. Sensor capability of a /Culture Vessel/. There should not be a secret left unrevealed on this world, the second the Mind formed the belief that it was in an alternate universe.

And no, cutting somebody's arm off to badger them into answering questions is not "speedy and decisive action". Definitely not to a Mind. "Speedy and decisive action" starts with mindreading and has moved to "make first contact with the Gods" within the first ten seconds of arrival. You know, /creatures that can actually hold a conversation with a Mind on an equal tier/. To quote Banks: "close to Gods, /and on the far side/."

The actions shown in the story so far are cognitively appropriate for a /Knife missile/.

[edit] Sorry if I'm getting irate. I just can't stand Minds - the peak beings of the non-Sublimated Culture universe - being painted as slow brutes.

[edit] It's bad enough when Banks does it.

[edit] Did it. :(
