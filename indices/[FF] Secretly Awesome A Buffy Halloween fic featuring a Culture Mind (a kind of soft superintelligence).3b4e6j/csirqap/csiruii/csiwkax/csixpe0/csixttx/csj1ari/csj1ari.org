  Cultural aversions are things for times when you weren't just copied into a new universe and discovered that you were fictional, imo.

I assume rethinking core philosophies is not high on the to-do list in this kind of situation. If it was, I'm not convinced that the new information provided by this scenario warrants rejecting those existing beliefs. In the books the lack of mindreading is rarely an issue; they can create models of human behavior accurate enough to effectively be precognition.

  None of which, as far as seems, exist in this universe. There's no reason to stick to a precommitment made with societies who no longer exist.

There's no solid evidence for that either way presented. Only weak evidence, that the other Minds couldn't be reached. Even if they don't exist, there could be a good reason behind not wanting to do this. It's not discussed in detail in the books.

  Cultural pressure as exerted by Minds is honestly far worse to me than "mere" mindreading.
#+end_quote

No evidence for this in the novels AFAIK. There are examples of people living longer / alternate life styles.

  I don't know. In general, your Minds read like People with Omnipotence, not Superintelligences. By your own explanation, the cognitive ability a Mind can bring to bear on a problem outstrips that of entire civilizations, and you're telling me the best way to go about it was to walk somewhere and cut some dude's arm off?

I agree that it is difficult to write an entity with attributes ascribed to the Culture Minds. I don't think Banks does an unreasonable job of it.

Just because characters don't act as you would doesn't mean they are wrong, stupid, or poorly written. They have very different information and experiences than you do.

The suspension of disbelief is 'the Mind did this because it decided it was best', just as every character (particularly in rational fiction) decides what to do. Obviously the author isn't going to spend half the chapter describing the model the mind produced and the simulations it ran to select the optimal action.

I can come up with lots of potential actions to take, but I can't claim to select the optimal one with the same rigor that a Mind hypothetically could. The action it took was safe(well, reversable), effective, and easy to execute, I don't think the fact that it was violent matters.
