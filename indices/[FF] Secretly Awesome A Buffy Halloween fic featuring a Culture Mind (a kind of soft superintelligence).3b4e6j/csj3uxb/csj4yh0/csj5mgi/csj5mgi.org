  If I understand this, you're asking why the originals are treating their possible mergers with such nonchalance? First, it's not clear to the characters that there will actually be a merge.

No, I didn't even know they were planning on merging. What's terrifying is having your body being taken over and staying conscious during your entire experience. An in-character Buffy would be fucking pissed at this, no matter how awesome alternate universe Buffy is.
