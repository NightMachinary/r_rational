I think the thing most criticised about /Ra/'s ending isn't its downer nature --- which is fantastic, I agree --- but the way Rachel Ferno enters the plot at the last minute, shuffles everyone to the sidelines, and saves the day^{1} on her lonesome. Which is fixed here.

Actually, this ending is even a /more/ complete defeat. In the old one, Actual Humanity lost the new war and was forced to flee into the unknown, but with nobody dying. In the new one, Rachel --- the person resurrection of whom was the main goal of one of the protagonists --- anticlimactically and irrecoverably dies after doing nothing of consequence, and Actual Humanity is uploaded into Ra, in a full surrender to the Virtuals' ideology.

It's perfect.
