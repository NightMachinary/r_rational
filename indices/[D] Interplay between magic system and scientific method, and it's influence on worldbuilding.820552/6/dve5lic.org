There's no such thing as magic. Magical vs scientific thinking is a different axis from realism vs the supernatural. They're muddied only by the potential need to keep a story culturally relevant via referentiality to past mythologies. But for the sorts of maximalist, strictly alternate-world fantasy favored by this forum, this isn't a concern.
