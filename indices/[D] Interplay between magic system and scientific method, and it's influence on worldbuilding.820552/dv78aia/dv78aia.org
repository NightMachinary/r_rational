How does Worm count as the second one?

Not going too deep into spoiler territory, but the "magic" in Worm became a part of the setting in a modern era, after science and technology was already well established with existing natural laws.

If the "arrival" of its magic happened in, say, prehistoric times, odds are that technology (or even humanity) would exist in modern times.
