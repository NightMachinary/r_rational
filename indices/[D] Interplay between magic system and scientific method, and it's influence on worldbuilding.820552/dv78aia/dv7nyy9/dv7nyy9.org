  How does Worm count as the second one?
#+end_quote

Because magic in it based on really advanced science and therefore susceptible to scientific inquiry, and each parahuman has unique power.

#+begin_quote
  "magic" in Worm became a part of the setting in a modern era
#+end_quote

I am aware of that, but nowhere in my classification I made any assumptions on how and when magic emerged.

#+begin_quote
  If the "arrival" of its magic happened in, say, prehistoric times, odds are that technology (or even humanity) would exist in modern times.
#+end_quote

I don't see how that relevant at all - can you elaborate on what you mean by it?
