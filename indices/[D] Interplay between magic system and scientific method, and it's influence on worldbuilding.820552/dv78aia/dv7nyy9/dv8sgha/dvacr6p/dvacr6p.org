I agree with OP on this one -- the powers are rare and varied enough that technology would still develop. most people would still benefit from technology and wouldn't just rely on people with powers.

the point is whether the magic is /generally exploitable/. if it's restricted to a small population and has inconsistent results it is harder to test and less likely to lead to generalized techniques anyone can apply.
