I'd say that Dresden Files is probably a better example of the second case than Worm, since we don't actually see anyone making headway into understanding how powers do what they do in Worm, and given the way the entities work they probably resist anyone trying to understand them: putting them into the third category for all practical purposes. Anything that operates on some basic rules (eg Harry Potter's say word get magic) is subject to scientific inquiry, and that applies to most magic (otherwise it's just random noise). The meaningful distinction here is whether people can actually make headway in understanding the basic causes behind effects.
