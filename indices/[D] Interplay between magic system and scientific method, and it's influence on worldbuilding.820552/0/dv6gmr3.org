Keep in mind that even in the best case, in our world, humans only managed to even begin to really exploit the rules beyond the basic capabilities our species was equipped with. Basic tools and basic tribal organizations and crude spoken language is all that nature really equipped us for.

It took hundreds of thousands of years before we managed to accrete enough precursor techs for the industrial revolution.

And we still are nowhere close to what the rules imply is clearly possible. The rules imply that ship of thebes style immortality* and matter recompiling is eminently possible, we just can't do either.

(matter recompiling - that is, we have a machine that can start with any old rocks and sort it to elements then produce any exact atomic level schematic we want, including additional instances of that machine)

So a universe with the first type of magic, but magic users just lazily use basic spells or even just spell like abilities is totally possible. (SLA - crude instinctual uses of magic for basic, cantrip level effects. like a character with the bloodline of a D&D sorcerer doing nothing with it but occasionally a bit of burst of flame or some slow regeneration healing ability)
