  Magic system which is not susceptible to scientific inquiry and is separated from the rest of the world which is susceptible to it. Example: Harry Potter

not sure about this example. there is a literal school of magic and research is done into new spells. this clearly would be susceptible to rational study, even if it doesn't align with what we know about physics.

Examples of magic that would not be susceptible to scientificy study would be powers imbued by dealings with Demons/Gods/Spirits, where the results are capricious and arbitrary.
