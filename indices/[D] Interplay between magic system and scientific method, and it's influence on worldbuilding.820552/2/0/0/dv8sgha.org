  Because magic in it based on really advanced science and therefore susceptible to scientific inquiry, and each parahuman has unique power. Except it's not even Magic, it's super-advanced science that is understandable and follows specific laws, putting it in your First category if anything else.

  I am aware of that, but nowhere in my classification I made any assumptions on how and when magic emerged.

You didn't? What was the line "/leading to world developing technology instead of magic/" for?

Also, I have one word to say about it "not developing magic", and that word is /Cauldron/.

  I don't see how that relevant at all - can you elaborate on what you mean by it? I meant to say *wouldn't* not *would*. IE: If the "Magic" in the system arrived in prehistoric times, most technology would never be developed, except that granted by the magic itself (ie: Tinker powers).
