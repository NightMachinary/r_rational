Bit late to the party, but have you read Ra by Sam Hughes?

It tells the story of how magic was discovered in 1970 and has been incorporated into the world. In this case, it sits firmly in the first category, except for the fact that it has only been discovered in 1970, and that there is no evidence of its existence before 1970. The how and why of this are explained in the story and are a major spoiler. [[#s][MAJOR spoiler. If you're ever going to read the story, don't read this]] It seems to fit fairly well into the first category, but when the story advances it becomes more and more arbitrary and might even end in the fourth category.
