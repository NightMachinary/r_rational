Randall Garret's /Lord Darcy/ series treats magic as the science of the world, and we see glimpses of attempts at dealing with magic scientifically... and also a glimpse of (he's a murder victim, so he's already dead when our heroes arrive in the scene) a psychically blind experimenter trying to develop a purely materialistic science.
