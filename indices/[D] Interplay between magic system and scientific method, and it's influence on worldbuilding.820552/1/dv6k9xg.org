The HP fic I'm working on - I'm trying to do this.

I wrote a laws-of-physics for the magic system, and then conjectured on why both magical creatures and mundane creatures exist, and why the universe does not look magical.

Then I went back and tweaked the laws to account for that.

Having applied the derived evolutionary biology conjectures to humans, I then contemplated how this would affect the development of social structures.

This then feeds into rewriting and reconciling history from the first civilizations to about 2000 years ago or so.

Then, I considered how the first attempts to understand magic would have possibly gone, drawing from similar things with regard to IRL science and math.

This then applies itself to the development of cultures as per the last paragraphs.

This then gave me a plausible history-path for the development of anti-non-human-sentient-prejudice, and anti-mundane-born prejudice, as well as how the wizarding economy 'works', why the statute of secrecy happened when it did, why Horcruxes are particularly knee-jerk abominable even to 'Dark' families, etc.
