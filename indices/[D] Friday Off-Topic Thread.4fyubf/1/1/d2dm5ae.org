My main problem with MMOs as they exist today is that they always seem to be so focused on keeping people playing with Skinner box mechanics that they sacrifice everything else. Gameplay tends to be trivial and repetitive, with the leveling process usually requiring no skill whatsoever, immersion is constantly shattered, emotional investment in the narratives tends to be nil... It's not that developers don't try to include those elements, it's just that never seem to be willing to make any design decisions that might distract from the slot-machine-like reward loop, which leads to players feeling a compulsion to play the game that's not always proportional to their real enjoyment of the game.

So, if I could design my dream MMO, I think I'd actually get rid of most forms of non-narrative and non-skill-based progress. There would be no levels, you'd unlock most of your skills in an extended tutorial, loot would tend to be related to the narrative and designed to add to immersion- you might find rare, differently styled cosmetics by exploring a distant nation, but never by grinding mobs. When not cosmetic, loot would tend to be sidegrades that would open up different playstyles, and almost never work as direct upgrades.

The combat would be a real challenge- maybe resembling a more forgiving Dark Souls- but just as important to the gameplay would be creative problem solving- like how in Deus Ex, game systems allow for different, sometimes emergent ways of approaching situations. Also, narrative heavy character interactions, both with NPCs and with other players, would be central to the gameplay. You'd never see huge swarms of anonymous adventurers completing the same quests as you- instead, all player-to-player interactions would start off with scripted sequences, and then be procedurally woven into the narrative.

For example, lets say that you and another player were fighting in the same dungeon. You wouldn't see each other initially, but at some point, you might be interrupted by a sequence where a villain would capture your character. While you were playing through that scripted sequence, the other player might be shown a room with your character trapped in a cage. You'd see a screen saying something like "Three Days Later...", and then you'd both be in the same instance, playing through a sequence where you could each choose dialog options to express your characters' personalities, and then the other player could choose to rescue you. If they did, you'd be playing a co-op rpg, which might work like Divinity: Original Sin in some ways.

So, the game would procedurally create adventuring parties where everyone had real emotional connections to all of the characters. When a party member quit the game, you might see a brief cinematic of their character saying farewell and riding off into the sunset- the idea would be to make player interaction as immersive as possible.

There would also be an extensive matchmaking system- you'd be matched with people from your guild, people you'd individually select, or people who tended to play the game similarly to yourself, depending on your settings. You'd usually be playing with 3-6 other people, though you might see much larger groups of players in specific sequences, like huge battles.

Finally, there would be no end-game content. Instead, there would be a pvp game mode that would be completely separate from the story, and that you could start playing as soon as you installed the game, as well as a new game plus mode once you'd completed the story, that would let you carry over rare cosmetics. The game would also be designed from the ground up for replayability, with lots of different possible play-styles and content that you'd miss on your first few playthroughs.
