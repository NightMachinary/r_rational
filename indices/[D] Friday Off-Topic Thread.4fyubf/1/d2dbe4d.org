Let's say that you had carte blanche to design a fantasy virtual reality MMO using technology that's twenty years down the road. What features would you include or specifically not include?

--------------

I've been watching Log Horizon (which I'm not done with - no spoilers, please) and marveling at how similar to modern-day MMOs their game world is. In part this must have been done in order to reduce the workload, since they can just borrow the grammar and concepts, but at the same time it seems somewhat stale to me. If I were writing my own "trapped in an MMO" story the first thing I would do is create my own MMO rather than borrowing heavily from existing games. There are some definite cons to that, but I really like worldbuilding.
