King's Cross, September 1st (I think that's the day the train leaves), +Lightning scar+, Dumbledore, Resurrection, Little Hangleton, father's bones

Assuming I'm a muggle. I'm sure there are better messages, but this one should let me get the attention of some wizards before their kids go to Hogwarts, and the last six words should ensure Dumbledore makes a visit to Little Hangleton and has a long hard think about the presence of Tom Riddle's father's bones there, as they relate to resurrection rituals.

Assuming the ten words strike me as important, of course. If I just take them as random unimportant stuff, I'm not going to London to stand around at King's Cross for no reason.
