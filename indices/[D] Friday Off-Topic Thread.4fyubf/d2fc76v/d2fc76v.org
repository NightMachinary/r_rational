I know I'm a bit late, but I'm curious what you folks think would make a good online fiction license. I'm thinking something like the following, but I'm no lawyer and I realize licenses are hard.

#+begin_quote
  This work is the exclusive property of ______, unless otherwise stated all rights are reserved.

  Limited right to copy: Anyone possessing a copy of this license and the accompany work has right to make and use as many copies for their own use as they choose; however, no right is given to publish or distribute publically these copies.

  Right to derived works: You have the right to make and distribute any derived work you make under two conditions. The work must be transformative and require creativity to produce. The work must be licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and be free for everyone to use under those conditions. Farther the created work may not be used for any commercial purpose.

  Time Limit: This license shall stay in effect until 50 years from the date when a particular piece of this work was published. At that time those works older than 50 years shall be released into the public domain.

This license is intended to achieve two things. First protect my rights to this work if I ever decide I want to make money from it. Second allow others to use this work and to match my feeling on how copyright should work in the US. I'm not sure it's completely valid, but keep in mind without it you have no right to copy or produce fan fiction and the like. If you see a problem with it or have a suggestion feel free to put them forward also if you want clarification or explicit permission to do something don't hesitate to ask. I should also mention that while this license is meant to be irrevocable any derived work I produce may be licensed under any conditions I might choose.
