/What would you estimate to be your favorite mobile suit or mobile armor from the/ Gundam /universe(s)?/

Ever since I first saw it (probably in a trailer for /[[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Unicorn][Gundam Unicorn]]/, the series in which it appears), I've been absolutely fascinated by [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/NZ-666_Kshatriya][the Kshatriya]] ([[http://i.imgur.com/j02g9Pa.jpg][image]], [[https://youtu.be/uf_teTeFBUY][video]]). An evolution of the similarly-styled mobile armor [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MAN-08_Elmeth][Elmeth]] and mobile suits [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/AMX-004_Qubeley][Qubeley]] and [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/NZ-000_Queen_Mansa][Queen Mansa]], this massive mobile suit stores a total of twenty-four funnels (for those unacquainted with /Gundam,/ self-propelled plasma guns that are controlled telepathically by psychic "Newtype" pilots) in its four binders (wing-like extra appendages, also used to mount thrusters for improved maneuverability and hidden beam-saber-equipped arms for surprise attacks). It has other weapons, but the two attributes of the Kshatriya that make the strongest impression on me are the funnels and the binders.

Whenever I see funnels' ability of "all-range attack" used--by [[https://youtu.be/nN9O3hwTd4k][Rau Le Creuset's Providence Gundam]], or [[https://youtu.be/A44ECDWJjD0][Elpeo Puru's Qubeley Mk. II]], or [[https://youtu.be/uLYntQiC16Q][George de Sand's Gundam Rose]]--I am absolutely /flabbergasted./ It really impresses upon the viewer how superhuman a Newtype must be, in order to control all these three-dimensional weapons /and/ the main body of the mobile suit simultaneously--it reminds me of the Tines in /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77711][A Fire Upon the Deep]]/, or [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Six_Paths_of_Pain][the Six Paths of Pain]] in /Naruto/. Also, the Kshatriya's design is absolutely /breathtaking./ The symmetrically-arranged binders can [[http://i.imgur.com/ehi8HeK.png][fold into a closed position]] in order to protect the body of the mobile suit (and give the visual impression of an imposing cloaked figure--see also [[http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/e/e4/Gf13-001nh2-normal.jpg][Master Gundam]] and [[http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/0/0f/Xxxg-01d2.gif][Gundam Deathscythe Hell]]), or they can be flared outward ([[http://i.imgur.com/SV5msTb.png][front]], [[http://i.imgur.com/jmgchCw.png][rear]]) to give their maneuvering thrusters room to work.

How can an utterly run-of-the-mill Gundam possibly compete with this /undiluted awesomeness??/

I don't bother to subscribe to the RSS feed of [[http://www.theonion.com][The Onion]] because I prefer to receive updates from that site [[https://www.facebook.com/TheOnion][on Facebook]]. Why? The comments are /hilarious!/ In addition to people who /intentionally/ make funny comments, it's very entertaining to see people who complain about offensive stories being chewed out by people who actually have senses of humor. [[https://www.facebook.com/TheOnion/posts/10154219474489497][This story]] was the most recent one to get a lot of complaints ([[https://i.imgur.com/DEm2jjy.png][top comments]], [[https://i.imgur.com/RJL2h2a.png][reaction distribution]], [[http://www.theonion.com/article/kidnapped-boy-found-safe-imagines-kidnapped-boy-2597][article]]).

It's interesting, though, to note the articles that /I myself/ don't find funny. Most often, I get annoyed whenever the site repeatedly [[http://www.theonion.com/video/brutal-anti-cruz-attack-ad-just-30-seconds-candida-52562][goes ludicrously overboard]] in attacking /some/ presidential candidates (even though I dislike them more) while only [[http://www.theonion.com/article/bernie-sanders-asks-anyone-whos-serious-about-brea-52746][poking gentle fun]] at the /other/ presidential candidates (even though I dislike them less). It really feels to me as if [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup][they're trying WAY harder than necessary]]--but maybe my sense of humor is just calcifying as I grow older... :-(

An easy way to seem cooler than you actually are is the production of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_origami][modular origami]]. It's typically quite simple, requiring a minimum of skill to manufacture each module--but the /assembled/ models can be /extremely/ impressive.\\
- [[http://i.imgur.com/xEsO1h2.jpg][Cuboctahedron]] ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron][Wikipedia]]): 24 Post-It Notes = 12 square vertex modules = 1 hour of work\\
- - This is a small example, about as big as my hand. The module is ludicrously simple--it consists of a waterbomb base on top of which a preliminary base has been slotted on and had its tips folded inside.\\
- [[http://i.imgur.com/XS143DU.jpg][Truncated icosahedron]] ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron][Wikipedia]]): 120 Post-It Notes = 60 triangular vertex modules = 5 hours of work\\
- - This is a large example, about as big as my head. Again, the simplicity of the module is ridiculous--it's exactly analogous to the square-vertex module, but folded from squares torn into equilateral triangles (wasting more than half of the material...) rather than from the full squares. This model is actually /easier/ to assemble than a smaller one (such as the cuboctahedron) would be, since the curves are much more gentle--but this also means that there's less friction holding the modules in place, so the model is more fragile as well more constructable.

Special "origami paper" is totally unnecessary, since each individual module typically is too simple for the paper's quality to matter and any small errors in folding a module probably will be unnoticeable after the model has been assembled. Post-It Notes ([[http://www.staples.com/Post-it-Super-Sticky-Notes-3-x-3-Assorted-Marrakesh-and-Rio-de-Janeiro-Collections-15-Pads-Pack-654-15SSMULTI-/product_168224][available in more colors than the standard "Canary Yellow"!]]) are extremely convenient for modular works of moderate size (though the adhesive can be annoying), but printer paper and binder paper [[http://i.imgur.com/7pgIFxw.jpg][also are serviceable]] if you want your models to be outrageously humongous (and easier to assemble). Alternatively, you can tear each piece of printer/binder paper into four Post-It-Note-sized squares rather than into a single giant square.
