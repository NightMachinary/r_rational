My favorite mecha anime will always be Broken Blade or Break Blade. Although it falls into some [[http://i.imgur.com/Ircnc0Kl.png][anime trope traps]] (though that one is actually subverted later), it has a cool magic system and is one of the few mecha anime with a reasonable explanation for why there are mecha.

I might even say Broken Blade is the only mecha anime where I feel like the mecha are adequately justified. In most mecha anime the mecha are like tanks (they have guns and are powered by some kind of power source and contain a pilot). There's no real explanation for why they're better than tanks though-- generally you'd expect treads to outperform legs and for a single axial gun to be easier to aim and use than having unnecessary arms and legs that manipulate external tools.

This gets even more ridiculous with space-based mecha, where it's like, ok, maybe you can think of some contrived reason to have arms, sure. but legs? In space? ._.

In Break Blade, it's 100% reasonable for the mecha to exist. Since mecha are basically just armor worn by Sorcerers, with motion powered by their magic, it makes sense they'd have arms and legs. The Sorcerers can probably more intuitively control their motion and weaponry with their intuitive magic when it's analogous to their biological limbs. Break Blade's Golem Armor probably was developed over time as an extension of physically worn armor, where eventually weapons, them arms and legs, became supplemented with magical strength, until they extended beyond the body of the wearer and were controlled entirely by magic and the wearer was fully enclosed (once quartz displays were developed). Break Blade's mecha actually make sense and you can see how originally they were just suits of armor.

I like the magic system, too. In the Broken Blade world, everyone has magic, which is the ability to, at short distances move certain kinds of quartz crystals using your mind. The amount you can move, how good you are at doing it, and your ability to exert pressure etc all vary from person to person. Their industry is based off of this. Farm tools and vehicles are powered by it. For example, you see a motorcycle where the driver spins a quartz in a disc to power the bike, and machine tools that are controlled by the workers since they have quartz crystals embedded in the joints.

The mechs themselves are well-designed. Krisna's Fafnir-class golems [[http://i.imgur.com/QCFzku4.jpg][(link)]] are about 40 feet tall. The torso is basically an armored shell with magic displays in it, with enough room for the pilot and the controls and that's it. The legs and arms extend out from the torso and are controlled via quarts crystals embedded in flexible ropes-- the mech will only be as fast and strong as the pilot's ability to use magic.

Basically, this represents pretty much what you'd expect for a society with this kind of magic to develop as a powerful weapon. It's a large magic-powered tank, and since it relies on people's intuitive ability to use magic, it uses hands and legs instead of treads. The development from "guy wearing armor" to "powered armor with magic" to this, which is basically a step up from that (no human limbs in the armor limbs, entire pilot is in the torso) seems clear.

The weapons they have are cool, too. They mostly use [[http://i.imgur.com/DO0lLQk.jpg][(link)]] swords, but they have also developed a device called a "pressgun". Basically, it's a gun that operates in a manner similar to an airsoft gun. Using magic to operate a mechanism, a spring is compressed, or an air tank is compressed. This potential energy is then used to push forward a plate or force air into the chamber behind the projectile, which is then launched out of the weapon. A powerful sorcerer can get more range and use more powerful pressguns. Your typical civilian is capable of using a small, hand-held pressgun that can kill someone at close range. The very best sorcerers with the most talent and training, the ones strong enough to pilot golems, can use pressguns that are basically the size of cannons-- and indeed, most golems carry such a pressgun.
