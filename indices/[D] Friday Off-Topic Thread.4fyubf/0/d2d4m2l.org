What are some ways to gamify writing?

I'm practicing writing fiction, and it's gradually coming along, but it's pretty hard for me. I really want to get good at it, but my reddit-addicted brain just seems to refuse to engage in this activity, doesn't enter the flow. Programming, on the other hand, works very well(it has an immediate feedback/gratification loop and clear goals). So I'm trying to figure out what kind of system would help me to experience the same thing in writing.

[[/r/WritingPrompts]] is pretty helpful, and blogging has sort of natural gamification(traffic/upvotes/comments) embedded in it, but these are misleading, my brain is getting dopamine spikes out of seing upvotes or refreshing the stats, not out of the writing process itself.

There's gotta be a way to design a feedback loop that would make writing fiction addictive.

I've been thinking about a website with daily flashfiction challenges(100-1000 words, winners determined by voting, leaderboard of the best writers), but it's not that different from writingprompts. Github-like streaks could help perhaps(a visual representation of how many words you have written every day, and how many days in a row you write). Or maybe a text editor with a progress bar that would show how much words you have written until reaching a daily goal....

Can writing be made interactive, like in a chat? Or more real-time, like improv? Or collaborative?

Or, perhaps, I'm just doing it wrong. Writing HN/reddit comments works, writing personal diary works. Writing non-fiction articles about rationality works(because there's clear goals, and a clear path towards putting together an article), but writing fiction/comedy doesnt, my brain just goes blank and immediately gets bored. I've been trying to solve it for a long time, still can't seem to figure out why I can't.
