Have you tried [[http://writerkata.com/][Writer Kata]]? It's not everything you're looking for, but it's pretty great. Having the challenges split up by size makes it easy to start for the day, since you only have to start with writing individual sentences. As you move forward, you get bigger and bigger challenges, but since you're already warmed up, it's a lot easier than just starting from blank.
