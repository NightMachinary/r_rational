Playing RPGs in real time is a well-established practice too, with a large number of tools you'd compete with, from IRC dice bots to the [[https://roll20.net/][roll20]] behemoth.

Combat is the part where tools are most helpful, because the big-name RPGs like D&D /really weren't/ designed for online play. Anything turn-based slows things down considerably. Anything that has players /interrupting other players/, even just to say "actually I take 1 less damage because I have a Divine Shield power", is even worse. And number-tracking is a pain in the ass.

There is really two directions to go to solve this: RPG-like video games with automatic rules enforcement (Conclave is the most D&D-like, but /all/ multiplayer video games satisfy the D&D need to some extent), and very rules-light RPGs like Dungeon World (but then you have to convince the player base to learn a non-D&D game, which is frustratingly hard even when the game is dead simple).
