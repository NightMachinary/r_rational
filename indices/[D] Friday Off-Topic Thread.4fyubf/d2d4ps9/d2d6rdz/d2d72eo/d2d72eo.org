Maybe. I'm completely new to DnD, so far I haven't found a cool website where it'd be easy to get started and find people to play with.

Also I just like making websites and want to practice my webdev skills, so if it already exists but I can figure out how to make it better - I'd do it anyway.

Do you know any examples of websites where I could play?
