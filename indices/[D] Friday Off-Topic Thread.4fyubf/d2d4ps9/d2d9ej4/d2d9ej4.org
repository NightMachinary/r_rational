I play via roll20, or at least did until our group sort of fell apart over scheduling issues (the bane of most D&D groups). It works /okay/, though I tend to like a little more freeform playing than roll20 is really built for. It doesn't lend itself too well to sandbox games, because it makes the sandbox a little more apparent to the players if you don't have art assets, tokens, or stats.
