Organization-wise, there are a few places with preexisting communities that serve as hubs. Giantitp is the one I use the most. Dungeons and Dragons 5e and 3.5 are the most common, with Mutants and Masterminds and FATE being a bit rarer. For almost everything, DM/GM's are in short supply, making getting into games a hassle.

If you go to the recruitment forum for Giantitp (here: [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?51-Finding-Players-(Recruitment)]]), you'll see a lot of games starting. I'm recruiting for a Mutants and Masterminds game, for example (here: [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?485629-Annecy-Michigan-(M-amp-M)&p=20691252#post20691252]]).

Games fall apart because people vanish without saying anything, and everyone waits a week for them to post. The break in flow makes it harder to get things going again. It happens /a lot/, probably to more than half of all games, and usually really early on; I've been thinking about possible fixes for a while now.

When a player leaves or joins, what happens is pretty much up to the GM. They're responsible for running the whole thing, so they recruit or dispose of the character however they think is best. You see a few threads looking for one or two players to fill out a party that lost people every once in a while.
