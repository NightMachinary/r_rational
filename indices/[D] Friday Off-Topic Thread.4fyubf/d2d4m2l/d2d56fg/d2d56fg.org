I have similar motivation problems when writing fanfiction. My solution is usually to get as much out the door as I can on initial enthusiasm. Then, any time I want to write a new chapter, I binge-read comments in order to build more enthusiasm. It works well as a positive feedback loop, but it can be broken easily by an underwhelming chapter or a busy week.
