Set daily goals for yourself, and if possible, keep a word count visible at all times. I use Scrivener, which has session and project goals you can keep on screen and a little bar that changes from red to green as you fill it. That helps for me, in those moments when I'm feeling like screwing off and doing something else, or when I feel the urge to dive back into some story that I stepped away from months ago (an urge that, if followed, would probably lead to me making lots of incremental progress but never finishing anything).

Writing serials also helps, because then you have a basic unit (the chapter), social pressure (from even a small audience), and clear deadlines (in the form of a weekly schedule). But if you like short stories, maybe that doesn't help as much, and serials come with some serious drawbacks.
