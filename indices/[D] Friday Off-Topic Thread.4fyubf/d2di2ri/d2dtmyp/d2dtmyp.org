My old job involved cleaning up after rabbits and cats (by myself for several hours a day). I ended up listening to the HPMOR podcast 3 times over the course of my employment. I don't how much you will like these but I would recommend:

- Hello Internet (by CGP Grey and Brady Haran)

- The Shadow Over Innsmouth (read by Mike Bennett)

- Mike Bennett Podcasts (more H.P. Lovecraft Stories along with his own novel)

- StarTalk (with Neil Degrasse Tyson)

I have a couple political ones on top of this, but I don't know how I feel about recommending them here. Hope you enjoy at least one of these!
