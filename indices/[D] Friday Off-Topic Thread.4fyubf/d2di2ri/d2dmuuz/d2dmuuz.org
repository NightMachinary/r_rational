If you haven't listened to the original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio dramas, they are quite good. The Primary/Secondary ones were done before the books, while the last three sets were done after, but they're probably all worth listening to. The BBC has made a number of radio adaptations of stuff that tend to be worthwhile in general, e.g. Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's Good Omens.
