I consider it the most promising anime of the season thus far.

Genre-aware neet trapped in a fantasy world. It's not taking the lighthearted approach that [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo][Konsuba]] did, but also not as brutally realistic as [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/31859/Hai_to_Gensou_no_Grimgar][Grimgar]] either.
