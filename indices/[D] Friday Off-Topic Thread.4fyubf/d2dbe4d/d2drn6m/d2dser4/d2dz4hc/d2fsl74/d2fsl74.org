Procedural generation is easy, but getting it to create interesting and balanced results is not.

One of the ways that I've seen games balance things is to just not worry about balance at all, which is possible if there's continual leveling. In Borderlands, it doesn't really matter if the RNG gods give you a great gun, because in another few levels you're going to naturally outgrow it and the OPness is only temporary. But I'm not sure that I've ever seen an MMO where there's no level cap, since the level cap is where the endgame lies. And if there are truly /unique/ items that are overpowered, that's a different matter entirely, because the playing field can't just be naturally leveled by everyone getting their own copy.

I'm curious how difficult it would be to implement auto-balancing of items. The game devs for most games obviously do a bunch of balance changes manually, but with access to loads and loads of data it might be possible to automatically identify which items are overpowered, or overpowered in combination with each other or certain builds.
