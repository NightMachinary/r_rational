I'm not talking about OP-ness in terms of unfairly large numbers, rather unforeseen synergies that would result in absolutely game-breaking combos at any stage of the game.

As examples (sticking to Tales of Maj'Eyal):

- There is a spell that increases the duration of all beneficial timed effects by 4 turns, decreases the duration of detrimental ones by 10 turns, and has a cooldown of 20 turns. There are are many powerful beneficial timed effects, such as immunity to all negative status effects, damage shields (that you can boost in strength for as long as they last), and various other ones. There is an effect on some items that reduces the cooldown of all of your character's spells (usually by 10%). If you got 80% spell cooldown reduction (from multiple items), then you could cast a damage shield, boost its strength, keep increasing the duration, boost its strength again (after the shield boosting spell's cooldown reset), and so on forever, giving you almost the equivalent to arbitrarily high max HP, in addition to all of the other boosts you can maintain.

- There is a Prodigy (a character's high level super-specialization) that makes all incoming damage Arcane damage instead of whatever else it would have been instead (a sword would hit you for Arcane damage, as would a fireball and poison damage etc.). There is also a item effect called damage affinity that makes a certain percentage of a certain type of damage heal you, in addition to dealing damage as usual. If you got your resistance + damage affinity to arcane to be >100% then the only things that could possibly kill you would be healing prevention, resistance penetration, or a single blow that did more than your max HP.

- There is a weapon effect that has a chance to refund a portion of a turn when you hit an enemy. Usually this is about a 40% chance to refund 10% of a turn, which roughly translates to a 4% boost in speed during combat. If you dualwield, that would be a ~8% boost. If you had doubled attack speed on top of that, it would be a ~16% boost. If you found some way of boosting it further, there's nothing limiting you to earning /less/ than one full bonus turn per turn of attacks. If you managed to get it above 100%, then you could kill any enemy in less than zero time (which only works because it's a turn based game, but still.).

- There's a Prodigy that allows you to walk at instant speed at a cost of 10 stamina per tile, and a skill that recovers stamina for every tile that you walk. Usually this is limited to ~3 stamina per tile walked, but combining half a dozen skill-boosting items could bring it above 10 and let you walk anywhere instantly and recover stamina as quickly as you want.
