I'm working on [[http://github.com/traverseda/pycraft][an engine]] that I hope will someday include MMO features.

On an unrelated note, here's some of the stuff I'd like to see in an MMO

Actual construction of things like cities and fortresses. Structures should be mostly player owned and player created.

One of the things I like is an intermeshed player economy. Make it so that trading and trade caravans are an actual worthwhile thing.

Along with that, make travel difficult. I've got ideas for a vaguely steven-universe crystal-gem system, where you can "project" your friends into your local territory, but they can't share loot or equipment. Physically moving from a server in london to one in japan would take weeks of travel time, it's also dangerous.

There's a huge opportunity for whichever guild sets up reliable shipping.

I'd also like there to be different levels of death. You die in combat, you poof. You turn into an object, and someone has to carry you back. Or maybe they just leave you, and you need to run the hell out. Or maybe you hire a guild to come retrieve you.

But once someone is poofed, you can invest resources to permanently destroy that character. Destroy all their levels, maybe steel some of their equipment. The process takes a while, so there would be plenty of time for a rescue attempt.

It's not the kind of equipment I'd expect an individual to have, but a large guild might be able to do it. During war, a large guild might invest the money to do it on an industrial scale.

Eve-online style training sounds reasonable as well. As long as you log in once per day, you get a skill point to put into whatever skill you want.
