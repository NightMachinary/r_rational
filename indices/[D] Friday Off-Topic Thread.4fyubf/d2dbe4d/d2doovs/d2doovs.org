Log Horizon depict modern MMO because author was avid Everquest player.

Some thing that I want to see in perfect MMO.

Big mysteries and myths. Quests that don't have obvious solutions and whole community tries to figure them out. Obvious problem is that sort of things have expiration date. Secret World had quest that relied on players looking for real world informations. It's too bad that now most google searches lead to direct answer.

Not focusing exclusively on combat. Common failing of MMOs is that you can be anyone you want as long as you want to be profesional killer. Fallen London is step in right direction. It uses the same set of mechanics for everything: combat, seduction, investigation, stealing, dreaming, book wring and countless other thing.

Probably with rise of VR, games that focus solely on exploration and virtual sightseeing would gain popularity.
