And the fun stuff goes up here!

Ooh ooh, what're you presenting!? What conference? Have you been working in a lab? Which field? I remember you're a double-major, so which one? Have you gotten into grad-school yet without telling us? Are you a professor yet without telling us? Have you /solved everything forever/ without telling us?

You should tell us.

  Has anyone here ever have to present a research paper at a conference? What was it like?

I mostly re-used the slides from when I presented the same material as part of my MSc thesis defense, but changed over to less casual language. It also turned out that the accepted way of avoiding double-negatives (like, "falsified the null hypothesis of no relationship") for statistical results is to say the statistically significant result /suggests/ something ("significantly suggests a relationship").

I rehearsed my presentation two or three times before actually giving it, once in front of my girlfriend (more of an empirical science type than me), and whenever and wherever it was awkward, I edited it. By the last time I rehearsed it, I didn't feel like it was perfect (it's never /perfect/), but I did feel like I wasn't sure what I could or should change without making it worse or completely violating an important constraint about length or formality.

The day of, I wore a button-down shirt and a corduroy suit-jacket (trying for the [[http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?n=1446][smart academic]] look) over my neatest jeans. And I was nervous as hell /all day/ until my presentation, my heart racing and my hands even clamming up slightly. I've talked to a few other people who're just /always/ like that about public speaking, even when everyone tells us we're perfectly good at it, so don't be too disheartened if you're nervous too.

And then it went /just fine/, and nobody even asked asshole questions during Q&A. Somehow, my advisor even ended up liking the slides I sent him and the text of the paper we'd sent in.
