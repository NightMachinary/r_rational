I hate to break your heart, but it wasn't a conference. I'm still an undergrad who is in his junior year.

I dropped my computer science major, because I had very little enjoyment of higher level computer science classes and I was in danger of ruining my GPA through too many Cs from CS courses. So I dropped from a major to a minor and finally got to take higher level Cognitive Science classes (my other major) and been having fun with the field ever since. Ironically, I've learned so much more about how to code statistical models, data analysis, shell scripting, and /actually useful/ coding techniques from BCS classes than I ever did for CS classes.

I think it's because BCS requires actually using what you learn while CS is all about the theory and learning "clever" techniques over what will actually solve the stinking problem! At least that's my experience for my university.

At least I've done two Independent Study Projects by now, worked in a lab for the second summer now, and I am required to write 3 scientific research style papers by the end of this semester!! At least I have professors who are willing to proof-read them and show me how to do better.

  What did I present?

It was an event where every undergrad who is doing Independent Study research presents their results through a poster. I think it's called the Poster Session of the Undergrad Research Expo?

Anyway I presented about how confidence levels can be affected by prior experience at a task or is it more of an accurate reflection of your own estimate of your skill at the task? It was a simple visual task where you see a Gabor Patch (diagonal lines) on the screen for 100 ms, answer if it was slanted left or right, and then you have the option to bet or not bet 5 cents on your answer. After the option to bet, you get to know if you answered correctly. The decision to bet or not bet allows me to measure your confidence levels.

The task was harder or easier depending on how much noise obscured the stimulus.

If subjects chose to not bet after getting the previous trial right, then that would be indication that people's confidence levels are affected by past performance. However this is wrong! Subjects bet at the same frequency regardless of whether or not they got the previous trial correct.

If subjects are accurately self-evaluating their own level of skill, then they should be more accurate for trials they chose to bet on versus trials they chose to not bet on. This part turned out to be correctly predicted.

In conclusion, subjects derive their confidence mostly from self-estimates of current ability and almost not at all from prior experiences with the task which is fairly counter-intuitive. I concluded that it may be due to how low-level the task was and since the subjects saw the image flashing by so quickly, they may be coming up with an answer and their estimate of how likely their answer is to be true before they can mentally compare to previous trials

Note that this actually built on prior research I did last semester to show that confidence represents the objective certainty of an image which means that humans are very good at estimating the probabilities that a given Gabor patch could be slanted left or right. Humans have a good sense for statistical probabilities.

If you want to know more, I can send a copy of the poster. It looked amazing and very professional quality (so happy my friend was willing to help with the graphics!).
