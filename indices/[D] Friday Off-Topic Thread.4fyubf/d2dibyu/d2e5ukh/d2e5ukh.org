Talking about math mainly, and a little about CS.

Academic conference? Personally, I hate it, and think it is an unfortunately unavoidable ritual and a waste of time (exception: anything organized by the mfo).

Typically, people only get funding for travel if they give a talk. This means that there are a lot of short talks scheduled, possibly in multiple tracks, with very short breaks in between. Hence, nobody has time to really explain something, and nobody has time to really listen (imho talks shorter than 50 minutes are worthless, and more than 5 talks a day are impossible to digest).

Industry conferences are different in my experience: People get funding for travel just to listen to talks, and hence the speakers get sufficiently long time-slots to actually do something interesting.

Academic colloquia also are awesome, but nobody except for the 3-5 invited speakers gets travel funding.

So, I'd advise you to think about how much time you have, how much sleep your audience got, and what you want to accomplish. Assuming typical academic standards, this probably means that you want to (a) make a good impression and want (b) people to read your paper, and can give up trying to (c) teach people about your cool ideas.

This may sound too cynical, but making people feel that they understand something is very different from making them actually understand; choose wisely what you aim for.
