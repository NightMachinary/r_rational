The imposter syndrome thing has never gone away for me. However, as far as anxiety goes - presenting stuff to people without panicking is a skill you can learn. If you think you are bad at it, and want to learn it because you think it's the sort of thing you'll have to do a lot of, then you can. You will eventually learn it just by doing it a ton in front of people until you get better at it, but that sort of approach might fails because you don't get useful feedback, you have trouble maintaining skills with intermittent practice, etc.

If you want to take action to get better at and more comfortable with public speaking (reduce anxiety, increase skill) my recommendation is to look for an active, good [[http://www.toastmasters.org/][Toastmasters]] group local to you that is open to the public. Go as a guest to various groups and see if it's something you're interested in - try to find a group that matches what you want in terms of formality, age of members, time and place, etc. I am in a university club that meets weekly and the practice of presenting and speaking in Toastmasters made a significant difference at my oral defence.
