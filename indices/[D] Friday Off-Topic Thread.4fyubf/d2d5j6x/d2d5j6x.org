Don't actually take this as a recommendation, but it has a few elements that I think there were a few people here that like(portal fantasy, [[#s][s]]), so it might be worth it for you to check [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu][re:zero kara]] , I will note that ep 1(a and b) and 2 felt kind of slow, because they were dealing with all the basic set up already seen tens of times before, so I recommend reaching ep3 if you want to get an idea for the series past the boilerplate.
