How do people organize these games, do you just find people on the forum and ask who wants to participate?

Do games fall apart just because people forget about them and get bored/busy? What happens when a player leaves? Can new people join mid-campaign?

How many people can be in a campaign? What do you do if like 20 people want to play?
