  How do people organize these games?
#+end_quote

There are a number of specialized forums. And it's not uncommon as a subforum / special thread in large communities. (I imagine there are a ton of dedicated subreddits.) You can also ask your friends, of course.

  Do games fall apart just because people forget about them and get bored/busy?
#+end_quote

Yup. It's a big commitment, life happens. Plus it can be hard to know in advance whether you'll enjoy the campaign or not. (There's a large variance in the quality of online campaigns, with a very very low floor.) When playing with strangers, often people just vanish rather than discussing the issue.

  What happens when a player leaves? Can new people join mid-campaign?
#+end_quote

The game keeps going as long as the GM and remaining players are willing to keep it going. Mid-campaign recruitment happens, though rarely IME; it's intimidating for newbies and gets drowned in a sea of "I have this AWESOME new campaign idea!!!!". It's worked for me though.

  How many people can be in a campaign?
#+end_quote

However many the GM thinks they can handle. Some games, and some platforms, make large groups more doable than others.

  What do you do if like 20 people want to play?
#+end_quote

The GM handles the situation however they like. SomethingAwful's recruitment threads have people post the character they would like to play and try to woo the GMs with fascinating background stories. Others might just do first come first served.
