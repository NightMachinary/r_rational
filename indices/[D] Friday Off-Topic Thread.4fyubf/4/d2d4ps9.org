Have you played DnD online?

The way I understand it it's usually played via forum or something like [[https://anonkun.com/][anonkun]], an author is telling a story, and many people voting on character's actions.

What's your experience with that kind of system? How do you think it can be improved?

I have been thinking about making a website where people could play DnD via chat. Maybe people could gather in a chat room, one GM, and 3-5 players, and have short campaigns.

Does it make sense? Do you think it will work? Do you have some ideas/advice on desining that kind of game?
