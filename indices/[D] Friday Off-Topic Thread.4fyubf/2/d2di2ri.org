I started a new job on Monday. I sort through tax returns and make sure documents are whole/in the right order/exactly A4 sized, etc. It is tremendously boring.

/However/. Because it is /easy/ boring, very monotonous work, we are allowed to listen to podcasts/audiobooks/youtube/whatever.

This first week I've mostly listened to Let's Plays, Stephen King's It and HPMOR. I was hoping [[/r/rational]] might have some recommendations - I have maybe 35 hours a week where I can listen to anything I want but can't really look at a screen much. I've thought about maybe picking up an audio language course, and TTC/the Great Courses are nearly the best thing ever, but I would like some variety. Because I'll probably stay at this job for a while I'll have lots of time to check out recommendations, so even if it's not something that belongs in [[/r/rational]], the more suggestions the better! My general interests are sciencey stuff, politics, history, philosophy, Fantasy, writing, general entertainment... But feel free to mention stuff outside these areas. Learning programming would have been great, but I don't think that would work, since I can't spare a hand to type or look at the screen much.
