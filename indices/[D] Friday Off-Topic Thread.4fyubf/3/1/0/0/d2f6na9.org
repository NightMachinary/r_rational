Got a board game shop nearby? Go in and ask for cooperative games. (/Pandemic/ is good, but there are heaps). Slightly to very expensive, depending on what you get!

You can print your own /Cards Against Humanity/ set. I suggest just using one of the themed expansions, which are generally pretty funny. The base game is un-funly filthy, which is a shame because the gameplay concept is fun. (free)

Mafia/Werewolf/Avalon/Resistance is a family of fun no-equipment-required games about perceptiveness, cooperation, and betrayal. Play with three or more people and the most complex rules you can all handle (simpler than you think). End the session with a totally honest declaration from each player about the strategies they think they got away with. (free)

Is there a particular number of people, person, or group you're thinking of?
