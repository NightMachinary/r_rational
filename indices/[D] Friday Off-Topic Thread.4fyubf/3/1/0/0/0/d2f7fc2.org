Pandemic is a really good idea, thanks! I've been thinking about printing out a new CAH set since the base pack is really heavily American and there was an unfortunate incident with some of my cards :/

We've got Werewolf already but I'll definitely check out the other games in that bloc you've got there. Thanks for your help. :)

Any number from 3 or 4 upwards is fine, the one-on-one games can get a little overcompetitive sometimes, you know?
