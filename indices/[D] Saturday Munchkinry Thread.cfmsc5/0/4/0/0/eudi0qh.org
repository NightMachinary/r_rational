I don't know of every speck of dirt or stone on my body, but I'm sure there's more than 5 of them of any variety if we talking about the microscopic/atomic scale.

Does the body as a whole count as one source or is each speck on the body one source? I would've thought any contiguous piece counts as one source, so the area under each fingernail would count as separate sources if not multiple sources.

Though if we're using the word "source" it implies the resource is extractable so it would only detect the smallest possible unit of resource manipulable by Earth magic.

I'm guessing Earth magic can't pull the Iron out of someone's blood, so that wouldn't count as a source of iron for Earth magic.
