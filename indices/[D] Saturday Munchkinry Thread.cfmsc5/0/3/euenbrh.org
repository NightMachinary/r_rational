If nothing else, it would become trivially easy to find a needle in a haystack, thereby rendering an age-old proverb nonsensical. EDIT: Wait, you said "natural." What makes something "natural" in this context? Does any conscious modification render a mineral non-natural, or only certain industrial processes? For example, if a rock was knapped off a flint core five thousand years ago, does it remain un-natural?
