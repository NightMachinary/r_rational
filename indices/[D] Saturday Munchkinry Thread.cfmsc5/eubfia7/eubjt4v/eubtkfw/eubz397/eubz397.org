Ah, I misunderstood. I thought the threat came from the gravitational force applied by the marble onto the mooks. If the marbles don't have that many gravitons infused, then they should only accelerate downwards with great force, but are otherwise mundane in terms of horizontal force since the super is just throwing them with his baseline human strength.

In that case, since vertical force is the issue, while horizontal force is negligible, I suggest regrouping for another attempt, and this time bringing along a bunch of powerful fans/wind ability users to blow around the super and his marbles horizontally. The fact that the super's ability can only apply vertical forces means that he can't overcome strong horizontal winds, not unless he grabs onto something. But if he's grabbing onto something to avoid being blown around by the wind, that means he isn't dodging, so your mooks can shoot him with tranquilizers.
