Prepare a weighted net as a backup, especially from on high, with the idea being that it will grant a few seconds of distractions so that a mook can tase him, but that's in case things go sour. Then, stage a hostage situation to keep him contained and present with several mooks (3 or so) taking several hostages each cooperatively. Two such hostages are plants, preferably a man and a woman.

The hostage-takers are demanding the hero cuff his own arms and legs and allow a blindfold to be placed over his eyes. If this works, great, capture successful.

Set up a scenario where the man "plays the hero" and sees a chance to tackle a mook and steal his weapon, "wildly" shoot another in the foot, and "try to" shoot the third, but the third shoots him, preferably in the arm or shoulder. The third mook should have to be facing away from the hero for this, giving him a chance to take the third one out himself.

Have the woman scream "No! ____" where the man's name is a name of one of his family/close friends, preferably a father, son, or lover, but brother or close friend works. Even a "gender neutral" equivalent can work (Aaron/Erin, Jesse, Jamie, etc.). The name should be common enough to not be surprising. The woman rushes to the other plant's side and tries to tend to his wounds.

The plan can be tweaked based on his psyche profile, but should allow a conversation where the man (or woman possibly) plays it safe but tries to get a way to contact or a future meeting. If nothing is going to plan, the weighted net drops.

If things aren't looking up for that, the woman plant (and maybe man) assist hero on escaping the net, then attempt to extract him with a disguise in a vehicle while a few managers and a few more mooks attempt to "catch" them. This should pretty much guarantee further conversations if they're good actors. If they're bad actors and he isn't buying their cover, we skip straight to the net and tasers. Possibly limb shots as well.

At no point should he see my actual face.
