You're going up against a superpowered individual with the gravity-absorption powers described [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bq4y0i/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eo2v0kq/][in this thread]], but you don't know the full extent of their powers. You do know they can fly for short periods of time, and apparently transfer momentum or intertia somehow so that small objects hit as if they were larger. The super has not yet publicly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debutante_ball][debuted]], and your mission is to recruit or capture them before they do.

This confrontation happens in a convention center with a large central atrium, as described [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c2i7a7/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/erkmblh/][in this thread]].

Your powers:

- You know the super's unmasked identity.
- You have access to dozens of Mooks, who are competent "operators", which means that they're former-military or former-police or former-secret-service people with martial arts and firearms training. They're generally equipped with tasers, cellphones, business suits, a lot of muscle mass, and sunglasses. Some may have stun sticks or gunpowder pistols. Some may have that unusual quality of character called "initiative", which causes them to be creative in problem-solving.
- You have hacked the app servers of the convention that's currently going on at the convention center: the app's panic button and messaging functions don't work.
- You do not have an IMSI catcher or Stingray-style cell tower spoofing device. If the super has or acquires a phone, they can call the police.
- You have the bland cooperation of the convention center staff: you have keys to lock and unlock most doors, the walkie-talkie-equipped staff have been told to cooperate with you. Non-walkie-talkie-equipped staff will seek -equipped staff before following orders from you or your Mooks.
- You have the backing of your superiors, who you're pretty sure are some shadowy government agency. Nevertheless, they have asked you to be discreet.
- You have your backer's analysis of the super and their script for how you were supposed to approach the super's unmasked identity. The script did not work; you squicked and frightened your target and your target super is now bouncing around the atrium.

The super has non-lethally disabled several of your Mooks, and acquired their weapons. The super appears to have used one of your disabled Mook's cellphone to call for emergency medical treatment for one of the Mooks that the super disabled.

The convention center staff are becoming worried about the goings-on.

The convention staff haven't noticed that their app is down yet, but the con-goers have definitely noticed the super bouncing around the atrium, and are likely to start noticing your Mooks and you.

The goals of this operation:

- Preserve your operational capacity for future missions. Avoid drawing media attention to your mission, and avoid contact with the conventional police.
- Recruit the super, or if recruitment is not possible, capture the super. If capture is not possible, learn as much as possible about the super for future recruitment or capture efforts.

Do you decide to abort the capture mission? Do you proceed but change tactics?
