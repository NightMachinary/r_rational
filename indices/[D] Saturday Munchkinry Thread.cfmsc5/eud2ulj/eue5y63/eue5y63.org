Send one world's public patent information to the other world to submit them first and sell the patents. Use this to gather enough money for 3 more devices.

Build another device, but don't turn it on yet. Go to a casino or horse race. Turn on the device and bet on different halves in each branch, doubling your money in one and losing it all in the other.

Repeat the previous paragraph a few times, producing a line of worlds the last of which has you having ridiculous amounts of money. Found a research organization, perhaps carefully branching a few times, and go for technological victory.
