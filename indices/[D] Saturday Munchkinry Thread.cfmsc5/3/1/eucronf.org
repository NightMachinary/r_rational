#+begin_quote
  3) The total number of walkie-talkies never increases: whenever a parallel world branches, only one of the branches will have the walkie-talkie, the walkie-talkie becomes a mundane primitive lump of metal in all other branches.
#+end_quote

I immediately discard my lump of metal, and waste no further time hoping it has magical properties. The chances of it remaining magical are essentially zero.

But if actually the walkie-talkies were duplicating during branching, just like me, then I'd contemplate this:

1) Divide the world into square km sections by latitude and longitude.

2) Use a quantum random number generator to pick one.

3) Using all my money, loans, cajoling, etc: acquire the land in question and the mineral rights for it. If I can't reasonably acquire it within a year, skip this step.

4)a: Spend the rest of two years prospecting my new claim and trying to turn it into value.

4)b: Wait if it is apparent my claim is useless.

5)a: If I have profited more than 100 million USD by the end of two years, turn my talkie into a sender and put a device near it playing the coordinates I received and a three-word description of the value I found there.

5)b: If I haven't profited that much, turn my talkie into a receiver. Keep the device on my person until I hear the message of the 'winning' coordinates. Once I do, write it down and smash my talkie.

6): Continue to wait.

If the message is 30 seconds long, I'm awake 18 hours a day, and I only listen twice to write it down, I expect to reach a million alternate selves within three years. The surface area of the Earth is 500 million square kilometers. If there are 500 or more square kilometers on it that are worth more than 100 million and within my reach, all alternate selves will have 100 million USD to play with by the end of five years.

I would do more thorough math if I actually found myself in this situation: it might be better to have senders smash their talkies as well, with longevity proportional to value. It might be better to use 10 square kilometer chunks, or to find a way to exclude the ocean.
