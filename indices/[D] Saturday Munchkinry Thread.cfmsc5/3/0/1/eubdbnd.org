That is one of the issues you have to overcome.

You can assume some kind of super rationality is going on, in the sense that parallel world versions of you are likely to make decisions similar to your own. So for example, if you decided to roll a die and press Send if you get a 1, and press Receive if you get a 2 or 3, you could reasonably expect to see ~1/3 of parallel worlds being Receivers and ~1/6 being Senders.

The Senders could then start talking about all of the knowledge his world knows, especially about technology, so that the Receivers can reap large benefits from such information by recreating those technologies in his own parallel. (Masterpieces of music and literature can also be sent and recreated.)

The problem here is that with that many Receivers, the distance between every Sender world and the Receiver world would probably be very small, so most of the knowledge sent will already be known by the Receiver. You could reduce the odds of being Senders and Receivers much much more to increase the distance, but then that would mean most of the parallel world yous would get no benefit.

So I was really looking to see if anyone had any clever ideas about how to do better.
