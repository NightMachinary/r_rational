This is part 4 of the mini battle royale quest I've been running. It's +very+somewhat low effort, there's no voting, and it's intended to be simple fun.

--------------

Felicity's first wish gave her a metal dome for cover, and her second gave her a trapped fortress, not huge in scale, but certainly dwarfing the dome from before. She was sitting on top of the dome, inside the fortress, watching a video feed of an outside camera pointed at the metal box that encased her opponent. Presumably.

There was audio---believe it or not, excellent quality audio---but there wasn't much to hear. The box was thick, maybe a third of a metre of solid metal, so it was a shock to hear sound come through in volume at all at first, but it had died down relatively quickly. Felicity didn't know much about hallucinogens, but whatever it had done with the victim, they hadn't stuck to whatever they were doing before.

Then the paper plane hit the back of her head, and she jumped so fast she tumbled to the ground.

--------------

The task laid out was fivefold. Get a spear, get a flamethrower, wait for her opponent to run out of oxygen, failing that try to lead her into the fortress' traps, and failing that do a bit of stabby stabby.

Getting the weapons was easy; Felicity had an intuitive grasp of the fortress and how to move around and modify it safely. The wish seemed very generous on that front, fulfilling not just the spirit of the wish, but fleshing it out and rounding the corners. The fortress was a bit bigger than a large house, squashed and spread out over a larger area, and with a much, much sturdier build. Waiting for the air to run out, well, that would take a while, but the fortress had drinks^{water} and snacks^{rations}, so she sat by the TV^{external video feed}, cranked the volume up, and after waiting many uneventful hours, finally caved in and took a nap.

Felicity was up and heading for combat in seconds, before regaining her composure and back checking the video feed. She wanted to win, and she wanted it now, but even so she didn't want to end up dead. Oxygen deprivation wasn't going to cut it, but the rest of the plan could be handled with restraint. She moved out of the fortress, weapons in hand, and looked for an entrance to the chamber of hallucinations.

The box was formed of four metal walls that had driven themselves up from the ground, somehow joining at airtight angles. They were sloped inwards slightly, and the ceiling seemed to be literally just a thick, metal plate that had fallen on top of it. Moving around the side revealed a circular vault door, the kind that sits flush with the sides and has a protruding, circular handle to open it. A moment later the door was unlocked, still with no noise inside the chamber, and Felicity opened it cautiously, standing behind the bulk of the door with the flamethrower in one hand and backing away from wherever she thought the hallucinogens might spread to.

Then the lights in the room turned on, and her opponent was seen standing at the opposite wall, hands by her side, gazing into open space. Felicity shouted at her to grab her attention, but there was no response; her opponent just stood there, gazing, from inside the room. She tried a bunch more times, but at best got muted, distant responses. Felicity was worried the hallucinogens had spread to her, so she made a choice, backing off to hyperventilate to get oxygen pumped into her lungs, and then charging into the room, spear raised.

The spear hit her opponent and bent, barely denting the skin. Felicity sprained both her wrists in the process, perhaps because of the effects of =[[ Sudden Death ]]=, but she grimaced through, raised her flamethrower, and let it fire.

*Arlene Lewis defeated!*

The next wish for you to munchkin is again ‘ten times the mundane, ten times the magic... well, give or take'. You should know the drill by now.

Since this is [[/r/rational]], I have some comments concerning rational optimization. To be frank, before researching hallucinogens and discovering just how potent some are, I expected Felicity to end up dead. These are some comments on the suggestions given for the chapter.

1. People don't risk running out of oxygen; they get carbon dioxide poisoning first. A small room would still take multiple days for this to happen, and Arlene was not in a small room, so we're talking something like a week of waiting, at which point dehydration is a bigger issue. This was also not going to waste her stamina, since “her strength was purely magical in nature, and it took no special effort to engage.”

2. Arlene “stabbed a grip into the smooth steel” with her hand, and took no injury from it. She is probably not going to die if a normal human runs up to her and pokes her with a spear.

3. Leading Arlene into the fortress would not have been particularly safe, because if she was aware enough to respond productively, you would have been leading around someone vastly faster than you, who could have killed you with any stray movement.

4. Your fortress contained traps said to be using poisons, and even if it didn't I had allowed for ‘fairly free reign'. Throwing a canister of poison into Arlene's room would have been comparatively very safe and very effective. (I'm not saying this is the most optimal solution.)

In the end I'm glad Felicity survived, even if it was a bit anticlimactic.
