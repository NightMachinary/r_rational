People who dont qualify become ghosts. Ghosts are summarily enslaved and used to power golems. Screwing up your chances with all the gods is generally considered the act of a complete lunatic. A couple of the gods /do/ find doing that incompatible with their ethics, so being the mage responsible means you give up 3 heavens, but... it is /very/ profitable.
