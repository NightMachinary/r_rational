  And none of the True Faiths account suicide in and of itself a sin.

Implicitly, this means that these religions do not need to maximize their followers and the afterlife is something like a social club situation where the various faiths in the afterlife are just trying to make good matches and meet interesting people.

To explain, if these heavens and their respective deities were trying to maximize their number of followers, then more than likely, the tenets of those religions would quickly change to prohibit suicide. Suicide can easily become a mass phenomenon even when we don't have any proof that literal heaven awaits you in the afterlife. But provide proof of heaven and circumstances that would make people fear they'll lose their chance at getting there and you'd sometimes see entire countries disappear in a day.

For example, suppose you have a country with a religion which prohibits its followers from killing, but allows suicide. If some other powerful country declares war on them, they can't fight back without losing their chance at their preferred heaven. Their best option is to all just commit suicide together, as an entire country. After a couple of incidents like that under various circumstances, you'd probably see religions starting to prohibit suicide. However, since none of your religions prohibit suicide, it would suggest that your religions really don't care much about how many followers they have.

Implicitly, this would also suggest that your deities are not powered by worshipers, and they don't really need worshipers to advance their plans or accomplish anything of importance. The worshipers are ultimately doing their own thing independently, and the deities merely tolerate it rather than encouraging it. At a guess, I would suspect that your deities are probably similar to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNXohNU3tWo][Dr. Manhattan]], in how they have [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxM79UNvKqc][difficulty connecting with humans]] because of their perception of space and time, and their rather "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK9RvNVGcWY][different]]" views of life. Similar to Dr. Manhattan, they would likely be powerful enough that the endeavors of man are generally too feeble to be worthy of their interest or concern.

  What other inevitable consequences do you see?

People start being good all the time (assuming the religions with the good heavens require good behavior). There won't be much conflict in the world, because even people with bad intentions who have any self-control whatsoever are still going to act and behave like good people. Bad behavior and conflict would typically be associated almost exclusively with drugs/alcohol, demon possession, or neuropsychiatric disabilities like untreated schizophrenia, delirium, dementia, etc. In general, it would probably be seen as a sign of medical or magical illness which requires treatment. However, this could be different for religions which offer "forgiveness", in which case, you might still see patterns of bad behavior followed by at least half-hearted repentance among people who are not mentally ill, but just genuine assholes who like doing that kind of shit.

Human knowledge along with scientific and cultural advancement would probably be significantly improved compared to our current situation. For example, Thomas Martin Einstein is Albert Einstein's great great grandson, so we would conceivably be able to contact Albert Einstein through him to see if he's developed any new testable hypotheses that would further our knowledge of the mathematics governing the fundamental physics of the universe, and we could update him with the results of the tests to keep him interested and willing to keep giving us new ideas. Similarly, MLK's granddaughter, Yolanda Renee King, is still around could allow us to get her grandfathers' thoughts on the current state of affairs in US culture and politics.
