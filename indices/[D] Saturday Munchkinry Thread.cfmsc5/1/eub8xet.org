The Problem of Heaven:

Secondary Fantasy realm. There are a number of known True Faiths. These each have well known criteria for accepting the souls of the departed into their respective afterlives. If you meet more than one set of criteria, you get to bounce around between the various afterlives you qualify for.

None of them are perfect utopias - because none of them exercise tyrannical control over the souls residing there, and the locals are, after all, largely human. But they generally are very nice places.

This is known because there are magics for contacting the afterlife. Well, "For contacting people in the afterlife who wish to speak with you". They are not obligated to answer, and getting hold of someone without living relatives tends to get difficult. The oldest souls stilling willing to talk to living people tend to be subject matter experts, and you better have something interesting to say, or they will hang up and go flying around the Tree of Yrud instead of wasting time talking to you.

And none of the True Faiths account suicide in and of itself a sin.

Okay, I am basically assuming that this counteracts malthusian forces pretty darn hard - Whenever things in the mortal realm gets overly miserable, you get mass suicides.

What other inevitable consequences do you see?
