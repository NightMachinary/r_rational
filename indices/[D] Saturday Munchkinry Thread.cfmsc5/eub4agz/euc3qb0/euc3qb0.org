The problem lies in the fact that /I/ received this opportunity. I receive no benefit unless my walkie-talkie is on Receive, and I'm not altruistic enough to put it on Send just for the sake of potentially helping out a possibly-nonexistent alternate dimension that I will never be able to interact with. I know myself well enough to know that I almost certainly wouldn't select Send in any alternate world, unless events had diverged in such a way that my psychology was significantly different. It's sort of an interdimensional tragedy of the commons.

There's the further problem that anyone on Send wouldn't necessarily know the state of technology on the opposite side. Let's say that somehow one of the alternate versions of me hits Send and is in a sci-fi utopia. He realizes that the other world would likely appreciate the knowledge of how to construct the FTL drives they have in that timeline, but where to begin? Alternate-me can inform whoever's on the other side that the breakthrough allowing FTL travel came when they figured out they needed to shield the warp drive with neutron star material, but that's only useful if the Receiver he's connected to is just slightly behind in technology. You could learn and explain the technology progression from early history onward, but I would run into the problem that I'm neither patient nor intelligent enough to learn and subsequently teach such a breadth of knowledge.

Perhaps I'm just not thinking this through, but it seems like something which I wouldn't be able to utilize at all.
