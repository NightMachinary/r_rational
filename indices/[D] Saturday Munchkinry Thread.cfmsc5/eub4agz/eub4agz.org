Suddenly, in every parallel world where you exist, a magical walkie-talkie appears along with an instruction manual.

This walkie-talkie lets you communicate with the yous from other parallel worlds according to the following rules:

1) Every walkie-talkie has two buttons, labeled "Send" and "Receive". Pressing either button will permanently lock the walkie-talkie into that choice.

2) At every point in time where the number of Senders is less than the number of Receivers, an optimal matching of every Sender to a unique Receiver is created that minimizes the total squared distance between each Sender-Receiver pair, and each matched Receiver plays the sounds in the vicinity of the matching Sender.

3) The total number of walkie-talkies never increases: whenever a parallel world branches, only one of the branches will have the walkie-talkie, the walkie-talkie becomes a mundane primitive lump of metal in all other branches.

4) The sounds emitted by a walkie-talkie in Receive mode can only be heard by you.

5) Any attempt to analyze the technologies/magics involved in the creation of the walkie-talkies will cause the walkie-talkies under analysis to revert into mundane primitive lumps of metal.

So given these magical walkie-talkies, how would you decide when and whether to press the "Send" or "Receive" buttons? (And when, if ever, to destroy the walkie-talkie to change the optimal matching?)

How would your answer change if every world receives two walkie-talkies instead of one?
