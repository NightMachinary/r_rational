    and apparently transfer momentum or intertia somehow so that small objects hit as if they were larger.

  Has the super done this? Because if so it becomes really obvious that some kind of gravity manipulation is happening, because the transfer of gravitons to a small object will probably cause it to emit strong enough gravity that everyone nearby can feel themselves being pulled towards it.

Yes, the super has done this, but it's on the scale of tens or hundreds of kilograms, not planetary masses. You don't notice the gravitational force exerted by a car driving past you; you wouldn't notice this transfer. The lethal thread comes from hole-punching, not gravitational gradients. Imagine if someone dropped a 50-kilogram nail from 10 stories up.

The apparent threat level is lower than what you're estimating, but I do appreciate your contribution!
