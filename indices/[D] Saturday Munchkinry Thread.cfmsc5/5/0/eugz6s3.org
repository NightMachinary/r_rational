I should probably get on to writing the quest.

We have gone for easy kills in the previous two rounds. We should start looking to enhancing ourselves.

"I wish for a Kyubey, an injector and as much MCU Super Soldier Serum as possible."

The reason this hopefully doesn't violate the "wish for more wishes" clause that definitely is in place is that Kyubey grant wishes based on the girls' karmic potential, which is an intrinsic property of the girl and not Kyubey's power.

Inject yourself with the Super Soldier Serum. Contract with Kyubey.

"I wish for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c9uk9q/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/etc24l9/][the ability to travel back in time to anywhere within 5 m of my pasts selfs location with the limit there can only be Y alive Felicity's at any one time. Where Y = the largest number I can make it with my Karmic potential.]]"

We get super strength, super speed, super durability, a healing factor, immunity to chemical attacks, super strength, super speed, super durability, a healing factor, a safeguard against death, time twin, some other ability the contract gives and a weapon.
