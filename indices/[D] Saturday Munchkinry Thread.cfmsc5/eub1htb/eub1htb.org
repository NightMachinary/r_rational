I'm interested in what people would do in the modern world if they knew the GURPS spell "Seek Earth", which lets you find the nearest natural dirt or stone, and exclude known dirt and stone within the range, so over several castings you could inventory all the minerals in a fairly small area.

For discussion purposes you would be able to make an average of 5 successful uses of the spell per day with a maximum range of 100 meters.

I've got my own ideas, of course, like being able to "pan" for gold or diamonds really efficiently along streams or rivers that cut deposits, but I'm curious what others would do.
