That is a hard question to answer. I wanted to say that it branches apart on every choice and random event, such that there are infinite worlds branching off every world at every moment, but then we run into the problem where deciding whether to press Send or Receive is also a choice/random event and so our decision doesn't matter, what matters is which of the infinite worlds the walkie-talkie goes into.

I really only created the rule on branching to limit the number of walkie-talkies, so one world can't become an infinite number of receivers and get all the senders from similar parallels. If it helps, you may assume that the worlds cannot branch at all.
