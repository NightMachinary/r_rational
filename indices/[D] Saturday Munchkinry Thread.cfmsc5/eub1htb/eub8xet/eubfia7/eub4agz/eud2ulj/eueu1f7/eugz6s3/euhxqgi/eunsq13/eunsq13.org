  I wish for a Kyubey
#+end_quote

Just to check I have this down, by ‘Kyubey' I'm assuming you mean:

#+begin_quote
  I wish for a member of a largely emotionless alien race from space, which bargain with prepubescent females, which they consider maximally emotional, so they can harvest their emotions to produce negentropy. Their side of the bargain is that they use magic, which is powered by said emotions, to fulfil arbitrary wishes with strength proportional to the expected emotions of the wisher, and in return they ask the wisher to perform harvesting tasks that eventually result in the wisher turning into a ‘witch' and themselves being harvested at a later date. This Kyubey should then offer Felicity a wish.

Is this an accurate interpretation?
