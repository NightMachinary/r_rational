You now have an average of 1.5 tries for the class of decisions which can only be made once but whose optimal solutions are unlikely to change much in different worlds. Just alternate which you tries first and you both benefit.

You can do any search task where the things you're searching for were placed before you activated the device twice as fast. This would make you particularly good at prospecting, so getting geology degrees suddenly becomes valuable.

You can run password cracking algorithms for passwords which don't change often twice as fast as anyone else. This makes you valuable as a white/black hat hacker. In particular, you can run RSA decryption algorithms twice as fast for the majority of applications, as private keys don't change often IIRC. You can also steal a huge number of gaming accounts twice as fast, as most people don't change their passwords very often.
