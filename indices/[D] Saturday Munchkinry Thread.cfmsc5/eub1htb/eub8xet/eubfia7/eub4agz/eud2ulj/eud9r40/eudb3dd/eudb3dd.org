Isn't most of this just stuff I can do with 2 people, no parallel timelines needed? I suppose technically I only need to pay for one person's wages and coordination should be much more efficient than usual.

This would actually be helpful as I work as resourcer in the employment industry, being able to split my workload with myself would be efficient and I should effectively double the work I get done less communication time. Though I doubt I'd be able to double my pay as a result.

But still x2 speed on parallelisable tasks isn't a very strong munchkin.
