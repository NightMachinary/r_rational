I build Rainer Plaga's ion trap device for "interworld" exchange in such a way that I have the equivalent to a telegraph line to a version of myself that branched off when the device was created. It's the many-worlds' interpretation of QM. Both versions of myself have a device so its two-way communication.

How do I munchkin this?
