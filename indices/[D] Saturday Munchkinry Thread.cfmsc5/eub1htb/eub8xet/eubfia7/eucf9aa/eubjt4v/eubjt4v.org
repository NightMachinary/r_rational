  and apparently transfer momentum or intertia somehow so that small objects hit as if they were larger.

Has the super done this? Because if so it becomes really obvious that some kind of gravity manipulation is happening, because the transfer of gravitons to a small object will probably cause it to emit strong enough gravity that everyone nearby can feel themselves being pulled towards it.

  The super appears to have used one of your disabled Mook's cellphone to call for emergency medical treatment for one of the Mooks that the super disabled.

Ah, a good guy. Take innocents "hostage", but hostage in the sense that the super will be responsible for their deaths. Specifically, order the convention staff to simply stand on the edges of the catwalk/bridges but don't do anything. Don't do anything to the staff either, just let them stand there. This would mean that if the super uses his gravity powers on a small object, those poor innocent staff will be pulled by the gravitons and fall to their most grisly deaths.

Since the super has clearly displayed a reluctance for personally murdering his enemies, this will most likely seal off his supernatural usage of small objects, leaving him only with his ability to float around. Your mooks should have no problem taking him down now, because without those small objects, his offensive ability is essentially the same as a baseline human, while his mobility is easily countered by superior numbers.
