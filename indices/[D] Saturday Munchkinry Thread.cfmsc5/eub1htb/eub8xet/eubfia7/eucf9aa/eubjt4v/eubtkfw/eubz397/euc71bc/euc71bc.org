I guess I need to figure out whether pumping something full of 50 kg worth of gravitons only gives it 50 kg worth of gravitational attraction, or also gives it 50 kg worth of inertia. Does a marble pumped full of gravitons at the moment before it's released in a throw travel with the marble's inertia, or 50 kg of inertia? Does it make sense to separate inertia from apparent mass?
