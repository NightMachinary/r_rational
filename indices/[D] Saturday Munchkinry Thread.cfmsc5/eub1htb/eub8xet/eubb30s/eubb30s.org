You'll probably get a bunch of people, even in Heaven, who believe in a "true death" that occurs once nobody can contact you any more.

You'll also probably get a rough equivalent of our flat Earthers, people who don't believe that the Heavens are real and any communication from them is just some deity playing tricks.

Most of the True Faiths are going to /heavily/ encourage people to stay alive and propagate the Faith in some fashion, despite your bullet point saying that none of them count suicide as a sin. Memes can't spread if every carrier is dead.

That being said, if there's a "catch-all" Faith for people who didn't meet any criteria, that one is probably going to be all for suicide.
