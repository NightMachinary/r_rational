That's a good point.* Though I will note religions already put up art and buildings - adding lists of names** (beyond that of the founder, and recent leaders) wouldn't be a lot of effort. My main idea was that while we might think normal people wouldn't be super interested in the living world, except where their relatives are concerned, fanatics who know their heaven is real (because that's where they live) might have more of an interest. (And if there are heavens you can get into by spreading that religion...***)

*This would add value to not only genealogical records, but also the census, and perhaps give a reason to combine the two.

**Carved in stone, etc.

***This raises the question of whether a ghost that didn't make it into any heavens by not meeting the active ("you must do this") parts rather than the inactive parts ("you must never do this") can meet those requirements after they die, and then go to some heaven.

And now I'm wondering how religions would be affected by trying to compete to have the best afterlives.
