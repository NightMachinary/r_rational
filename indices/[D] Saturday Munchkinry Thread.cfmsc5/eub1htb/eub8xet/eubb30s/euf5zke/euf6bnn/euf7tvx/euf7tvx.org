  Who's alive to contact them, if the religion's died out because everyone knew their heaven was super cool and easy to get in to?
#+end_quote

Anyone who's still alive (though this might vary with the workings of the ritual). A religion need not die out - even if everyone alive who believes dies...that doesn't mean they can't be summoned. While they're alive, some people try to preach/spread their religion. While some people might only be interested in talking to living relatives, people who enjoy sharing their beliefs might continue doing so after they've died. (Someone doing the ritual: "I want to talk to someone about the afterlife." Ghost: "Have you heard about...")

  Like mortal governments are gonna censure their religious texts, because you don't want your workforce offing itself.

Who needs religious texts, when you can talk to any preacher who's dead, and still going strong?
