A mage can start a cult with tenets disqualifying the people from any known religion, ensuring a supply of golem ghosts and becoming extravagantly rich.

Most of the consequences depend on the specific afterlife restrictions and how widespread the knowledge of those conditions are. How do the common people know the rules and why do they believe in them? Can the average person do the magic to contract their ancestors, or are they able to afford/ trust the mages to do it for them?
