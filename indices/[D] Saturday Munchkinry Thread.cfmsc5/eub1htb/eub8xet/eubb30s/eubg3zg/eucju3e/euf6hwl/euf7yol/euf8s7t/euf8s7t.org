My assumption about behavior is based on similarity to humans - which have variation and limited consumption. In other words, I'm saying there are both hardworking humans and lazy humans, and thus (if gods are similar to humans*) then there are hardworking gods and lazy gods. It is worth noting that if there isn't a source of new gods, and conditions are harsh, even occasionally, then given enough time, lazy gods could be wiped out, and become rarer/change strategies**. (Which raises the question of what happens to their heaven.***)

* Which I don't have a reason to believe - it's just a common portrayal.

** "This year we are announcing some changes. In order to get into Heaven, from here on out, you will have to do a little more..."

*** And this is a good reason for something like maximization.
