I should clarify that I am referring to the common fantasy trope of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly][Gods Need Prayer Badly]]. With this arrangement, even if the dead count as viable worshipers, you'd still want to maximize or at least promote the expansion of your living worshipers to facilitate continued supply.

To draw an analogy, livestock farmers probably wouldn't set up their ranch next to a cliff and use the cliff like it's a fourth wall to complete their ranch enclosure. However, if they did choose to do that and then half of their herd flew off the cliff in a panic one cold winter day, they'd probably realize it's a bad idea and put up another fence to keep their animals from committing suicide. Even if the rapidly-frozen dead livestock could still be made perfectly fine to eat, it's risky to have no control over situations that could cause all or most of their herd to die.
