What exactly happens when you bounce around the various afterlives you qualify for? Does that mean you can actually interact with the heavenly locals and tell them about the other afterlives that they didn't qualify for?

Does that mean that the various heavens are thus interconnected by the multiply-qualified serving as pseudo-information traders? So the locals of a heavenly world could learn of the other heavenly worlds connected to them by the multiply-qualified?

I could see some kind of multi-world cooperation going on to record all of the people born in the mortal realm and which afterlives they ended up in, if only to confirm whether or not all afterlives have been found. The after-lifers would have an incentive to encourage the living to become multiply-qualified, so as to strengthen the heavenly network connections and possibly find new afterlives.

That means the mortal realm will soon be full of multi-faith people, aiming to be qualified for as many different afterlives as possible.
