Tree leaves have been used to search for trace amounts of gold beneath the surface of the soil, to determine where to mine. This technique is limited to the depth of tree roots, which makes it most useful in dry areas where tree roots go deep. I can't find many hard number, but the world record for deepest roots is 120 meters, and most tree roots in residential areas (well-studied for infrastructure reasons) don't go more than 5 feet deep. From that, using a 100 meter range to identify locations of gold deposits would be very useful in establishing mines.
