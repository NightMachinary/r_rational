In a Bayesian sense. I wonder how "Seek Earth" treats partial knowledge. If the post-test odds after using my detection equipment says there's a 50% there's an oil deposit below, does that count as a known source?

Depending on the way "Seek Earth" treats knowledge you might be able to extract more information from it than you'd think you could.
