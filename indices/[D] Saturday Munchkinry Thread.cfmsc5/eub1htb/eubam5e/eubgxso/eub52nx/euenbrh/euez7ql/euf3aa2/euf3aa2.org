I can see a difficulty, then, in that (IIUC) the spell would work most efficiently in a context where the thing you're looking for is embedded in a large amount of a less valuable material of a type that would not trigger the spell. So, a needle in a haystack, but it can't be an actual needle because that's not natural. But there are a limited number of situations where that would apply, and depending how finicky the spell is you could spend a lot of time sifting through the different kinds of mineral you aren't looking for. But I may misunderstand the parameters.

​

If you're standing on a sand dune, will it incessantly point out the nearest grain of sand, one after the other, until you run out of castings, or can all sand grains within range be marked as catalogued once it's pegged one? Or can you tweak it to identify handfuls of sand, or larger groupings of small units? Shifting this around, suppose you're standing next to a cliff face looking for a specific mineral. Does all the more or less solid rock of the face count as one found thing, or does it count individual mineral bands, or what? I don't remember a lot about geology from high school and college, but I vaguely recall that there are a huge number of different kinds of rocks and minerals.

​

(I'm also mildly curious as to what the spell is used for in actual games of GURPS)
