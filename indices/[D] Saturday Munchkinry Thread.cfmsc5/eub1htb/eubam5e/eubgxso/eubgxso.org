Hmm, what is the precision of the spell, and limits on what materials it can detect?

For example, could you go to a hospital and cast the Seek Earth spell looking for gold, and thus find any patients suffering from gold poisoning?

I imagine it wouldn't work for arbitrary poisons, especially biological ones like snake venom since they wouldn't count as "Earth", but there are a lot of poisonous metals that could be considered "Earth", so using a "Seek Earth" spell may help you quickly find and diagnose poisoned patients.
