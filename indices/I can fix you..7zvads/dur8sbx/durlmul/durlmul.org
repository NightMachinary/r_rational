Crimes of the past self: think of it this way. I go out and commit a murder, but then wipe my memory of having done so (say I restore from backup after shooting myself). If the current me, which has never committed a murder, could be extrapolated forward to performing the same action, then shouldn't I be just as culpable? So you'd need to change so much as to be nearly indistinguishable from the person who committed the crime. In the Clockwork Orange example, is Alex after conditioning actually a different sentient entity, or is his behavior simply under external controls? Since his original self was recoverable, I would say that definitionally his past-self didn't die, but was only suppressed.
