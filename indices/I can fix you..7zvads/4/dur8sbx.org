  You are different from your past self. [..] In a certain sense, past you is dead, and has been replaced, albeit organically, by present you. If past-you doesn't exist anymore and can't be recovered, past-you has died.

It's nice to find something that describes part of my own views so closely without having to specifically go looking for it.

Some additional things to add to this discussion:

- the undefined importance of the meta-self: how much is the current version of the self dependent on both its past versions, and its “meta-self”: the over-encompassing image of itself that stretches across time and can not be observed and analysed by itself due to the nature of a human brain and mind? How much do deep memories in fact affect us, mental and physical traumas, almost completely forgotten experiences, the changes that one's system of morality has undergone through the continuous history of all the past selves and reasons behind those changes, etc? And given the degree of importance that all these “hidden stats” hold over a current version of a self, can one really say that the current-self is its own person and that the past-selves just die when they change too much? Can a leopard really, truly change its spots; and if it can, does it matter enough to define it as a new creature or is it still the same one because its skeleton remained intact?

- ageing --- when you compare a 40 year-old version of someone with their 50, 70, 90, etc year-old selves; doesn't it turn out that the more they age the more of the person that you knew at their 40 withers away and dies? This can be a very painful question for those who have people close to them who are old or becoming older. The damage to the body and the brain make such people remnants of their past selves, but the society (and they themselves) often excepts us to treat them as the same person. If you interact with someone close to you who's now, say, 70 years old, and neither see them alive nor dead but as continuously dying, how are you supposed to deal with the emotioal backlash from such an understanding of a human sophont's \ consciousness's life?

- crimes of a past self --- how much should've the late-stage version of Alex DeLarge from Clockwork Orange be held responsible for the crimes committed by the earlier versions of his self? What are all the other important factors that should be considered when answering this question, besides the issue of the past-self deaths?
