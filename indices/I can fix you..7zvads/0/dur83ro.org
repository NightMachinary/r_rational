  if past-you doesn't want to become present-you, but present-you likes being present-you, then who's preference should receive more moral weight?
#+end_quote

Of the present version, because 1) the past version had its chance already and had already used it, no matter how efficiently. 2) the opinions of dead people should be disregarded more than of the living.

  What if you wanted to be changed in such a radical way; does your preference really matter or does this become merely assisted suicide?
#+end_quote

This question's answer partially depends on definition of “suicide”; and while defining suicide is relatively straight-forward in the legal sense of the word, in context of such a discussion it is much less so. For example, one of the reasons behind the common negative perception of suicide is the effects it leaves on the people who knew the person who committed suicide. Another, from a government's point of view, is that it is interested to maintain such an environment in which the random destruction of its “cells” --- individual people --- is minimised. These types of problems are not an issue when we are dealing with the more esoteric definitions of death and suicide.

So, even if it does become an assisted suicide, what of it? Why should it matter?

  If the end result is the same, then does it actually matter how we got there?
#+end_quote

First, the analogy was so inaccurate that I won't even bother listing all the things wrong with it. Second, it matters because in case #1 you were changing the would-be ice cream lover through their consent, while in cases #2 and #3 you were violating a bunch of their publicly recognised rights.

  To draw the point home to fiction: how is it okay to fix Bellatrix Lestrange? If you can make her stop being evil and crazy via years of therapy, or via mind alteration, then is there a moral difference?
#+end_quote

See definition of death\murder\suicide above. It's ok to fix her because in the public's eye this esoteric definition of murder is a non-issue.
