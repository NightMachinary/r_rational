  I think that humans can be swayed by a clever enough argument regardless of other factors; what if the AI is just really persuasive? It doesn't have to 'change your mind' if you come around to the idea on your own.

Well yes the fact human minds can likely be convinced of anything using superhuman charisma without direct tampering with the brain is exactly why coming up with a consistent way of solving these sorts of alignment related problems isn't easy, nor is it even clear anyone's done it yet.

  Bu the mental processes of your experience are now directed towards a different perspective. A set of experiences is less important than who experiences them. We can call it something else if you like: mind state vector corruption? Mind state vector usurpation?

This always struck me as a weird unjustified supposition to make. just because you identify with many aspects of your mind, doesn't mean there's any actual reason to suppose that anything except the the presence of the brain processes which generate experiences will function in a subjectively different way should you change other elements. To put it another way there's no reason to suppose you are anything except those processes that generate qualia for the sense of "you" which actually predicts experience.

Furthermore trying to tie a definition of identity which actually predicts experience to transient properties like personality/memory doesn't seem very workable because you can't make any real convincing points for why complete change in those traits should result in "death" but not the many tiny such similarly instant changes that happen to one's mind constantly (after all at some level the human brain must be quantized in its functions). Given such matters have great relevance when it comes to predicting future subjective experience it seems like a system that couldn't seem to /even in principle/ give definitive answers on that shouldn't make sense unless you think human minds are magic.
