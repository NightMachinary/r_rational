I think a lot of this is conflating different questions, after all if you're not talking about cessation of experience (the mental processes in the brain that were generating your experience are still doing their thing) then "death" is a poorly defined thing and should probably be tabooed in such discussions.

So once you're just talking about personality/memory changes that's something of a different and broad topic. Ultimately though this is probably not a currently generally solvable set of ethical problems for pretty similar/identical reasons to AI alignment and of course should you get it wrong then you get an AGI/ethical system that minds controls people into wanting to be turned into hedonium.
