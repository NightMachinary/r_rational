Change can be necessary, just like it can be necessary to be weak sometimes. But you shouldn't look on it as a good thing in and of itself, because the more you change, the more your goals drift, and the more your goals drift the less you even are the same person you used to be.

People on this sub are used to seeing goal drift as a huge issue with AI because of how fast it can happen and how it can have such negative effects on us. But goal drift in a person has very negative effects too; if you can't trust your future self to work towards the same goals it hamstrings you in the present.
