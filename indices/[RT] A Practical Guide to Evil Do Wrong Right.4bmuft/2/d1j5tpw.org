Just caught up to the latest chapter; really great series! The Name system reminds me of the Fame system in Shadows of the Limelight (which I've already read), but honestly I'm more interested in the underlying question "Can Evil be better than Good"? And its close follow-up "Can it continue being better in the long-run?"

I was firmly on the side of Evil until Bard gave her reasoning for why Good needs to win, and now I'm a bit worried that she's right. As one of the comments roughly said, Good at its best is wonderful for everyone, and at its worst is small-minded and dangerously inept. Evil at its best is efficient and orderly, and at its worst is cataclysmic and genocidal. So while the Dread Empire may currently be a better place than "Good" Callow was, this period of stability and relative peace is extremely rare. And when Evil goes bad, it goes VERY bad.

Does anyone have other recommendations like this series? Or other empire building, characters-are-not-idiots stuff?
