  I really love this story, and actually tear up when listening to parts of the audio version.

Well shit, awesome! As an author, there are few things that make me happier than hearing something like that, thank you! I'm sure the voice actors/actresses will be pleased too, I'll pass it on. :)

And thank you for the feedback about rational fiction as well. I've written a little over a half-dozen stories so far, and only two of them are what I'd consider "rationalist." Turns out that as much as I love reading it, it's not a writing style that comes naturally to me.
