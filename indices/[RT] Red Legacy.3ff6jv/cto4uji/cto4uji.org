I really love this story, and actually tear up when listening to parts of the audio version. I'm not sure whether or not to call it "rational", but things that make me turn towards saying "yes" include:

- what we see of world seems to be well considered, consistent, and the result of optimization processes
- conflict is driven by the universe being awful and real differences of values
- main character has an attitude of "wherever it takes"/heroic responsibility
- clever things like the "self-destruct" button
- it asks important questions about to what extent we should want to cheer for immortality research

The first and last are just elements of good SF, I guess, but I included them anyway.
