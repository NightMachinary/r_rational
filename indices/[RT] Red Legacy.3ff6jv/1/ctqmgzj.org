Very good story. I remember when you announced it had been accepted for publication and I did see it in print. It is a lot more heart wrenching than I expected from 'Soviet mad scientist'. The Lamarckian evolution is a brilliant stroke of alternate world building. A very Strossian vibe. I wish I had thought of a story like this. I was sure that the reactor incident would actually point to some Darwinian technique to save her child, but sadly, that didn't happen.

Minor nitpick: There is no way Soviet security would be this flimsy around a national security project of this nature. Even accounting for the Lamarckian explanation, MI6 and the others seem to penetrate it far too easily. That just feels wrong, somehow. I also need to sit down and think of how a Lamarckian world would actually look like. Would be wildly different or just subtly different as this story portrays ? But a very good story, overall.
