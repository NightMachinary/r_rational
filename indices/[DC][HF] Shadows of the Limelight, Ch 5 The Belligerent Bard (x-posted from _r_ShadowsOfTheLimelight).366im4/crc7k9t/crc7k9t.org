An interesting point is raised by the fact that Fame can be directed towards fictional and historical figures. Is that really true? How could they have possibly tested it? Perhaps it's incorrectly attributed.

For instance, we know that a person gains power when more people know about him. If people in the past had more power than people now, and that's confirmed and not an exaggeration, then perhaps it's because, I don't know, the system works with the /percentage/ of people who know about you, rather than the /number./

Anyone else have theories or criticism?
