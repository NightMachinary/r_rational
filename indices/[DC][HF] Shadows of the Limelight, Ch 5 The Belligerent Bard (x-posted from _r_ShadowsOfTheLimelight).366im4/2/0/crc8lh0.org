It's not that people had more power back then, I think, but that people /now/ are wasting their thought-minutes on stories about dead people. The thing with the 10 000 audience focusing to exaggerate childrens' domains shows that it's not who knows about you, but who's thinking about you. If I'm thinking about Hercules, I'm not thinking about Brad Pitt.

On the other hand, the author indicated somewhere that absolute numbers matter, so I imagine that it's a case of "power increasing, but not as fast as it could be because of all these dead assholes who carved their faces into mountains."
