Lack of knowledge is probably part of it, especially since Gaelwyn seems to be on the leading edge of knowledge and the things he's discovering are pretty basic. It's not really stated how long ago Laith was living, but I'd guess within the last hundred years? So these are probably people who are having legitimate arguments about what the functions of the internal organs are, nevermind being able to diagnose problems, nevermind actually being able to fix those problems with good consistency. (And yeah, flesh is OP.)
