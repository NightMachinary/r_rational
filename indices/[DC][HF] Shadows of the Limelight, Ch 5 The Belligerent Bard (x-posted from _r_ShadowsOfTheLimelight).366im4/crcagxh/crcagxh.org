So, a few thoughts in this chapter.

I'm a little confused about the lack of immortality. The flesh domain cannot affect organs, but there are other body domains so it would be a bit arbitrary to not have those. We count the skin as an organ, but I can see why a pseudo-renaissance culture may not.

That said, such an arbitrary distinction could suggest that the underlying mechanism here is belief rather than simple volume of fame (a la discworld), which would also put Vidre trying to spread the sorry she can detect lies into a new context.

But back to the topic of immortality, it seems that an amazing way for an immortal to get and maintain fame without any effort or input would be to hide their their method of immortality, and pretend to die. From that point onwards they would be referenced in almost every discussion of death, immortality, hubris and wasted effort. Bonus points for a "deathbed conversion" to religion, which now makes you one of the go to arguments of the religious. Double bonus points if you leave an eternal reminder if who you are on the side of a mountain.

What I am saying is that King Laith sounds like a story, and in this world that usually means it was intentionally created to serve some purpose.

The evidence against Laith being alive is the meta knowledge that Alexander is a better author than the "mysterious enemy is a callback to the first chapters" trope.
