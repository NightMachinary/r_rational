The thing is, if you can repair the rest of the body and starve tumours to death with vessel constriction, pancreatic cancer isn't actually a big problem.

I am really wondering if the only reason they don't have near complete disease immunity at the moment is because of an unexplained difference in physiology compared to the real world, or because of a lack of knowledge of the flesh users.

If physiology is normal, almost any surgery should be pretty trivial. Flesh users can change muscle, fat, vessels and connective tissue (the last two implictly).

If you keep the vasculature tuned up (atherosclerosis free) and don't smoke (you can fix bronchitis, but not emphysema), and remove any tumours as they arise (detected by smooth muscle invasion at the capillary level) the only [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey#The_seven_types_of_aging_damage][real problems]] you have left are build up of inracellular and extracellular junk. Living for a long time should be possible for the majority of people. I can even think of several ways to set up an Alzheimers slower/partial fix.

I'm going with lack of knowledge in universe for now, see how it plays out. In the right hands, flesh domain is super broken.
