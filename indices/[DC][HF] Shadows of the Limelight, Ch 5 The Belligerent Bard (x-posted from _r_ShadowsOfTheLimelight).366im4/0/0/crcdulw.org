The domains are conceptual or symbolic in some way. You have ones that are based on materials, like water, wood, iron, but you also have ones that are based on reactions, like fire or rust, and then other not-totally-physical things like sound, shadow, and light. All the domains are thematic in some way. While that might be for Doyalist reasons, it might also be that this is also the Watsonian reason. ([[/u/xamueljones]] gets credit for this basic theory [[http://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowsOfTheLimelight/comments/34n4e4/shadows_of_the_limelight_ch_3_nighttime_ballet/cqxjwyo?context=3][here]].)

You get access to your domain by being famous, but it's not too much of a stretch to think that the domains themselves exist because the domains are famous. It kind of makes sense for there to be this "gap" in the domains around the internal organs if they're not thematic or symbolic enough.

Laith probably died from pancreatic cancer or something, since "pancreas" doesn't seem to be a domain.
