I've not read SFP yet though as others have said in the thread, your description encourages me to move it up my list. (Also the kind of people who didn't like it, and the clever and generous way they express that dislike, encourages me further.)

Have you read Worm and Ward? Your article reminded me a little of Glory Girl's journey from brutal Superman-ish flying brute with emotional overwhelm bonus powers, to body-horror victim of her adoptive sister's “healing” powers (healing being Amy's very irrational interpretation of what her powers /really/ do), to civil service pseudo-cop (strong parallels to Alison/Mega Girl going to college) to leader of a supergroup formed in group therapy, and eventually to saviour of the world again. You would probably enjoy it, if you haven't read it; word of warning, the whole thing is like six million words.
