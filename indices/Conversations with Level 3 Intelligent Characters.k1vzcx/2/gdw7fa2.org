  Seriously, go read it. Reddit will still be here when you get back. I promise---NAY, I PRECOMMIT---to upvote your comment if you take a month to reply because you were reading the first three chapters.

Ugh! This sentence made me twitch in annoyance.

I love what you have written here and SFP is fantastic in how it portrays moral difficulties and ethical debates, but you are using that word wrong!

Precommitment does NOT mean to firmly promise something that you will follow through no matter what. It requires imposing an outside force which will force you to follow through on your promise no matter what, even if you yourself change your mind and try to break the promise.

Odysseus precommited to ignoring the sirens by tying himself to his mast, instead of promising really hard that he wouldn't jump overboard. Couples are precommiting to who gets what in a divorce by writing up a prenup instead of just relying on a verbal promise before marriage. Harry is precommiting to save the world as safely as possible at the end of HP:MOR because he's under an Unbreakable Vow which makes it impossible to take any action which would doom the world.

You'd be precommiting if you had a friend who will perform the upvoting based on posting times even if you asked them to do otherwise in the future, instead of saying you'll do an upvote yourself.

What you are doing is just regular promising aka everyday commitment.

Nothing against you personally, just a pet peeve of mine when I see that word misused.
