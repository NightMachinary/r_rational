I'll sign off on all of that.

The one thing I would like to clarify is that I have no problem with the story promoting progressive views - that's perfectly fine. It's more that all the characters who disagree with the author's worldview are portrayed as completely unsympathetic. I'm thinking here of the right-wing fire hero in particular, who expresses the view that fake rape allegations exist and then promptly turns out to be a rapist himself (I think? at least he was accused of it by Moonshadow, don't remember the specifics).

Rationality is all about seeking out opposing viewpoints and coming up with ways that you yourself might be wrong. This is not the way to go about that, I think.
