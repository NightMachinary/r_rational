I thought about what you've said, and I think I agree that there is a bias, but I don't agree with your conclusion. I think it still classifies as rational (and even rationalist) fiction.

If I'm going off sidebar definition, then it hits most of the points. If I go off "rational fiction is what the subreddit thinks is rational fiction", then SFP has been recommended multiple times.

There was a point raised a while ago, that fiction shouldn't be excluded from 'rational fiction' for being bad. That for the distinction of rational to be as useful as possible, it should include both good and bad fiction in it.

I would say "SFP is a rational fiction, but has attributes that detract from it", or even "SFP isn't perfect, and some of the ideologies should be taken with a grain of salt", and these are sentences I could apply to any rational fiction.
