Eh, the over emphasis on left wing politics tends to push it fairly antirational. I remember when reading it the author didn't seem to have any real conception of what people felt, unlike with HPMOR where I felt Yudo understood Hermione's viewpoint fairly well and Malfoy's viewpoint.

Take the organ donation, and selfish people- [[https://www.atlassociety.org/post/charity]]

This is from Ayn Rand. They're fine with charity, if not viewing it as especially noble, so long as it aligns with your own values. I certainly didn't get any sense that the author had read up on traditional selfish philosophies before writing that scene.

  Answer: Objectivism holds that there is nothing wrong with charity, so long as one is pursuing one's own values in providing it. As Ayn Rand said, charity is a marginal issue: it is not especially noble to engage in it, but if pursued prudently and seriously, and not at the cost of other important values, it can be a source of good for one's society and ultimately one's self. Objectivists tend to view their donations to causes as investments in some kind of improvement: a better culture, a better city, etc. But like investments, these require attention to make sure they are paying off.

  If you want to help strangers, go ahead. But don't feel any prouder of yourself than if you had bought a Porsche.

She actually avoids discussions about this, by flying away. She doesn't do any internal introspection when confronted by intellectual ideas she dislikes, she flies away.

When she doesn't get her way, she doesn't do any internal introspection or values adjustment, she uses violence to force a guy to comply for the greater good.

The gay character does teach Allison the value of incrementally helping people, thus showing that gay people are good, but it's not a great lesson, and no one really confronts Allison on this. She spends her time starting a woman's shelter personally, because she has learned that helping people is good, and because she was the original one who wanted grand schemes she has no one to discuss this issue with.

As others have noted, she could be much more effective at charity if she earned a lot of money and funded thousands of women's shelters worldwide.

She also isn't very introspective on violence. She herself beats up Feral, this random guy she went on a date with, but doesn't have any real introspection that women can also be violent.

But yeah, it's a level 1 intelligence here. They don't have any real comprehension of dissenting viewpoints.
