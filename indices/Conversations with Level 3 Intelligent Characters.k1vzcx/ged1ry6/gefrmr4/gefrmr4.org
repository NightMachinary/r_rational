  She actually avoids discussions about this, by flying away. She doesn't do any internal introspection when confronted by intellectual ideas she dislikes, she flies away.

  When she doesn't get her way, she doesn't do any internal introspection or values adjustment

Weren't there pages upon pages of introspection and interrogation of her values after the Max thing? Didn't she throw up and cry out of guilt, and ask for the input of a philosopher on whether it's ethical to compel moral action, and hold a debate with herself where she specifically called out her own lack of empathy toward Max's point of view in the moment, as well as her failure to meaningfully consider nonviolent methods of gaining his cooperation?

You're describing how she reacted to Max's refusal to help at the time as if that were the complete encapsulation of how she and the comic address that topic, which I think is pretty uncharitable on top of being misleading to folks who haven't read the comic yet.

  She also isn't very introspective on violence.

This, broadly, is an extreme mischaracterization of Alison's character and the comic. The comic is largely /about/ her introspection regarding her propensity to tunnel-vision herself into violent solutions because violence is what she's naturally good at. She's constantly questioning what that means for her capacity to do good, and whether it's something she can change about herself, and how she might go about doing that. Some of her most important character development moments have to do with interrogating this flaw in herself and overcoming some related blind spot.

  The gay character does teach Allison the value of incrementally helping people, thus showing that gay people are good,
#+end_quote

I don't think this was the intended message. I think gay people with various personalities and ethical codes just exist in the world and therefore also exist in the comic.

  She spends her time starting a woman's shelter personally, because she has learned that helping people is good
#+end_quote

That's not what she did or learned. She started a collaborative project with other powered individuals to help protect women from violence because she realized that she was tunnel-visioning herself into only trying to find ways in which she personally, by herself, could use her own powerset to accomplish systemic change, when it's much more effective for people of various skill- or powersets to work together. The Valkyrie Project isn't the highest-impact thing she could be doing, but it represents a critical conceptual step forward. "Helping people is good," conversely, was a concept she was on board with from the start.
