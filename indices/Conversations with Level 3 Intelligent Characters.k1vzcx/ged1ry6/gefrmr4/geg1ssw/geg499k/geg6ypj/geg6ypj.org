  She does often resort to violence reflexively, and this is a facet of her relationship to violence that she introspects about all the time. It's a character flaw, and one that does not go unchallenged either by the story or by the character herself.
#+end_quote

The ideal for introspection of violence is that it would have some connection to actual violence, and that she would be less violent or more nuanced in her violence later on, which doesn't really happen.

  Re: politics, it kind of sounds like you're strawmanning how the comic depicts people and ideas because you disagree with its left-wing bent.

I'm fine with the politics, it's just really hamfisted. Christians object to abortion because they don't like abortion. Subbing in organ donation for abortion works as well in showing christian views as having lesbians flamethrower some puppy rescue houses because some environmentalists bomb animal testing labs works in showing left wing views.

In terms of why I don't give a good faith viewing of the comic and assume they are making a nuanced message on conservatives and christians, well I doubt the authors would see stories where gay people were evil and flamethrowered people because of their gayness as a nuanced story about a few radical gay people.

It's important to be representative. Just as people, and me, can condemn stories for exclusively having LGBT or women as bad, I can condemn the comic for exclusively having their political opponents as murderers.

  I agree it's not the maximally effective or radical thing Alison could be doing with her time. But a rational story does not have to be one where the main character does only rational things. This is a story about Alison's growth, which means she can't start out as a perfect utility optimizer, or jump directly to that in any one step of her moral development.

It's not at all effective in her stated goals. She said Tara shouldn't organ donate because it didn't fix systemic issues. She herself is doing a non controversial set of actions that does nothing about systemic issues. It's orthogonal to her goals.

  A huge number of pages of the story are dedicated to debates between opposing ideas in which both or all sides are given substantial weight. This is no small thing in a webcomic format where every few lines of dialogue require hours of drawing and coloring.

They debate opposing ideas, but in a fairly narrow range between people who mostly agree with Allison. Part of the appeal of HPMOR was debates between people with fairly radical disagreements.

The story has people with fairly radical disagreements, they just don't debate much. As I noted, she flew away when a Randian disagreed too much.
