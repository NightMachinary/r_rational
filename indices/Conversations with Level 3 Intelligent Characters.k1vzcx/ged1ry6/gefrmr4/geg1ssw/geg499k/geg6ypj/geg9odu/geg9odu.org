I don't really have anything to say on the subject of Alison's introspection about violence that I haven't already said. To summarize, 1., said introspection is a huge recurring theme in the story; and 2., I expect a well-written, humanized character with a core, arc-defining flaw to manifest that flaw often, especially on emotional impulse, and not to overcome it easily even with deliberate effort. We may have to agree to disagree on what "counts" as introspection and growth.

The protesters' issue isn't with organ donation, it's with mass organ donation /by a dynamorph./ Spitting in the eye of God by putting her weird mutant organs in everybody, or what have you. (Although I honestly can't remember if they were even explicitly said to be Christian or religious at any point, or if they were primarily a dynaphobic group with at least one member carrying a sign that mentioned Satan). In any case, I think you represent the comic's takes in that regard to be more hamfisted/less nuanced than they actually are. For example, you say the creators would object to a story where a gay person murders someone because of their gayness, but have you considered that there's a whole arc in the comic about Alison trying stop a feminist from murdering people because of her (particular brand of) feminism? (Which I think is an even better parallel to the terrorist since feminism and bigotry against dynamorphs are both philosophical views, whereas being gay is not.) Does that strike you as a narrative choice that would be made by writers who want to depict all left-wing people and ideas as unfailingly good and all right-wing people and ideas as unfailingly evil?

  She said Tara shouldn't organ donate because it didn't fix systemic issues. She herself is doing a non controversial set of actions that does nothing about systemic issues.

You're assuming that her views on one-punch solutions never evolved; that what she said to Tara at the time is still what she uncritically believes. I think it's pretty evident in the comic that she starts to recognize that as a blind spot in herself, how she'd reject paths to incremental change in favor of waiting for some hypothetical future opportunity to Fix Everything Forever. You're presenting a time when she expressed an inadequately examined, overly simplistic take, and a later time when she demonstrated having moved past that, and saying that means she's acting orthogonally to her goals. The reality is that she started allowing herself to do good in smaller ways with the potential to build to something greater, while /also/ taking the opportunity to make a huge systemic change when one finally did come along (the Max thing).

Finally, I think the disagreements that have been argued in the story have been pretty radical. "It's ethical to compel moral action" vs "it's not" is a huge disagreement, as is "It's ethical to make extreme personal sacrifices to fix some of the world's problems" vs "personal sacrifices for partial solutions are wasteful at best and prolong an unjust system at worst," or "It's ethical to murder rapists who've escaped legitimate justice, for purposes of harm reduction and/or retribution" vs "it's wrong for an individual to commit vigilante executions." It's true that neither Alison nor the story take seriously the idea that total apathy toward the wellbeing of other people is reasonable--and as someone who's read and written about Rand extensively, I frankly don't either, and would also not sit there and debate with someone who had just suggested that my dear friend's extreme personal sacrifice was of no moral value--but the more important Randian concepts about personal autonomy and the use of force are given substantial attention.
