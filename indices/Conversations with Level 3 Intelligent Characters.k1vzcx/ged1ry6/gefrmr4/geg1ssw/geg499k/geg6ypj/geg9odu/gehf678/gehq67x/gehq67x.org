The version of the comic you remember seems a lot flatter than the one I read. Putting aside the uh, interesting take that the guy Moonshadow kills was merely innocently "escorting a drunk girl home" (and that you evidently missed the panels that showed Moonshadow was acting on allegations that he'd committed actual past sexual assaults rather than on his "thought crime" with the drunk girl), I certainly don't recall Moonshadow being portrayed as "very reasonable and sympathetic and collected and proper." I recall that she was depicted as an extremist with understandable motives but abhorrent methods, that she was fraying at the edges, that she wasn't even able to stick to her code of only killing rapists (she attacked Alison and got the fire guy killed). In the page you linked, Alison is saying she thinks Moonshadow's approach is /wrong/, but is asking herself whether her perspective on that is warped by her invincibility and whether stopping Moonshadow was the /best/ thing she could have been doing with her time, which are exactly the sorts of questions characters in a rational work should be asking themselves.

I mean, first you're saying the comic is a thin political treatise because it strawmans and villainizes opposing viewpoints instead of meaningfully engaging with them, and now you're suggesting that it's a thin political treatise because Moonshadow wasn't portrayed as a mustache-twirling psychopath and was allowed to have some impact on Alison's perspective despite Alison rejecting her methods. Do you want the comic to explore different viewpoints or not?

  He asked to be a superhero with real powers, she just ignored that despite having several mecha suit making super genius friends. Normal people refuse the false choice between violence and inaction, and pay people for their services.

Again, she literally calls /herself/ out on this later. She asks herself why she just made a half-assed "sterile appeal to heroism" and then went straight to violence instead of exploring any of the countless other options, and the answer is that she isn't good at any of the other options--diplomacy, bartering, manipulation, etc--because her powers mean she's never /had/ to be. She's never developed those skills, or any propensity to readily generate solutions that rely on them, because she could always fall back on being her setting's Superman analogue. The fact that she doesn't "consider what normal people do" is the /entire point./ You and I could sit here all day brainstorming various things she could have offered Max in exchange for his willing cooperation, but the narrative purpose of that scene was not to demonstrate how to optimally persuade someone. This story explores the ethical development of a character who is /not/ a normal person and has to identify and address the blind spots that have resulted from that.

Like this is all stuff that is explicitly, exhaustively explored right on the page, and you're just omitting it from your analysis and writing her off with stock phrases about intelligence quantification. "Rational" characters are not (usually) infallible utility maximizers with no room to grow and nothing to question about themselves. A character who has flaws and blind spots, but actively tries to identify those in herself and question her own premises, is absolutely valid as a rational protagonist.
