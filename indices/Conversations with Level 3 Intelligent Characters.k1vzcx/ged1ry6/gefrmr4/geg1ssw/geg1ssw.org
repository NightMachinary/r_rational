  Weren't there pages upon pages of introspection and interrogation of her values after the Max thing?
#+end_quote

She does have pages of introspection, but she doesn't actually ever get any real understanding of how she could persuade him. She learns violence is wrong because it prevents diplomacy, but neither she nor her professor show any real understanding of his motivations or any reliable pathway forward, and she doesn't make any real effort to understand him later.

That's the mark of a level 1 intelligent character. She does what is best for her, which is intellectual sounding discussions and doing what feels best for her personally with her abilities.

Level 2 would be her doing some sort of impressive cognitive feat to solve an existing problem. She's not there yet. She does what feels good, she doesn't focus on solving what she sees as the larger problems are.

  This, broadly, is an extreme mischaracterization of Alison's character and the comic. The comic is largely about her introspection regarding her propensity to tunnel-vision herself into violent solutions because violence is what she's naturally good at. She's constantly questioning what that means for her capacity to do good, and whether it's something she can change about herself, and how she might go about doing that. Some of her most important character development moments have to do with interrogating this flaw in herself and overcoming some related blind spot.

She still uses violence fairly reflexively. She thinks a lot about violence, but she doesn't actually think much when there's a problem near her.

  I don't think this was the intended message. I think gay people with various personalities and ethical codes just exist in the world and therefore also exist in the comic.
#+end_quote

The comic is very political, with evil christian conservatives who flamethrower someone for organ donation, and the conservative being a hot headed murderer who destroys a dam and is abducted by a sympathetic drug and truth test for rape female person.

As such, I am doubtful that this wasn't the intended message. The story is pretty blatantly anti religion and right wing people, and is fairly explicit about praising people who are the right sort of politics and condemning those who are the wrong sort of politics.

This severe lack of introspection, where political enemies are violent murderous thugs, is not a sign of an especially rational story. "Christians are wrong because they flamethrower organ donors" is not a coherent political argument.

  She started a collaborative project with other powered individuals to help protect women from violence because she realized that she was tunnel-visioning herself into only trying to find ways in which she personally, by herself, could use her own powerset to accomplish systemic change, when it's much more effective for people of various skill- or powersets to work together.

Sure, but it's not systemic change- there's lots of women's shelters out there, and they get lots of funding from Republicans and Democrats. It's an activity that doesn't challenge the system much and is normal politically. She's not actually doing anything towards her stated goals, and as such isn't rational.
