  I just finished reading Strong Female Protagonist, the superhero webcomic our society needs but definitely doesn't deserve, and as a consequence there's a blonde invincible chick in my head who wants to know whether writing stupid things for the Internet is really the best way for me to spend my time.

I thank you for putting this in front of the thread because it saved me for reading anything below.

If you think any fiction where people put on suits to fight crime and 'villains' - or more realistically, criminals - would in any way shape or form give up anonimity and advertise who they are (which, you know, helps them get caught) is not said villains holding a stupid ball, then I'm sorry, you're wrong. Super heros are, ultimately, a silly concept.

SFP attempts to do what Miracleman did in 1985, only, much, much worse, and doesn't realize that it's lionizing the supergod, instead of pointing out how inhuman said super god would be.
