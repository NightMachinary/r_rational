  I'm going to stop you right there. This isn't a rational world, it's a justification for super heroes to have existed/continue to exist. And as we agree, that's silly.

  It's a handwave, and sure, to justify the story, but it makes it non-rational as a default.
#+end_quote

That's... not any definition of "rational literature" that I've ever heard.

I could make the same argument about the utterly stupid and incompetent Ministry for Magic in HPMOR being a justification for the premise of the story. Would that make the story "non-rational as a default?" Of course not.

From what I understand, a story is "rational" if the world is internally consistent, if the protagonist's end goals are aligned with their values, and they mostly use logic and good judgement to achieve those goals. And generally, in order to make a story with a rational protagonist interesting, you also need a rational antagonist. If the world also needs to be run by rational people from the start, then you don't have much of an interesting space to tell a story, because a rational protagonist and a rational antagonist would (unless their values are completely incompatible) be able to cooperate within the current system in order to achieve mutually satisfactory goals.

  Are you for real? 'He presented arguments'. What argument is there to present with 'I'm trying to take over the government in a coup, people died, but it was all in a good cause' makes sense?

How about [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-18/][someone is murdering superheroes and the government is either incompetent to stop them or complicit in achieving this?]]

If the government is either deliberately killing people like you off, or standing back and letting such a thing happen then, well...

  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Was Menace going about this the best way? No, and he stopped (and then started manipulating Allison by reading her thoughts, which is it's own kind of villainy, but let's not digress.

  As you'll see, the pattern is that super god will defend anyone she thinks is doing good, like the one who 'kills rapists'.
#+end_quote

I'm going to skip forward to where you elaborate on this point, because it pretty much said that engaging with you further is pointless:

#+begin_quote
  [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sfp-5-157-for-web1.png][Here]] is super god defending the actions of the killer.
#+end_quote

What Alison actually says about Moonshadow (the killer in question) is:

#+begin_quote
  Moonshadow wants to use lethal violence as a tool for social change. I think that's wrong.
#+end_quote

How is stating outright that what you think someone is doing is wrong, "defending" them? How is it, in any way, characterizing Moonshadow as someone "she thinks is doing good?"

And, again, in context, not [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-5/page-149/][ten pages earlier]], she tries to talk the "rapist killer" out of doing that.

Like, really, I don't know where you're getting "super god feels bad because she had to stop this series of killings."

"Super god" is feeling powerless because nothing she tries to do actually, meaningfully changes things for the better. "Super god" is conflicted because she knows that her own personal morality is no basis on which to make world-altering decisions... but what else does she have, when those decisions are in her lap?

If, instead, what you're taking from that is, "jerking off extrajudicial murders - and tossing aside pesky concepts such as 'due process' in the meantime," when the protagonist is the one who is *stating outright that this is wrong*, I don't think we're reading the same comic.
