  It's great. Go read the first three chapters because I'm about to spoil them, and it's great so you should just read it first. Seriously, go read it. Reddit will still be here when you get back. I promise---NAY, I PRECOMMIT---to upvote your comment if you take a month to reply because you were reading the first three chapters.

I saw this and decided to read it until I got bored. Ended up reading the whole thing during the entire rest of my day. Thank you for introducing me to this wonderful story that kept me from studying for my exams dipshit. 5/5 best comic I read this year.
