Other than Allison, does anyone actually object to Moony killing people?

Some random person she meets is pro murder,

Some other random person she meets is pro vigilante murder.

The comic is pretty pro it. Allison is against it because she fears eventually Moonshadow will get someone innocent (she doesn't regard herself or flame boy as innocent presumably) not because she's against killing rapists.

  I mean, first you're saying the comic is a thin political treatise because it strawmans and villainizes opposing viewpoints instead of meaningfully engaging with them, and now you're suggesting that it's a thin political treatise because Moonshadow wasn't portrayed as a mustache-twirling psychopath and was allowed to have some impact on Alison's perspective despite Alison rejecting her methods. Do you want the comic to explore different viewpoints or not?

The overton window of the comic is allowing of vigilante killing rapists, khan members, and Ayn Rand readers, and starting a woman's shelter. The perspective of viewpoints is fairly narrow. Rationality tends to mean a slightly wider viewpoint and less murderous rage to people who politically disagree with you but aren't doing much.

I mean, of course a murderous feminist is gonna be portrayed well. They are a feminist, so they do things good, even if they may be seen as misguided.

  Again, she literally calls herself out on this later. She asks herself why she just made a half-assed "sterile appeal to heroism" and then went straight to violence instead of exploring any of the countless other options, and the answer is that she isn't good at any of the other options--diplomacy, bartering, manipulation, etc--because her powers mean she's never had to be.

Sure, so she's below the level 1 intelligence of a random person on the street.

  No, step one towards a more intelligent Thorin is just to have Thorin behave like there is a person inside him figuring out the best thing to do, like you or I would in his shoes, as opposed to an H-Zombie who throws down the key in order to provide Bilbo with a Dramatic Moment.

She has an H zombie who throws down the key to provide her with dramatic moments. She doesn't have the basic intellect to work towards her chosen goals, she has emotions that dictate her actions.
