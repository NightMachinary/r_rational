SFP was a rather well written story that possessed a great deal of character development. It ends (not heavy spoilers) on a cliffhanger, but cleans up a number of plot hooks that mean it's still satisfying to read, regardless. I enjoyed it and I would recommend it to others. The quality of the art and everything improves, as is normal for a small team of artists I think. So, go read it :p
