  It's been awhile, but I recall it at least being heavily implied that both sides - "superheroes" and "supervillains" - were manipulated into those roles

I'm going to stop you right there. This isn't a rational world, it's a justification for super heroes to have existed/continue to exist. And as we agree, that's silly.

It's a handwave, and sure, to justify the story, but it makes it non-rational as a default.

  Again, if I recall correctly, she was both convinced that he was working towards a good cause

He killed people - [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sfp-4-30-for-web.png]]

Are you for real? 'He presented arguments'. What argument is there to present with 'I'm trying to take over the government in a coup, people died, but it was all in a good cause' makes sense?

Super god is enabling terrorism. Osama, Hitler, Franco, Pol Pot presented their arguments about doing evil for 'the greater good'. Would you accept her somehow believing the holocaust was okay under those circumstances?

Which is why we have laws and courts and all that silly stuff like 'due process' and 'not being emotional, but reasonable in the approach to the rule of law' that superheros skew.

Lionizing the super god. As you'll see, the pattern is that super god will defend anyone she thinks is doing good, like the one who 'kills rapists'.

  It's interesting that you linked the image and not the page. This occurs four pages earlier, in which a member of the group she later threatens has murdered several doctors, and attempts to murder a friend of Allison's.

It's one of the many instances of super god being treated in the right. What did the cop do? Oh right, she is above him, her being angry justifies resisting arrest.

Nevermind that psycho super god is a psycho waiting to happen.

But hey, she puts these fantasies to practice.

Here, linked the page. While you're (in most jurisdictions) allowed to use violence in defending others, this is a classic case of excess of self defense.

[[https://www.stacklaw.com.au/news/criminal-law/excessive-self-defence-and-use-of-force-to-protect-yourself-against-an-intruder/]]

Section 418 of the NSW Crimes Act 1900 states that a person is not criminally responsible for conduct which they believe is necessary to defend themselves, another person or property, provided that their actions are a reasonable response to the circumstances as they perceive them.

Her strangling out the dude for no reason other than having 'suspicions' - later confirmed, because this is a political tract, is a crime.

And don't get me started on the one who kills rapists. That is a whole can of worms on jerking off extrajudicial murders - and tossing aside pesky concepts such as 'due process' in the meantime.

Long story short, another super kills 'rapists', well, alleged ones and judges, because who needs a criminal system, right, and in the end, super god feels bad because she had to stop this series of killings.

Here is super god defending the actions of the killer. Because you see, she is above humanity, above laws and reasonable doubt.

Our hero, ladies and gents.

Here, a picture from Miracleman. While in this comic - written by a /good/ writer, this behavior is a demonstration of how inhuman (even if you consider benevolent) a super god would actually be.

Making a parallel with the picture I linked originally, the one with the cop, here is how Miracleman frames a similar situation - [[http://trabalhosujo.com.br/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/miracleman-thatcher-594x895.jpg]]

Then he proceeds to actually change the world in interesting ways, but enough about Moore.
