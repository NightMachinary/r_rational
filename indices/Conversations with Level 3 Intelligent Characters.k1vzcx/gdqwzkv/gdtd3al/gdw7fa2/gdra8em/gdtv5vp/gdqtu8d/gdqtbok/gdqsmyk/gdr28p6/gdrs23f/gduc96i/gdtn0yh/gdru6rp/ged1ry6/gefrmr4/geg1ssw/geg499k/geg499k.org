She does often resort to violence reflexively, and this is a facet of her relationship to violence that she introspects about all the time. It's a character flaw, and one that does not go unchallenged either by the story or by the character herself. In the moment, while reacting emotionally, is exactly when I'd /most/ expect a character who otherwise tries to overcome a known personality flaw to instead screw up and manifest it.

Re: politics, it kind of sounds like you're strawmanning how the comic depicts people and ideas because you disagree with its left-wing bent. It's absolutely a left-wing comic, but at no point does it make an argument like "Christians are wrong because they flamethrower organ donors." A religiously motivated terrorist exists in the comic and flamethrowers an organ donor, which is not equivalent to the comic presenting a political argument that Christians in general do this, or that the inevitable conclusion of Christian values is the flamethrowering of organ donors. The protesters and terrorist in that scene are a clear parallel to the actual anti-abortion protesters and terrorists that exist in our world; obviously the real-life existence of such people is not an argument by the universe that all Christians are like that.

The story function of that scene is to create dramatic conflict and to put Alison in a situation where she reacts in an impulsively and excessively violent way and doesn't face any real consequences for it, all of which is important for her/the comic's later interrogation of her relationship to violence and the absence of an external force that can constrain/punish her actions. Reading it as a political argument that gay people are good and Christians are bad is reductive and misses the point. (In particular, the idea that Feral's arc is just about showing that gay people are capable of compassion and sacrifice is like...I mean, I think the creators must reasonably assume that anyone who's still reading the comic at that point is /already/ on board with the concept that gay people are human.)

Whether the Valkyrie Project (again, not a women's shelter, it's [[https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-5/page-165/][a network to help connect superpowered individuals with women at risk of domestic violence/sexual assault and coordinate their efforts]]) represents systemic change...I do think it's a step in that direction, as proof-of-concept for ways of coordinating superheroic efforts that aren't "team of people who go out and punch giant robots." I agree it's not the maximally effective or radical thing Alison could be doing with her time. But a rational story does not have to be one where the main character does only rational things. This is a story about Alison's growth re: figuring out what her values should be and how best to put them into practice, which means she can't /start out/ as a perfect utility optimizer, or jump directly to that in any one step of her moral development. She doesn't even have to ultimately achieve perfection in this regard, as long as her imperfect approach isn't represented by the narrative as being perfect.

Finally, I strongly disagree in general that the comic doesn't explore and steelman opposing ideas, with the exception of maybe ideas like "women should be threatened with violence for reporting sexual assault" or "there's nothing wrong with letting countless people die out of spite, aside from the question of whether or not it's ethical to /compel/ someone to save said people, which will be discussed at length." A huge number of pages are dedicated to debates between opposing ideas in which both or all sides are given substantial weight. This is no small thing in a webcomic format where every few lines of dialogue require hours of drawing and coloring.
