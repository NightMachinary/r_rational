  No, I mean it existing /at all/.

  Which is why I made the comparison with Miracleman - the superheroes didn't exist at all outside of a simulation.

It's been awhile, but I recall it at least being heavily implied that both sides - "superheroes" and "supervillains" - were manipulated into those roles by a group whose goal seemed to be maintaining an artificial status quo in the face of superhuman abilities.

  Who defends a costumed (lol) mind controller who is a terrorist and dates him? He did attempt a coup against the US.

Again, if I recall correctly, she was both convinced that he was working towards a good cause (i.e. against the group which was disappearing supers who could actually effect real change to the status quo), as well as being under the kind of /de facto/ mind control that would occur if someone could read your mind and tailor their arguments accordingly. It's later framed as akin to date rape, IIRC.

It's interesting that you linked the image and not the page. [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-3/page-63/][This]] occurs four pages earlier, in which a member of the group she later threatens has murdered several doctors, and attempts to murder a friend of Allison's. When she tries to get answers from that crowd, they take the side of the man who just /tried to burn down a hospital/. And then the events you show occur. Is vengeful anger a moral, rational reaction to those events? No, it isn't, and it isn't portrayed as one. Is it an understandable reaction? Absolutely.

And presenting that anger in a way that makes it more difficult to find the context of the events (by linking the image and not the webpage) makes me think that you're deliberately trying to obfuscate that context, which doesn't do much to convince me that you're arguing in good faith.
