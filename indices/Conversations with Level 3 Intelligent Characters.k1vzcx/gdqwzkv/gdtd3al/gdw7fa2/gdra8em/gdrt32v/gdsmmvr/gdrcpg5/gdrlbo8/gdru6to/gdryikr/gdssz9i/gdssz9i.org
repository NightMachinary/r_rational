Different poster, but wanted to chime in after having just read through the comic from start to finish this morning, so it's quite fresh in my mind

I think you're both right and wrong about the story's treating the powers as a "way to spice up a story that doesn't really need them", but that in and of itself feels like it's effectively the theme/point of the story. There's a background theme/subplot in the story that partially addresses some of what you're saying - the strong psychic has discovered evidence that there's a hidden group in the background that is explicitly killing anyone with powers that are applicable to truly changing the world, with the characters who seem best able to doing so either having been possibly intentionally distracted from doing so by the government superhero control program (pintsize) or having successfully hidden themselves from those programs, preventing them from acting overtly.

From a rational perspective, it also takes the premise of "give a snapshot of births superpowers and then turn off the faucet" to what seems to be a logical and internally consistent end. There's not adults with superpowers because of the premise, and a significant chunk, possibly the majority, of the kids who received them, at least in the areas shown on screen, literally became child soldiers, which is likely to pretty heavily interfere with learning things.

There is some exploration of how the powers work that happens mostly off screen, done by adult scientists, but as you already mentioned, this is largely a story about what happens if you can't find a quick "I win" button in the superpowers (possibly because /The Powers That Be/â„¢ are preventing that because they would stop being /The Powers That Be/ in that case?)

I don't at all disagree that this is also clearly a story that is pushing a specific, identifiably liberal/progressive political worldview, but I will disagree that the main character's actions are being presented as morally correct/right, since more than half of the text in the story seems to be a very literal philosophical exploration of ethics itself, in light of the in-universe reality of superpowers. I still agree that the comic is still pushing the progressive views as mostly correct largely through the characters that are presented as viewpoint characters and who gets screentime, but I think it's largely exploring the various failure modes of that ethos, just very clearly from the inside, as seen with the storyline around the non-human-looking characters, which seems to do a very good job of capturing a lot of the risks and nuance that can be lost when you try to group a large number of people with very different wants and needs together and say "we're trying to help all of you, together!"

I also strongly agree with your assessment that the story touches on "rationalist themes" in the very traditional (for this genre) sense of having a cast of characters with fairly different experiences and thought processes exploring very philosophical concepts on screen. I'd also agree that it's less typical than the ur-rationalist fiction, in that the philosophical concepts it explores are less "how to think about thinking the right away" and more "how to think about being good (and no way is the right way)"
