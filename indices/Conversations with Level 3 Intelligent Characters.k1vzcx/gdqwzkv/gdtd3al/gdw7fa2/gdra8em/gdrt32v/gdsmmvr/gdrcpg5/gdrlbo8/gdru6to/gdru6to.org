  It's explicitly about a character /rejecting/ their unique advantages and refusing to use them because they feel guilty about having them.

That isn't accurate. She didn't stop using her powers because she felt guilty about having them; she chose to retire from /traditional superheroics/ because she didn't think she was effecting meaningful change by punching things really hard. She still uses her powers and the story is about her trying to figure out /how/ to best use her powers to accomplish good, hitting various pitfalls and encountering a variety of conflicting philosophical perspectives along the way.

Regarding "dismissing organ donation"--spoilers ahead, but she ultimately doesn't convince Feral not to go through with it, it's made clear that her initial opposition is based in emotion and in an acknowledged blind spot she has re: preferring idealized "one-punch" solutions to partial-yet-significant steps forward, and she later doubles down hard on helping Feral donate organs at an even faster rate, so I don't know where you get the idea that the /comic/ is saying organ donation is a pointless or inadequate path to utility. Hell, when they get to the big moral conflict over whether it's acceptable to force people to cooperate to maximize utility, helping Feral donate more organs /is/ the utility maximization end of that equation. I feel like you're taking the main character's flawed perspective at one point in her development as the authorial voice stating what is Objectively Right, and I don't think the comic has ever framed her as a moral authority in that way.

Finally,

#+begin_quote
  the characters don't try to exploit them in any meaningful way.
#+end_quote

You yourself mentioned the organ donation thing. There are other examples too. Off the top of my head, Patrick using his mind-reading capabilities to "copy" other people's skills, languages, etc, and Alison applying Max's power to Feral's instead of making him make her even better at punching or whatever. It's true that not /every/ character tries to exploit their powers creatively, much like not every real-life person would do so if they had powers.
