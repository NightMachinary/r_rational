I really can't see SFP as rationalist fiction. The entire premise is to take the author's political biases and to raise them up as something good. Having a gay character selflessly agree to torture herself infinitely for people who hate her only for the evil conservatives to flamethrower the doctors is so blatant that I cannot overlook it. There is also a serial killer who is treated as sympathetic because she only kills rapists and the only conservative hero is, of course, a secret rapist. But that aside...

Yes, the main character ponders about how to fix the world, but cynically declaring that small scale acts of kindness are pointless if they don't fix the whole is /not/ rational. And after telling Feral that donating organs won't fix anything, what is her own solution? Setting up a woman's shelter. Yes, that's right, the optimal thing for a superhero to do in a world full of magic and super technology that could fix everything is... to set up a woman's shelter.

Not to use her fame to raise money for women's shelters, mind you. No, she has to do it personally or else it's not noble enough. She can't just tour the country and convince people to donate to effective altruism charities, no. She has to personally build up yet another woman's shelter because she is a strong female protagonist and it's part of her /identity/, gosh darnit.

Not even a shelter that allows men, in recognition of the fact that abused men receive less support. Oh no, it can't be anything that would make the reader uncomfortable. The /optimal/ thing for our heroine to do is to reinforce precisely those biases that the intended audience already has.

I read the story to completion, so it's obviously not bad. It's well written and has good art. But it's also a cautionary tale of what rational fiction should precisely not be.
