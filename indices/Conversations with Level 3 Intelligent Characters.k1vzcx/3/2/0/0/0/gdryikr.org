I'll admit it's been a while since I read it, but what does the protagonist do with her powers, then? I don't remember any analysis of the new power she gets halfway into the story, or any attempt to exploit it. She doesn't try to learn the science of it either IIRC. Superpowers are mostly treated the way zombies are treated in "pride and prejudice and zombies" - a way to spice up a story that doesn't really need them.

You're right that Feral's organ harvesting is an example of munchkining. But first of all, it's something you can come up with after 5 seconds of thinking. Secondly, I got the distinct vibe that Feral was doing it out of self-loathing and self pity. I mean... here we have a depressive and suicidal character subjecting herself to infini-torture. It just doesn't strike me as an action that's optimized for helping people. And the fact that it's a gay woman (of color?) doing it, who is then torched by evil conservatives for her trouble? Ehhhhh.... that doesn't seem like the authors were trying to teach the readers a lesson in rationality, exactly.

I get that all the introspection and dialogue makes it feel like the story might belong here, even if none of the conclusions are explicitly rational. And again, you're *definitely* right that the dilemmas are not presented as purely black and white. But it's pretty hard to not see the "our team good, people who disagree with us bad" angle of it all.

Maybe we could meet in the middle and agree that it touches on "rationalist themes"?
