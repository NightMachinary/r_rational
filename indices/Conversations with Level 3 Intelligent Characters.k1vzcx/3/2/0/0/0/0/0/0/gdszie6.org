No, the fire guy turned out not to be a rapist. At least, Moonshadow ultimately concluded he wasn't one. This was a big deal in the story because she didn't want to kill him once she had confirmed this to her satisfaction, but her actions got him killed anyway. It was a failure mode of her philosophy.

It's definitely a social justice-themed story with left-wing bent. But you mentioned it's been a while since you read it, and there's a pattern across your comments of remembering versions of plot points that are a lot less nuanced and more heavy-handedly partisan than what actually happens.
