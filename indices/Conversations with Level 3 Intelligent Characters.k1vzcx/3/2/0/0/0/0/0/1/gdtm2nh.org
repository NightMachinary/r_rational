  It's more that all the characters who disagree with the author's worldview are portrayed as completely unsympathetic.

Agreed, at least along a political axis.

  At least he was accused of it by Moonshadow

That actually seemed like one of the weaker aspects of the story to me; Moonshadow used that scene to prove that she was (in my view) unrealistically cautious about who she killed, by showing that while she suspected him off being a rapist, she actually planned to drug him with a magical truth serum to find out if he was actually a rapist or just cared about theoretically being called one enough to threaten to murder any woman reporting being raped. (I'm calling it magical here because such a thing to my knowledge doesn't exist in reality, but it was not treated as a superhero invention or even as an extraordinary thing to exist, despite being one of the more world-breaking things to exist, if true.)

His perspective did feel a bit on the nose as more of a stereotypical internet commenter, and was definitely portrayed as unsympathetic, made worse by the fact that this was being placed literally as a contrast to someone who was actually, successfully committing murder of people she suspected of being rapists.

Coming from the perspective of someone who identifies fairly strongly as a fairly far left progressive, one of the reasons that I opposed the death penalty (and punitive carceration in general) is that most evidence that I've seen shows that increased punishments, up to and including the death penalty, don't seem to be very successful at deterring unwanted behavior. As such, the perspective of the characters that essentially either endorse or at least condone Moonshadow's behavior, while presented in a very sympathetic light, come across very poorly to me.

  Rationality is all about seeking out opposing viewpoints
#+end_quote

In character, it does feel as though the main character is working her way towards this, but showing an honestly fairly realistic progression, from being very sure of her actions earlier in her life to confronting and seeking out those who disagree with her as well (and in many cases, failing to do so, but that seems to be portrayed as a character flaw, not what she should be striving for), even if she mostly confronts those challenges which are hard for her, but not necessarily (personally) for the presumed progressive reader.
