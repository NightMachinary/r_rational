I think it might be worth a reread, honestly. It does seem like you're misremembering parts of the story, both in terms of the events that happen in it and also tonally. For instance, interpreting Feral's motivation as self-punishment was plausible at one point in the comic, but it's ruled out later on when she's unreservedly thrilled about being able to help more people without having to be on the table 24/7.

I'll agree that they don't get super deep into the underlying mechanics of how superpowers work, but I also think that would be a very different story. You could certainly write a rationalist story about superpower mechanics, but this is more of a rationalist story about ethics that uses superpowers as the catalysts for moral conflict. They're certainly not just "spice;" you couldn't have the story without them, the whole point is exploring how ethics intersect with superpowers. A rational or rationalist story doesn't necessarily deep dive into everything it covers; it's okay to have areas of focus, and often that makes for better storytelling, especially in a medium like comics where a digression about how superpowers work on a quantum level could take weeks or months.

Re: Feral, I think it's worth considering whether your own politics are affecting how you interpret the story and what stands out to you. Do you think the same events would have bothered you if she were straight, and do you think you would have registered her straightness as a characteristic in its own right? Is there anything inherently irrational about a gay character doing something good? If Feral being gay is a problem because she does something profoundly heroic, is Moonshadow being Asian fine because she's a serial killer? I think it's worth being wary of the impulse to write off a scene as being wholly motivated by a political agenda just because a gay person is in it, you know?
