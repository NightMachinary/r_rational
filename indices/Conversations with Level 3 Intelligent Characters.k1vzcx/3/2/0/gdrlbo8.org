But SFP isn't bad - I liked it. It's just explicitly anti-rational. The fact that it's thoughtful and deals with issues related to rationality does not change the fact that it comes to the exact opposite conclusion.

Let's go through it point by point:

-SFP does not have characters creatively applying their knowledge and resources. It's explicitly about a character *rejecting* their unique advantages and refusing to use them because they feel guilty about having them. This is anti-rational.

-There is no satisfying intelligent solution to the problems SFP brings up. Like I said, "build a women's shelter" is not an answer to "the fundamental problems in the world." Dismissing organ donation because it doesn't solve oppression is a straight-up rejection of utilitarianism.

-The powers are treated as magical, and more importantly, the characters don't try to exploit them in any meaningful way.

SFP is a cautionary tale precisely because it *feels* rational at times, by bringing up rationalist-adjacent topics and having smart-sounding characters spend thousands of words talking about them. But optimizing to *feel* as if you're doing something is exactly what true rationality teaches us not to do. You're supposed to optimize for the real thing.
