I really don't think it makes sense to make claims about the "final conclusion" Alison comes to when the comic never actually ended. What final conclusion in line with the author's politics do you think she reached?

And she doesn't refuse to use her powers. She questions whether she /has/ used her powers in good ways. She questions whether she /can/ use her powers in good ways. She questions whether it can ever be justified to use violent means for good ends. A lot of the tension in the story is about her awareness that if she comes to a harmful conclusion about how to use her powers, that's bad for the whole world because there's no known external force that could stop her. But she doesn't "refuse to use her powers," and she doesn't give up on wanting to save the world. (I mean, take the whole Max thing--I don't know how you read that part and then conclude that this is a story about someone refusing to use her powers.)

I also want to comment on how you described the "women's shelter" thing (IIRC it was an app, but that doesn't really matter). I don't think we're meant to see the Valkyrie Project as the utility maximization endgame for Alison's powerset, but as a step forward in her philosophical development. Specifically, it's the proof-of-concept for her revelation that her frame of thinking about saving the world all by herself is fundamentally flawed, and it's smarter and more effective for many supers to work together. So "She has to personally build up yet another woman's shelter because she is a strong female protagonist and it's part of her identity" is...kind of the opposite of what happened there.
