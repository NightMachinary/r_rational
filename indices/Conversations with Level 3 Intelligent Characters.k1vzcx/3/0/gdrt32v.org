The main character doesn't have to be a perfectly rational being for the work to be rationalist. The premise of the story is that Alison is trying to figure out how to be and do good, not that she's an ethics genius who already knows how. Her points of view on morally sticky topics like Feral's organ donation are presented alongside strongly argued opposing points of view, not framed as obviously correct. She makes mistakes in her actions and reasoning and tries to learn from them. It's not irrational to write characters who are human enough to sometimes act or think irrationally.

I also think your description of the "rapist serial killer" arc is misleading. It's not framed like "oh it's totally fine because she only kills rapists." The character is depicted as someone who has built up a moral framework that she views as internally consistent and that comes from an understandable emotional place, but that is ultimately harmful and hypocritical. If she'd been written as a one-dimensional straw villain whose motives were totally unsympathetic, then she might as well just exist in a regular superhero comic instead of one whose "battles" are mostly ethics debates.
