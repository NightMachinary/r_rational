  I expect a well-written, humanized character with a core, arc-defining flaw to manifest that flaw often, especially on emotional impulse, and not to overcome it easily even with deliberate effort.
#+end_quote

Harry likewise manifests his anger and need to kill and win often in HPMOR, and he at times finds ways to lose and show weakness with emotional growth. Allison's emotional growth never actually grows into action.

"Share the body of Christ, not the body of Satan."

"Lev 18.22"

"God hates NEFs"

They are very explicitly religious and Christian.

And yeah, irl Christians have no real issues with organ donations by mutants or by people of other races. They're fleshy bags of flesh. Even fairly racist people are generally fine with getting organs from races they dislike. This is a made up issue made because the author doesn't really understand Christians.

  but have you considered that there's a whole arc in the comic about Alison trying stop a feminist from murdering people because of her (particular brand of) feminism?
#+end_quote

Yes, this is very common of political stories like this. The idea is that all left wing people are reasonable and fair, and this feminist is indeed shown as very reasonable and sympathetic and collected and proper.

She is indeed sympathetic to Moonshadow [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-5/page-157/]]

Even after Moonshadow killed a random guy who was escorting a drunk girl home.

[[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-5/page-78-2/]]

She is still seen as pretty sympathetic.

It's a very weak political comic. It would be a lot more fun if it went to either extreme- either she used force to bully everyone into compliance, or she learns that the world is a more complex place than she thought and re-evaluates, but no one really confronts her enough to force her into one stance or another.

[[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-5/page-31-4/]]

They even admit that the issue of due process is a big one, but don't really analyze much the fact that Moonshadow is an absolute psycho who executes people for thought crimes.

[[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-5/page-149/]]

Allison doesn't even note that, yes, an innocent person did get executed by Moon, Moon executed a guy who was escorting a girl home who Allison suspected of wanting to rape her, but never actually confirmed that was his intention.

  The reality is that she started allowing herself to do good in smaller ways with the potential to build to something greater, while also taking the opportunity to make a huge systemic change when one finally did come along (the Max thing).
#+end_quote

Did she actually express that as her philosophy? Because doing what felt good in the now was never something she was against.

Ethical debates aren't completely connected to rationality anyway. Allison has a sort of alien morality that is disconnected from what intelligent people think, and often isn't quite up to a level 1 intelligent character.

Like sure, you can debate over compelling moral action or not, but Allison doesn't consider what normal people do, pay people for action. He asked to be a superhero with real powers, she just ignored that despite having several mecha suit making super genius friends. Normal people refuse the false choice between violence and inaction, and pay people for their services.

She doesn't have any plan to actually do systematic change, so it's not a great debate.

Moonshadow executes people for thought crimes, which kinda undercuts the vigilante execution line since it's ignored.

Anyway, the story flips between being a 0 intelligence story and 1, and isn't that rational.
