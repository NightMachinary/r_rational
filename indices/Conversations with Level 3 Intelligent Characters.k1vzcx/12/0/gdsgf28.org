... Is basically the entire point of SFP.

The story revolves around a character who realizes that punching super-powered criminals is not making the world safer, who instead decides that she would contribute more to society as a firefighter, and who decides to use her gifts in a more constructive way (while getting an education to try to find an even more constructive way to benefit society).

All of the costumed heroics done by the protagonist are shown in flashback, for the very reason that the protagonist no longer does them.
