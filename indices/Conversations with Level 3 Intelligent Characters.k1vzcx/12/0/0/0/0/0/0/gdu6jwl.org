i really really like strong female protagonist. it has an interesting world, excellent art, and engaging characters. however, it is not rationalist. it's not realistic, even. any story where "traditional" super-heroics is presented as a possible development for civilisation to take upon superpowers manifesting randomly among the population immediately places itself on the softer side of fiction in terms of realism, even if it attempts to examine itself using more "mature" ethics. i also found the story's explanation of how status-quo altering superpowers were suppressed extremely hand-wavey.
