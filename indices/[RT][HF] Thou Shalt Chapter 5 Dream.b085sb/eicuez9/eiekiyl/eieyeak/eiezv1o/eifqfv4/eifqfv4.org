There wasn't any real narrative danger. Neither Learn nor Celeste was in any real danger of dying after being introduced so early and the rest are just named goons to me until I get to know them better. There's going to be stakes involved when Learn tries to get to that school of learning since we know that it's basically his dream and we know that there's a very real chance that he will be denied that.
