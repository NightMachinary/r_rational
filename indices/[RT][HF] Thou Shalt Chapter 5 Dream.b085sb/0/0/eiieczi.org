I appreciate the constant feedback, Sonder! It's really helpful, and good motivation to keep writing and getting better.

I started this project to work on my writing chops, but it's become a whole world to me. I'm hoping to get to a point where I can successfully share that with all of you in a compelling fashion, and the comments and critiques are all incredibly helpful for that goal.
