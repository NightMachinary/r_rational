The could have united as 6 to take down the bad, but the story wouldn't be as big of a boost to them. Instead they fit into he narrative groove of 5 heroes to give themselves an edge. It's this blatant abuse of story tropes that I'm talking about. All the big Named seem to know stories intimately, they consciously change the things they do, say, and think just to get a narrator edge. After a while, this act in of itself because a groove in creation. The Named trying to manipulate the system. My question, is why, after thousands of years of this happening, hasn't this turned into its own meta narrative yet?
