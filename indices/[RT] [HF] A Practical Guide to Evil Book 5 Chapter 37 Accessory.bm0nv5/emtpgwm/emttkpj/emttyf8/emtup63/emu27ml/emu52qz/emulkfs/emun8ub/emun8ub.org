Interesting point on the action vs intent.

I think the Rule of Three specifically relies on action over intent to work---after all, Pilgrim's whole plan on defeating Catherine relied on him initially "losing" by relinquishing Black's soul. But if that was the key to long-term victory, wouldn't that nullify the whole ordeal by not being a loss for him?
