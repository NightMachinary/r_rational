I don't think everyone with a Name is intimate with stories, just a few of our primary view points, Cat, Amadeus, Neshamah, Grey Pilgrim, Bard, to a lesser extent Malicia. Looking at the various PoV [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/extra-chapters/][here]], no one really thinks in story beats nearly as much as Cat does. Akua and Hakram comment several times on Cats intuition in that regard being remarkable.
