But why would you lose a friend if you shared it? How is it different from sharing coin (or food or other coin-bought resources under 'coin'), in that if they drink too much and you have to pay for more? (Or is it to do with getting into fights when drinking together, in that in Nicae people tend to turn belligerent rather than more-friendly when drunk, or that everyone keeps friendship-destroying secrets from each other which they might let slip if drunk..?)
