This is off topic, but it seems everyone with a name is intimate with stories in general. So intimate that they know how to rig the game in their favor based on common story tropes. If this is the case, and assuming this has been the case if we look at how long the Dead King has been playing the game, wouldn't there be a Name out there trying to actively prevent Named from creating artificial stories?

Is this what the Bard's purpose is?
