This makes my head hurt.

I think that, essentially, you can't make a "meta-story" groove because by acting in a specific way, you are enforcing the existing story groove. Choosing five people because the elevator only fits five has the same impact as choosing five people because the sixth would be a narrative hindrance. At the end of the day, you're still choosing a band of five, and that reinforces the trope which makes it so powerful.
