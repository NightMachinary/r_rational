I'm loving this conversation BTW.

I guess it comes down to Akua's dilemma. Action vs. Intent. Is the action of banding into a group of 5 against a greater evil considered enough? Or is the intent more important. The fact that they truly are putting aside their differences to seek a common goal, and internally, their intent is to work together to take the for down.

Based on what we've seen so far, actions themselves seem to hold more weight. If intent was greater, I'd imagine the Pilgrim would have failed long ago. For his whole scheme was born out of letting thousands die at her hand so he could place the final blows. Not a very heroic thing to do and doesn't seem to hold Narrative weight itself as he was working toward the rule of three.

In this case, there seem to have action and intent on their side, but I'm curious if the Narrative will ever catch on and make a name tied to stopping those cheating the system, like an Intercessor perhaps.
