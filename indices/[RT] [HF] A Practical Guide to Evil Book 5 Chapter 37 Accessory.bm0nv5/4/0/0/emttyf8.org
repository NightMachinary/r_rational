I'd use your example actually. A trope is the heroic band of 5 taking down an evil villain. This is obviously no group of heroes. There are some heroes in the group, but they consciously fit themselves into the trope. quite obviously I might add. Now Cat's already getting a boon from Creation for having done so.

If there were this many heroes and villains all fake-playing the game, why wouldn't Creation catch on and create a new story about people trying to game the story system?
