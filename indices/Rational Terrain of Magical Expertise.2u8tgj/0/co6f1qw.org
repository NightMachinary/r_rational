You know... virtual reality always seems to have way too much brain access in fiction. In various series whatever VR tech they use seems to be able to cause real pain, kill you in real life, control your personality... I know that if i wanted to play one of these games I sure as hell wouldn't be using the official tech (Which probably already comes with some sketchy matrix brain plug), I'd be wiring an oculus rift and a joystick to interface with the game or something.

Then again... What if the virus can do what it does with just a video and audio feed? Maybe it works through some sort of subliminal messaging.
