I came up with two different ideas for how the forbidden power(s) could work and not sure which one to pick or if it might be possible to combine them.

Idea 1: There are TWO forbidden powers: One that messes with the information feed from your brain to the game (in game actions, like not being in control of your own virtual body), and another that messes with the information feed from the game to your brain (sensory). If someone's virtual interface gets infected with both forbidden powers, then their connection to the game is completely disrupted. They will still be conscious, though. However, they will be trapped in the virtual machine since they are unable to log out or quit the program, and if the virtual machine is still filtering out real sensory information. This could cause total sensory deprivation.

Idea 2: It's called the forbidden power because the forbidden power glitch involves the game sometimes having trouble correctly identifying an infected character model. This can give them access to abilities that they aren't supposed to have access to. Think of it like the move “metronome” in pokemon, but in real time in a game where players normally have complete control over their virtual bodies.

Ideally I'd like to combine these two ideas, but I'm not sure how. In the original story the forbidden power wasn't actually a character ability, but a semi-sentient computer virus that temporarily possesses a player's mind through their infected character model (which begs the question of why it's even called the forbidden power). (IMO) the forbidden power was very obviously inspired by the glitch pokemon Missingno from the pokemon videogames, and the most likely theory (that I know of) behind the glitch pokemon's existence can be found here:

I would love to hear your suggestions. Thanks!
