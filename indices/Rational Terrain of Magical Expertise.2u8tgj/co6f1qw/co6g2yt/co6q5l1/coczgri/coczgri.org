  Maybe I should make it so that players are trapped in the game like in Swort Art online?

I really like SAO's depiction of this.

The people aren't, in principle, "trapped" in the game. They're using the official tech almost exactly as it was meant to be used. Their motorics are simply shut off while they're playing, similar to how dreaming works. Normally you're supposed to be able to log out, but as part of their social experiment, that function is disabled. (This is super illegal, probably.) You could still just take their headsets off, but the guy who built them added a boobytrap in the design.

To clarify: you're not "in" the game in the sense that your body is abandoned, it's just that being forcibly logged out kills you as a deliberate design choice by the person who set up the scenario. You can still starve to death IRL; the scenario relies on society not just letting the players die.
