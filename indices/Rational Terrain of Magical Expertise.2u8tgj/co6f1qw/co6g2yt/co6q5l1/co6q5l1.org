If that's the case, how do players log in and log off? And how would such a secret possibly be kept hidden from the public, when the alternative is using something less invasive like the occulus rift? People would wonder why they weren't using something like occulus rift, right? Maybe I should make it so that players are trapped in the game like in Swort Art online? That way the secret being let out wouldn't be enough to shut the game down right away. But then that begs the question of why people plugged themselves in in the first place? Maybe because either A) people were dying and wanted to live on in the game, or B) they wanted to spend time with someone they cared about who was living in the game, or C) because of A and B the trend catches on and people go there all the time to hang out and enjoy themselves. Not sure if I like that explanation though. Although if the players become trapped in the game together, that might explain how the main characters become such close friends.

Something that I wondered was why in the original TOME, Alpha kept logging back in even though his character model was infected with the evil virus. He should have just stopped playing, since it was technically his character model and not him that was infected. If he logged off and didn't come back online, he would have been fine and the virus would not have been able to follow him. If the virus DID infect his actual mind, he should have stayed in the game so as not to let the evil virus loose into the real world.
