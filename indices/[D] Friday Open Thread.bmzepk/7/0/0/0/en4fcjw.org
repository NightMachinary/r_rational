Eh. I'd rather you not, but US politics has proven itself to be the worst, quickly devolving into the sort of partisan conversations that you could find in thousands of other places on the internet. Worse, before the rule was implemented we had people with no actual interest in the subreddit coming here just to argue politics, and I would just ban those people, but they're hard to root out. I think that "heat not light" thing is especially going to be the case as the election season ramps up.

I've never seen that for any other country, but the sub has grown quite a bit, and it's /possible/ that two people will get into an unproductive, partisan discussion about what's going on in French politics, at which point I would probably step in and remind people not to be turds. It if happened a lot, then I would just ban politics in general.
