Bring a good book. On paper, not electronically, so you can read it on the plane while your electronic devices are all switched off.

If you're looking for something new, I can strongly recommend the Chanur series by C.J. Cherryh (if you haven't read it yet) - though note that it /does/ need to be read in order.
