Two huge QoL items:

Soft earplugs - makes sleeping in the plane reasonable instead of miserable from sudden noises and talking, improves reading ability and enjoyment when people are talking around you, and might help you sleep wherever you're staying once you get there. They're tiny and cheap, bring a few.

A firm neck pillow - get a wrap around neck pillow that is as firm as possible and ideally can button or zip in the front. Having something that lets you rest your head on your shoulder comfortably makes sleeping while sitting up infinitely better. Just don't get suckered by really soft ones, it's not a real pillow it needs to hold your head off your shoulder comfortably.

Also bring and wear layers of clothes so you can shed or add them to your comfort. Planes tend to be cool.

Best of luck in a new country! I've never heard of melatonin being a prescription drug, you might be able to find supplements that naturally boost it. Tart cherry juice for example?

Also if you want to jump right into the local time and avoid jetlag I find doing a 1 day fast works well. You will be sleepy initially, then a boost of energy for about 12 hours, and finally you will get very sleepy. Get up the next day, eat a big breakfast, and you'll be well on your way adjusted to the local time if that's an issue for you.
