Well, the new Ted Chiang collection is pre-ordered on my Kindle, so I think I will probably re-read some of that. Otherwise I have some of my favourite fanfictions on there, The Martian which is always good to inhale in a couple of hours, all of Animorphs, and a bunch of books I haven't read yet. So I should hopefully manage!

Also thinking of putting some TV series on my laptop for some quality bingeing time.
