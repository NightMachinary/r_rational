I'm moving to another country for six months!

Anyone have advice for what I absolutely must do/bring/buy to make my 21 hours of travel (6 hour flight, 2 hour layover, 13 hour flight) bearable?

(Unfortunately melatonin is only available by prescription here and is very expensive. I'm considering buying over the counter sleeping tablets to help me sleep on the plane but am worried about being too groggy during the layover and when I land and have to clear customs.)

Anyone have advice on what I should/shouldn't pack?

I'm packing clothes (selected carefully to all match and be appropriate for anything from lounging around the house to a job interview), a laptop (to be my computer over there) + mouse, phone, kindle, travel adapters, a phone power bank, chargers for everything, a SIM card that works internationally, personal hygiene items (toothbrush/menstrual cup/etc), glasses (normal/spare/sunglasses). And lots of snacks for the plane.

It's interesting as it's much less stress to pack for this move than it is for a shorter holiday as I can't carry my entire life in 25kg so I'm going to need to acquire stuff over there (renting a furnished room should hopefully mean I get linens but buying cheap linens and towels is far from a prohibitive expense for me...)
