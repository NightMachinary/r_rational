That's fair and reasonable.

I imagine it likely has to do with a lot of people present here being from the US. Speaking as an outsider, I /could/ talk about my local politics but I very much doubt that anyone here would be particularly interested. So, even though it's not forbidden, there's really no particular incentive for me to go to the effort of doing so.
