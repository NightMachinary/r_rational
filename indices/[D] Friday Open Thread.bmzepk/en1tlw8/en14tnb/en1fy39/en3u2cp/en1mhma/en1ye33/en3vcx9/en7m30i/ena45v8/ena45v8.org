I haven't read that FM and was about to badmouth it, I expected it to be like recommending the Ranger Handbook for someone asking about infantry tactics. I'm actually amazed by how readable it is in comparison to other doctrine, thanks for pointing it out!

I'd also recommend an emergency medical guide, but you might have to go civilian to find one useful without gear, training, or support. The "Austere Emergency Medical Support Field Guide" by USA Homeland security is the best one I know of but requests EMR, EMT, ALS, and wilderness training for all levels. It's also the most useful with gear. Maybe there's a civilian prepper/apocalypse guide that assumes no gear or prior knowledge?
