Making this up on the spot:

1. A synonym for sex.
2. One or more perceptions, usually associated with the former. (A belief about one's self.)**
3. A cluster of (a variety of) characteristics which (it has been claimed) are associated**** with (either of) the former.
4. Associated: gender roles, ideas about what people "should" do based on (1 or 2).
5. Related: See stereotypes relating to genders, esp. professional.
6. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender][A grammatical category]]. In english, may affect three forms associated with referencing (an individual)... (Surprisingly complicated. I think "he" used to be used as neutral, but now "they" may be preferred. (Why people can't agree on one standard, english has been in use for centuries, and "they" has always been unambiguous*.))

*Or at least, unambiguously /ambiguous/.

**Poor definition, my apologies. This distinction is "relatively recent" (with the caveat that everything old may be new again).

****Or correlated. The relationship between these is also a topic, and both may be flame material on the internet.
