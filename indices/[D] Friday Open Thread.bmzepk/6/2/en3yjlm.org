Gender role is anything that affects someone's /perception/ of themselves in a way that relates to sex or relationships. Sexual characteristic is anything that is /physical or biological/ that relates to sex or relationships.

This often serves as the foundation for one's identity and relationship to society as people mature and grow up.

Yes, if there is someone who grows up isolated from society or any interaction with another person, I would argue that the individual in question would not have a gender of any sort (biological sex is another thing entirely).
