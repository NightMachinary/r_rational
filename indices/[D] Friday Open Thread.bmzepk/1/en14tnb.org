I've recently been binging through a bunch of videos [[https://www.youtube.com/user/jonbois/videos][by sportswriter Jon Bois]], though I'm not really about sports so much. He's a good storyteller with a focus on analytics that I really appreciate. There's a focus on outliers and statistical oddities that I find compelling. (A lot of SB Nation's stuff is really good for people who aren't into sports, and I've been steadily adding things to my various idea boards for stories that are in their planning stages.)
