OK based entirely on your recommendation I went shopping yesterday and picked up earplugs (easy), and went looking at neck pillows. I found some pretty firm looking memory foam ones for $15 and was like "this isn't too bad" when I tried them.

Then I went to a department store. I saw they had the $15 ones but they also had [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Go-Travel-Ultimate-Memory-Pillow/dp/B01G8IHX7A][this monstrosity]] for $55. I laughed and was like "There's no way this is three times better than the other ones" and I attached it to my head and..... it was like a flight of angels came in and started supporting my head from all directions, gently carressing me with their feathery wings.

OK, maybe not quite that good, but it was like night and day. And I figure it's either a worthy investment if it's excellent, and if it's shit it's proof for the rest of my life that neck pillows aren't something I benefit from investing in. I also grabbed a new sleep mask as there was a 20% off when buying two or more products from the line and I don't have a sleep mask with cavities for the eyes (I use sleep masks all the time at home but when I wake up there's been pressure on my eyes all night so my vision is blurry for 5-10 minutes which I can't imagine is healthy?).

I just wanted to let you know that your advice was listened to and will either be responsible for me having a much more pleasant flight or will be the annoying thing I have to cart all around my travels and regret buying :P

My experience with jetlag is if I'm in the sun I don't feel tired, but if I'm indoors I do, so I'm not too worried.

I arrive about 7am local time so my plan is to get an uber, put all my crap in an airbnb, and then just walk around / sit in parks / dining al fresco / etc enjoying the sunshine until about 5pm or 6pm, scarf something quick for dinner and then go back to my airbnb and sleep for ~10-12 hours, wake up at 4am, and then (hopefully!) be all reset - I tend to go to naturally be a morning lark so it should work out (fingers crossed).
