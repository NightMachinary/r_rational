Yo MagicWeasel! All the best for the journey! Did you get a good layover airport?

For flight: your own comfortable headphones! You have the glorious option to spam movies the entire flight, makes subjective time in flight very short, and the crappy free ones will hurt after 10 minutes.

And electronic devices can nowadays be used during the flight, just not landing, so don't worry too much about paper books. That includes the laptop for example, so download offline DCSS ;-)

Pack a warm jacket. At night the airplane gets real cold and the thin blankets don't cut it. I run pretty cold, so YMMV, but I was SO happy about my big fleece jacket. A hood also gets you a bit of placebo privacy from your seat neighbours. In addition to RetardedWabbit earplugs, bring a mask/shawl to get darkness when you want it.

Depending on your dietary preferences, snack selection: I had it happen to me on the long flight NZ->germany that there were no vegetarian options left, so if you are strict pack a bit more.

Otherwise the travellers credo: pack light and carry a credit card.

And hit me up for your Berlin weekend!
