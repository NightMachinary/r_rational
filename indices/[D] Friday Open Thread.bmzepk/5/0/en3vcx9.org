The US Army Survival Manual, or similar book that provides information on how to not die under such circumstances, is not a bad candidate for inclusion on Earth or Earthlike worlds - as a castaway survival would be of very high utility and there's an awful lot of ways to die stupidly by yourself. If you're going to be 'shipwrecked' to a populated area with other people around then of course this isn't so relevant.
