In today's era you can have the entirety of Wikipedia on a flashdrive, an ebook reader, and direct device solar panels if you wanted to. I don't think this would be more immediately useful than a guide, but it would be entertaining for someone to be trying to reverse engineer and implement survival techniques from this. It could also help you ID literally every organism you see, since it contains scientific species standards and pictures.
