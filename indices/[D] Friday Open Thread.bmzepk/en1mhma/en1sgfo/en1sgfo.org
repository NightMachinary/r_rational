Where are you coming from?

Besides the obvious touristy favourites, if you want to know what's going I recommend checking [[/r/Torontoevents]], checking out the stickied post on [[/r/toronto][r/toronto]](which is affliated with an app, exploreTO), and maybe checking [[https://www.blogto.com/events/]].

It's a shame you're not here this weekend. The [[http://www2.torontocomics.com/][Toronto Comic Arts Festival]] is happening Saturday and Sunday, probably my single favourite weekend every year. It's a free festival hosted at a huge public library, and unlike most other festivals/conventions it's actually about comics, mostly indie comics, and not superheros and video games and cosplay and merch/souvenirs. Artists and writers come from all over the world for it, and there are a bunch of workshops, panels and lectures on cool, niche topics, ranging in tone from casual to academic.
