If one survived a shipwreck and could theoretically have any reference pages, what would be the most useful? Example: take the dinotopia universe, if you were shipwrecked and could wash up with references (they are water damaged so you have to rewrite/redraw) what would they be? Periodic table, specific statistic or math charts, simplified diagrams/blueprints, whatever.

For those unfamiliar, dinotopia is by James Gurney. Sentient dinosaurs living alongside humans, preexisting society and culture.
