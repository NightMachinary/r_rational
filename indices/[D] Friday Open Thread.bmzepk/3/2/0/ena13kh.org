  your own comfortable headphones
#+end_quote

Done and done! I have bone conduction headphones and also "sleepphones" which is essentially a headband with speakers in them. Both are bluetooth though so I can't directly hook them up to the inflight system and I don't have digital or analog adapters for those. So IDK. We'll see how we go.

... I did not think of that I'm going to add that to my packing list

  Pack a warm jacket.
#+end_quote

I also run pretty cold. I've got my warm jacket in my suitcase ATM but I think I'll wear it on the plane as you're right, it's probably the way to go (plus I'll be leaving probably on a chilly enough day that it'll be useful)

  Depending on your dietary preferences, snack selection
#+end_quote

Already pre-ordered the vegan meal and triple checked but I'll probably check it another couple of times. Hopefully the airline doesn't screw up, but if they do, I'll be bringing a TON of snacks

  carry a credit card
#+end_quote

Oh right. I should tell my credit card company that I'm going away for six months!

  And hit me up for your Berlin weekend!
#+end_quote

Will do! I really should start planning that in earnest. I was originally planning a sleeper car on a train for the experience but I think I'll fly as it seems so much easier.
