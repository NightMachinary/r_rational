I believe the entire show is a metaphor for the development of humanity and the ratchet of science. With that in mind, I don't see why you couldn't make a rationalist Gurren Lagann by replacing Spiral Power with actual science and rationality. Perhaps a rationalist!Kamina and a developingscientist!Simone. A Rational Gurren Lagann, as others have said, would just be Gurren Lagann since everyone is rational for their universe (from memory).
