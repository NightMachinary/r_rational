I want to see a continuation fic. Overthrowing the anti-spirals was the easy part. Now he has to figure out how to keep the universe from collapsing into a black hole without getting rid of spiral power. A problem difficult enough for the anti-spirals to consider taking over the galaxy and then lobotomizing themselves the less scary option.

I'm not sure how you'd write that, though. It's not the sort of thing were people can understand the problem and how the solution works. Also, you as a writer would have to figure something out that the entire race of anti-spirals could not.
