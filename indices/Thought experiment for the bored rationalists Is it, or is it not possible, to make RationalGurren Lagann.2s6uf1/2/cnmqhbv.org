Well, lets take our world ("earth"). Now add a number of extra planes, that are overly power rich. Planes 1-10, each of which has a power base 1 order of magnitude more than the last. We are on plane 0

People are largely powered by "spiral energy" to keep with the theme there is a portion of our mitochondrial DNA that reaches into this first plane. Food is still neccesary to keep the portal open, but not as much as it used to.

Each plane also carries a certain mutability of the rules that goes up with the planar base power. Our brains are structured so that they broadcast out belief just a little, but far enough for it to reach our other cells. This, for any normal human, creates a small aura around them where the rules work a little more to their understanding. If an optimist and a pessimist both jump off of a 10ft wall the optimist believes he will land on his feet, the pessimist expects to sprain an ankle. Both are usually right.

The first level of this is only enough to bend rules subtly in your favor. Over time the more rational people learned that the more you know about the system, the harder it is to affect change. When handed an iron pipe and told it was a new metal that was incredibly heat resistant, it failed to heat up over an open flame compared to a control.

As the average Intelligence went up the particularly dense people were faster, stronger and more durable. The intelligent learned that larger machines could channel these effects far easier. Anyone can tell that a stick, or a sword, or a rock is simply what it is. But a hovercraft? A spaceship? These things took study to understand how it works. Time passed, and the human race became divided: those who built, and those who used.

Users were given more and more advanced technology, and put to work. Their ignorance field kept them the same. They never evolved, they never mutate, because from the womb they are molded by belief. The only thing that evolved was the ability to affect reality to a greater extent. Through their confidence, and their willingness to push limits the greater members broke to the second plane, then the third, fourth...

The buildmen evolved over a few thousand years. They changed, modded themselves. And lived a good life off the work of the usemen.

Until the humans attacked, they used their fantastic weapons and tools to fight a war. And they lost, just barely. The beastmen, with their great tools, and advanced AI locked them away. Most of their tech was large and a little unwieldy due to being built to accommodate an ever larger ignorance field. But they worked. So they kept it.
