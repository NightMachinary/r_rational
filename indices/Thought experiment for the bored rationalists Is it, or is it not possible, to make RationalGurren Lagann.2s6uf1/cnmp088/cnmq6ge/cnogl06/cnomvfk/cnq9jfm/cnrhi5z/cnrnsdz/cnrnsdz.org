Fine, let's put it another way: Spiral Energy suggests that physics has rules about complex and large-scale objects like human brains, in a way that does not obviously reduce to rules about the component parts of a brain. This, even though all the scientific knowledge we've gained since the 18th century suggests that we live in a reductionist universe. If it were confirmed, everything I thought I knew be either wrong or extremely incomplete. Better yet (or worse, depending on your perspective), the scientific method itself would be thrown into question.
