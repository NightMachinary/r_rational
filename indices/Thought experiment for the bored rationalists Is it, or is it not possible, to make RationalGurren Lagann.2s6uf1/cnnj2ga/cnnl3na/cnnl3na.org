Excuse me, I have to go to board-games night now, but in fact it should be, "/Kick your preexisting models to the curb and dissolve the impossible!/" Because there's a vast difference between:

- I don't have a model that allows for this to be possible. ("It's /impossible/ to win the AI Box game.")
- My existing models give this event such an absurdly low probability that pigs might as well fly out of my ears. ("It's /impossible/ to make a party hostess's undergarments jump a meter to the left when a switch is pulled.")
- My existing models allow me to /construct a logical contradiction/ when this event happens. ("It's /impossible/ to exceed the speed of light.")

Only the last one is an actual /impossibility/, as opposed to the first being mere ignorance and the second being a very strong /but finitely low/ improbability to which counter-evidence could someday be provided.
