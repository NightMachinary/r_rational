Also note: there's a [BST] -- brainstorming tag and a [RST] -- rational tag. While being really strict about the tags isn't required here at all, in this case those two would be quite useful to make it at-a-glance scanable what this thread is about from the title: "[BST][RST] ... Rational!Gurren Lagann" makes it really clear when you're scanning a bunch of titles in a row, as comp. to just "... Rational!Gurren Lagann".
