"Aniki, we should just run away!" Simon cried out. "That enemy mecha is massive, and we only have one little mecha that we just figured out how to power on a minute ago! That thing probably has a skilled pilot, and it's huge, and it's got an even huger club!

"And we've got what, fists? Little tiny head-sized fists? We don't even know how to close the cockpit! If we're insanely lucky, we might last five minutes by dodging the whole time, but it's useless if we can't even dent the enemy's armor. That might give some of the other villagers time to escape, but then we'll -- then we'll d-- Aniki I don't want to die!

"I don't want to die -- I don't want to -- and -- and -- and Lagann shouldn't even be able to move! Whatever happened to energy conservation, this thing violates basic physics!

"We can't fight a battle after just falling into the cockpit, that's crazy!"

"Hoy hoy hoy hoy hoy hoy hoy!!

"You're procrastinating Simon! So what if this thing violates basic thermodynamics? It can clearly move! Empirical data trumps theory.

"So throw thermodynamics to the curb and go beyond the impossible! That's how the Gurren-dan rolls!

"So what if we can't find any weapons on Lagann. That doesn't mean there aren't any! Realistically speaking, how much of Lagann's capabilities do you think we've figured out yet?"

"Ah, well we've managed to turn it on.--" Answered Simon. "And this important-looking spiral-shaped gauge is reading nearly empty."

"See?" Kamina patted Simon on the back. "We've only just scratched the surface of what the mighty Lagann is capable of! A blank map does not correspond to a blank territory Simon.

"Have you forgotten? Your empiricism shall pierce the heavens!

"So come on blood brother, let's get out there! We're gonna show that big moron the power of the Gurren-Dan!!"

(Note here how neither Simon nor Kamina are fully 'correct', but rather their two approaches form two sides of a whole that /is/. This is intentional, don't worry I'm not going beyond what's rational in-universe just because SpiralPowerDidIt.)

--------------

So, major rationality skills could be taught in the way of rational judgment superseding whatever nonsense your ancestral brain is throwing out in non-ancestrally-adapted situations, and at the same time not going overboard in one direction -- because a nonstop stream of generic mooks constantly blowing up for an hour straight isn't awesome, it's boring, so it's ineffective given Spiral Power. Which is why you have lots of attack types! And you throw your moon-sized mecha's continent-sized sunglasses at them like boomerangs! And -- yeah a rational reimagining of TTGL is definitely possible.

So rationality is definitely still important when basic physics and logic are overridden by the Power of Awesome.

--------------

Speaking of, let's not forget about Nia, pretty much the sole voice of reason in canon (not that I minded, TTGL is about crazy awesome after all): "Halt, Adine-sama! Nia Teppelin commands you!

"These people have done nothing wrong! They merely seek to live peacefully on the surface, like we do. Why won't you let them?

"Is it because they are humans, and you are Beastmen? But the Spiral King is human! I am human!

"Because the surface cannot support that high a population? Whyever not? Why must there be only one city on the whole surface of the planet?

"These people are just like we are. And yet you're repressing them -- driving them back underground -- turning just government into authoritarianism! Don't you think there's something wrong with that paradigm?"

--------------

And of course, once the Dai-Gurren-Dan really gets going "Kardashev-level civilization" is a bit of an understatement. I mean, we've got the Spiral King casually handing out immortality (eg Viral), and humanity casually relifing the who-knows-how-long-dead Spiral King after the latter had his entire core torso drilled through. And FLT, and the Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann -- I mean Kardashev-Level-Three Free Energy Generator... hell, who am I kidding, let's not forget about the universe-sized mecha whose idea of a special attack involves throwing galaxies around.

Lots of awesome transhuman-y tech to play around with,-- all based off the Power of AWESOME.

--------------

edit: I just realized, I wrote Kamina as saying "realistically speaking". That should cause some sort of paradox, culminating in a universe-breaking EXPLOSION OF AWESOME because -- Kamina saying "realistically speaking" goes beyond the impossible and throws reason to the curb.

And that's how the Dai-Gurren-dan rolls.
