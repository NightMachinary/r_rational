I had a fic idea where Lordgenome and Nia switched places with Kamina and Simon.

All know and fear the name of Lord Kamina, ruler of the Dai-Gurren Empire, a war-mongering despot who suppresses scientific development in favor of building his ideal world of conflict and manliness. Under his rule, the Dai-Gurren Empire has become a society that exalts only martial prowess and embodies the most toxic attributes of masculinity at their worst (think the spartans or mongolian hordes at their worst, combined with an unhealthy dose of misogyny), which only barely stays stable because Kamina, in a dictator's best practice, has managed to make the Beastmen his scapegoats, and is now shipping them off to underground concentration camps. Though tensions rise, the humans manage to keep society controlled by ensuring that Spiral Power is limited only to their species, denying the Beastmen the right to fight back in any way. This is the Dai-Gurren Empire's way.

But Geno, a brilliant man banished to an underground concentration camp for daring to speak aloud his dream of an scientific, peaceful society, has other plans. Armed with his forbidden research into the true nature of Spiral Power, Geno plans to unite the oppressed beastmen and overthrowing their Spiral-powered oppressors with a secret weapon of their own- a machine that he and his daughter Nia built together in secret, utilizing forbidden methods of manipulating Spiral Power with steel and wire rather than flesh and sinew- a weapon called the Lazengann!

Armed with the Lazengann, Geno eliminates the defenses of his prison camp easily, and recruits four young beastmen, forming the terrorist group TEPPELIN. Soon, TEPPELIN has become Lord Kamina's personal nightmare; led by the mysterious masked figure known only as the Spiral King, TEPPELIN begins liberating prison camps left and right.

But just as TEPPELIN's momentum seems unstoppable, Nia meets Simon, the personal ward of Lord Kamina, a kid whose test scores revealed unparalleled potential for Spiral Power. And Simon won't let TEPPELIN get their way, not when his bro is counting on him to stop the terrorists and protect the Dai-Gurren Empire...

(Yes, Geno still dies at episode 8, blasted through the chest with a spiral laser by Kittan, causing Nia to go all depressed until she manages to convince Simon to defect fully and join their side.)

So, tl;dr: it's basically Code Geass for the first season. Anyways, things after that go pretty much the same. The Anti-Spirals, this time, kept humanity confined to earth because they were afraid that mankind's drive for warfare would consume the universe in eternal war if they got the chance.

(Also, in this fic, beastmen would just be the descendants of pre-apocalypse humans who got gene-mods to look like catgirls and stuff; they're entirely capable of unlocking spiral potential, it's just that the Dai-Gurren Empire has been doing eugenics to 'keep the race pure'.)
