Well I'm mostly just going to respond to the stuff about people using ectoplasm since that's what's going to most substantially impact human civilization and what I find the most interesting by far (everything else could be removed and things would still be very interesting).\\
As a side note if you want all your creatures magic to have common origins then you should have a pretty massive number of animals which make use of strategies involving creating extremely poisonous materials and shooting projectiles since ectoplasm control makes those the easiest offensive behaviors to evolve and lots of animals would evolve to create temporary shells around themselves out of something vastly more durable than bone, chitin or keratin. Also you're probably going to need a /very/ good reason ~100% of people didn't evolve to make use of ectoplasm because it would have been invaluable in the ancestral environment.

Anyway based on your previously mentioned limits on ectoplasm (including not being able to make solid objects smaller than a micrometer or any details of a larger solid object smaller than can be seen with the naked eye) I can imagine while overall tech level might be renaissance there would be a whole lot of exceptions to that.\\
Additionally even relatively weak mages end up becoming very formidable since one of the most important limits ends up being the amount of caloric energy your body can output in a day (with most people being able to at least manage 1-2k calories), so what really matters is how much someone can binge eat and still have their body make somewhat efficient use of the energy. However given how rapidly people with say anorexia can put on weight with high calorie diets and how many calories some endurance athletes need I'd say well trained mages could probably produce at most 10k of caloric energy per day which is somewhat over 8 kilograms of TNT.

Given the above considerations high quality gunpowder (or something that works about as well) will probably exist since once a single person figures out something like this the ability to create more via ectoplasm probably spreads rapidly. Additionally a whole lot of other rare or hard to synthesize materials are probably going to abound given how much easier ectoplasm makes chemistry. One impact of this is that chemical warfare is going to become very widespread pretty quickly which basically makes any non-mages a liability as they can only hope to flee or have a mage surround them with ectoplasm to protect them (since manufacturing sealed clothing capable of protecting against extremely potent poisons is probably not possible).

Armor piercing and high energy projectiles and explosives against other mages would also be the only real game in town in terms of weapons. Since while they might not have kevlar they could easily create the strongest spider silk which is an order of magnitude stronger and could be combined with limpet teeth (which are five times stronger than even that but rigid) making melee weaponry utterly useless (since you can't create ultra-sharp blades given the limitations) as well as any weaker ammunition. However while armor is probably going to be used due to shrapnel (and to protect against bullets which have lost much of their energy due to range) the use of high power single use ectoplasm guns and ammunition will probably still render the armor ineffective against a direct hit.\\
So together you're going to have really weird looking warfare, gas attacks which devastate cities being common. Artillery and high powered firearms and explosives are going to be used however large explosives are probably going to be rare due to the difficulty required in getting enough people to work together to make the explosive and then use it before it begins disappearing.

The benefits of ectoplasm on the development on chemistry are as mentioned before likely to be substantial and food protection will necessarily be very focused on, since that in turn determines how much firepower your military has access to. Given this chemical fertilizers seems nearly inevitable to develop by this time.

You're also going to have a weird dynamic in that flying around around especially with glider is going to be pretty easy with ectoplasm control. So you're also going to have something resembling WWI levels of aviation in many regards and no real way of detecting flying enemies beyond sight. The amount of equivalent horsepower that could be generated would be low however the planes would be more like sealed ultralight gliders and wouldn't need to carry much beyond the weight of the pilot(s). As thus bombardment from directly above is likely to be tremendously common as will parachuting enemies directly into enemy cities. In fact flight is so easy with ectoplasm control that you expect it to have been something will have dealt with for millennia in all likelihood. So the effects flight is going to have really need to be considered since for one communications (and troops) are likely to travel by glider at a speed on par with many semaphores but with a great deal of obvious advantages.
