How about metal monsters that are pissed at the exploitation of their cousins? (ore)

I think sticking to biological creatures only is needlessly limiting in fantasy.

P.S. I think ectoplasm needs a shorter name. Ether, Pysche, Soulsomethingorother(soulmass? doesn't matter if it's not actually soul related, they don't know that!), but ideally no more than 2 syllables. It's going to be coming up a lot in whatever story features it, and 4 syllables is too long for it not to get annoying in my opinion.
