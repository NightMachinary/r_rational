Well, most mages hide their unused ectoplasm inside their body, since it can't be bubbled there. (Did you read the linked post at the beginning?)

But if organic matter has a presence in the other plane, why not anorganic matter. I think the other plane should be mostly void and some ectoplasm... maybe some rare monsters.

I think Fae should be kept away by iron (To keep true to the myth). Maybe they have problems with magnetic materials. So most knights and soldiers are protected and villages could have a ring/chain of iron around them. And honestly, who cares about peasants ;-) (still not sure what society should exist)
