  Yeah, but it was some time ago. I probably don't remember everything.

Well, there isn't really any other magic besides ectoplasm.* There are no healing spells or divination or buffs. Only stuff you can make with ectoplasm. Some monsters may have different powers (like fairies or dragons), which should still relate to ectoplasm somehow.

Also ectoplasm doesn't really regenerate. If you lose some, you are weaker forever. So most try to keep their ectoplasm near them, to prevent enemies from bubbling it.

*Well, you could make poison out of ectoplasm and put it on an arrow. Not sure how smart that is, if you could also just use poop or buy poison. Probably good technique against animals/some monsters or people without ectoplasm.

  (I've come across at least one story that had "cold iron" described as a mistranslation of "iron of the North" i.e. magnetised iron).

Some [[https://forum.rpg.net/archive/index.php/t-770739.html][random users in a random forum]] say [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling][Rudyard Kipling]] invented the cold iron thing and fairies. And I thought it was an old myth or something that was also mentioned there: " it might or might not have something to do with distorted re-re-re-re-tellings of some early iron age people's conflicts with more primitive, still bronze-using cultures."

Which makes the Fae's iron vulnerability less desirable for my story.

  You've got to keep them safe enough that they can grow the food your knights need.

Real knights eat only dragons :-p and can't think farther in the future than to the next battle.

  /Living/ matter. There's a difference
#+end_quote

The difference would be the steady state of biological reactions. And I don't see how that would be different from any other chemical reactions. (like rusting iron or burning wood or cooking)

We could say it is the biological electricity of the human body. But if that weak thing can stop ectoplasm, what happens if a storm cloud has lightning bolts in it.

So if I think it from the beginning to the end: ectoplasm interacts with electricity somehow. Maybe it stops someones control over it. Or throws it back in the other plane. Now fae would 'fear' magnets cause magnets produce electricity via magnetic induction (not sure about grammar) and that somehow interacts with their abilities, they either lose the ability to travel between planes or get pushed into the other plane.\\
Now if there is some electricity, like with a lighting strike, all mages near it lose their power over ectoplasm for a while. Maybe a second, maybe a minute, depending how far away they are. And mages can't use their ectoplasm if it got hit by lightning for days/weeks. But better than they get hit.

I think that could work. I just can't make a reincarnated millennial the protagonist (He would be overpowered.) Also you couldn't make electric devices with ectoplasm.

I like it, cause I chose ectoplasm as a temporary name cause I thought the magic stuff should act somehow like ghosts if unused. And it is 'proven' ghosts interact with emf sensors. ;-D

Now the only problem is how weak the electricity is, and why in the skin. I could say evolution made animals/monsters have more electricity in their bodies, since it protects from ectoplasm. But I think electricity should be in nerves and muscles. I should research that. But maybe that is why you can still use ectoplasm in somebodies body

It also could 'explain' why you could store/hide all your ectoplasm inside your body (well it is stored in the other plane and can be there compressed all you want). But the next problem is, why you can still use/control it. Maybe some ectoplasm acts like an antenna to your magnetic field and your ectoplasm interacts somehow with your magnetic field. Easier way would be, you just need to step to the side, so the ectoplasm isn't in your body anymore. Still weak explanation. Maybe the telekinesis works differently.

Well, that helped me a lot. Too sad I'm lazy and will never write a story... Maybe I make a post in [[/r/worldbuilding][r/worldbuilding]] and [[/r/magicbuilding][r/magicbuilding]]. On the weekend, maybe
