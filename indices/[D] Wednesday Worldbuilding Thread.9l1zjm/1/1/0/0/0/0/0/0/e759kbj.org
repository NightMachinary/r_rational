Or perhaps life in general has an ectoplasmic as well as a physical presence, such that fae (and magic) can't travel through /living/ skin. (Thus, any magic that needs to work inside someone needs to first cut through the skin - which would mean that a stop-the-heart death spell can be delivered via a sword or an arrow but not just tossed about willy-nilly (but a fireball can be tossed about willy-nilly because it doesn't need to work inside the skin))
