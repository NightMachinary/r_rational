  Their diet is mainly raw meat.

This is legitimately terrifying. They eat raw meat and can turn up without warning /inside your lungs?/

...yeah. Terrifying.

That, and they should find their way inside carcasses before the creature that killed that carcass gets to the inside thereof - so a hunter kills (say) a deer drags it home, and when he cuts it open a bunch of Fae fly out. This would lead to a belief that they are the spirits of dead animals, and they are treated in accordance with this belief (either honoured or squished depending on the culture).
