  Fairies can hide temporarily in the other dimension/plane. And are intelligent hand-sized insects with humanish proportions (google winged praying mantis). There are other insects that can do this.

Does this mean that they can bypass a spherical shield (ectoplasmic or not) by cutting through the other plane? Insects that are not stopped by any wall or barrier are going to keep turning up in the strangest places...
