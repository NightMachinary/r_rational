How would /you/ create a rational Avatar world? The mechanics and spirit of the bending powers is all you need to keep for this prompt (i.e. they're partly spiritual, firebending is about the concept of Fire rather than oxidisation), in as much as you need to do anything I say.

Keep the Lion Turtles? Have prehistoric cavemen like in the real world, only with bending? Etc etc.

Love to hear what you can come up with :)
