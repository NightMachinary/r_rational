Make the bending techniques secret, the same way China kept silk production and porcelain a secret for thousands of years. Have the four nations speaking different languages (or dialects) and using different writing systems to make it difficult to spread information from place to place. Use a feudal society where most people are bound to the land and their family, not free to travel elsewhere, so the spread of ideas is painfully slow, and information (like Greek fire) can be lost to time provided the secret is well-guarded.
