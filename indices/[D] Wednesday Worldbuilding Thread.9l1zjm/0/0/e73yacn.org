Bending is divided into four elements, with distinctions between benders of the same element largely being a result of training and aptitude. Bending is hereditary, but also somewhat tied to geography and spirit, meaning that two fire benders who have a child born in the Earth Kingdom and indoctrinated under Earth Kingdom cultural values will have a strong chance of their child expressing as an earth-bender. (We can think of the hereditary aspect as simply allowing a binding site for the element, with some kind of spiritual "Sorting Hat" element that takes into account expected personality, cultural background, parentage, and geography. It would allow benders who are 'against type', but they would be rare, and some people who have the binding site get a null binding, meaning that they're non-benders.) Most fire benders are aggressive not because that's their culture, but because those are the people who tend to get the bending power.

All the other disciplines are an outgrowth of the four elements, either being adaptations of a secondary element's style/ethos, or a deep dive into what an element conceptually is. Blood bending, energy bending, healing, vine bending, sand bending, glass bending, void bending, lightning, ice bending, metal bending, et cetera all fall under "technique" which have variable difficulty to learn, being easier if you have a good teacher and approaching nearly impossible for some if you don't have the right aptitude/training.

Practical consequences of this:

1. Benders will most likely be of a specific, pre-determined ethos. Since benders are more powerful than non-benders, they'll tend to have disproportionate power, which means that culture and society will have a pressure in that direction. If the Fire Nation ever started to shift away from the pre-defined ethos of the fire benders, there's a good chance that they would face a coup (at best, they need to accommodate the benders).
2. None of the nations can really have other benders in great quantity. There are a few strategies: hire benders from other nations, establish cultural enclaves within their own nation, or take territory from another nation and attempt to occupy it while still retaining their culture. All these come with costs and pitfalls, especially since there's a decent chance of fomenting rebellion or losing benders to emigration.
3. It's hard to hold territory outside of your own designated environs. Even if you manage to wrest control from another nation, you're never going to get the kind of homogenity that you want, and you'll /still/ get benders who are ideologically opposed being born there, albeit without much in the way of training.
4. Since fire bending polities can absorb other fire bending polities with relative ease, the result /should/ be that all the fire benders will eventually become unified, assuming that the civic technology exists to make that happen. Same goes for the other nations, except perhaps in the case that there's a large geographic separation.

I don't really think there's /that/ much that needs to be rationalized in the series/setting; it's relatively well thought through.
