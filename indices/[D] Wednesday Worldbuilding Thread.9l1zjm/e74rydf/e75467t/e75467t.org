There is a simple magical means to protect against attack. It stops any object of sufficiently small volume that is going to strike the warded person.

Now, the power requirements with volume go up exponentially. So, it stops a bullet easily; an arrow if you've got a really expensive charm, and a greatsword never...

Or perhaps, instead of the volume of the missile, it's keyed off the distance to the enemy, so the closer you are the less effective it is. Something along those lines.
