If you think about it from then point of view of economics, it basically comes down to demand and supply, so if there are guns and nobody is using them, that means that there is no demand for it so no one wants to invest in it and those that did (inventor?) couldn't make money off of it. So why is there no demand for guns? Is there a substitute item that is maybe cheaper or better than guns in which case the guns just can't compete. Maybe magical bows and arrows, magical swords,magic spells like fireballs can all outclass guns. Or something that makes guns obsolete, plasma guns are most likely superior to guns with bullets, so if they have the plasma equivalent of magic spells, why do they need an inferior weapon. Or what if the forcefield is especially strong against physical objects.
