In a fantasy world where the technology is at about the renaissance level from us and (10% of the) people can summon temporarily material from (ectoplasm from) a different dimension/plane [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9g25b6/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/e619qk1/][(with some limitations detailed here)]] and telekinetically move the summoned stuff. (Personally I want the power difference from magician to warrior be like tank to soldier)

What monsters could there be? And what powers do they have?

They should have an evolutionary path and be somewhat plausible (in that world). Also if possible their powers shouldn't be too different.

For example, some dragon species can summon flames from the dimension/plane that destroys someone elses ectoplasm (material). But they aren't the big apex predators they are in other fantasy settings. They have big wings and light bodies. The biggest species should have a main body about the size of a horse (+ wings). There are cat/dog sized species used as pets (or guard dragons).\\
Pigeon sized dragons (without flames) replaced pigeons.

Fairies can hide temporarily in the other dimension/plane. And are intelligent hand-sized insects with humanish proportions (google winged praying mantis). There are other insects that can do this.

Dryads could be bears/apes that can summon plants.

Goblins are... smart lizards/salamanders/sharks (on land)\\
Also, what type of state should there be? Or you find interesting and would fit the setting? Kings/Queens and Lords/Ladies? Democracies and dictatorships? Just city states like in ancient greek? Communism? I don't plan to write about political stuff or mention it (more than once), but I dislike that all of fantasy has kingdoms as default...

Anyone has ideas how Chimeras, Manticores, Satyrs, Wolpertinger and similiar creatures could happen? I want them, but can't really find a way how to make them without saying a wizard did it. Maybe two creatures got fused using a portal in the other dimension... and somehow survived... and their genes combined (so they can have kids)... somehow... with the help of a wiz- f##k..

Anyhow I'm thankful for any input. Maybe you think they have a different technology path than us. (I just don't want too much chemistry aka explosives or steam power.) Or there should be vulcanos throwing out ectoplasm from the other plane/dimension (that vanishes before it gets back down). Or you have suggestions what the inhabitants would call the ectoplasm/material, creatures, other plane/dimension or I should call it to make clear what the ectoplasm/material does. (Cause all used terms are just placeholders for now.)

Thanks for reading, even if you don't comment :-)
