  There are no healing spells or divination or buffs.

Eh... there might not be hitpoint regenerating spells, but I'm sure that ectoplasm could be used to hold wounds closed, apply direct pressure and help set broken bones. Buffs? A suit of ectoplasmic armour makes a great defensive buff. And as for divination, well, a /camera obscura/ should be well within the projected tech level...

#+begin_quote
  Also ectoplasm doesn't really regenerate. If you lose some, you are weaker forever.
#+end_quote

Ooooh. Right. Then you do /not/ want things that go around eating the stuff.

  Some random users in a random forum say Rudyard Kipling invented the cold iron thing and fairies.
#+end_quote

Further down in the same page, another random user sources Pliny the Elder as stating the use of iron for anti-magic properties (though the link he provided doesn't work). Going from 'iron' to '/cold/ iron' may well have been Kipling, though.

  The difference would be the steady state of biological reactions. And I don't see how that would be different from any other chemical reactions. (like rusting iron or burning wood or cooking)
#+end_quote

Does your world have to follow the same rules as ours?

There is a clear difference between living matter and dead matter, in that living matter is capable of self-directed movement and of reacting in various (more or less) intelligent way to stimuli; well, animals, at least. (Perhaps plants don't have an ectoplasmic extension). What (if anything) this difference implies in ectoplasmic terms you can basically decide arbitrarily.

  So if I think it from the beginning to the end: ectoplasm interacts with electricity somehow.
#+end_quote

Now, /this/ leads in all sorts of interesting directions.

Imagine a tower - a tall tower, the tallest thing in the area. It is topped with an iron rod, and that rod is connected to half a dozen lines of iron which run all the way down to the ground. Naturally, it attracts lightning like anything. Any mages inside this tower will be completely unable to use any magic at all. So, if you need to keep one prisoner...

#+begin_quote
  But the next problem is, why you can still use/control it.
#+end_quote

Here's a thought. Your body uses a certain amount of electricity; some of it is to regulate your heartbeat. So /your/ ectoplasm is attuned to the beat of /your/ heart; exposing it to another heartbeat disperses raw ectoplasm (but not solid ectoplasm, or at least not immediately). It's not the voltage that stops it. It's the wrongness of the rhythm.

...as an extension of this, a mage whose heart stops and is re-started will lose all access to the ectoplasm he used to have (but may gain a different bunch instead, tuned to his new heartbeat)
