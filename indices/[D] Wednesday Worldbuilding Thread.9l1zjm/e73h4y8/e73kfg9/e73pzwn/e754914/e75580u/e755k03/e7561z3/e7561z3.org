They should eat normal food. Probably other insects or small rodents. Or in swarms bigger animals. Their diet is mainly raw meat. To keep some of the myths true.

I don't think anyone wants to deal with the Fae and the Fae are hard to capture.

But nice idea. Maybe someone befriended one Fae and uses it for spycraft and scouting. I don't think there should be a bunch of them spying.

Maybe some pet dragons fire would keep the fae away from human settlements.
