Inside lungs... hmm

There is a rule that ectoplasm manifest with a constant pressure. I didn't have a value yet but somewhere between 1.1 atm and 2 atm. And you need to see the space or feel it somehow.

I think lungs can't be targeted. (Also true for mages)

Maybe Fae travel makes them for the travel time very fragil. Or it isn't possible.
