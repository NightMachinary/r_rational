Depends how intelligent your Fae are. If they're human-level intelligence (even only small-child-level) or have poisonous bite or stings, then you have a creature that people do /not/ want to mess with (because they can slip in /underneath your armour/ and bite/sting/stab you).

Outdoors you'll have plenty of insects and indoors fewer - except the Fae which will be in about the same quantities either way. Also, that sealed grain silo isn't all /that/ sealed while they're around.

If they're intelligent or at least trainable, then you have potential for unstoppable spies (with perhaps a magic item for scrying on if they're only trainable).

What do they eat? If they eat ectoplasm then a swarm of them is going to really annoy a wizard (even if any individual one eats only a negligible amount), but at the same time a wizard who knows what he's doing can try to guide a swarm (e.g. towards an enemy's spell) by baiting them with his own ectoplasm, as a kind of targeted dispel.
