I wouldn't say malicious. They just get kidnapped from their home plane...

Maybe they eat ectoplasm and need to feed on the ectoplasm of wizards... or try to get back through their help...

But I don't know if I want intelligent ectoplasm.

Still maybe some ghost thingies have enough ectoplasm to become natural golems. Or slimes...

I just don't like to anthropomorph rocks... or water... or air... or fire... And those should still follow evolution (meaning there should be small and big ones and with similar different abilities). But creatures that are out of ectoplasm give dragonfire (which destroys ectoplasm) an evolutionary edge.

Still what do those things eat (where do they get their energy). Ghost can probably hount mages (and creatures using ectoplasm) and suck energy from them.

Also no clue why someone should be able to use telekinesis (on their own ectoplasm).

I would need some other things that uses telekinesis.
