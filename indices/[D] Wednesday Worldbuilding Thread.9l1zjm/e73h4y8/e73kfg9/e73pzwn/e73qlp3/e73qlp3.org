I was thinking of adding some ghost equivalent. That are to 99% in the other dimension/plane.

Also it seems I didn't make the power clear in this post. Every magician has it's own ectoplasm/material that is in the other plane/dimension. And they can summon it into their world and turning it into iron/steel/water/aluminium/earth/gases. And they can only effect their own ectoplasm via telekinesis.
