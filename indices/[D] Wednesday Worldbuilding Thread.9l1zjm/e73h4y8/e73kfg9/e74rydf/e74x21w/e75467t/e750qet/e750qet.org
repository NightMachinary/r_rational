Guns are bad if: Laws against guns (automatically a live sentence, even in selfdefense) The accuracy of guns is bad Bullets are expansive or hard to get (arrows can be used more than once) The sound brings monsters

Magic is bad: Depends on the magic system Maybe you want to save it for healing Maybe it draws monsters Maybe killing with magic is bad karma (knives are fine... cause reasons) Maybe casting takes forever Or is impossible in a brawl Maybe to expansive

Of course in JRPG I mostly use swords cause it doesn't cost anything and magic/abilities is mostly overkill for most mobs...

Btw I think most soldiers still have knives and train for hand in hand combat for just in case.

And there could be other things like force shields. Or the character can't buy guns or use (offensive) magic. So the best weapons they can use are swords and bows.

Still if you look at the stats of the weapons (see link) you will see it is rational to use other weapons.

Maybe a sword kills in one hit and a deadly gun wound still let's the opponent make one last attack...

Hard to say, choose one reason or try to not think about it and accept is as rule of cool.
