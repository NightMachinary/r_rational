Dune has a good take on the sword thing: most everyone worth assassinating has a personal shield that deflects stuff in proportion to its kinetic energy. So something moving very quickly, like a bullet, will be deflected away, but something moving slowly, like a sword or dagger, will get through the shield. It's a kind of classic sci-fi trope; Stargate SG-1 copied it, for example.

To make it to a "guns and magic" thing, the magical charm that has this effect is very easy / cheap / long-lasting to cast. Bows travel significantly slower than bullets so you can just specify a cutoff above arrow!speed but below bullet!speed.
