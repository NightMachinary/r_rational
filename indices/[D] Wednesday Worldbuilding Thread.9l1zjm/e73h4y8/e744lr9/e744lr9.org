I would lean into the whole spirit-bending as the origin of element bending.

Command of an element isn't hereditary. Typically the talent is granted by lion turtles, and an aspring bender is expected to go on a quest to find and petition a lion turtle for the power. Any given lion turtle only ever hands out one element. No one but the lion turtles know if that's because they can't grant others or if they choose not to, but it's the reason for the homogeneity of the national bending traditions as the element favored by the local lion turtles is by far the easies one for somone to learn in that region. Lion turtles will almost invariably refuse to talk to the avatar, and have never been known to grant an element to somone who already had a different element (again, no one actually knows if the can't or just don't).

​

The Avatar is their world's Prometheus. Humans claim he scammed the lion turtles into giving him multiple elements and they punished him with personal responsibility to what humans do with bending and eternal reincarnation until he achieves the Sysephean task of bringing "balance" to the world which they deliberately divided by handing out bending the way they do. The lion turtles generally refuse to comment but Wan-shi-ton's library is rumored to contain their account of the origin of the avatar (it's basically the story we saw in Korra).

​

However lion turtles aren't the only sprit benders. The avatar has learned the art a couple times and therefore it's available to any avatar via the avatar state (though mucking about with somone's soul is usually not a task for the emotionally charged midset the avatar usually uses to induce that state), and some spirits can do it as well, but they don't tend to hand out elements. There are constant rumors of human spirit benders, but they're treated with the same stigma as "witches" or otehr practitioners of irresponsibly risky arts due to how easily it is for spirit bending to go bad and how hard it is to practice to the point of mastery without leaving a trail of shattered souls behind. Allegations that they got their power form a spirit-bender instead of a lion turtle is a prejudice that benders who develop novel application for their element (lava bending, metal bending, etc.) often face. And sometimes it's true (blood bending, mr. Explosion, healing*).

​

*I'd make healing super rare because it's pretty OP, and I like the idea of one of the most objectively good novel bendings being the product of the taboo for good reasons process.
