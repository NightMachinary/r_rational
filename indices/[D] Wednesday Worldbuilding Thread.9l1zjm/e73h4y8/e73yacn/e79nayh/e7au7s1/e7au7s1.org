You can keep a lot of the same stuff. Republic City is a culturally unified city that's meant to have equal representation of benders, and it's chiefly composed of immigrants. I don't think that the show dives deeply enough into politics to get at stuff like "Fire Nation is overrepresented in the populace" or "different national ethos cause frictions", but that's good fodder for exploration of some themes, especially since they're essentially the same themes as the "bender vs non-bender" core conflict of season one (which got undercut by how they handled it and didn't have a satisfactory resolution).

If second (or third) generation immigrants are much less likely to have powers (since Republic City isn't of prototypical geography and culture is a mish-mash), then you get benders as foreigners and hardliners, which underscores and layers some of the bender/non-bender tensions, since it's not just "why should the benders have all the powers" but also this separate issue of "what do the powerless do against the powerful" and "what do you do when your ethos is disadvantaged by the facts of the world in spite of its moral correctness".

Of course, if you really wanted to, you could change the rules between series, which would have its own effects. Since bending is partly spiritual, the "who gets to bend" issue could be "solved" by the Avatar at some point, especially if they realized the systemic/political issues with what's outlined above. IIRC something like that happens in Korra anyway, with the air benders coming back.
