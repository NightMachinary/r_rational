Mostly this is inspired by the recent Avatar nitpicking thread.

Probably what I'd do as make it so everyone has the potential to learn all bending styles, they just have different levels of ability. Some people would practically be non-benders, though, they have that little ability.

I'd keep as much of the rest as I can, I like the flavour of the world.
