The past thread complained that it was weird to have a 'Fire Nation', 'Water Nation' or whatever.

I'd solve this by saying that bending-potential worked like real-world blood type. One gene gives you element-coded proteins in your blood. But you need two matching genes to control an element. Since the genes always appear on the same chromosome, this means that everyone can bend at most 1 element.

Real world blood types create the possibility of [[https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/rh-incompatibility][Rh-incompatibility]], where you get medical problems if a baby has proteins that the mother doesn't have.

People in Avatar's history wouldn't understand blood-proteins, or genetics. But they'd notice that two fire-benders would always have fire-bender kids. And they'd probably notice that two benders of different types have non-bender kids, plus a bunch of health complications.

That's enough to create some pretty strong taboos and cultural norms.
