The world is just a place created by some lion turtles to keep their pets? Cause why would spirits separate from their property/territory/home willingly?

I don't know what else to change. The hybrid animals make no sense, except if some spirit created them. But it would be a different world without them, even if they are mainly fluff.

Maybe try to get avatar powers for everyone (you like)? There should be a way. Or use light bending to gift bending powers.

Find better martial arts that can be used by all benders (like the redirecting lightning is inspired by the water tribe martial art) or is specific for the avatar.

What do you find irrational? People trusting the avatar will fix things?
