Sorry if I'm late but I wanted to just throw something in here.

So, there are these creatures whose most distinct trait is their ability to cause fear. This fear is so great that anyone who looks upon their bare visage will be completely consumed with irrational panic though afterwords they will not actually be able to describe what said creature looked like. This fear also extends to their voices, which by themselves are horrible enough to cause most creatures to vomit.

However, these creatures are of human level intelligence and are very little in number. So, how would you munchkin an ability like this one?
