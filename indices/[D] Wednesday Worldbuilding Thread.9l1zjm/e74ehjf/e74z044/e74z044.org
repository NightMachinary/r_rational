Does the irrational panic cause in some people the need to nuke the place they saw the creature?

Peaceful lives: Make a village. Stay there. Hope nobody nukes it or burnes it down out of fear.

Worlddomination: Write the leaders of a country a letter what you want them to do, else you send monsters/demons after them. Go to their office and say hi, leave a letter that says that was the only warning. You are even so nice to erase the image of the monsters from their brains. Of course depends on the reaction of the leaders and how the power effects people. (I think Trump would nuke everything

Murderhobo/live comfortable Take what you want and don't care.

Counterstrategy: Walls and earplugs. Maybe locked doors. Always have two doors, where one has to be closed.
