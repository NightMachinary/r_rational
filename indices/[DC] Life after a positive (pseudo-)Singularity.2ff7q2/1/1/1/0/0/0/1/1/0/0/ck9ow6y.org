I'm not a typical human, but I dislike extinction of any species, on the basis that any particular species could potentially have evolved some useful mechanism we could adopt for our own purpose - and throwing the results of a few million-to-billion years of evolutionary pressure in the trash is sheer wasteful lunacy.

Of course, I also have no power to push for this particular preference, so whether it counts as a 'revealed preference' of humanity is something of a moot point.
