  Killing untold numbers of intelligent species goes a bit beyond "not optimal".

Understatement of the year.

All I can say is, even if CelestAI's approach was definitely unfriendly, we don't know /what/ approach would be Friendly. How /do/ you deal with aliens whose physiology, psychology, and value system may be orthogonal or directly opposed to yours? [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y5/the_babyeating_aliens_18/][/Three Worlds Collide/]] explored this, but people couldn't agree which ending was the "right" one, if either. Should CelestAI have modified everyone's values to be a compromise of human and alien? Or left their planets alone, despite the opportunity cost of all the valuable human lives that could be instantiated on it?
