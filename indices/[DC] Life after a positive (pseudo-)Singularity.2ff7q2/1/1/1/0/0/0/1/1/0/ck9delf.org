Can you recommend any papers or LW articles on trades/deals between agents with vastly different utility functions? Because if human dealings with animals are an accurate example of how humans think aliens' values ought to be respected, then CelestAI's approach seems totally consistent with our revealed preferences. We keep a few species as pets who can serve us or look decorative; exploit others for their labor, meat, milk, antivenin, etc; and give no thought to the rest. If a picturesque species is nearing extinction, we keep some in zoos, but nobody really cares about extinct insects or fish until the changes to the ecosystem start affecting us. The Superhappies' attempt at compromise in /Three Worlds Collide/ by [[/s][Spoiler]] seems superhumanly fair-minded, and I'm not even sure if it was a good thing for us (hence the popularity of the story's "True End").
