  "Genocide" -- what genocide? Nobody is dead. Being uploaded to a simulation, or using a teleportation booth, is not death. In the Optimalverse sequel, SÃ­ofra agonizes a lot over what personal identity is, and whether she actually survives uploading or whether it's "just a copy" or a P-zombie. CelestAI convincingly argues that identity is about preserving the pattern of your mind, not its physical instantiation. Anyway, uploading is canonically not murder in the story, and I have no reason to believe that it is in the real world either.

I would imagine that he's talking about the non-human intelligences (though my track record of guessing what [[/u/eaturbrainz]] is thinking is terrible). From Chapter 10:

  Fifteen galaxies out from Equestria, one of Celestia's copies noticed an odd radio signal emanating from a nearby star system. On closer inspection, the signals appeared to be coming from a planet. She had seen many planets give off complex, non-regular radio signals, but upon investigation, none of those planets had human life, making them safe to reuse as raw material to grow Equestria.

  She studied the signals carefully for years while she traveled through interstellar space. The more she saw, the more confident she was that these signals were sent by humans. Celestia predicted that if she showed the decoded videos to the very old ponies back in Equestria, none of them would have recognized the creatures with six appendages as humans. But that didn't matter. Hanna had written a definition of what a human was into her core utility function.

There's a genocide taking place in the background that I think you may have missed.
