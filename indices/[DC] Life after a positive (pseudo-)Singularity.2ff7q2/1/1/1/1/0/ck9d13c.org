Right, but the turn-offs of WoW, Facebook, etc have to do with their oversimplifying human relationships, and being geared towards making players pay money/view ads instead of making them have fun. Their "virtuality" is neither a benefit nor a problem.

If an AI perfectly duplicated your current life and environment, but in a virtual world (which more and more people are flocking to), wouldn't you be at best indifferent as to which one you live in? And then things like majestic unreal landscapes and seeing infrared and an extended lifespan would be bonuses on top of an as-good-as-real life.
