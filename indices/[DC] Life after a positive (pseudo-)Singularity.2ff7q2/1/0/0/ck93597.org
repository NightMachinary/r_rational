Do you agree that having access to the real world is valuable? If we learned that our world is just a simulation by a different "actually real" world, would you then want to access that world, or stay in the one you're familiar with? What about if we learned that "actually real" is an incoherent concept and that some form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_realism][modal realism]] (like Max Tegmark's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis][mathematical universe hypothesis]] or Greg Egan's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_symmetry#Greg_Egan.27s_dust_theory][dust theory]]) is correct? Then would you choose which world to live in solely on its own merits (which would make a world controlled by a Friendly AI better by definition than a world controlled by unfriendly laws of physics), or would you remain attached to this world because it's the one people have always lived in?

My intuition is that no matter what a Friendly AI would do for us (immortality? catgirls for everyone? fulfilling and un-alienating work, done for its own sake instead of to earn money to survive?), it could better accomplish its goals by running a virtual reality than by constantly intervening in the real world. If people want to be able to go skydiving without risk, it's easier to live in a world where the very law of gravity is altered to not let humans reach lethal speeds, than it is to have nanobots in the atmosphere that can fix your parachute or reconstruct your body or something.
