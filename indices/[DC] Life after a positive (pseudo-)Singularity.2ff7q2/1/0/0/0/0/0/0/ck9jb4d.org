The friendlyness part doesn't matter at this point, only the "superintelegent and strictly greater than you in every capability, and you're uploaded to inside it's mind". If it wants you dead, you are /already/ dead. If it want you to believe it's friendly and isn't actually friendly enough to have scruples doing so, it'll just write that belief directly to your brain rather than try to convince you. If you have ANY kind of information, it'll just look at your neurons and read it out. Any kind of thinking you could do, it can use the computing power more efficiently than simulating your mind. Any body it can build, it can put a far more effective specialized AI in.

If you are not uploaded, it's far better of uploading you and using the atoms for something else.
