  Do you agree that having access to the real world is valuable?
#+end_quote

I do agree with that.

#+begin_quote
  If we learned that our world is just a simulation by a different "actually real" world, would you then want to access that world, or stay in the one you're familiar with?
#+end_quote

I would want to know as much about the "actually real" world as possible, to at least figure out in what ways whatever our virtual-real world uses as computing hardware might be threatened by events or entities therein, and how to minimize such risks.

#+begin_quote
  What about if we learned that "actually real" is an incoherent concept and that some form of modal realism (like Max Tegmark's mathematucal universe hypothesis or Greg Egan's dust theory) is correct?
#+end_quote

Then I would draw on a quote that's decades old to me but that (insert hipster hat, etc) you've probably never heard of:

"Anyway, there are an infinite number of alternate dimensions out there. And somewhere out there you can find anything you might imagine. What I imagine is out there is a bunch of evil characters bent on destroying our time stream!" -- Lord Simultaneous

Put another way, in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, what I /want/ to do (catgirls, etc) is probably somewhere near the top of the pyramid. What I /need/ to do in order to survive is somewhere near the bottom. The reasons I want access to the fundamental layer of reality, or very rough equivalent for modal realities, is more a matter of survival than desire - the base of the pyramid instead of its peak.
