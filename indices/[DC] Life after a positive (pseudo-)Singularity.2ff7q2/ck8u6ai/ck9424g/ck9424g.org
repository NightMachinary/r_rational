Is that an actual 'ugh field', or simple distaste?

  Compare, and then tell me whether it's worth clicking.

One question that few authours seem willing to try to tackle is, once a bunch of people have uploaded into a virtuality... what would life be like for them? What would they spend their time actually doing? If that aspect of such scenarios interests you enough that you'd like to read about at least one possibility, even knowing that you're going to be disturbed by it, then you might want to read through the first Bartleby's story.

On the other paw, if the 'bleck' you feel from death-jockeying is strong enough that you don't think you'd be able to learn anything from such a story, then I'd recommend against it. (On the gripping paw, if a major part of that 'bleck' you feel is from the /pain/ involved in Prime Intellect style death-jockeying, rather than the killing itself, then a minor spoiler of the Bartleby's setting is that inhabitants don't feel pain they don't wish to and/or enjoy, and their version of death-jockeying can be as cartoonish as, well, cartoons.)
