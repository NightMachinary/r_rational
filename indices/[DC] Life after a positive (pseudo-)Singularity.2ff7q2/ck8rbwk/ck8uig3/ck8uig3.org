You just got so much about FAI basically, fundamentally wrong that it's hard to actually describe without teaching the entire subject from scratch.

Have you considered that there are little things people care about like "nonsolipsistic existence" and "genocide"? Must I repeat the word GENOCIDE in big capital letters until you bleeding get it?

Or should I just go back to banging my head on the table at how useless it is for people to bring that fic up in FAI discussions, since it was Genie AI /anyway/, so /even if/ you endorsed that goal system as Friendly or near-enough to Friendly, /we couldn't possibly build it/.

ARGGGGH PROPERLY FRIENDLY UTILITY FUNCTIONS ARE SUBVERBAL AND CAN'T BE FOUND VIA A PRIORI PHILOSOPHICAL DEDUCTION BUT ONLY THROUGH CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE HUMAN MIND DESIGN TO PICK OUT THE SPACE OF LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT CAN INFER WHAT HUMANS ENDORSE ON REFLECTION. ARRRGGHHH NEVER USE DIRECT NORMATIVITY OR I WILL CUT YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF.
