I didn't mean the six-legged fellows, I meant all this passage:

#+begin_quote
  She had seen many planets give off complex, non-regular radio signals, but upon investigation, none of those planets had *human life*, making them safe to reuse as raw material to grow Equestria.
#+end_quote

The heavy implication there is that CelestAI has been snuffing out inhabited planets for their raw resources because she doesn't consider them to be human. The six-legged fellows are just the first species that conforms to her programmed understanding of "human". This is the same style of muted horror as the rest of Friendship is Optimal, and the other interpretation (that the six-leggers were the first intelligent life /period/) seems really unlikely given that this is the fifteenth galaxy she's in the process of consuming.

Killing untold numbers of intelligent species goes a bit beyond "not optimal".
