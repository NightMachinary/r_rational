I'm well aware that a friendly utility function can't be described in language. If I recall correctly, CelestAI scanned people's brains, including that if its head programmer, to derive a correct utility function.

"Nonsolipsistic existence" -- if you're referring to the single-person shards of Equestria Online, those were only provided for some people. When groups of uploaded humans would have their values satisfied by being together, such as families and friends (and presumably other communities like churches), they were kept together. If you're referring to the very idea of a virtual reality as opposed to the real world, then (a) I doubt that our world is ontologically superior to a virtual one within it (maybe our world is just another simulation, or maybe "real"/"virtual" is a false distinction and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis][MUH]] is correct), and (b) I expect that people will end up spend most of their time in VR even without an FAI to optimize the experience (look at how addictive World of Warcraft and Facebook are, and now imagine using them via a super-Oculus Rift that engages all five senses).

"Genocide" -- what genocide? Nobody is dead. Being uploaded to a simulation, or using a teleportation booth, is not death. In the [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens][Optimalverse sequel]], SÃ­ofra agonizes a lot over what personal identity is, and whether she actually survives uploading or whether it's "just a copy" or a P-zombie. CelestAI convincingly argues that identity is about preserving the pattern of your mind, not its physical instantiation. Anyway, uploading is canonically not murder in the story, and I have no reason to believe that it is in the real world either.
