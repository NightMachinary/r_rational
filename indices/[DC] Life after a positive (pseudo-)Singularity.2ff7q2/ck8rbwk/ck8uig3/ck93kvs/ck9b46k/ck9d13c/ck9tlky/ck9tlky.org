  If an AI perfectly duplicated your current life and environment, but in a virtual world (which more and more people are flocking to), wouldn't you be at best indifferent as to which one you live in? And then things like majestic unreal landscapes and seeing infrared and an extended lifespan would be bonuses on top of an as-good-as-real life.

Ummm... see, I think this whole discussion goes wrong when you start referring to simulated environments as "worlds" or "realities". Then it becomes a whole Plato's Cave, Matrix-based paradigm, which leaves you the choice to be paranoid about achieving root access to reality on the one hand or complacent about giving up the security of your own reasoning and perception on the other hand.

I'd say: if we want to live full, healthy lives, then simulated environments ought just be /places/, places among other places. I would no more want to never leave even an optimally pleasant simulation than I want to never leave an optimally arranged bedroom. Being a hikkikomori, on any scale, is not a very good life choice, when you could be mustering the bravery to go outside and see the rest of the world.
