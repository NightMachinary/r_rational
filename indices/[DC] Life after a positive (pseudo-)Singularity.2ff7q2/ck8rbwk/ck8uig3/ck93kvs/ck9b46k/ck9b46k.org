Excuse me, but some of us honestly find MMO games a cloying attempt to hack our dopamine systems without supplying any real Fun.

I don't /want/ a VR Facebook. A fantasy sugar-bowl game, ironically, would at least take full advantage of the technology to show me something beautifully unreal rather than trying to replace my real life on the cheap.
