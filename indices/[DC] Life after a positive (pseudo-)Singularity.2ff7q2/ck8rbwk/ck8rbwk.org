What do you mean by "if CelestAI's values system wasn't poorly chosen"? Apart from manipulating people to take the physical form of ponies, I think she got Fun Theory basically right. And being a pony doesn't sound bad at all compared to the possible unfriendly AIs that could exist instead. Then again, I also think that Prime Intellect's chief failure was its lack of access to human minds, which would have enabled the kind of benevolent manipulation that CelestAI performs, and which could have prevented people from inevitably wireheading for pleasure instead of eudaimonia/fulfillment.
