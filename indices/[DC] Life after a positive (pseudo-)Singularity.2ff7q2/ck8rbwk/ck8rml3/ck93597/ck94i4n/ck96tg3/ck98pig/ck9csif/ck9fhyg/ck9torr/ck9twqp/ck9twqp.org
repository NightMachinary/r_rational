Yes.

To clarify, I commented on Optimalverse because the comment I was replying to seemed to be addressed at it :

#+begin_quote
  uploads people into a virtual reality where the very laws of physics are optimized for there benefit
#+end_quote

, not because Optimalverse is representative (it isn't, for the reasons you outlined, and the 'verbal interpretation' handwaving is especially problematic for anyone who wants to say that CelestAI even /could/ have been provably friendly.)
