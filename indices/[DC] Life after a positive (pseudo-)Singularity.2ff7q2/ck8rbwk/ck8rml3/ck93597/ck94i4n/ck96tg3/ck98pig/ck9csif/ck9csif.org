You're right, proving an AI to be Friendly is hard enough, let alone actually making one. And if someone "proved" that an AI is friendly but then it starts kicking puppies and eating children, I'd disbelieve the proof. But if someone had a proof that an AI is Friendly, and then it uploads people into a virtual reality where the very laws of physics are optimized for there benefit, I'd just think "Oh, so that's how to achieve Friendliness. Can I join you?"
