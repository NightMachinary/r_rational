I had no idea that TMNT had Time Lords. A cursory Google search does not find any good Doctor Who crossovers, though. Someone should write a rational one...

  The reasons I want access to the fundamental layer of reality, or very rough equivalent for modal realities, is more a matter of survival than desire - the base of the pyramid instead of its peak.

That makes sense. I've been thinking of "build an FAI" as the ultimate "access low-level reality for survival purposes" action; once you get that right, you can ignore reality's substrate and concentrate on your higher-level desires. If you don't trust the AI to act in your best interests, though, then yeah, you would need to understand how the world actually works yourself.

(Personally I would want to understand low-level physics anyway, just for the sake of knowledge; but if simulated realities were commonplace, there wouldn't be any /need/ to focus on the particular physics of this particular world. Maybe some non-Euclidean world has more interesting physics than ours.)
