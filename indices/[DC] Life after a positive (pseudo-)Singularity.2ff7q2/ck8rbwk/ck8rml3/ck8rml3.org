A major theme of the Optimalverse stories involves the question about whether uploading is a good idea or not. Many people feel that having access to the real world, such as having a choice to change their mind and un-upload, or at least have access to true information about reality, is an important detail that makes CelestAI's enticements, which lack the same, a poisoned apple. Or, put another way, that CelestAI's value system makes uploading reasonably equivalent to wireheading.
