This particular story seems to share a good deal with "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect", at least setting-wise. In fact, the furry element could be dropped entirely, and the story itself would remain nearly the same.

In general, I get good mental-model results by treating furry as more of a meta-genre, like anime.
