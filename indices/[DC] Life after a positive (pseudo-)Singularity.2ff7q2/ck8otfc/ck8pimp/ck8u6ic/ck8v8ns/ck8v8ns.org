There is death-jockeying. Or at least, there is killing and dying for fun (since it never sticks) as a sort of art form -- guess that's close enough to your definition. Dunno about wireheading -- the story sequence is just so weird that I didn't get all that far through it. Having talked to the author, I believe that he was honestly trying to maximize that feeling of weirdness.
