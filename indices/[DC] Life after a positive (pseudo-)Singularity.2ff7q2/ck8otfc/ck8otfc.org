I don't think I've ever seen religion as a centerpiece of a furry story, but I'd argue that all furry fiction, not just erotic furry fiction, represents what life after a pseudo-Singularity might be like. There seems to be fertile and untrodden ground, somewhere between Charles Stross and Kyell Gold.
