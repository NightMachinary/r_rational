  If I want to protect some shit I don't put RIDDLES in order to do that. Noone can resist a good riddle! Put a riddle on a safe, I'll be trying to crack it just for fun, even if I don't care about what's inside the safe.

Also, importantly, riddles don't distinguish Friend from Foe - they're a test of intellect rather than of motives. See this shit all the time, where solving puzzles and riddles is how you prove you're "the chosen one" (Redwall did it in about every second book), which only works when all the bad guys in the universe are comically stupid.

Which, I mean... they often /are/ stupid, because a competent antagonist would have resolved the plot in their own favour while the hero was still busy having some dilemma or crisis of confidence about whether to even try to be a hero. But you shouldn't be able to predict ahead of time that your chosen hero is going to be the only one smart enough to solve your mystery.
