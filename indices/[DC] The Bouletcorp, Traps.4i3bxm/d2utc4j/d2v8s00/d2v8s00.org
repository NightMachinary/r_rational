That's a good theory. I'm unique in that I couldn't enjoy The Hunger Games at all because the world doesn't make any sense from an economic or a sociological perspective. Not only did I think the people of the Capital were idiots, but I couldn't get behind the social satire because Panem was so unlike our world that I found it impossible to relate it to our own.

The chief reason I couldn't suspend my disbelief was that the people of the Capital aren't actually rich, they just indulge in luxuries. Rich people get money from something, these people just have everything they want because they live in the Capital. There's also the fact that the Games aren't intimidating because they don't threaten death, they guarantee it.
