PRECISELY! Whats the point of having power you can't avoid things like rules,waiting time, social image or even tedious and boring work.

Rational behavior of anyone with any modicum of self-sustaining power should be acting in a way they feels most enjoyable, and not worry so much about efficiency and social status.
