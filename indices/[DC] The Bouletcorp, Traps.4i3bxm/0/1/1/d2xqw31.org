  I couldn't enjoy The Hunger Games at all because the world doesn't make any sense from an economic or a sociological perspective.

That's the most interesting thing about the books, imo. There's so little worldbuilding, that it serves as a kind of political/economic litmus test. Most readers seemed to just fill in the copious, gaping blanks with their own preconceptions and biases.
