I suspect it's a case of supervillian status signaling. By putting the artifact in an expensive temple that doesn't do its job, you indicate both that you go out of your way for style, and that the artifact doesn't even matter that much to you.

When you build a zillion dollar arena to make kids fight to the death, you show that you're willing to pay extravagantly just to kick a few extra puppies.

It's a supervillain thing.
