Why an instinct to hide sex from sealed if they can't understand it anyway?

You're basically talking another language so it seems weird to me that they'd make sealed cover their ears when you talk about sex even though ears uncovered they don't hear it

Also how do leap years work? How does it work in space? What if you've been frozen? What about hormonally stunted people or people with delayed puberty? What about mentally handicapped people?

Seems to me if you're going to have a mechanic so you can't get in legal trouble you should just make a god of consent or something who gets involved in all cases.

But I guess it's OK to write about rape and murder as long as they're adults so not consent. God of legal protection
