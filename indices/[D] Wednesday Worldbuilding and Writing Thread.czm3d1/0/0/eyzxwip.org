* Mages

  :END:
Like witches, mages also use mana, though they cannot collect it themselves. Unlike a witch, the mage can only use his own essence, which must be collected by a woman and then given over to him. For this reason, wizards often have one or two assistants who can collect their essence when needed. Also for this reason, most mages will push their appetites as far as they can go, doing what they can to lower their refractory period and increase the number of times they can ejaculate in a day, which usually involves increasing their baseline sexual desire.

Where witches have their own powers largely focused on growth and kinetics, a wizard's power largely revolves around materials, whether that be creating them from nothing, or enhancing them in some way. A mage can use a decade of their essence to erect an enormous cathedral overnight, or a week to create a small cottage. Aside from what they can do with mundane materials, a mage can also imbue mundane objects or materials with special properties, which vary depending on the specialty of the mage.

Unfortunately, it takes a significant amount of time and effort for a mage to become any good at magic, which limits their numbers immensely, especially since that same essence they generate could be used by the witches in order to grow crops. Nevertheless, most kingdoms will have a small handful of mages on staff, tasked with either building or making metamaterials.

Of note, a mage can increase the power of their essence by holding onto it while at a place with a good enough view of as much surrounding land as possible, for unclear reasons. The need for these viewpoints limits mages even further, but for this reason, most mages will use their powers of construction to make a tall tower for themselves as their first major act of magic. This collection does not work if two mages attempt to collect from the same field of view, which they can tell, and usually negotiate.

Some examples of metamaterials:

- A helm that's harder to break without becoming brittle
- A sword that's sharper than possible with tools
- A cloak that's resistant to fire
- A dress that's completely waterproof
- A set of pants that fit the form of the wearer
- A net that never gets tangled
- A dagger that curves through the air when thrown
- A bow that fires as though it had three times the draw
- A frictionless dildo
- A dildo that moves on its own
- A dildo whose size can be changed
- A dildo that can change temperature
- A small homunculus capable of following rudimentary commands

Knock-on effects:

- Elite soldiers (usually witches) are outfitted with metamaterials making them more effective in combat.
- Because different mages have different metamaterial specialties, there needs to exist some kind of network of wizards where they can hand metamaterial objects back and forth to double or triple power them.
- Mages need to be not just mages but architects and artisans as well, or failing that, they need to have architects and artisans that they can do serious consultation with. Because mages spend a lot of their time not really doing anything, it makes a lot of sense for them to pick up a trade as well.
- There are going to be a lot more huge buildings around the world, if they take so much less capital and labor to construct
- Depending on the variables, there will be less use for mines, if a mage can just make a knife or sword or horseshoe out of nothing. Probably not possible given the scales involved though. Probably not desirable to get rid of mines, from a worldbuilding perspective. Mages can either be hoarders, not using their stored essence until it's on something big, or they can be day-to-day or week-to-week, only keeping a limited stockpile for the jobs on hand. The former would make more sense with a patron, while the latter would make more sense in a capitalist economy.
- Mages build their mage towers out in the middle of nowhere, more often than not. This doesn't make mages recluses, because they probably have a small staff with them, one or two attendants, some artisans, and maybe a few others.
- It's hard to bootstrap as a mage, which is part of the reason why so few people are mages. You need time and effort, plus all the collected essence, which is why it's mostly an upper class thing, except for a few rare cases. A kingdom could create a mage's college and pay for young men to become mages, but they might not have the incentive to do so depending on how high the cost is, whether there's a bloc of existing mages who oppose such a thing, and what the actual benefits are.
