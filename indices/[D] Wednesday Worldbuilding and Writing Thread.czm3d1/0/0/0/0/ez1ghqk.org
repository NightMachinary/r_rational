I don't see too much use from the plane of cocks, aside from the fast travelling, if Mana harvesting from it isn't practical. The only original thought I had for it is that there is apparently a plane of abundant animal parts that are alive and seemingly don't spoil. So, if getting food from agriculture isn't practical at the moment, a witch could travel to the plane of cocks and come back with as much fresh meat as she can carry.

Giving someone a cockmeat sandwich would be more than just an expression, it would be a gift of great labor. Maybe not blood, sweat, and tears, but sweat and other bodily fluids.
