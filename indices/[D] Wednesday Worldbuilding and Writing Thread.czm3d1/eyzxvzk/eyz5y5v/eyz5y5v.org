What's your favorite form of urban mass transit that satisfies the following conditions?

- has a fixed route with dedicated structures for stops
- has a dedicated right-of-way, like BRT, trains, people-mover
- has "stations" with a payment barrier to entry of the "station" or transit system, rather than a payment barrier to entry of the vehicle or a trust-but-verify honor-system "yes I have a ticket" system.
- can run in tunnels to access a platformed station
