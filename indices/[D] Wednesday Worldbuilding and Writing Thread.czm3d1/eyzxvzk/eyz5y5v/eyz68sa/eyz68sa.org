My own personal favorite is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiba_Urban_Monorail][Chiba Urban Monorail]], based mostly on aesthetic and freedom of planning, but it's probably more expensive to implement than other forms of urban mass transit, and as a suspended elevated line has some risks that non-elevated non-suspended systems don't have.
