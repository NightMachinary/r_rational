*NSFW* *(Seriously)*

--------------

Tales of Mu was recently recommended to me as "there's lots of worldbuilding, mostly to facilitate sex". I couldn't really get into it, but found the idea intriguing, since there are lots of erotica tropes about sex, but rarely much in the way of concerted worldbuilding effort. Most of what I've seen are one-of species, spells, potions, or magical effects, with relatively little consideration for the wider implications, sociological impacts, and second-order effects.

* Sealing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sealing
  :END:
By ancient magic, any child born is 'sealed', locking them away from so much as the concept of sex until their eighteenth birthday. The sealing is bidirectional, affecting both the sealed and the unsealed. Firstly, if the sealed hear or see anything having to do with sex, it will be locked away from their mind as meaningless fuzz, with the memories imperfectly restored upon unsealing. They have no sexual desire whatsoever, even if they're physically sexually developed (e.g. when they're seventeen years old and three-hundred and fifty-five days old). Further, they take no pleasure whatsoever from stimulation of any kind. Secondly, the unsealed have no attraction whatsoever to the sealed, and have an instinctive desire to shield the sealed from viewing or hearing about sex. This comes with a complete revulsion toward so much as the idea of interacting with the sealed in a sexual way, with a strong preference toward clinical description if absolutely necessary.

On a person's eighteenth birthday, they'll fall into a deep sleep that lasts for roughly eighteen hours. When they wake up, any memories of people talking about sex, having seen sex, or other blank spots will be partially (and non-traumatically) restored. Additionally, unsealing day is usually accompanied by sexual urges at the extreme end of normal.

Sealing extends beyond humanoid society, impacting the wider world as well. Sealed are completely immune to the entirety of sexual-magical effects, from the predations of sexual monsters, from sexual diseases, and from nearly anything that would cause them to have sexual pleasure, and stimulate them in a way that would be sexual. Further, most sexual monsters will instinctively avoid the sealed and not engage in sexual activity when within range of the sealed.

Knock-on effects: Children have a warding effect against the monsters that roam the wilds, so are often brought along on merchant caravans, on ships, or in other circumstances where monster attacks would be more common. Children sometimes have shifts manning the city walls, usually children supplied by orphanages. Similarly, there are childrens' adventuring guilds in some nations, as children have a quite different experience of the world from adults, one which protects and shelters them.

Unsealing tends to be something of an event, marking an entrance into true adulthood, though the circumstances vary by culture. Because the unlocking of memories is somewhat scattershot, the unsealed need to be introduced to the world as it actually is, and must learn norms, rituals, and expectations at a fairly rapid pace, especially as there's no effective way to prepare them for it.

* Mana
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: mana
  :END:
Males produce 'essence' when they orgasm, which can be captured by any close-by (touch-range) unsealed female, who then uses a simple spell to process it into small pearls of 'mana', with some residual magic left behind. This mana is extraordinarily useful for many things, which helps to incentivize sex. Further, residual mana has benefits for the woman, fulfilling biological functions (allowing her to go without food or drink, repairing the effects of aging, healing injuries, boosting immune system) and increasing sex drive and sexual arousal. A woman who has quite frequent sexual intercourse can subsist exclusively on mana, sometimes even forgoing sleep. Men get no benefits from sex besides pleasure.

Mana can be used to:

- Make things grow. This mostly applies to crops, which get the most benefit per unit mana. Properly cast, a single pearl can increase crop yield over an acre by 50%, with sharply diminishing returns. Typically, each acre will get three castings per planting.
- Similarly, a heavy burst of mana can be used to enormously accelerate the growth of a single individual plant, with much better diminishing returns, turning a sapling into an enormous old-growth tree in a matter of hours. This magic can also be used on animals, growing them at a greatly accelerated rate, though it's rarely done given the mind doesn't advance with the body. Use on people is non-functional, and impossible on a sealed individual.
- Enhance awareness. Using a pearl of mana as a focus, a witch can enhance her senses, typically one at a time, as two or more requires extra skill and concentration. Sometimes this is used for sexual pleasure by enhancing the sense of touch. Witches are often used as sentries, and are capable of producing fine artisanal works.
- Engage kinetics. Witches can fire off kinetic blasts for both defense and offense, and if they're skilled, can even apply kinetics to themselves in order to fly. Use of kinetics can drain the pearls fairly quickly, so flight is mostly used for short distances rather than long ones, or in those cases in which it's acceptable to burn lots of mana.

Knock-on effects:

- Improving crop yields means saving on the labor necessary for keeping people fed. This is good, because a lot of the world has dangerous beasts or environmental hazards, and fields usually need to be fenced in. Better yields also mean that society can support ancillary professions at lower population densities, and in high densities, can afford more specialization.
- Kinetics mean that witches have powerful offense, while flight means that they have fast response times. This makes witches the natural police of the world, capable of taking out any criminals.

* The Plane of Cocks
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-plane-of-cocks
  :END:
In a similar way that other settings might have a plane of elemental fire or a plane of elemental earth, there exists a plane of cocks. If you were to go there, you would see rolling hills of cocks, some spaced close together and others far apart. These cocks come in all varieties, some large and some small, but most average. Each of these cocks is functional, in the sense that it will grow erect when stimulated and ejaculate when given enough stimulation. To all tests that have been done, these cocks are not in fact attached to anything, and exist simply by themselves, part of the landscape of the plane. Interestingly, the ejaculations do produce mana, though somewhat less than from an actual male.

Travel to the plane of cocks takes a great deal of both mana and magical expertise, and is more of a curiosity than actually useful, except by those witches who might be constrained by the number of cocks available to them in the prime plane.

On the other hand, the plane of cocks is instrumental in a number of magics on the prime plane, including the cock portals, a number of magics that allow the growth of a cock, and various others. Similarly, there are methods of transportation available to a witch that allow for fast travel through the plane of cocks, making it instrumental in the fabric of the world.

* Potionmaking
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: potionmaking
  :END:
Potions have many different effects, though most of them are biological in nature. Potion-making is a process-based skill, one which takes ingredients and processes as inputs and returns potions with various effects as outputs. A master potion-maker can tweak and adjust their potion in various ways, increasing or decreasing duration, effects, and other parameters. With that said, potion parameters mostly have to be guessed at, and there's always some risk that a brand new potion will act in unpredictable ways, or will fail to work at all.

Some potion effects:

- Hair growth/removal
- Body changing (permanent/temporary)
- Healing/regrowing (pricey)
- Sex-related (erections, lubrication, semen volume, etc.)

Some potionmakers have potions that will transform them into beasts at a moment's notice. Such potions are a rarity, since they're mildly dependent on personal biology and bodily metrics, so don't work for everyone. Some potion makers also have gender-bending potions, which are a bit more common.

Healing potions are expensive, but can fix almost any problem, so long as they're formulated right. There are very few people with missing limbs, as those can be regrown with potions, something which is expensive but worth it in the long run, and typically funded by a kingdom.

* Cock Rings
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: cock-rings
  :END:
A “cock ring” is a small ring, between five inches and eight inches in circumference, which, once activated, will have a cock from the Plane of Cocks come through it. This cock can be used like any other, and typically gets used by women who don't otherwise have enough cock in their life, or as a way of having a non-threatening marital aid. When they ejaculate, there is some production of mana, but far less than from a normal cock. Because of the mana cost to create one of these cock rings, they are primarily used for satisfaction rather than the production of mana, since there are generally enough normal human cocks available. Some of these cock rings have attachments on them, whether that be a handle for easier insertion, a flared base for anal insertion, or a special attachement for use as a strap-on.

* Agriculture
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: agriculture
  :END:
Most food in this world is sexual in nature. This includes aphrodisiacs, things for women to fuck, things for men to fuck, sexual stimulants, lubricants, and all kinds of things. Some of these uses take some preparation, and not every single thing in the entire world is sexual in every way, but it's very common.
