  Based on the description I would guess functional immortality. Which is really interesting from the societal perspective. It would imply that the female rulers would have centuries of experience whereas male rulers would get a century at max, thus I would predict that societies either would have female rulers in place due to the higher competence or would have strong norms against women being in power.

  I feel that there is a strong incentive to have daughters as those can become functional immortal and have a much higher availability of mana. I feel that there is also a high chance that a society would emerge with men being seen as little more than cattle.

It would also give even cis men a strong reason to take a gender bender potion as they reach the end of their life span. Gender ratios could become seriously skewed over time in that world if women are effectively immortal. Good thing there is a plane of cocks...

This "problem" could be fixed if healing potions also enable effective immortality.

On an unrelated note, I wonder what use there is in a frictionless dildo?

Good to see flesh.txt made real!
