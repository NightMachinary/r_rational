I'm mostly thinking of the erotica/porn/Hollywood trope where everyone looks younger and prettier than is realistic, and this is a way of justifying this, along with some other things. I'm a fan of senescence as a tough problem with a lot of components, where you solve one problem and find out there are even more problems five or ten years down the line ... which seems to be what happens in the real world, where /something/ is bound to get you, even if you can fix a lot of the problems along the way.
