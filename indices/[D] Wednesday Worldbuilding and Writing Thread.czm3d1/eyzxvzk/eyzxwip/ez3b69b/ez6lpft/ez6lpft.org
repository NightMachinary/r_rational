Based on the description I would guess functional immortality. Which is really interesting from the societal perspective. It would imply that the female rulers would have centuries of experience whereas male rulers would get a century at max, thus I would predict that societies either would have female rulers in place due to the higher competence or would have strong norms against women being in power.

I feel that there is a strong incentive to have daughters as those can become functional immortal and have a much higher availability of mana. I feel that there is also a high chance that a society would emerge with men being seen as little more than cattle.
