I like that. Though actuallfy thinking more about it I wonder what defines man and woman in a world in which you can modify your body? It seems unlikely that it's what your genitals are. If it's just the DNA you could modify that but staying in a body aesthethic you are comfortable with. If it's self identity that's a very different jar.
