I feel like worldbuilding is kind of directionless, in the sense that you create rules and then see where they go, without having all that much of a destination in mind. I guess I would also say that this /isn't/ about maximizing the amount of sex, it's about maximizing the variety and quantity of unique sexual scenarios available to write/think about. (Per machines, I don't think that's much of a concern, but I might be overestimating how difficult such a machine would be to make. Pretty sure that you would just have the men manually stimulating themselves, if speed was your primary concern, which it probably wouldn't be given that you're much more limited by refactory period.)
