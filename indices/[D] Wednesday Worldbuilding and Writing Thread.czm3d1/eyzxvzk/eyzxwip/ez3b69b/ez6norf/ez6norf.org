I feel that the idea must have been to create a world in which people had a ton of sex but I honestly don't really think that is what would be happening. Mana comes from ejaculation and the quality of it doesn't seem to be related to pleasure. Female pleasure becomes inefficient. Non-vaginal sex is much faster at reaching the point of ejaculation and I would expect that there would be a bunch of machines that could bring a man close to orgasm just to have the woman touch him when sufficiently close.
