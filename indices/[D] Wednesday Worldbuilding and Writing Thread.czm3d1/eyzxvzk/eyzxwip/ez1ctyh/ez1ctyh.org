Neat ideas. I'm going to assume that the discovery of magic has been somewhat recent, on an evolutionary timescale, because I think there would be some extremely strong selection pressures in various areas. Any population that had men with a shorter refractory period, or who were more easily stimulated to orgasm, would fairly quickly outcompete their rivals. It's hard to predict exactly what would happen, but I think gender ratios at birth would also change from the more or less even ratio we have IRL.

Men being able to give various benefits to women, including effectively feeding them, by having sex would probably mean that working families would prefer daughters and a smaller number of healthy males, as this would significantly offset food costs and medical hazards.

Unless condoms or some other method of birth control is handed out by the pound to every person, combined with easier food production and offset food consumption, population would skyrocket whenever other resources aren't significantly limiting expansion. Wars of expansion would be the norm for most of a country's existence.

Massively boosted plant and animal growth could lead to vastly faster artificial selection, meaning custom species would be common, and probably vary by region. Plants that grow useful materials would quickly be altered to produce more of that material, meaning things like buildings would be made of almost entirely organic materials due to how easy they are to make compared to things like rocks. Metallurgy would be a hard field to advance when bone and engineered wood are readily available materials. This further limits the utility of mages being able to make buildings, although it could be useful for temporary structures.

Walls around cities would likely be made from trees, as trees are easy to make, hard to climb over, and easy to take down as a city expands or contracts.

Charcoal would by far be the most common fuel source.

Women would be soldiers more than men, as they are not the main limiter on a faction's mana generation, and groups of women soldiers could be sent for long treks using men to both heal them of injuries and effectively feed them. This significantly reduces supply lines. Added to the fact that women can be witches, enhancing their scouting, guarding, and combat abilities, men would likely be rare as soldiers.

Sealing means that there is no weird child rape stuff going on, but male children would likely be heavily pushed to be really, extremely good at cardio and aerobic exercise before they reach 18. Marathons would be a high school graduation requirement.

Mages I think would be engineers instead of architects, if the mana requirements seem to mostly scale with the amount of material created instead of the shape of it. Use their magic to make otherwise hard to craft items. Not specifically sure what those would be, given the lack of information, but it seems like the more promising path.
