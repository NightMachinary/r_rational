I respectfully disagree. Depending on the internal structure the plane of cocks would be a heavily contested resource. Compared to men, the cocks on the plane don't expend resources when milked and it is logistically simpler to have a cock farm than a men farm. It is also likely that you could develop machines that could milk many cocks at once, or bring multiple cocks close to orgasm simultaneously so the speed of harvesting mana becomes much improved.

Edit: Body modifications are possible. I wonder what the shape of a dedicated harvester of mana in the cock plane would look like. You want a lot of appendages to milk as many cocks at once and you would have 'entrances' designed to make ejaculation happen as quickly as possible. I feel like it would have to look nightmarish.
