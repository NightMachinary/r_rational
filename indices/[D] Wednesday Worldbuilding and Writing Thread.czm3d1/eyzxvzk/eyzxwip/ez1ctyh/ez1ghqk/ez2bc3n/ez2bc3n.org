The plane of cocks could be useful when it comes to warfare depending on how the topology maps out. At the very least, defense outposts and border guards in the plane would be necessary to keep saboteurs and assassins from entering city walls if it's just an overlaid plane.

It could also see use in expeditions, where a witch skilled enough to open a portal to the PoC, and equipped with enough automatic enchanted fleshlights, would be able to sustain herself indefinitely. The Arctic would be explored and mapped much earlier in relative history than here, for one, as well as spelunking/exploratory mining.
