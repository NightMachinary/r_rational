  Instant deceleration but not acceleration of the material.

What reference frame does this apply to? Do you receive an equal and opposite force? If I stop a cannon ball of equal mass, do I go flying out the other direction?

If there is no If it is decelerating material relative to the user, this can be used for infinite propulsion in space. Stand on a metal table, kick off of it, then stop it relative to yourself, increasing net momentum in the direction you chose.

What degree of fine control is there? Can be used to create cryogenics by decelerating individual atoms relative to each other. Condense out [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUKcHe0-m_I][liquid oxygen]] from the air for use as an accelerant.

How many objects can be controlled at once? If the metal is in liquid form, does the 100kg apply to the entire mass of liquid, or only to the portion being actively controlled? If the latter, separate out blobs of liquid metal to fill the entire 2m volume.

Combine liquid+cryogenic control to travel through the earth's mantle. Would need to constantly reinforce shell of metal to prevent collapse. Would need to take additional source of oxygen for journey. Ascent would require breaking through rocks, may need creatively chosen exit points.

Does the alloy need to be metallic? Hematite (Fe2O3) is 70% iron by mass, but can have a rocky appearance.
