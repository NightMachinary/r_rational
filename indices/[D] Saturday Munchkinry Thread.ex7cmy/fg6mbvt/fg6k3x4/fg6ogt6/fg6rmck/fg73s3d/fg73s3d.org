- Since none said it yet. Make metal frame for wings and have a low tech flight method if that's what the setting calls for..
- Can he attach loads to the metal and still manipulate it after the weight limit ? Either way he can use momentum to accelerate and throw objects he holds with the metal, turning him into a catapult or cannon anecdote.
- If the object only has to be partially contained into the 2m radius he technically can have increased range.
- Personally I think it'd be cooler if instead of stopping metal nearly instantly his power subconsciously redirected the projectile into an orbit around him, which he then could send back with little to no loss in force or momentum.
- If you ask some engineers they could easily come up with a better shield / impact absorption system using different metals in combination and not having construction limitations. For instance liquid mercury layered with steel, or some form of metal fur, or simple layering of very thin metal sheets etc.
- Very thin steel wires, they cut animals very easily..
- He can technically fly at very high speeds with a metal ball attached to a rope which he grabs when he (mentally) throws the ball and releases when the ball starts falling / decelerating. He can technically do this continuously afaik and go as fast as he wants. As long as the mass of the metal and it's momentum don't magically get transferred to him without physical contact, and he can keep it in his power range.
- Depending on how much force he can exert, power armor is a thing. And he can use levers and pistons / whatever (ask engineers) to increase his strength without having to worry about a power source, heat or many other obstacles that make it difficult for us to make power armors.
