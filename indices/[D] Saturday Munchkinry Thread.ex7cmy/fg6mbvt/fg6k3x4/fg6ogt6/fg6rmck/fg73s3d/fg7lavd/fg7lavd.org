+I'd like to point out that that alloys are, by definition, 100% metal.+

One major aspect of any materialbending is the fact that they can bend the material without any of the usually necessary equipment. In this case, you can bend metal to mass produce sculptures, or create intricate normally-impossible works, or easily wield metal together.

Destruction in a city would be absurdly easy. Anything electronic or mechanical could be bricked in an instant. Powerlines, pipelines, wires, cables, easily severed. You could bring buildings down by strategically weakening the metal supports.

Depending on how the power works, mining could be a good use of your time. Just walk around in a cave, or even just in a soily area, and rip out all the residual metal in range. This could also apply to humans, making for rather bloody deaths of a thousand punctures.
