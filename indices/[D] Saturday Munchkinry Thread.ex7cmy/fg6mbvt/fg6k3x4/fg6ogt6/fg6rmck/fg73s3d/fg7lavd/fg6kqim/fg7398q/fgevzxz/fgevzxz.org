Instant deceleration?

We're moving around the Sun at 30 kilometers per second, around the center of the galaxy at 220 kilometers per second, toward the Great Attractor at 1,000 kilometers per second, and through the cosmic background radiation at 390 kilometers per second.

Accordingly, by properly decelerating a 100 kg mass to rest relative to one or more of these destinations (the math is going too be tricky but a good computer program on when and where to to the deceleration is eminently practical), one can easily cause an impact with an energy release of the same order of magnitude as the Hiroshima bomb.

Ideally, of course, you're going to do that from well away from your target.
