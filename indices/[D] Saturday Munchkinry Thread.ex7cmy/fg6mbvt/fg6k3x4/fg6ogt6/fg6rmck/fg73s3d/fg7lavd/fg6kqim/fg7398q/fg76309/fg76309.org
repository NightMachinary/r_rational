Okay let's say you are moving the pocket watch, congratulation you are moving an object, let's say you want to move only one gear inside the pocket watch, congratulation you've got an object and a broken watch, think about this, a car is one object (obv you ca t controll it since it weighs more than 100kg but whatever) you can however control half of the front and back halves car's frame and, assuming it doesnt get wrecked, move it like that.

Basically an object is something that's either weld, bound together with something so it doesnt fall apart, or is capable to stand alone.

Let's say you have a gun, and you need to pull the trigger, now you have two objects, one is the gun and the machinery inside, the other is the trigger, which needs to be moved separately from the gun for it to work, if you have an object with something inside you are basically moving the frame and making sure that everything inside stays together as it's supposed to be, you don't controll it unless something goes wrong
