You can bring into existence any well-descibed hero from popular culture, mythology, etc, but you have to choose hereos well known before year 1500 (so no superman, etc). Also, no time travel/multiple hero duplication, etc. Just one being and once.

He will have any superpower that he should have according to the tales, he will show up in your living place.

Who do you bring and why? What are you trying to do with them? Are you trying to somehow convince them to serve you? You have the full knowledge that is available to you right now, and the hero knows nothing about the todays world.

PS: I know this one is easy to munchkin because of loosely defined rules but still I'd like to read your ideas.
