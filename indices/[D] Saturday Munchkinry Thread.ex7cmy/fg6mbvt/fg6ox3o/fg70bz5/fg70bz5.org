Other than what Alexander already said..

â€‹

- They might find reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921573-lost-connections][Lost Connections]] helpful.. It's basically a scientific guide to fighting depression and being happier.
- They'd want to research a good investment method for that money so it can last indefinitely.
- They'd want to find a job / project / artistic endeavor to occupy themselves with, these can change and morph overtime, maybe even consciously on a seasonal basis. IMHO humans need to work in some form to be happy, be it an actual job, school, or dailies in a game.
- Also they'd want to do some research into philosophy, be it eastern or western, to help them cope with the realization that even after they get everything they could possibly want nothing changes, and now even that hope of "being happy when ..." is gone. This fucks up a lot of high performers and lottery winners.
- If their brain is used to the "I'll be happy when ..." paradigm they should start working on changing it for something else.
- They should do the things they know they should do but find it difficult, be it writing, painting, starting a restaurant, learning a language, making a move of that person, cooking, moving somewhere...
- Reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art][The War of Art]] may help, the author calls this difficulty Resistance and claims it's one of the main causes of human suffering, to paraphrase an example he gives: "imagine how many lives would have been spared if Hitler had the courage to face a blank canvas." It's likely a book worth re-reading once a year.
