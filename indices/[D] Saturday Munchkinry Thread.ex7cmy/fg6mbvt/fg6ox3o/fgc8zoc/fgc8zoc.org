What's funny is that this answer really points out just /how little/ a million dollars is.

If you stuck a million dollars in a decent asset mix and got a rate of return of about 5% per year, you could pay yourself an annual salary of $60k for 30 years, or ride the low income threshold at $45k per year indefinitely.

Although that's great, you're not /truly/ wealthy, because that would solve a ton of the problems in these bullet points. Half of them explicitly cost money, and the other half are made significantly easier if you have money:

- Exercise: sure you can do this on your own, but you're likely to hurt yourself or just plain give up. Hiring a personal trainer to come to your house for an hour per weekday will cost on the order of $25,000 per year, more if you need them to keep quiet about super abilities.
- Fix diet: hire a personal chef to buy and cook food. Will cost something on the order of $60k, plus the cost of the food.
- Focus on experiences: traveling safely costs money. Figuring out your travel plans costs spoons. The wealthy still use travel agents; you just buy a package from an agent and you're good to go. If you're super rich, you'll have a private jet.
