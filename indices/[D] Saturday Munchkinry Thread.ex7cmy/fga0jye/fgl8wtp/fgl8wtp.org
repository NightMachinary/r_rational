While there are a few tempting choices, I would /love/ to see what Jesus says about the state of the world right now, and I'd love even more to see what he does about it when he finds out.

- *Me:* So, if you look on the map here, this is America, where we are. This is the most economically- and militarily-powerful country in the world right now. Over 300 million people live here, and about 70% them are ostensibly followers of you.

- *Me:* America is a democracy, similar to Rome. We have a senate, and we vote for a leader that we call a president, and together they run the country from this place, Washington D.C., over this way. Our current president is Donald Trump. He says he's a Christian. However, he's an adulterer, he's divorced two previous wives and has been married three times. He says he's a billionaire, and although he often lies, if he's telling the truth about that, it would make him one of the richest people in America. Regarding the modern Christian concept of forgiveness, he once said: "When I go to church and when I drink my little wine and have my little cracker, I guess that is a form of forgiveness. I do that as often as I can because I feel cleansed."
