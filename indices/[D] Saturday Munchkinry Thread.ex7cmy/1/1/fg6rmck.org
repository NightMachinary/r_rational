  instant deceleration but not acceleration of the material
#+end_quote

Here's the case for not having different rules for acceleration and deceleration: it's really just all relative. An object that experiences an acceleration of 100 m/s^{2} will experience the same magnitude of force as an object that decelerates at a rate of 100 m/s^{2,} it's just that the force will be acting in the opposite direction. Acceleration and deceleration is just a matter of perspective; the only thing that makes one "numbers going up" and the other "numbers going down" is your relative frame.

In the same way that orbiting satellites "fall toward the earth," the earth is constantly "falling toward the sun," accelerating due to gravity to travel in a circular orbit. (If earth's acceleration were 0, it would just be traveling in a straight line.) So if I reduce your acceleration (relative to the sun) to zero, you will no longer orbit the sun along with the rest of the earth, and be hurled off into space.

So, maybe it makes more sense to say that the metalomancer can only cause things to instantly decelerate /relative to their own frame/, which makes more sense. But it also means that the metalomancer can mix things up by changing their own frame. e.g. suppose I'm a metalomancer in a car traveling 30 m/s west, that means that /relative to my frame/, a stationary object is speeding away from me at 30 m/s eastward, and decelerating that object to a speed that is "0 m/s (relative to me)" will cause it to accelerate to a speed of "30 m/s westward (relative to the ground)."

Instant deceleration (or really, "instant anything") seems ripe for exploitation. (Maybe we should just assume that by "instant" you mean something like, "comes to a complete stop in 1 millisecond or some other extremely small time frame that's basically imperceptible to humans", because you kind of break the laws of physics any time you try to say that something happens in 0 seconds. When thinking about that time frame, realize that the difference between 1 millisecond and 2 milliseconds is also quite large in terms of the g-forces that would be experienced by whatever object you were decelerating.)

As they say, "it's the instant deceleration that kills you." (The reason that crashing a car into a brick wall is more fatal than crashing your car into a wall made of jello is that the deceleration is more rapid.) So if I can cause your car to instantly decelerate from 60 mph to 0 mph, your body will be flung "forward" relative to the car's frame and have a decent chance of instantly killing you, just like if you had driven into a wall. Of course, I can't cause the whole car to instantly decelerate, because it's more than 100kg and has non-metal parts, so I guess I'll just freeze your engine block in place and cause the rest of the vehicle (including your body, which is seated behind the engine block) to "collide" with the stationary engine block. Or, if the engine block exceeds the 100 kg limit, I'll just freeze the pistons in place (while the rest of the engine continues traveling forward, "colliding" with the pistons), so you get to unleash whatever explosions were happening in the piston chamber as well as your body colliding with the stationary pistons. (When the kinetic force of the pistons colliding with the rest of the engines causes the pistons to start accelerating forward, I'll just activate my power again to once again decelerate them to zero.)
