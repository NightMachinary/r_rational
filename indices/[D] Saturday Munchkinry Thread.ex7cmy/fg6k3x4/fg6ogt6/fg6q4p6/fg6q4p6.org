Ah there goes the munchkinery I want. Ok let's update the rules shall we? No, he doesnt have that amount of precision, we are talking about macro here not micro, the smallest he can go is about the size of a grain of sand, he doesnt have enough controll to let's say, split water into oxygen and hydrogen, but he has the controll necessary to split, let's say about 300 kg of mercury into 3 spheres of 100kg of mass, thereby controlling all of it.

Now as for the movement issue, there I go fucking with the third law of motion again, no there is no equal and opposite force, if he say it stops it stops, period, he could theoretically use it to fly in space, but he would fry his brain well before getting to any good fraction of C, the faster the object goes, the harder it is to control, so what he likes to do is use it as a slingshot. He spins the object to gain velocity and momentum and when it has enough he let's go of it.

The alloy doesnt need to be metallic, it just needs to contain more metal than not, let's say an alloy of Iron+tungsten+alluminium(I don't think it exist but fuck it) is about 55~60% of the mass of the alloy, if it's any less than that then no dice sugar, and even with this the movement speed he can give it and the precision with which he can controll it is less, so by rule of thumb Pure Metal>Metal alloy>(metal+nonmetal)Alloy.

He doesn't have a limit to how many things he can controll, only on how much they can weight, the radius is static, it cant change with training, the same goes for the weight, the only thing he can train is his control.
