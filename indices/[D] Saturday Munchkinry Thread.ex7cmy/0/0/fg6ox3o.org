It depends on why they're unhappy and where they live, but:

- Get stable housing, spend a bunch on a new bed and a good pillow, go to sleep around the same time every night, get up at the same time every morning.
- Exercise routinely, using the money for a gym and/or equipment. This goes to health, but also to helping regulation of hormones and some other things. If you're poor, it's not /impossible/ to work out, just harder, with some inconveniences. Get a personal trainer to show you /how/ to work out.
- Fix diet to include more whole foods, less added sugar, less carbs. Diet is notoriously bad among poor people, for a few reasons. Get a dietician, but maybe wait until after you've been following all the common sense advice you would get from the internet.
- Get a medical checkup to address any ongoing health problems.
- Obtain friends. Hard to do, but easier with money. The best method is probably to buy into a hobby or activity of some kind, maybe more than one, ideally one that has a consistent group that meets on a weekly (or more) basis. That at least gets the foot in the door, and can be helpful if you're not naturally charismatic or social. Most of my friends that I didn't make through high school, I made through D&D or Magic: the Gathering. Most of my wife's friends were through ballroom dancing or rock climbing. Much easier with money, because money buys time, and you also don't have to worry so much about costs.
- Get a partner. Easier with money, by virtue of the labor you can save and the stuff you can do, the likely lack of scheduling conflicts, but finding the /right/ partner is a bit of a crapshoot. Still worth pursuing (along the usual paths, especially hobbies/activities, see above).
- Get a therapist. This isn't really for therapy, though you might need that too, but to have someone who is paid to listen to you talk about your life and problems, who is in your strict confidence, and who will be there if you have some personal thing you need someone to talk to. Friends or a partner can fill this role, but if those aren't available, pay someone.
- Focus on experiences, not on things. Travel, see the world, try new things, ideally with friends or your partner, but if not, then alone.
- Avoid things that suck up your time while delivering little in return, whether they're obligations, things that feel like obligations, or vices. Internet, television, social media, etc. are common vices, especially if you're poor. If your obligations are things that can be solved with money, try to do that.
