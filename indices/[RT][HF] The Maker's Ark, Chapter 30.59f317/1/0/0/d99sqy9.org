Ill take the slow pace anyday. I did a full re-listen back when the spear was mentioned and while I wasn't paying attention to pacing I found it thoroughly enjoyable.

Obligatory reminder I am waiting for an edition I can spend dollar votes on and while rare I'm pretty sure there are others like me. Bonus if you can get it in audio-book, even How to succeed in evil's authors works aren't that cheap as an audio-book but some of us buy them to not have the intro and outre music every 20 minutes.
