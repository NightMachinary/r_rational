It's pretty much a clone of Spacebattles, with some slightly nicer features and less assholish mods. There was a whole schism and everything. It has a nicer colour scheme too.

I personally also find the average user to be slightly less standard-internet-comments-section-tier, but that could just be me.

It's not uncommon for an author to make a thread on both forums and update each at the same time, but don't feel obligated to do so.
