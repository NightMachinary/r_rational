You are, but don't worry, the earring situation was pretty confusing. For a Hemalurgic spike, you need three things: a specific metal, a compatible bind point, and intent. If you're lacking any one of these it won't work. For Vin's earring, Ruin himself was providing the intent. You can't just accidentally stab someone in the right place and form a spike, you have to have some idea of what you're trying to do.
