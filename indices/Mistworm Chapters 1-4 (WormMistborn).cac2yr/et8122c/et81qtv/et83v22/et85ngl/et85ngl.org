  she considers steel enough preparation
#+end_quote

I must have given you the wrong impression somewhere. She does not at all consider steel enough for cape fights---she just figures it's good enough to get her away from any fights before she gets caught up in it. Her priority is raiding stashes of cash and taking down unpowdered, unarmed criminals so that she can get enough money to buy the correct formulas for the rest of the metals she needs.

This Taylor also had a different Trigger, and figures that the way to get the rest of the metal she needs is to get money, and hey, don't drug dealers have a lot of money on them? Also school sucks and she has no social life.

  her desire to avoid "situations like high school" isn't enough to overpower her common sense

I would disagree here. Personal experiences can form phobias for similar situations. It's not reasonable or logical, sure, but it's a character flaw and not a plot hole in my opinion. And as it turns out, she's right to be afraid of similar situations in the Wards. Sophia is one.

Are you sure about that? What more evidence does there need to be? A cape has superpowers---all they need is their fists, and not even that if they have telekinesis or laser eyes or some such power. Psychotic killers are mentally unwell. They could indeed stand near the body for no reason, or continue wailing on it even after the person is dead, or even kill someone and then just go about their day like nothing happened. When a Ward tells you she saw some cape go berserk on something, you can't stop and consider if she's telling the truth---there could be a superpowered criminal going on the rampage, you need to take action. I do agree that any after-action investigation would pick up that something fishy was going on.

He did that here too. Taylor descended form the fire escape before he started talking.

Thank you. I'll try to do better in that department.
