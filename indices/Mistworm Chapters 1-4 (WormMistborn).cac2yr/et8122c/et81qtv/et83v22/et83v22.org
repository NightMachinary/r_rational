Well, the problem is that she considers steel enough preparation, when it's only one-sixteenth of her power. Taylor went to great lengths when she was experimenting with her bug powers - going to the public library to research insects, gathering different varieties from around the city, and three months of physical conditioning. Even then, she was /procrastinating/. Canon Taylor needed the push from having her notebooks ruined in order to be persuaded to go out, and even then, she waited patiently for the weekend. Given enough time, she would have had full plate armor and a better dyed costume, etc.

If she needed more resources in order for her power to work, she would have sought those out from the Protectorate - her desire to avoid "situations like high school" isn't enough to overpower her common sense. (No matter how much fanfiction authors would like to persuade you otherwise.)

As for the PRT - Sophia herself is a notoriously unstable Ward. But even disregarding that, a cape that went berserk on a civilian in her own civilian identity would leave more evidence at the scene, wouldn't be standing on her own calmly by the body. And if Sophia were to describe an encounter with her, the PRT would ask for a description of the power. Sophia needs to come up with a lie dangerous enough to get them to send a full squad out, but not so dangerous that it could be instantly disproven. If she tries to flub on details or says something like "I'm not sure." there's a chance they might send the police to the scene of the crime instead, because they can't know if it's actually Parahuman involvement. These aren't impossible obstacles to overcome, but it's a very convoluted way to get to the end result.

My impression of Armsmaster came from the fact that he was being economical with his words - it makes sense if he's trying to go after Lung, but it wasn't a strong impression for a first encounter. Taking a look back at it, it doesn't seem as bad as I remember, but given that it was my first impression, maybe you might want to put something more in there. Again - chapter two can be immediately improved just by giving the concepts in there more space to develop. I didn't get a very clear picture of the fight, and the conversation with Armsmaster on the roof (How did he get up there? In canon he made his approach with a motorcycle.) felt truncated.
