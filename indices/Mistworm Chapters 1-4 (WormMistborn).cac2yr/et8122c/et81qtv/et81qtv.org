I decided to let the first events in canon happen basically the same way, and diverge from there. I'll try to add more context between lines in the future, thank you.

Can you tell me what gave you this opinion? I never like that characterization either, and tried only to show him as bluntly professional with a bit of flat humor that Taylor doesn't recognize. He's also looking for Lung since he's been rampaging.

The key phrase here is after the first Lung fight. I tried to make the Lung fight an inciting incident so that she'd learn she needs more preparation than just steel. It seems you didn't get that impression, so I definitely did something wrong.

Consider it an AU element in that case. My logic is that they have a Ward's testimony that some cape went berserk on a civilian in her own civilian identity. If she's that unstable, I would think it understandable that she's foamed.
