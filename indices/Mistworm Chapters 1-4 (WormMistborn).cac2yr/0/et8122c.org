Alright, first impressions:

Chapter 1: Alright, nothing special. "I thought I would be a Tinker." is cool except that you don't really show us the moment when she understands what else she is. It's a pretty neat way to explain how she received information about her power. In general, we should either see more preparation or more contemplation before the first fight - Worm had a good three thousand words of it, you only hit about one-thousand.

Chapter 2: A one-two punch of terrible. Lung fight for no reason, then transition straight into Robo-master. I'd suggest just removing it entirely, unless you're going to have Lung and Armsmaster be the first and second antagonists of the first two major story arcs, like in Worm. The only good thing about this chapter was Taylor flying over Brockton Bay. It doesn't even really plunge Taylor into this story's intrigue, like in canon, because it seems like you've gone in the direction of a different inciting event in chapter 4. In particular, I'd like to say that Armsmaster doesn't have any /obvious/ social deficiencies in canon, and the insinuation that he does is both annoying and never treated with the consideration it deserves. (It takes Lisa's supernatural intuition to reveal that Armsmaster has beef with Dauntless, and has feelings of inadequacy. If he were struggling that obviously, the Protectorate would have done more for him before Leviathan.) The dialogue in this chapter is bad too - there's too much repetition and not enough context behind each line. Taylor's quips to Lung don't have any time to sink in before the next one comes. It feels like an abridged version of events. Give it a bit more meat and it could go from bad to just mediocre. I'd suggest cutting it in its entirety and putting the relevant stuff in later.

Chapter 3: This is where the story gets much better. Props for not just quoting the bulling scene from 2.4 like a lot of hack authors do. Making the trigger event different (I think that's what I read?) is also neat. Taylor somehow not experimenting with her powers more before going out is the most out of character thing in this story - she waits a full three months in canon, and in that time Taylor would /definitely/ have figured out more about allomancy than she has by now, even with monetary limitations. The part where she's caught unprepared with Lung is something that shouldn't have happened unless something strongly changed her mindset - this is the girl that kept a pile of quarters in her utility pouch after the first Lung fight, just in case she needed to use a pay phone. Still, now that we're getting this exposition and preparation, it's better late than never. The body hook at the end is definitely good, too. I don't think I've seen that in other stories.

Chapter 4: The mystery presented here is neat. I feel like the PRT is too trigger-happy here - the only suspect who could have possibly made them act that definitively against Taylor is Sophia, and even then, I feel like they would have opened negotiations before shooting. (What if they caught the wrong person with Taylor's profile? She's in civilian clothes - even murderous capes don't get foamed if they don't start to fight back. They would need a /much stronger body of evidence/ than eyewitness testimony.) But those inconsistencies can be ironed out, and in the end, you'll have a chapter that segues into conflict better than like 95% of Worm fanfiction. This is why I feel like the Lung fight is so unnecessary - if you cut it out and left this in, the question of why Taylor went out so half-baked would make much more sense.

Overall, a decent 5k words. Not the best story I've read, but I wouldn't drop it from what I've read here, and I'm eager to see where you take this plot.
