Happy New Year!

Sorry for being a few hours late, I had a clock which was somehow set three hours ahead leading me to post this about three hours late.

/grumble, grumble, stupid digital clocks thinking I'm in a different time zone, grumble, grumble/

I also found an interesting 7 Beat layout which works very well for the plot of any relationship story.

- Beat 1 - The Hook -- Why the protagonist needs/wants the romance/relationship.

- Beat 2 - The Meeting -- The two characters meet and an attraction, or reason for one, is established.

- Beat 3 - Conflict Point 1 -- Wherein the protagonist realizes they should not be together, as it conflicts with their goal/dream/beliefs.

- Beat 4 - Raising the Stakes -- Wherein the two characters are bound together, despite the conflict. They accept their love/relationship/attraction.

- Beat 5 - Conflict Point 2 -- The relationship looks good, all is working, but there is niggling doubt. The conflict continues to gnaw away at them, it's a false happiness.

- Beat 6 - The Black Moment -- It all goes wrong, all hope is lost. The relationship seems doomed.

- Beat 7 - Resolution -- Obstacles overcome, romance achieved, or tragic ending.

The 7 Beats are clearly designed for a romance story, but it can work as well for platonic friendship, frenemy, bromance, or any story centered around relationships.

I planing on using the 7 Beat structure with a group of 5 characters so we'll see how that goes....
