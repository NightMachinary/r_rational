I posted this elsewhere in this thread but I think it might help you out - I've hooked beeminder up to draftin to do that sort of thing automatically, even though its concept of "word count" is "words added or removed" to reward you for editing too. Perhaps that might work for you, if you don't mind the way draftin looks? (I prefer google docs, but that might be because I'm used to it...)

Here's mine anyway: [[https://www.beeminder.com/mad/janowrimo]]
