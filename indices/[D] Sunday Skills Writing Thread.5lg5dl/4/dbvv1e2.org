So, JaNoWriMo (January Novel Writing Month) begins! I'm writing my yaoi paranormal romance novel (yes, really).

Yesterday was almost a write-off because I slept so badly following my "spending NYE playing board games sober" party, but I forced myself to write /something/ so I would have no 0 days.

Of course, once I started writing it flowed easily (I chose something that was easy to write, though), and I enjoyed writing, though I hate the result (it was written after a night of poor sleep). It is definitely not ready for even basic feedback.

Here's my beeminder goal if anyone wants to keep tabs on me: [[https://www.beeminder.com/mad/janowrimo]]

Something that just occurred to me: the main character is a vampire. How do I bring this up? In an opening scene do I just sort of take it for granted that the reader knows that the main character is a vampire, or do I have to go into a basic description of vampire society, lore, etc? How do I do that? Does anyone have a link to something available online that introduces the concept of vampires to the reader? My Vampires Are Different, of course, but all the reader needs to know for now is that he can't go in the sun and has better senses than a human - you know, the usual; they can find out the rest later as the vampire's lover does.

Things I need to do to fix the scene I wrote yesterday:

- Rewrite it entirely (really)

- Find out what the level of warfare technology was in 550 CE

- Describe what people are wearing

Goals today:

- Write a completely different scene

- Aim: 3,000 words
