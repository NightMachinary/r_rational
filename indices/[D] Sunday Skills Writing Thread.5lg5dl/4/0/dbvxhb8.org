DO NOT go into a basic description of vampire society and lore or I will put your book back on the shelf, or close the tab, or whatever other way I can stop reading as quickly as possible.

Show, don't tell. First ideas would be having them casually drinking from a pouch of blood stored in the refridgerator, or having them check what time sundown is that day in a restless "come on, I have shit to do" kind of way. This depends on the specifics of your vampires, naturally; there are small things that make the world seem real to the reader, and you're better off incidentally showing those than infodumping. (Some people will say that they like being started off with an infodump. I'm not quite willing to call those people liars, but they're in the minority.)

Obviously you also have the option of saving the reveal for later, but if you do then you want to lay in the foreshadowing and have it actually have some punch to it. But I generally think it's more effective to just leave as much "out in the open but unexplained" as possible and then explain it all later on, unless you're really good at foreshadowing in a way that doesn't look like foreshadowing until after the fact.
