Yeah, I really don't want to do a "by the way I'm a vampire and I need to eat a pint of blood every three days also i have a superstition about carrying money" sort of thing because it's... stupid, like you said. It takes you out of it. It reminds me of when I used to read /The Babysitters Club/ and the first chapter would introduce you to each of the titular babysitters (so that way new readers wouldn't be confused). Even at 10 I would skip through this part because I already know Claudia is bad at spelling, Stacy has diabetes, Marie-Anne and Dawn are stepsisters and that Jessie is black!

The first part is set with WW2 as a backdrop, and the two characters who ultimately fall in love are an American deserter and a 1500 year old vampire, so any exposition that needs to happen can happen as the soldier finds out about The Big Truth of the vampire.

I'm actually writing at the moment, the scene after the vampire first starts drinking from his love interest, and the guy is understandably confused. That said, before he had his blood drunk, he was like "okay, rich guy, weird, asks me to do these strange errands, has weird superstitions about sunset, he's probably a Jew". I'm feeling a lot better about this section because I got a good night's sleep!

We'll see how we go! Thanks for your input and encouragement. I really appreciate it.
