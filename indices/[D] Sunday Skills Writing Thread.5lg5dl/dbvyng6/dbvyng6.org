I am getting serious about editing /The Timewise Tales/, a static-timeline fantasy novel. It's told from three points of view which are wildly out of sync with each other. The first draft is complete, but now I'm having some trouble hammering it into a workable novel.

The general idea is that the narratives are woven backward and forward like so:

ch1: A1 talks with B23\\
ch2: B1 talks with C12\\
ch3: C1 talks with A5\\
...\\
ch31: A13 talks with B4\\
ch32: B17 talks with A14

The general */narrative/* rules I'm working under:

1. Never show the same scene from a different perspective unless there's a really, really good reason to.
2. Scenes from the same viewpoint character go subjectively forward in time. /(If there's a scene from A's viewpoint, then the next scene from A's viewpoint will be subjectively after the first scene.)/
3. /Most/ scenes take place from the viewpoint of the character who is "changing" from the encounter, with the other character being the one who is reacting, or acting the way they do based on future information.
4. The climax of the end of the book happens at the subjective middle of each timeline (with the epilogue/denouement effectively spread out through the entire book).

As might be expected, this is proving tricky to map/edit, not just in terms of cause and effect, but in terms of making sure that it works on a narrative/story/character level. It's partly tricky because I need to make sure that things are revealed in the correct way to the reader, while also coming naturally from the characters themselves, e.g. "I'm pissed off at you because of a thing you haven't done yet" or "I'm teaching you this as a way of making peace about a wrong that I haven't inflicted on you yet".

I think what I'm going to have to do is go through and mark each character's subjective timeline, then read through the novel three times, /then/ start editing. But if someone has a suggestion for a better way to edit this, I'm all ears (but it is /close/ right now, close enough that I think editing what I have is still a much better solution than making the map first and then rewriting from scratch).
