I found this story overall a bit 'meh'. The vision of the future imagined by the past was interesting but I felt that the story was too short for the characters to display much rationalism, and the villain(s) wasn't/weren't particularly impressive either.

I'm also trying to work out how a battery powered circular slide rule works. I've used [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E6B][this]] circular slide rule as part of my pilot licence and the main benefit is that it doesn't use batteries. The best I can come up with is a slide rule with a digital display like those digital calipers you can buy. Anyone else have any clue? Or was it meant to be a joke, which I just missed?
