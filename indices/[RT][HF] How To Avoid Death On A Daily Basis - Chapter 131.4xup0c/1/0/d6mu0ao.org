It does start off quite slow and takes until the end of the first book (more or less) to find its feet. This was because I winged it from the start (as an experiment). It does get better, but I wouldn't jump ahead as there are a lot of call backs to stuff that happened early on. It also depends what you didn't like about it. If the characters didn't strike you as interesting you probably won't warm to them any time soon.

Mind you, I am the author so it's hard to be objective.
