  A huge portion of your readers go fucking ballistic whenever Jenny's name is mentioned, and I still have no idea why. I've never seen anything like it.

Having just binged through the whole thing, what I /think/ might have happened is exactly what Claire warns us about. Namely, the readers (myself included) spent too much time with Colin and we all got kind of suckered into his style of semi-justified paranoid thinking. It probably doesn't help that we can see how she's /successfully/ changing him both in ways that he notices and ways that he doesn't really seem to.

While reading, I went through a whole slew of different theories on what she was trying to accomplish as a long con (My favorite is still the period where I was /convinced/ that Jenny was dead/captured and had been replaced by a shape-shifted troll.) Now, at the end of book 4 she /seems/ to have meshed into the party permanently, but my brain keeps looking for what she could be up to by habit.
