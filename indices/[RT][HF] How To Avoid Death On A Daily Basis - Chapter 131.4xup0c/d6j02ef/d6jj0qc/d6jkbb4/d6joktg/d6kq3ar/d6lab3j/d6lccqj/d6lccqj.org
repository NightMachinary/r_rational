  At the same time, I often get attacked for both being misogynistic and pandering to the PC crowd, so there's no winning.

Aside from the specific details regarding which two groups are doing it, I think that's called 'being an author.'

I'm writing a story where the main character is a BTVS vampire. The MC, Jack, is literally a demon in a human suit. I don't get /attacked/ but I have reader commentary both pulling for him to be both more and less of a sociopathic monster. Often citing the same act/decision taken.

Readers, being a naturally varied lot, are rarely going to unanimously agree about anything. Unless maybe if it's a typo of some sort.
