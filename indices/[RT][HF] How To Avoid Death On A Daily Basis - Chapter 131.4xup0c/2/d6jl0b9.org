But mooderino, the story is called How To Avoid Death on a DAILY Basis, not Three days per week! (to be fair I stole this joke from the comment section of your latest chapter)

But seriously, its all good so far, and if you think it can be better with more write time then all the power to you. Also i am a bit OCD-ed that Book Five ended on chapter 131 instead of say 130 or 125, making it so all books have equal chapter numbers.

As for you story quality, the first I have to say is that Mandy and Cheng hooked up way to fast, it hasn't even been a day in story time, and I feel a girl seeing a demon turn into boyband member isnt going to go straight in bed with him, consider adding few days after introduction to ease them in to boning.

Also it would have been good for Colin to explain the situation to both Road Admin guy and Cheng when he had full info on both sides, and why even go into city where Road Admin has power over you? Drop a message by a courier or Dudleys hax arrows, and save yourself from Biadets bullshit.

Humour is still good, feel free to add more.
