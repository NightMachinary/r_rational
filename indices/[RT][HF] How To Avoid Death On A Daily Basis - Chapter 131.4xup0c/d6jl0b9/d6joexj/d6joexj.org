I wanted it to end on 130 as well (for similar reasons) but when I couldn't I decided to end it sooner rather than later. Probably could have stretched it out to 135 if I really wanted to but I was awful tired by that point. The stress of writing 5 days a week really tells after a while. Hopefully I'll be able to avoid that next book.
