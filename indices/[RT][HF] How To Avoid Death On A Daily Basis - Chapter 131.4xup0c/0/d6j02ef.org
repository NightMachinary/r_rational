OK. I don't know what to think of your story.

I can't not categorize it as rational, yet it feels so different. All the characters are fucked up, humans are violent weird fuckers, the monsters are crazy, and I don't even know. Colin is definitely crazy, yet somehow he's the only sane person in the story. Except he /isn't/ sane.

I don't know how you did it, but you made a story I'd expect to be unsatisfying to be /very/ satisfying. Your story is so good, but I can't even.

I await to see Book Five. You've done some nice work so far. Kudos!
