I think most of my readers identify with Colin and part of the stories popularity is down to how many pissed off young men there are in the world. And they tend not to like Colin either being too happy or too messed with (by girls in particular).

At the same time, I often get attacked for both being misogynistic and pandering to the PC crowd, so there's no winning.
