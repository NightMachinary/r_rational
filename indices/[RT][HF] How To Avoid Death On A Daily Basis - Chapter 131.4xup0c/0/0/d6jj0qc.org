Thanks.

Yeah, it's not strictly rational other than in a general 'realistic' approach which I often abandon when there's a gag to be made. I only post here (usually at the start and end of volumes) because others have posted discussions of the story on this sub previously and I have quite a lot of readers who frequent this subreddit.

It's been quite a divisive story because (I think) I tackle various triggering issues and have a number of difficult female characters. It gets me a lot of downvotes, but I still mange to find readers interested in reading a less obvious approach to fantasy, so I guess it works out for most people. Glad you're one of them.
