  I don't know how you did it, but you made a story I'd expect to be unsatisfying to be very satisfying. Your story is so good, but I can't even.

I think it's that the story is very focused on the main character and his team's reactions to the shit going on around them.

Sure, there's a plot going on, things are happening, but I don't know that it's actually important to the story. In the sense that I'm fairly certain Colin and company could have set off into the woods and done most anything else and I'd have enjoyed reading about Colin banging his head against the metaphorical brick wall about as much. The story could have been about Colin's merry band of misfits doing MMO style fetch and FedEx quests and that group of characters would /find/ a way to make hilarity ensue.
