Indeed, learning the rules of magic depends on the specifics, though it is notable that you don't need to know as much as a doctor in order to know more about diseases than someone from the first millenium. They may of course not be as bad as 10th century doctors.

I think The Salvation War generally goes from an interpretation of the passages where Gods' chosen people are turned away by chariots and follows logically from there when it makes judgements about how much of the divines powers are mostly show rather than power.

I know there's a few (like the sunstopping and the claimed creation of the entire universe) where humanity still cannot reach, but it's surprisingly often that a supposed miracle falls short of modern human achievements by enourmus margins (feeding thousands with loaves of bread on a single occasion vs modern technology and economic systems producing enough food /every day/ for billions to eat cheaply).
