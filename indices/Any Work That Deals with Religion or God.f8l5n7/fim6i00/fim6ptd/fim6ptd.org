I've tried reading along time ago, but I didn't exactly enjoy it. It's a bit too military fiction, I'm more looking for exploring the concepts behind the religion, rather than simply having angels and devils as characters.

Though I appreciate the thread, and the author recommendations. I'll definitely check it out.
