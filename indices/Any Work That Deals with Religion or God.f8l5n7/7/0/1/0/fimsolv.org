I mean ... that's not really true. Our abilities to combat novel plagues (whether affecting humans, animals, or plants) are extremely limited. We have no defences against mind control/possession, which TSW hand-waved away with literal tinfoil hats countering it. We /certainly/ have no defence against forces that can blot out the Sun, obliterate entire cities, mystically kill all firstborn in a nation, etc.
