Going by the same rationale as The Salvation War, the unleashed plague would likely be something like what we've already seen historically (Spanish flu or something) rather than a genetically engineered perfect superplague, which we can counter if not perfectly.

Blotting out the sun in a local area is something humans can both do and counter relatively easily depending on how it's done - the angelic forces don't seem to have access to planet-sized solar sails.

The telepathy is of course up in the air for how to counter, but like in the story I'd give even odds that humanity could use the scientific method to learn how magic works better than the native superstitious users before the year was up.
