You might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5330602/1/The-Dark-Night][The Dark Night]], which is a short story. I won't spoil anything but it only takes about 5 minutes to read.

Also [[https://web.archive.org/web/20180101160950/http://squid314.livejournal.com/324957.html][The Last Temptation of Christ]] is pretty good, and has a unique take on how you could tempt a (potentially) immortal, (maybe) omniscient being.
