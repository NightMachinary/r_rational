See, I find this response unsatisfactory. If simulation theory is correct, then just by knowing about a universe is equivalent to that universe existing (given perfect omniscience). So when god differentiates between a good universe and a bad one, both the good and bad exist as perfect simulations in god's mind. Therefore, just by virtue of being omniscient, all possible evil worlds and good worlds and every world in between exist. Or so it seems to me.

Edit: not sure what counts as a spoiler so I just hid the whole thing.
