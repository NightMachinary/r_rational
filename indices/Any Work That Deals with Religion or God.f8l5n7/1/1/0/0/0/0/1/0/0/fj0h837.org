Why does a being knowing or not knowing what we will do change wether we have free will or not? I mean imagine if there were currently an omniscient (but not immortal or omnipotent) being sitting on some moon and pondering all your future actions with detailed accuracy. As you say, this means you don't actually have free will. Then this being dies. It knew that was going to happen but it didn't have the power to stop it. Otherwise nothing really changes as far as your place in the universe and its laws is concerned. Do you really think that the death of that being might grant you free will? How?

I also want to point out that predetermination and free will aren't the only two option. You can also introduce random chance without that in any way leading to free will.

  but we feel like we have it and therefore we need to act as though we have it. That means acting as though things matter.

With this I agree. Humans /should/ act as if they have free will. They should act in many ways counterfactually to the realities of the universe. They can't function otherwise.
