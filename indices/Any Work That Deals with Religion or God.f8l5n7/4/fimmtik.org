I know With This Ring by Mr. Zoat is fairly popular on this sub (despite not being strictly "rationalist"), and deals with numerous religious and philosophical themes. In the DC universe every religion is true in some fashion or another, and as you can imagine that has /huge/ consequences.

This is my favorite bit, from the MC in a TV interview:

  "There are any number of more powerful beings out there. Refusing to believe they exist when you have good evidence that they do is simply... Foolish. Instead, what you get are materialists. People who believe that there's no... Fundamental difference between 'higher powers' and lower ones, merely a difference /of/ power."

  "What I find particularly amusing about it is how painfully logical such philosophies tend to be about moral utility. If a normal man or woman dives in front of a bullet to stop it killing someone else, they are performing an exemplary act of self sacrifice. There are few acts more worthy of praise. On the other hand, if someone bulletproof like me does it, we're not really sacrificing anything. If I step in front of a regular bullet I probably won't even feel the impact. Rather than being an exemplary act of self sacrifice, it's merely a good deed. To that way of thinking, the more powerful you get, the more you have to do to justify praise.‚Äù

  "To that philosophy, anything that wanted people to directly worship it had better either be doing a lot of good in a non-self-serving way, or actually require it to accomplish a particular thing. An omnipotent being is of no interest to such a philosophy, because it would be trivially easy for it to do anything, and as such there is nothing it could do that would be worthy of praise."
