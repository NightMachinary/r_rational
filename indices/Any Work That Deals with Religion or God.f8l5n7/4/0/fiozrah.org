Note that that's from the Renegade timeline, where he is himself a low-level god. Which simply means that his soul has been designed to hold more magic than normal (and to gradually gather more), and he can instinctively use that magic to affect things around himself without structured spells. Plus some side benefits like enhanced strength, toughness, poison resistance, and regeneration (although those are a bit mixed, because he can no longer rebuild his own body via power ring).

Edit: Another tidbit from the Renegade timeline:

  "Don't pretend to be nice. What are you doing on this planet?"

  "Before you got here? I was baking a cake."

  He narrows his eyes. "I'm sure it was an *evil* cake."

  "It was for a local religious event which commemorates the birth of a man whose sole purpose in life was to suffer and eventually die in incredible agony as a ritual sacrifice to stave off their god's wrath. The religion's practitioners wear a symbol of the mechanism used to execute him around their neck."
