Have you seen the TV show or read the book Good Omens?

If yes, I want to recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593][this superb fanfic]]. It's about Crowley (the main demon character) going to therapy after the events of the tv show. And it's absolutely beautiful. I laughed. I cried. I loved and hoped. Read it.
