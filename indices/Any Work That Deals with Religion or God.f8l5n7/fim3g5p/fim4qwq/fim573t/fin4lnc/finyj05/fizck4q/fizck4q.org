I'd say UNSONG and Practical Guide are equally rational, in that both follow the stories of characters using the laws of the worlds they find themselves in to solve their problems. The only reason these stories may seem irrational is because the laws of those universes diverge heavily from ours, mostly through the action of narratives on events in the world. But the fact that their world runs on narrativium is explicitly known by the characters, and they rationally exploit this fact for all it's worth at every opportunity. That makes the protagonists rational.
