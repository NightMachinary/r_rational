I haven't read Mother of Learning, so I can't speak to

a) whether Mother of Learning is above the threshold for being considered rational, according to the standard definitions of the genre (separate from whether it's /socially popular/ among lovers of rational fiction)

b) whether Mother of Learning and Unsong are /comparably/ rational, regardless of whether either meets the bar

The universe being irrational is a large part of the objection. Possibly the central defining characteristic of rational fiction is that the universe is sane, consistent, and sensible---that it's lawful, even if the characters or the reader don't know the laws.

Unsong very specifically doesn't do this, by throwing two dozen /different/ ways-the-universe-might-be-lawful into a blender, and having them co-opt and controvert each other. There's spell-casting, narrativemancy, placebomancy, Uriel's metamagic, random throwaways like Walldrug and the cactus thing, the laws of judgment resulting in people going to heaven or hell, etc. The end result is "pretty much anything could happen; the author can introduce fundamentally brand-new magics three-quarters of the way through the plot and the reader has to update their little mental suspension-of-disbelief document."

The other contender for "the central defining characteristic of rational fiction" is that the /characters themselves/ make sense---that they think and react the way real intelligences think and react; that they pursue their values at least somewhat sensibly and agentically; that they munchkin at least as much as real people munchkin, etc.

Unsong /does/ meet /that/ bar. It's full of people who are, in fact, actually trying (although some of the actually trying is sort of disappointingly first-level obvious and clich√©). People do in fact exploit advantages in the way that a capitalist market encourages them to; the organization UNSONG itself is a central example.

IMO, though, you need both in order to qualify as rational fiction. And I'm sort of a stickler for making sure to maintain the boundary that lets rational fiction remain something special and different---I don't want us to slip into calling things rational /just because they're well-written and contain good munchkining./ Similar to how I think it's important to maintain the boundary between parkour and freerunning---freerunning looks very similar to parkour, but it in fact subverts parkour's central (and /only/) defining principle, so blurring the terms destroys the only meaningful distinction.
