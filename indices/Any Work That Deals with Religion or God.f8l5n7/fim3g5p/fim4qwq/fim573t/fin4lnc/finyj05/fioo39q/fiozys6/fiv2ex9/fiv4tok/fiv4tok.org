Absolutely. It's specifically not Word-of-God, but I've heard Eliezer offer his headcanon-as-author about how the magic system came to be, and it makes perfect sense and holds together even in "normal" universe terms. Not to mention the fact that magic which is shown to work once within the fic always works the same way.

There are certainly places where HPMOR could be better, but I believe it clears the bar. I am less stoked about e.g. the end of Metropolitan Man---my interpretation of the earlier parts of the story is that when Superman is moving at super speed, he's also superperceiving and superprocessing and thus is invulnerable to "surprises," but this is not borne out by the conclusion.
