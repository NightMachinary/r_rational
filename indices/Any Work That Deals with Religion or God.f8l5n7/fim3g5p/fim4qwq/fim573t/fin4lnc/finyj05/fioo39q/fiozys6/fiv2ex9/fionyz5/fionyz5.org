  The other contender for "the central defining characteristic of rational fiction" is that the characters themselves make sense---that they think and react the way real intelligences think and react; that they pursue their values at least somewhat sensibly and agentically; that they munchkin at least as much as real people munchkin, etc.

  Unsong does meet that bar.
