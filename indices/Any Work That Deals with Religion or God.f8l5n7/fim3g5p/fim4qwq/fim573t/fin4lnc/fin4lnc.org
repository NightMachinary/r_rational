I'm curious how you arrive at such a strongly held opinion that Unsong isn't rational fiction? At the very worst, it is rational-adjacent, but mostly in that it avoids the tropes about turning the protagonist turning the plot on its head by tangential attacks on the central problem.

Is it because that the in-universe context is so irrational? That is a feature of the universe, like math.

I would argue that it is as least as 'rational' as MoL, but I have difficulty forming the specific argument without knowing the objection. The classification seems self-evident on initial inspection.
