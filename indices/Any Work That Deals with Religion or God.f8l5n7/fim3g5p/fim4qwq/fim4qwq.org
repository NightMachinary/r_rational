Note that Unsong is NOT RATIONAL FICTION (but it's super awesome and well-written and entertaining and appeals to the same sorts of people who like rational fiction). It's like that one freerunning video that keeps getting upvoted even on pure parkour forums.

(It has some of the /trappings/ of rational fiction, which is part of its charm, but in many cases it has those trappings just to subvert them.)
