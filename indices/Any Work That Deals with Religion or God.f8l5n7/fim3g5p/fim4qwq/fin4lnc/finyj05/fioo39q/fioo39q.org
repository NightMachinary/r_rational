Ah. Thank you for the cogent explaination of your position.

I would substantively disagree with the supposition that the universe itself needs to be rational for a work to be considered rational fiction. This is disctiction between 'the universe' and 'the aggregate actions of nonspecific characters populating the universe'. The universe merely /is/, it does not need to be consistent, it needs to be metaconsistent. It needs to obey the rules set for it, which may conform to constraint criteria which do not exist within its own framework. In the context of unsong, the very meta-rules that operate the universe are of inconsistency, that many in-universe physical and logical constraints can be broken on a regular basis.

In contrast, the aggregate actions of characters in unsong are, as far as I can recall, consistent. They operate within the physical rules of the universe, as disconnected from our own as they may be.

The other argument that I would put forth is that purity arguments are counterproductive. Unsong may be subtly 'not rational fiction', but it is definitely close enough under any definition to not warrant warning people off of reading it for fear it doesn't meet a purity test.

PS: I love your work.
