  Blotting out the sun in a local area is something humans can both do and counter relatively easily depending on how it's done - the angelic forces don't seem to have access to planet-sized solar sails.

Well, in the Bible it's done by, y'know, magic. [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+10%3A1-15&version=NIV][They can stop the Sun in the sky as well]].

  The telepathy is of course up in the air for how to counter, but like in the story I'd give even odds that humanity could use the scientific method to learn how magic works better than the native superstitious users before the year was up

I guess it depends on what the underlying reality is and how complicated it is. You could certainly write it in such a way that it's solvable and humanity wins, either by figuring out the mechanisms involved (although note that IRL understanding and unifying different parts of physics has taken centuries and is still incomplete) or by having it prove not /too/ OP (perhaps they can puppeteer people but not read minds, although traditionally they can do both.) Or the opposite - there's no law of physics that says "superstitious natives" can't have an insurmountable advantage, or for that matter that they have to be "superstitious" at all.

Regardless, it would be a more challenging and interesting conflict than "tinfoil hats block telepathy lol".

  Going by the same rationale as The Salvation War, the unleashed plague would likely be something like what we've already seen historically (Spanish flu or something) rather than a genetically engineered perfect superplague, which we can counter if not perfectly.

First of all, there have been quite a few historical plagues much more dangerous than Spanish Flu. But you're right, that's exactly what would happen in the Salvation War universe - everything is downplayed, ignored or cartoon-ified so as to make humanity win with ease.
