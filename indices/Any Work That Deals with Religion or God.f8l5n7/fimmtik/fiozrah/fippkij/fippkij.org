I think it's important to note though that the renegade is a New God and is partially connected to the Source via his domain (in this case Conquest); as a New God he's man and god both, not just man with extra spiritual growth + a grab bag of powers. Like yeah he has some super powers too but the difference between him and another random super is that connection/partial living representation of an aspect of the Source.
