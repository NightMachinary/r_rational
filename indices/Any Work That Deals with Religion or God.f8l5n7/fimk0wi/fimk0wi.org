[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/a-modern-myth/][A Modern Myth]] hasn't been mentioned. It's also by the guy who wrote UNSONG. The main characters are Greek gods. Religion isn't really part of it though, except that the gods used to get their power from sacrificing rams (which doesn't work anymore).

The Two Year Emperor has a few gods. Though very little religion.

Harry Potter and the Natural 20 has gods, though only one participates in the story (not including the gods preventing anyone from using the Candle of Invocation exploit, or one that could be used to get the first candle, but hasn't been). It's just a single deus ex machina, which is kept as minor as possible. Religion doesn't seem to play any role.
