This might be true near the line, e.g., UNSONG's universe could be juuuust over it, but I figure that once God finds that line, between universes that are More Good Than Bad and More Bad Than Good, He can just...not think about Even Worse ones in detail. Because, yeah, obviously, why would he do that?

If I myself can imagine the /concept of/ the existence of a Bad Universe, in the abstract, without personally modeling every subatomic particle of any particular one, surely God can avoid accidentally simulating universes that are truly not worth the processing power.

Even with an error margin added to the cost of running the process itself, He can come out ahead, net, without making the whole exercise pointless like you're imagining.
