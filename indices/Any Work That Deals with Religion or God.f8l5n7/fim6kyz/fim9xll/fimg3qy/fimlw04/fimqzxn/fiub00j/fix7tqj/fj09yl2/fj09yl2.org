It's something of a philosophical question, I suppose. What does the sentence "X matters to you" mean? I assert that it means "X is something that will cause preventable negative consequences to you." That harm might be physical (e.g. injury, death, destruction of your property) or emotional (e.g. someone you care about is hurt or is angry at you). Being mugged matters to you because you don't want to be shot or have your property taken. Your child being mugged matters to you because you will suffer emotional harm if they are shot/have their property taken. (That's what empathy /is/: Suffering emotional harm as a result of harm some to someone else.) If you are a person who cares about everyone then a hurricane that destroys a city on the other side of the planet matters to you to the extent that you have some capacity to help -- perhaps by sending money to help with disaster relief, or by physically going there to do the disaster relief work yourself. If you have no ability to help in any way then it is right to say that the hurricane the hurricane does not matter to you and you should try not to feel badly about the situation since that simply increases the amount of suffering in the world for no good reason.

In a predetermined universe where we have no ability to make changes, there is no reason for anything to matter to us. Things will play out as they are destined to.

In a universe with an omniscient being, there is no free will. The being knows what you are going to do and there is no way for you to do otherwise. You do not actually have the capacity to prevent any harm, since any harm that you perceive is inevitable and cannot be averted.

That leaves the question: Is the real universe predetermined or do we actually have free will? It's difficult to account for where free will comes from, but we feel like we have it and therefore we need to act as though we have it. That means acting as though things matter.
