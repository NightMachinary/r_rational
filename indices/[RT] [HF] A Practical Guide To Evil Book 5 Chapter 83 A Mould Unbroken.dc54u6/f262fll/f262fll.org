I wonder if Alaya is going to force the third red letter? Maybe not immediately, but at this point she's definitely past the peak of her own personal influence/power.

At the same time I wonder if Scribe's action previously had any real influence on this result. Considering that Amadeus pretty clearly sees the current status quo of Praes even after reforms as being, well inefficient is one way to put it. But Alaya was probably going to be in this position of ambassador alongside the Dead King regardless of the plots happening in the capitol of Procer, so why was Scribe so insistent that Cat not tell him previously about this plotting. Amadeus was already going to be opposed to hitching their cart to the Dead King, and the contingencies that he mentions in this chapter. Alaya has been on this path for a long time, it goes against my instincts that Amadeus would be unable to see that if nothing else she's changed, been changed by the Dread Empress-ship-ness more than she's changed the position or the greater part of Praes.
