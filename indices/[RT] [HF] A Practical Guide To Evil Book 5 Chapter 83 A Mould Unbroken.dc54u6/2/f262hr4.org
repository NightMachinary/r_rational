So how would this work, politically? In real life, if a bunch of foreign potentates accepted some new person as ruler of some country, then then that person would just be a powerless puppet ruler until he also gains de facto support in that country through an actual rebellion or invasion.

But with narrative logic, this act should at least give Black a Claim on the Name of Dread Emperor, though that transfer of power wouldn't take effect until Malicia either dies or abdicates. What powers does a Claim on a Name give you? Did Cat gain any powers when she was fighting all the other Claimants for Squire? Also, Black will probably need to purge all the highborns since they'd never accept him as ruler, a move that the rest of the Grand Alliance would gladly join in on, given that the truce with the Dead King stays in effect. So the next arc will be civil war in Praes?
