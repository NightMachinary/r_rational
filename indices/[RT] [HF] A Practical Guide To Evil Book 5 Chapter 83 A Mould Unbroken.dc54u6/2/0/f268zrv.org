  What powers does a Claim on a Name give you? Did Cat gain any powers when she was fighting all the other Claimants for Squire?
#+end_quote

She gained a whole aspect (Learn) just from becoming a claimant, and gained Struggle during the fight with the other claimants in the burning building (she didn't gain the name until all the other claimants were dead, which was after she'd gained and used Struggle). So you can apparently get two whole aspects without even properly having the name if the narrative is in your favour.
