  So how would this work, politically? In real life, if a bunch of foreign potentates accepted some new person as ruler of some country, then then that person would just be a powerless puppet ruler until he also gains de facto support in that country through an actual rebellion or invasion.

look up guaido in venezuela right now. he has more international recognition than the de facto president, maduro, but he had a fraction of the power because he hasnt been able to get the army on his side.
