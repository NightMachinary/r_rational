Well two different ways that jump to my mind one more historically based is the current government of Taiwan which was the previous Democratically elected government of Mainland China and which lost it's in UN seat as China, which isn't exactly the same thing, in more video game-ish terms in Crusader Kings while being the claimant to a position doesn't inherently have any power it gives well the claim which can then be backed up for the actual position.

It's also a huge call out which is important as you say in the narrative sense, presumably if the challenge isn't met then the name is lost. Cat felt, uhh more, in the name dream which is probably proto-proto name, but even with a claim she has the ability to do necromancy and enhanced reflexes. i think she even gets an aspect pretty quickly, but that might only be, because of a lack of a current one we don't exactly have a lot of data.
