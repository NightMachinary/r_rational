It was meant to be more interpretive meteorology, but the anthropology kinda metastasised. There's still about a thousand lines of code representing this traditional knowledge though, and using it to construct and analyse a season occurrence time series from about 100k weather data points.

I didn't even realise it /was/ a meme...

I'm really enjoying the longer experiences - /Out of Ammo/ and /Vanishing Realms/ are among the best games I've ever played. All the jokes about /Holopoint/ and cardio are true too... games now both demand and promote physical fitness :)

And I've had a soft spot for crypto since my grandfather gave me /The Code Book/ (Singh) at age 12 or so. Intro to information theory, one-way algorithms, and quantum physics was great when bored in high school - I played a lot with the Venegiere cipher. So the matasano challenges provide a structured way to get a concrete grip on the later chapters... while pretending I'm in /Cryptonomicon/ to pass the time on long flights.
