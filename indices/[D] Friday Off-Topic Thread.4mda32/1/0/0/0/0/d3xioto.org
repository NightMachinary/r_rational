~20Kwords on Indigenous calendars in Australia. Basically it turns out that

- Temperate European seasons don't work for tropical Australia (duh)
- The locals had more relevant seasons; defined by weather (and plants) rather than date, because Australia has crazy inter-annual variability
- I can detect which season it is based on the weather, from interview descriptions. I think; no budget for a second round of fieldwork :(
- Apparently nobody else has done this before

And you know, lots of writing Python and LaTeX etc.

I think this calls for a few weeks off, playing with my new Vive (arrived on submission day, best evening ever), and hacking the Matasano crypto challenges.
