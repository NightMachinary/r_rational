I have spent a couple hours playing it. It seems like a fun and exciting multiplayer first person shooter game.

That being said, It's hard to take seriously in the way I take Counter-Strike. Despite being well-designed, it's not a game that excites grand emotions in me. I don't find myself hiding behind a crate, listening desperately for footsteps as I guard an area. I don't find myself playing mind games as I change positions and try to outshoot my opponents. I don't have that feeling of triumph when me and one other guy coordinate the perfect 2v3 over voice chat and snap victory from the jaws of defeat.

Counter-strike is a plotting, desperate, paranoid game that sends the heart racing and the blood pumping. Overwatch is fun, competitive, and exciting, but it's not /thrilling/. I'll play it from time to time, but it will never have a place in my heart.
