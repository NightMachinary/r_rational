Yeah. Comparison to "progressive" doesn't really work, because if you call someone "progressive" you usually mean that they hold liberal views, rather than that they're striving to better themselves. And obviously that comes with a lot of baggage, where most people will take it to mean "liberal".

I might just borrow from the Latin "profect" and use "profective", which would at least let me give my own definition.
