  There's a difference between the commonly accepted definitions of a word and the set of all possible meanings of that word in every context it has been used since some reasonable time horizon.

Yes, there is. If you're asking do I think "Eight" has a commonly accepted definition of "I will love you forever," the answer is no. If you're asking do I think that, in context, *it means I will love you forever," the answer is yes. And I think you agree with both of those things.

So really, all we're arguing about is which of those constitutes a "definition." To me, that isn't a very interesting discussion.

Let's start over , moving back to the original point. All words are context dependent.

The intended meaning of a sequence of letters (a word), /must/ depend on context, because that's how the accepted definition of a word changes. All words have changed, therefore all words are context dependent.

What word could exist that has never, and will never, change in meaning? There is no word that is so immutable that it could survive a hundred years of being used "incorrectly." If you agree with that, you must agree that the context of a word determines the meaning.

We can quibble over whether that context derived meaning is a "definition," or we can argue over how common that new context must be applied before it is a "definition," but those are just semantics.
