Hmm, I personally don't like doing that. I dislike doing anything that makes me seem like an oblivious or non-savvy person. How I respond to someone thinking I insulted them varies a lot (since this rarely happens to me), but if I think someone is being overly aggressive, respond in a way that makes it clear it was not meant as an insult. If it's not someone I know, especially if it's a man, I usually act dismissive and make a joke at their expense. Alternatively, I offer an insincere apology and smooth things over. If it's a close friend, I make a legitimate effort to smooth things over, but it's not something that happens often.

Really, it depends on the case, but I don't make a habit of backing down, looking oblivious, or submitting when people challenge me aggressively and claim I've insulted them. I try to either retaliate immediately or explain it was a misunderstanding. I've never had something become a physical fight or anything like that, so this seems to work--for my personality and social circle, at least.

This kind of thing is pretty rare, though, so it's not something I think about much. My acquaintances rarely respond aggressively when they are insulted, and we already trade insults as part of humor, so it's not normal to escalate after being insulted.
