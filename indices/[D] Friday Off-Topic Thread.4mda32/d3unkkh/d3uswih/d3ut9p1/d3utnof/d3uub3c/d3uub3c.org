Normally, it's fairly obvious that it's a ruse, but the aggressive person can't call you on it without being more obviously aggressive, which costs a ton of social points, sometimes enough to expel them from the group.

Most people are rational enough to not risk that on a passing insult, and as for the people who aren't, it's generally worth the fight to expel the person from the group. For me, it's not worth dealing with a continually aggressive person.
