Something I thought I'd ask a community who's opinion I respect.

So, a friend of mine asked me to be her Dominate a few weeks ago. It's a fairly novel experiance as it's outside anything I've done before and not something I had really even concidered. I've done some research on the subject so I'm not completely out of my element any more.

I've pretty much just been ordering her to do things that are good for her or things she'd like to do anyways but for some reason or another hasn't. (So far, we've gotten her eating well and actually getting her vitamins and minerals. Daily excersise, and I've had her pick up a few physical hobbies so it's not a chore. I've also made her start reading various rational fic to ease her in to rational thinking.)

Punishments have pretty much just been used to reinforce the positive behaviors or for her fun. (Outside of a few things that disgust me, I've really got no personal preferance on such activities.)

It's interesting having someone that listens to everything you tell them to do and then watch them improve as by outsourcing their directions you wind up skipping over a lot of issues that crop up in self direction.

However, I was in discussion with a friend of mine the other day and she suggested that Dom / sub arrangements can never be healthy because even asides from the type of people they tend to attracr, even the "best" of them still encourage an unhealthy dependence and that any positive progress the sub makes is rooted in the Dom.

I disagree, as I feel that positive neural patterns can be built over time that will last even if the relationship winds up not.

Thoughts?
