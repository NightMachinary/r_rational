- Which is more palatable--a story with unimpeachable English that revolves around a Mary Sue, or a story with a perfectly-rational plot that contains nauseating "English"? Which is more common?\\
- Which looks cooler--a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome][geodesic sphere]] or the corresponding [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_polyhedron][Goldberg polyhedron]]?\\
- Which is tastier--an apple or an orange?

I was extremely surprised to find [[http://fav.me/d9kqhqu][this excellent story]] for [[http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/BIONICLE][the Bionicle canon]] while scrolling through the depths of [[http://www.deviantart.com/browse/undiscovered/literature][DeviantArt's "Literature" section (in "Undiscovered" mode)]], and added [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762053][its FanFiction.net version]] to my favorite and follow lists after reading several chapters. It reminds me of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715][In the Blood]]/ (my second-favorite /Naruto/ story, after /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/) in how it largely shuns the source material's focus on action in favor of drama while still managing to remain interesting.

It's always important that a person not get /too/ caught-up in being a fan, while forgetting the reasons for which he's a fan in the first place. How valid is my self-identification as "/Time Braid/ fanboy" when I haven't read the book in months? How valid is my ranking of five favorite anime series (in descending order: /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote][Death Note]]/, /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RockLeesSpringtimeOfYouth][Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth]]/, /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist][Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood]]/, /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam][Mobile Fighter G Gundam]]/, and /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats][Angel Beats!]]/) when I haven't watched any of them in over a year (and several of them in /multiple/ years)?

An artwork's position as "favorite" must always be capable of challenge. /Time Braid/'s status as my favorite book has been challenged several times--/[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198][Background Pony]]/, /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099][People Lie]]/, and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715][In the Blood]]/ come to mind. The ranking of my five favorite anime series is likewise by no means set in stone.
