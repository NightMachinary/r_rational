Well, the fruit and the juice are different items. I prefer orange juice to apple juice, both in taste and in texture--but, if I have the opportunity of adding seltzer water to the beverage, I'll pick the apple juice, because it seems that seltzer water's fizziness is somehow killed by orange juice, while it works just fine in apple juice. (Maybe it has something to do with the suspension-vs.-solution difference.)

As for texture, I definitely prefer oranges. I place a quarter or a sixth of the orange in my mouth, ensure that my lips are closed, and /squash/ the piece of orange, crushing the little sacs of juice so that they spurt all over the inside of my mouth... /delicious./
