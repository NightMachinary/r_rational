I guess if I have to choose, I would take good English and a Mary Sue over competent plotting and bad English, though it sort of depends on what we're talking about. Generally speaking, bad English will stop me every paragraph or two before I can move on to the next thing, while a flawed story will only stop me when something particularly egregious happens (or will make me dislike it when I'm done).

I guess in movie equivalents, it's like choosing between a well-oiled Hollywood wish fulfillment extravaganza, or a thoughtful low budget movie with bad audio mixing and cheap-looking special effects. The former is watchable but disappointing, while the latter probably makes me so uncomfortable that I won't finish it.

I don't really self-identify with fandoms, and don't really understand the people that do. There are books, movies, franchises, etc. that I have a lot of knowledge of, that I often recommend to people, and that I participate in discussion on ... but I've never had something that was important to my identity.
