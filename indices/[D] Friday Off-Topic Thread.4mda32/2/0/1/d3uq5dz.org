  There are books, movies, franchises, etc. that I have a lot of knowledge of, that I often recommend to people, and that I participate in discussion on ... but I've never had something that was important to my identity.

After I first read /Background Pony/, years ago, I was actually rather worried at the thought that it might replace /Time Braid/ as my favorite story--both because it was based on /Friendship Is Magic/ (which I only barely liked, as opposed to /Naruto/, which I liked /a lot/), but also because it was mostly a tear-jerking drama (rather than a blood-pumping, awe-inspiring adventure, as /Time Braid/ is). Was I shifting into the personality of a stereotypical "brony"? Was I becoming a boring person who would prefer Hercule Poirot to Yagami Light and Miss Marple to Dagny Taggart? Neither of these was a fate that I wanted.

Conveniently, however, all these worries vanished after my second reading of /Background Pony/, which firmly placed it in the number-two position. Later on, other stories reassured me that a person could still enjoy both drama and adventure without having to choose between the two.
