Depends how broadly you define "Mary Sue". Some people would classify HJPEV as a Mary Sue. For an even more clear cut example, Shinji and the Warhammer40k. I liked both of these stories, so basic English/grammar skills really help a lot.

I see a lot of fanfic that have an almost interesting premise but then fail in extremely basic ways, treating really bad fanon as canon, major OOC, awkward dialog being left unfinished etc. A story with a Mary Sue but all the basic writing mechanics done correctly can be pretty enjoyable.
