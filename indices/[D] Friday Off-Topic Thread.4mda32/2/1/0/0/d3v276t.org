I actually prefer orange 'taste' to apples, in that if I am confronted with the choice of apple or orange juice I will choose orange nearly 100% of the time (assuming roughly equal quality of juices - it's possible to buy extremely crappy juices / 'drinks' of either flavour, of course).

However, I don't like the feel, texture, and experience of eating oranges, while I quite like those qualities of apples. So therefore, I will usually eat apples instead of oranges if presented with a choice of fruits - again assuming roughly equal qualities like freshness etc.

I am weird.
