I have been reading the Berserk manga this week, and am about halfway through it. It's not rationalist, and the MC's main advantages appear to be the power to fight on with pulverized organs and the ability to wield a 600 pound 'sword' that is bigger than he is. Even so, it's one of my favourite pieces of fiction ever, and I recommend it to anyone who has ever enjoyed dark fiction. The world is grim dark, humanity's place in the food chain sucks, and despite that there is a lot of room left for humans being human. At least for the 80 chapter long 'flashback' or whatever that is. It's looking like there will be a lot fewer main characters and a lot more monsters from now on though.

But. I have learned something very important for my own writing from it. And it's not something awesome to be replicated. It's something a very skilled author did that turned out to be a major mistake which I will work to avoid in my own writing. There is a 'controversial' 'lost' chapter that the author retconned and banned from being reprinted. The scans I'm reading included it, so I didn't realize it was retconned until later. The reason the author doesn't want people to read it is because it sort of pulls the curtain away and reveals the wizard. Or more precisely, [[#s][All the biggest spoilers of Berserk all in one place]]. I'm still enjoying this story very, very much, but I've been pondering for years how much of the hidden 'true' plot to reveal in my own world, and after reading Berserk, I think it's convinced me to leave a lot of things unsaid and uncertain until as late as possible. It's one thing to /think/ [[#s][HPMOR example because everyone here has already read it]], it's another thing entirely to have it spelled out explicitly less than halfway through the story.
