I think in general it's better to be flirtatious than forthright when writing fiction. Raise your skirt and show some leg, but don't flash anyone. But if you /are/ going to state important things outright, then you need to change the focus of the story. Like, you could totally do HPMOR with the reveal in the early chapters, you'd just be shifting some from "what will happen" to "how will it happen" and using dramatic irony more than mystery.
