For fans of time loop stories, like /Time Braid/ and /Mother of Learning/, may I suggest a currently airing anime, Re:Zero? The premise is that the MC is suddenly transported to an alternate fantasy world, and then through the natural consequence of being a baseline human in such a world, dies shortly after. He than loops back the beginning, and, well, shit happens.

The biggest thing I like about this story is how seriously it takes the mental trauma associated with looping. Zorian from MoL doesn't really have that many bad deaths, the only really bad one I can remember is right after the Aranea massacre, where he took a restart off to get his head back in the game. On the other hand, one of the first deaths the MC from Re;Zero experiences is a slow, painful death from disembowelment that lasted hours. The anime does a great job showing the mental trauma that will accumulate from these types of painful deaths.

As to whether the show is rational or not, is up for debate. The MC isn't a genius, which can be said for most anime MCs, but he's in way over his head and under a great deal of mental strain so I think he can be forgiven. He does display a fair amount of insight and level-headiness when the situation demands for it. There hasn't been that much worldbuilding to declare if the world is coherent or not.

The animation, music, voice acting, everything is top notch. There's going to be 25 episodes so far, but I won't be surprised if the studio decides to adapt the rest of the story, given how popular it's been lately.
