I agree that the animation, music, etc. is really well done. The first two episodes really hooked me as well. But after that ... I don't know. I find the main character to be a little bit too inhuman in terms of his responses, even if you assume that he's suffering from some kind of psychological break, and there are times when the whole thing just falls into this pit of generic anime-ness without any redeeming self-awareness or meta commentary. I think those first two episodes led me to expect that it was going to be some kind of a deconstruction like /Madoka/ was for magical girls, but it's really not that, it only has a few trappings of being a deconstruction. Overall, I'm fairly disappointed with it.
