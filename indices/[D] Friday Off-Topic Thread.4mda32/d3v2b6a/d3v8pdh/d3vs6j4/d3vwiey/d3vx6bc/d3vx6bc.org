Someone mentioned in the discussion threads that the whole reason for the slice-of-life stuff was to get the viewers more attached to the characters, thus making subsequent episodes have a greater impact. Apparently the author, when he started writing this, set out to break a lot of anime tropes, so I think we'll be fine after this. If it makes you feel any better, I'm fairly certain the loop he's currently on (the one that started on Ep 8) will be the last one for this checkpoint.

The next arc is supposed to be a lot better than previous ones and will also explain some stuff from the first arc, as well as being incredibly sadistic to Subaru (enough that sales actually decreased in Japan for the LN).
