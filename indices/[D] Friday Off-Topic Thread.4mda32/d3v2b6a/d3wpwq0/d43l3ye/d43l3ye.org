  just look at the protagonist who one moment behaves like the typical gamer, the next like a playboy and the next again like a shounen protagonist, except without the power

He's a simple, happy-go-lucky guy. Which is the /completely wrong kind of protagonist/ to stumble into a violent time-loop story.

He overcompensates, and /tries/ to be a playboy or shounen hero or caricature of himself when he thinks he must. But it's not sustainable, and cracks appear more and more frequently in the facade. I think he's actually quite a believable character.

I can't say as much for most of the other characters. But then again we do not get as big a window into their souls. I can only hope their oddities will eventually get a satisfying explanation.
