No.

Like, no.

The anime has incredible potential, but the characterization is completely broken and insensate (just look at the protagonist who one moment behaves like the typical gamer, the next like a playboy and the next again like a shounen protagonist, except without the power), and characters holding the idiot ball are all over the damn place.

It's a huge pity, this could have really been awesome. But it isn't.
