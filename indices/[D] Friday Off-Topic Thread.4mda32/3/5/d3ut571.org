  I'm that guy...pretty much exactly. I am an undergraduate physics student who believes I know how to communicate with spirits that do not physically interact with the world and I have never come across any evidence to suggest I possess a mental disorder.

What does the process entail and is it possible to reproduce it? I come from a family of practicing black magicians on my father's side but so far I haven't found any evidence that any of their methods work.

I already tried to reproduce the experiments on the Quabbalah when I was younger and got no result from it so my stance on magic and spiritual realms is that it doesn't work but I'd love to be proved wrong.
