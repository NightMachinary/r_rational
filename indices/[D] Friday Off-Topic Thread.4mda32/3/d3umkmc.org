[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/][Remember when EY presented a hypothetical scientist who believed in non-physical spirits, but was otherwise a competent scientist?]] I'm that guy...pretty much exactly. I am an undergraduate physics student who believes I know how to communicate with spirits that do not physically interact with the world and I have never come across any evidence to suggest I possess a mental disorder.

I'd rather not cease to believe in spirits due to a lack of objective evidence because that would mean losing the benefits I receive from communicating with them, but I'd also rather not be a bad rationalist because rationality is incredibly useful. My beliefs stem from New Age spiritualism, though in recent years I have abandoned the pseudoscience associated with that belief system after I learned the truth.
