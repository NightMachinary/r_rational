If the psychological benefits are real, they're measurable. Are you saner when you talk to the spirits? Does the population of people who say they talk to spirits have a statistically significant benefit in psychological health?

Do you have enough bits of evidence to outweigh the null hypothesis that it's all just your regular meatbrain tricking itself as per usual?

Gah, nevermind. You opened with the article on this. But it also sounds like [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/][Belief in belief]] is coming into play.

  My beliefs stem from New Age spiritualism, though in recent years I have abandoned the pseudoscience associated with that belief system after I learned the truth.

Have you? Really? I like the [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Tarski][Litany of Tarski]]. It's phrased amusingly liturgically:

If spirits exist, I desire to believe that spirits exist.

If Spirits do not exist, I desire to believe that spirits do not exist.

Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.
