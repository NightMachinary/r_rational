What if you write ten numbers on ten strips of paper, close your eyes, mix them up, then place one under a cup. Bet a friend five credits that you'll correctly guess the number under the cup. Next time you project, ask which number is under the cup so you can win five credits.

Out of curiosity, how /do/ you get out of the car? Just believing isn't enough, as it seems you need the skill to astral project in the first place; how did you gain that skill?
