I already did that and even when they were forthcoming (see the green bat comment) the details tend to be...fuzzy. Sensation and observation during astral projection is often abstract and dreamlike with few concrete details, not to mention how much my thoughts tend to color my perceptions since the experience is purely mental. Even communication is based on sharing ideas and feelings rather than using words to describe them. Not that I haven't had intellectual discussion with spirits, I have and enjoy having them.
