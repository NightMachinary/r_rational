Basically, I think I'm astral projecting to the afterlife. It's a nice place filled with friendly people who are happy to talk to me and help me live a healthy live, despite my attempts at self sabotage. They don't like giving me objective information since they say it's better for me to figure it out for myself. Sorry for responding to these comments out of order.
