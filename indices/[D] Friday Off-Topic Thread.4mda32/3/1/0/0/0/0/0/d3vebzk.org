Your reasoning is impeccable, but I've already tried that. When I realized that certain parts of my map were inaccurate (pseudoscience that supported my spiritual beliefs), I reexamined the territory more closely only to find the implication that experiences important to my way of living had never occurred. The most logical course of action was to become an materialist atheist, but I have found that path impossible to follow and attempting to do so caused me nothing but depression.

In The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, the author theorizes and presents some compelling, though not conclusive, evidence that religious belief may have a genetic component. Given my utter failure at being happy while believing in materialist atheism I am inclined to believe as well that atheists lack the genetics for "religious experience". As a result, they gain no psychological benefit from religious practice and have difficulty comprehending why anyone would.

When I ceased to believe my map was accurate, I felt a void within myself that I had never felt before. The only way I could fill the void was by convincing myself that the really important parts of my map were still accurate, it was just the unimportant parts surrounding them that I'd been wrong about. The doubt returns from time to time however, and with it comes dread at the possibility that my memories related to spiritual experiences are false. I must find a new way.
