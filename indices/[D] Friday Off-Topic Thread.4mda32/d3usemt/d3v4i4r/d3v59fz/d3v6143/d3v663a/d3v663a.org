No probs actually I like it because it could be good inspiration for the rational fic.

  It's nothing out of the ordinary for mangas.

Yeah now that makes me wonder if we're just too used to low quality works or its just a cultural thing that makes them resort to the same plot devices.

In addition its nice to have someone to discuss the anime and manga with given that its fairly obscure. When it aired it had to compete with other works like Fate/Zero and Hyouka which made it even harder for it to be recognized.
