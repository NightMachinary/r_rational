Chapter 14. Getting around the plot-device dementia ought to have been the protagonist's driving goal from the moment he discovered the grandfather's connection to the book. And then the scientist shows up, she's sane (mad-scientist theatrics aside), and if nothing else she might be open to trade.

But instead the major characters do the [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][other kind of Hollywood Zombie]] thing. They just carry on with their routine lives as if nothing had changed, waiting for solutions to drift into their lap or for the next crisis. (While the minor characters just take everything in stride, full NPC mode.)

This is starting to sound harsher than I mean it. It's nothing out of the ordinary for mangas.

 

edit: huh. Chapter 15-16 made huge progress on getting characters to talk to each other. I wish the whole manga was on that level.
