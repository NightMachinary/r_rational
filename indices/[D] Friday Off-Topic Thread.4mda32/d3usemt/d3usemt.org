This week I binge watched/read a really fucked up anime/manga called [[http://myanimelist.net/manga/18597/Sankarea][Sankarea]]. It starts as an ecchi romcom that later develops into a really interesting romance-drama and that I'm thinking could be easily tweaked into a rational story with Transhuman elements.

Its about a zombie obsessed guy that finds a formula to create undead in his basement and in a fit of hubris decides to try it to bring his dead cat back to life. In his quest for undead creation he befriends Rea, a girl with a really fucked up family that in typical anime fashion doesn't find his "hobbies" weird and decides to help him with his little experiment.

After certain complications that include Rea stealing some of the apparently failed formula and her attempt at commiting suicide with it, they discover the last experiment was successful and ends up bringing the cat back to un-life and turning Rea into a zombie.

The story follows the protagonist's attempts to keep Rea and the cat from decomposing and finding a way to completely bring them back to life.

The zombies are really interesting as they retain their memories, personality and rationality unlike more traditional "rage zombies" but with time start losing sectors of their brain that make them confuse love and lust with huger. They are perfectly capable of planning and premeditated action in the first stages of the zombie state, just changing their goals towards eating those closest to them without even realizing it which makes them more dangerous than typical zombies.

I think it could make a great rational story about a protagonist attempting to perfect the cure for death. Ironically the grandfather with senile dementia that only acts as exposition and comic relief in the anime is closer to our rational protagonists and has a bigger role in the manga as he [[#s][Sankarea]].

I found it oddly inspiring and would like to expand on that premise once my schedule's more free.

The anime has nice music and animations, particularly the camera angles are really good in a SHAFT like fashion but the manga is way better with a bigger focus on the reanimation process, the state of zombies and going way waaay darker in later issues as Rea's condition worsens while the anime only covers the first arc and takes a more Slice of Life/Romance focus.
