Yeah, I doubt I could /really/ take it seriously. Make effort to improve, watch videos on heroes and maps, seek out tips: these are all things I do. But I doubt I'd go to LAN parties or seek to join or start an established team. Of course, "video game I take seriously" is already a slot that's filled by Melee.

I've never really played CS. I've done tutorial and bot stuff in CSGO a few times, in an attempt to familiarize myself enough to go online, but there's just something about Source games that I don't really like.
