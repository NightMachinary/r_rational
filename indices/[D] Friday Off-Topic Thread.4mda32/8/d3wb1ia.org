I've recently been reading Legendary Moonlight Sculptor. It's about someone in poverty playing a video game to make money to send his sister to uni. It's about one of those virtual reality games, in the same vein as SAO, but without the 'you die here, you die for real' aspect. The main character, username Weed, spends a year training in swordplay, martial arts, and the like before entering into the game itself, so he's playing with a much better understanding of combat than most other players. Combine that with a complete willingness to grind all day every day and you get an overpowered character. The real bullshit comes in with his class. Not only does he obtain a secret class from an ancient emperor, but he also gets a bullshit sword style from the emperor's legacy. This class is sort of like a DnD mage, in that it starts off weak, lacking in the bonus to chosen weapon damage that other melee and archery classes would have and being unable to cast spells, but ends up growing to insane levels via it's ability to master all general skills such as cooking, smithing, tailoring, repairing and, in particular, sculpting. Sculpting is the main aspect, as his strongest skills depend on it for bonus damage, but reaching each milestone in any of the other general skills gives stat points that could only be obtained by levelling up or grinding for points a la The Gamer.

Anyway, I'm rambling here but the point is that it's a good read. It's not what I'd call rational, but it's well translated and a fun time. I'm under a third of the way into the amount of material that's currently been translated, though, so I'm expecting some major power ups to occur.
