I've been autobanned from some just for commenting on [[/r/tumblrinaction]] back in the day. Other than that, I got banned from [[/r/askreddit]] once because someone said they didn't believe in NSFW tags and I replied to a link to Blue Waffles, and once from [[/r/politics]] for calling someone a shill after they posted 196 pro Hillary comments in one day.
