So apparently it is possible to be so deep into fitness that you stop caring about the taste of food...

After [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn-KDTxTWqI][Dom's video]] I started paying more attention to my eating habits and to my thinking process when I decide on foods. And I have realized that I had pushed it to such an extreme limit that taste completely stopped being a value I evaluate when deciding which food to eat...

It's impressive how fast the shift happened as well. Less than 6 years ago I was obese, had no knowledge of nutrition and loved good-tasting foods. Now, 6 years later, if a meal doesn't have protein I don't even pay attention to it.

Not sure if to be happy or worried about this change.
