How far have you gotten? Because the reason I am suggesting this is because I caught up a few days ago, and Ep 7+8 both have what you were asking. That is, with as little of a spoiler as possible, the mental strain starts catching upto him then and we start seeing him breakdown.

I actually wouldn't have recommended this if I hadn't see those two episodes.
