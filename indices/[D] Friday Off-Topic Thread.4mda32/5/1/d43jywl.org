Thanks for the recommendation. I'm enjoying it a lot so far.

In no small part because of how seriously it treats violence and death - even though it's a time-loop story set in (what usually appears to be) a happy fun-time anime fantasy world. The dissonance works really, really well.

I agree with [[/u/alexanderwales]] that the anime fun-time gets pretty old, but I'm willing to power past that.
