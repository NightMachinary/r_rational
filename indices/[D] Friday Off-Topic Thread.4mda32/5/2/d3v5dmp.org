Neat, I've read that this and Kanbaru of the Iron Fortress are the top runners of this season.

About Re:Zero, I interpreted it as a mix between KonoSuba and Erased with the timeloop and fantasy world. Definitely will try it.

I started Joker Game which seemed to have a rather interesting premise and handle things seriously but left it for a bit and a friend said it went off the rails.
