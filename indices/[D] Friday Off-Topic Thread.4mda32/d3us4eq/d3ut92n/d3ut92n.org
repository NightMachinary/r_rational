Yup, I've been banned from a few, though I have trouble remembering their names and nothing of value was lost. Some mods like to ban based on what opinions you express, no matter how calm, reasonable, and well-sourced you are. Some will even ban pre-emptively, without you setting foot in the subreddit. (It's not like ban evasion takes effort either.)
