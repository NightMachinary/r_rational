Do you know if there's any relationship between kaizen and wabi-sabi ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi][侘寂]]), other than their obvious contrast with one another? It's sort of my understanding (gained purely through reading Wikipedia) that kaizen is something of an imported and/or Western adaptation, so this might just be a contrast between cultures?
