For what's it is worth. 改善 (kaizen), definitely has a business feel to it, although it isn't exclusively for business.

Here's some [[http://jisho.org/search/%E6%94%B9%E5%96%84%20%23sentences][example sentences]] with English translation. That being said, a loan word doesn't always have the same meaning in other languages.

And /that/ being said, I've never heard "kaizen" used in English, so I think that making a word for the concept you're trying to get across would still be useful.
