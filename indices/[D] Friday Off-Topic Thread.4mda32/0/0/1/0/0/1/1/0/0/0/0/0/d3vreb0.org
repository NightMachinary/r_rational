  Perfectly valid communication but it doesn't make "I will love you forever" an alternate definition of eight.
#+end_quote

I disagree. In context, for that strange little couple, the word 'eight' does mean "I'll love you forever." Would that get it included in a dictionary? Probably not. Things don't get included in a dictionary unless enough people use a word to mean something.

Again, words mean whatever people mean when they say them. What else could they possibly mean?

#+begin_quote
  Can you come up with a grammatically correct sentence where it's ambiguous whether the word "and" is used as a conjunction or to refer to the word itself?
#+end_quote

Maybe? Why would I need to? [[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/and][And has multiple definitions that are commonly used depending on context.]]

#+begin_quote
  I don't understand the relevance of your second point.
#+end_quote

"The ambiguity only exists in English," is not a valid criticism, because I'm not trying to make a universal claim that apply to all languages that can express the concept of eight. I'm making a claim only about the English word "eight."
