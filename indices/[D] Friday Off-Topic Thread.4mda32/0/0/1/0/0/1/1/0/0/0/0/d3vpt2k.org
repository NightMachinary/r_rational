"Say eight if you'll love me forever."

"Eight."

Perfectly valid communication but it doesn't make "I will love you forever" an alternate definition of eight.

Can you come up with a grammatically correct sentence where it's ambiguous whether the word "and" is used as a conjunction or to refer to the word itself?

I don't understand the relevance of your second point.
