I did a reverse search for 向上心, which has that meaning applied to oneself. Some derivative of "aspiration" or "to aspire" is the accompanying translation. From OED:

#+begin_quote
  *aspirational* /adjective/ having or characterised by aspirations to achieve social prestige and material success
#+end_quote

That doesn't have the meaning of "better" or "positive utility", though.

Your best bet is to reverse search "change for the better" or "progressive" or "strive for change" in other languages, then translate their in-language definitions back to English. Using "progressive" I found the French "évolutif", which based on [[http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-definition/%C3%A9volutif][this]] may indicate it's close to what you want, but based on [[http://www.wordreference.com/fren/%C3%A9volutif][this]] one would conclude otherwise.
