We seriously need a word for "a purpose which isn't meant to achieve any higher purpose"- like the survival imperative, or love for another person, but also things like an aesthetic preference, or an addiction.

I feel like peoples' motivations are one of the most common and important topics of discussion, but the absence of a word like that can make those discussions very difficult. For example, if a purpose is just a means to an end, it's possible to use reason to convince a person to abandon it, but not if it isn't. That's a distinction that's important in everyday life, but unnecessarily difficult to communicate.

The lack of a word like that also prevents people from arguing over and forming consensuses about what are and aren't means to ends, which I think has contributed to us as a civilization having a very poor understanding of what we're all driven by.

Also, a word that describes when two things are correlated because they're caused by a third thing could be useful.
