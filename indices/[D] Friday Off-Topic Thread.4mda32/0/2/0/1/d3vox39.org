Yeah this is my default social tactic when someone is acting more aggressive than is needed.

If someone is really socially oblivious, and ignores that obvious deescalation because they don't understand it (as opposed to ignoring it on purpose) then sometimes you need to take them aside and explain explicitly what they've done wrong.

If someone is really itching for a fight, you either become aggressive back, and hope they're bluffing (unblinking eye contact helps), or submit tacitly and hope the rest of the group doesn't like the other person enough to include them in the future.

edit:

thanks for the correction!
