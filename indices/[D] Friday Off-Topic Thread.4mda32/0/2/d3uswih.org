I don't know if that one has a concept word, but there are a variety of creative ways to insult someone who is getting aggressive at a perceived insult. "U mad bro?" is one of them, but there are several that work well in person (for certain values of "well"). This isn't usually a good idea though, since it won't improve the social move, and will in fact be a real insult, probably making the situation worse.

This doesn't stop people from doing it though. Accusations of people being "butthurt" when someone responds to an insult are common amongst teenagers and young adults. Same with "don't get your panties in a bunch," which is both insulting /and/ dismissive (and sexist!). I've definitely seen people laugh off perceived insults because of things like these, but yeah, probably not what you're looking for.
