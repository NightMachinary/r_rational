I have tried to do what you're suggesting, and I haven't had much success. I also find James Randi's track record discouraging to my prospects. I don't know how to teach you how to do it, I just experimented with different techniques until I found one that worked. Now I can do it whenever I focus properly, but when I'm stressed I often forget how.

I know it sounds like magic in Kiki's Delivery Service, but I didn't watch that film until long after I'd discovered my problem with projecting. Besides, that plot point was a metaphor for artistic skills where you just have off days you have trouble explaining. The mind is a complicated thing that we don't completely understand, and what I do is completely mental.
