It's basically just meditation. I read about the practice of astral projection and managed to do it myself. I've also practiced a very abstract magic system in the past, but when I discovered I was justifying my belief in it with pseudoscience I stopped and now when I try again it doesn't always work. I can't be sure if any of my magic had physical effects, but it certainly helped me psychologically and I miss that.

I'm in the opposite position as you. My Mom is reiki practitioner, though she doesn't charge for it and never recommends it over medicine, but I've had trouble doing it myself lately or even feeling when she does it on me. I especially miss that, it always helped me calm down and think, which is especially useful when I'm stressed. Whatever this is I've come to the conclusion faith is what makes it work, which runs rather contrary to science doesn't it?
