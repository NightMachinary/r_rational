/1. This is intended more as a discussion input than a possible advice. 2. I'll try using an analogy from the same LW article you've linked to, but no other ideas from LW will be implied or referred to./

#+begin_quote
  It isn't possible to produce an accurate map of a city while sitting in your living room with your eyes closed, thinking pleasant thoughts about what you wish the city was like.
#+end_quote

Let's say you have a certain piece of map that is able to give certain benefits to you --- namely, it is able to serve as a rather effective coping mechanism and stress reliever. To keep this map in your possession, however, you have to restrict yourself from going into that area of real territory and comparing there how closely your special map-piece represents that landscape.

Will the rational choice to make be checking the real territory no matter what, just for the sake of scepticism? Or scepticism itself serves a purpose for you, and the choice should be made after comparing pros and cons of all possible stances?

Right now, as I understand it, your potentially-inaccurate map has the following markings on it: 1. “there exists at least some afterlife”, 2. “there exist at least some intelligent and friendly sophonts in the afterlife”, 3. “at least in some cases communication between our world and afterlife is possible”.

So the comparison between not-checking and checking the map's accuracy breaks down into at least the following PROs and CONs:

Not checking

- + powerful coping mechanism \ stress reliever
- - information about reality that has a high chance of being inaccurate

  - - risk of being manipulated by others through the beliefs you hold
  - - making important life choices based on high-importance (top-consideration) assumptions that are potentially inaccurate
  - - risk of gradually acquiring a blind-sided worldview which will hinder deep-level understanding of how reality works

Checking

- - coping mechanism likely diminishing in effectiveness or being lost altogether
- + ability to determine just how accurate the piece of map was

  - + /[opposite of the above-listed]/

Furthermore, the (+) coping mechanism could likely either be replaced with others (using CBT, as an example), or just preserved through some mental work.

  but I can't talk to them when I don't believe they are separate from myself

I don't know how relevant it will be in your case, but I've discovered on myself, at least, that it is possible to enter a “make-belief belief” mode /while/ having the hard-atheism as the top-tier world-view. In my case it's not about afterlife, though, so I don't know how relevant this could be for you.
