You are correct that my faith is a barrier against existential crisis, I have had more than one since I began doubting, and the instinct it fulfills is to discover the Truth. I started exploring New Age spiritualism out of a desire to gain spiritual enlightenment and understand the Truth about topics like God, the afterlife, and supernatural phenomena. I did not follow my beliefs for their own sake, but because I believed they were the path to Truth. I chose to become a student of science for the same reason.

I reached the point where I was happy and motivated to keep working, but then I discovered the skeptic community. Suddenly, science threatened many of my beliefs and I listened because I love science as much as spirituality. I had to know if I was right to believe what I did, but with my newfound skepticism I found it impossible to know if anything I believed was right. I told myself that my memories were not false, but I still doubt myself and fear losing my faith and the good things that came with it.

My faith gave me a sense of empowerment in life and harmony with the world, while rationality taught me to feel disempowered in the face of the chaos surrounding me so I could change it. They were able to coexist for the longest time, until I realized my faith was not and could not be accepted by rationality because the only part of it that really existed was my subjective experience, which I should distrust to avoid bias. The result has been an existential dread that comes and goes.
