I almost touched the subject of possible genetic predisposition of humans towards religion in my original comment, actually. Eventually decided against it to not unnecessarily derail the discussion if that wasn't what you were (partially) asking about.

  but I have found that path impossible to follow and attempting to do so caused me nothing but depression

Does this mean that it's not only (merely) a powerful coping mechanism for you but also what feels either like a necessary barrier against existential crisis or like an instinct to fulfil (e.g. akin to building a family, having children, etc)?

  The doubt returns from time to time however, and with it comes dread at the possibility that my memories related to spiritual experiences are false.

Well, if what you're looking for is faith \ religion for their own sake, then shouldn't it automatically become unnecessary trying to prove their validity? In other words, if in both cases --- of your beliefs a) being true and b) not being true --- you'd've to make yourself believe that they were true lest you became depressed, then shouldn't finding out how true they really are be pointless? Your end-goal is preserving your beliefs in either case, so you can just decide for yourself to keep believing, with no proofs necessary \ required.

  I must find a new way.

You could also try experimenting with this “religious instinct”, trying to find which patterns of thought activate \ satisfy it, etc. This could potentially help you devise your own toolset for achieving that “religious experience”. Simple, yet working religious system that is intentionally maximally isolated from aspects of the material world could maybe help keeping the positive effects of both bullet-lists.

p.s. If your standing assumption is that:

#+begin_quote
  atheists lack the genetics for "religious experience". As a result, they gain no psychological benefit from religious practice and have difficulty comprehending why anyone would.
#+end_quote

then perhaps you could ask for additional advice from places like [[/r/exchristian]] /(just as an example --- I don't know how good that particular sub-comunity actually is)/. If there are people who were non-forced believers before who managed to become atheists without sacrificing their happiness, then your worsened psychological state should've had other explanations than you being intrinsically religious.
