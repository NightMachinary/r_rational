Yeah, when I first began talking to them that's basically the answer they gave when I asked that kind of question. They say it is vitally important that I choose to "get out of the car" without being influenced as to what that entails, otherwise my experience will be colored by their statements and therefore limited.

Oddly enough, I think I've already done it. It's when I got back in the car and listened to some very intelligent people explain why it was impossible to know that anything exists outside the car because every scientific test of outside phenomena has failed to detect anything outside that I began to doubt whether I'd ever left the car at all.

Then suddenly, I couldn't get back out of the car. I couldn't feel the connection to the world beyond the windshield I had loved, or hear the ones I'd met outside anymore. I eventually convinced myself that my disbelief was doing more harm than good and was able to leave the car again, but my skepticism keeps trapping me in.

I started this conversation because I have been unable to reconcile my scientist side and spiritualist side. Each time I think they've arrived at an agreement they end up back in conflict because I cannot purge myself of doubt even though I believe both to be true. It may simply be overzealous self-criticism, but it won't stop.
