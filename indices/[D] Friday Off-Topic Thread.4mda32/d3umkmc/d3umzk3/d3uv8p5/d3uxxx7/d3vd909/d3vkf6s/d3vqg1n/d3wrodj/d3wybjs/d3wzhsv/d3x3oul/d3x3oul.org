Apparently they disagree and believe spiritual knowledge is of a different nature than scientific knowledge. When I asked them they admitted to not having the full answer since they're still discovering knowledge too. My hypothesis is that it has to do with the cycle of life, death, and reincarnation.

I believe our souls come from There and choose to forget what we know so we can learn from our life experience. It's unprovable, of course, but it makes sense based on my experience and would indicate spirits are rational from their own perspective. They said I was more or less correct.
