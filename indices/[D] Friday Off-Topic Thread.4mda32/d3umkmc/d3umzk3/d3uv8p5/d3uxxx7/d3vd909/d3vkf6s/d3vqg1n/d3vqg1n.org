The spirits I communicate with have likewise refused to offer evidence of their existence, and I kind of understand why. Spiritual enlightenment is not based on knowledge, but wisdom. Teaching people that wisdom is real and good will not help them to achieve wisdom because it cannot be achieved through a particular process like knowledge can. I recommend reading the part of Siddhartha where he converses with the Buddha for more specifics.
