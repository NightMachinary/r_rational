They do want you to believe enlightenment exists, but they do not want to tell you what enlightenment actually does to you. They worry that by giving you information that you do not discover yourself, you will not benefit as much from it since you are likely to misunderstand what they say and arrive at an inaccurate conclusion.

In the book, Buddha tells Siddhartha that he is founding a religion so that people will live spiritually healthy lives and be encouraged to pursue enlightenment, but agrees with Siddhartha that no one will achieve enlightenment just by following the Buddha's teachings. Most spirits seem to be of the same opinion.

As I understand it, perceiving and communicating with spirits has no medium between them and your mind, which makes what you see and hear even more vulnerable to bias than it normally is. When astral projecting, you are not using your normal senses and your mind has difficulty interpreting the experience in the context of your physical life.
