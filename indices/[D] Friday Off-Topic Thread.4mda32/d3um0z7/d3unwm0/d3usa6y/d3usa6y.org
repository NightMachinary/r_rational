On the other hand, if you're not stating something explicitly, you need to imply it really really hard. A mystery is always more obvious to the author than to the readers.

When you're dropping hints, do so liberally. For every ten clues you leave the readers will find one, misinterpret a second, dismiss a third as a red herring, and then find twelve more things that weren't meant to be clues at all and go on to weave an intricate and completely wrong web of conspiracy when the real answer was all-but-explicitly stated a hundred times.
