I stand by "make it as obvious as you can get away with". Even setting aside hindsight bias, most "accurate predictions" are just one candidate theory among many. And your Shocking Twist is probably complex enough that people can be partially correct about it - they may suspect that so-and-so and such-and-such are the same person, while being wrong about that person's real allegiance.

And even if somebody does guess the twist in advance... so what? They'll feel clever. They'll probably enjoy the story more, if it flatters their intelligence briefly and doesn't take five pages to explain the patently obvious (YES /DA VINCI CODE/ I AM LOOKING AT YOU). It's not a competition; if the reader wants to "win" the "game", let them.
