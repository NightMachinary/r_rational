A little bit of Flicker's background that I've wanted to find the right place to include for years. Inspired by the H. Beam Piper story "Omnilingual", which affected me strongly when I was quite young.

Also, for those that are interested (I didn't put up a separate post because it's not really rational content), I did a short bit on character appearances. If you are curious what Flicker, Stella, and Yiskah look like in my head when I'm writing them, you can get an idea here: [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/182880503096/appearances]]
