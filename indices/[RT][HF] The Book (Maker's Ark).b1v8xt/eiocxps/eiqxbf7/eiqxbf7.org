pretty cool concept of self-development of language using scientific text. Just read through "Omnilingual", and it seems that the key to it is pattern recognition across multiple sources. AI could be used to identify such patterns of writing. From a certain perspective, this discovery of the world seems to be what a lot of AI research is about, with computer vision for example. The computer has no idea what the array of colours of photos means it must first identify patterns from the noise.
