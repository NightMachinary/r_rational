That was sort of the point in the show already, wasn't it? It's not like even Chidi started out as a paragon of moral consistency, even if we're initially misled to think he's one of the most morally good people of his era. They /all/ started out taking the premise of their situation for granted, and they /all/ ended up questioning and ultimately dismantling that system as they became wiser people, even addressing pretty much the exact flaws with the concept of ranking people by moral worth in the first place that you bring up. Wouldn't the fix fic you're describing just accelerate the outcome of the actual show?

(Spoiler tags in case you haven't actually gotten to those parts. I had the same objections as you after watching the first season and before watching the others, so it's possible.)
