I want to give a perhaps weak counter-argument. The people who enter the good place are supposed to be the 'ideal' versions of themselves, the main cast included, so it makes sense that they wouldn't change much. They've already had literal lifetimes to figure out who they were, it's likely that human conceptions of change don't apply to them
