I feel like the Good Place being boring because they just give you everything was a legitimate problem, but suicide booths were not the solution.

I think the solution would be to make sure you still have a challenge. Instead of Jason just seeing the monkeys riding go karts, he should have trained them himself and maybe even built the go karts. Sort of like how on the beginning of the last level he played a videogame an gave himself a challenge rather than just cheating his way through it.
