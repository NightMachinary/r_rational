I don't think memory resetting would have fit. The heaven they came up with was largely about people having as much time as they needed for personal growth. That meant different things for each character, but they all spent their eternities becoming more complete, developed versions of themselves. To erase their progress just for the sake of doing it over again, like a rat on a wheel, would defeat the purpose. (Plus, having a jeremy bearimy's worth of your memories wiped doesn't strike me as meaningfully different from that version of you dying.)
