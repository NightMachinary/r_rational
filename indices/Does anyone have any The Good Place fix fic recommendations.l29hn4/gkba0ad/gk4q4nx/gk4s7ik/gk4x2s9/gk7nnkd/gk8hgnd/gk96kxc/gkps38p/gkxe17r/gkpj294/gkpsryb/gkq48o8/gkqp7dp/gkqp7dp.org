Doesn't Eleanor also end up remembering all of her timelines with Michael in the library? Or am I misremembering things?

In either case, they're "ideal" versions of themselves because they've given up all of the things that gave them angst. Eleanor made up with her mother, and was able to contextualize her actions. Tahani fixed her relationship to her sister. Jason came to an understanding with his dad, and was able to make sure Pillboi would stay on the straight and narrow for the rest of his life.

This is not a very strong argument, and I realize that. They certainly could have had other reasons to change, and probably should have in some ways. I think that the primary reason they didn't have the characters change was because they didn't want them to seem unrelatable in the last few episodes of the story. I wish we got more of the Good place and the lives of the characters within it, despite knowing that it would very likely be boring and uninteresting.

That being said, I do think that the writers of the show had one very good reason for not changing the characters too much. I think that if they had, it might have gone against the message of the show. The show is a critique of Western philosophy, especially Western ideas of ethics. Western philosophers (at least the ones taught in my classes) tend to view being ethical as about being a certain type of person with certain capabilities. For example, Kant viewed ethical people as being the most rational, and his conditions for rationality were more strict than I think is appropriate. /The Good place/ rejects this idea. This is why we see Chidi get dunked on so much in the show; he's a moral philosopher who gets sent to the Bad place for overthinking things. Instead, the show says that in order to be a good person, all you have to do is try to be good, and that you'll get there eventually. If the characters went to the good place and changed substantially, that might have sent the message that you can only be good if you act a certain way. For example, if Jason suddenly started liking reading books, then it might have sent the message that you have to be literate in order to be good, which is not the message the show wanted to send.
