I mean, there is nothing that says that a particular person has to want to do literally every single thing that it's possible to do. Also, were you expecting them to show every character doing literally every thing? I think the general point of "I've lived a very long time in paradise, and I've done a bunch of stuff, and had a bunch of experiences, and now I'm done" is probably relatively close to what would happen. You personally would want to do more things than the characters did. That's totally reasonable. I'm just not sure what you want from the show. I think they handled it as well as it could possible be handled without having some kind of Narrator voice say "They all did all the possible things before they got bored". That was the first show I'd ever seen that even implied that it was possible to live for meaningfully longer amounts of time than the standard human life time and to not get bored. As far as rational takes on eternal life, this is by far one of the better ones from pop culture.
