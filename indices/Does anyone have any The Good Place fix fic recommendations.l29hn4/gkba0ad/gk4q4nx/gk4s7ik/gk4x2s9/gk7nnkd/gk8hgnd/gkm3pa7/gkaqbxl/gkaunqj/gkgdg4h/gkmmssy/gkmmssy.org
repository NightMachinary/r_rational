I think the show made it pretty clear that the characters were not ok with being rebooted anymore, after having it forced on them for centuries. Also, for some definitions of personhood etc., being rebooted is no longer "eternal" life, it's just the same chunk of life being done over and over again. I'm not sure how being rebooted is that meaningfully different from choosing to end yourself. And while the show could have gone in that route (have Janet break physics/whatever to make eternal life so obviously good that no one would ever leave it), I'm not sure I would have preferred it. It would have stopped saying anything interesting or useful about the human condition, which was pretty much the entire point of the show. Additionally, if Janet /could/ do something like that, then why wouldn't the original heaven have gone that route. I think that the failure of heaven 1.0 pretty much demonstrates that Janet doesn't have the ability to just make humans love having the same experiences over and over again. The only real difference between heaven 1.0 and heaven 2.0 was an option to leave.

I'm sure some humans, given the choices you have presented, would take them. I also think some wouldn't. All I'm trying to push back against is the idea that the characters making the choice they made is somehow "non-rationalist". Living for millennia, doing a whole bunch of stuff, and deciding you aren't interested in doing more stuff doesn't seem to violate any kind of rational fiction guidelines that would require a "fix fic" the way that OP is suggesting. As far as I can tell, most rationalists/transhumanists/whatever want to have the /option/ to live forever. They don't want to force people to actually do it.

If the show tried to make the argument that living for millennia/eternally was /bad/, then yeah, that wouldn't really fit the the ethos. But all they said was "give eternal life, but don't force people to stay in it". If there is no escape route, then it's just a more gilded hell. And, having made that message, from a Doylist perspective, they pretty much had to make the characters choose that option just to give the show closure.
