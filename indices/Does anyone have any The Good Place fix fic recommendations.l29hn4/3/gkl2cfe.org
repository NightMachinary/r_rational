Fix: Human memories are finite, so by the time someone's experienced a good portion of everything they could possibly do, they'll have forgotten most of it.

I found it a bit baffling they didn't just give people the option to reset their memories after a while, given that was an established mechanic of the show.

That said, I feel like it was less of a critique of immortality and more a critique of peoples' idea of heaven. Being able to do anything with no conflict would be... lackluster. Though considering chronic boredom is a symptom of depression, I'm not not fond that people could read the show as "if you don't enjoy life, end it all".
