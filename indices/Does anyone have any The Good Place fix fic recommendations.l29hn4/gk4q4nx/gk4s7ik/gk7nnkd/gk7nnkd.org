There are a finite number of arrangements matter can exist in within a given volume of space (however large that volume is, as long as it's finite), and therefore, there are a limited number of thoughts and experiences it is possible to have. I'm not one of those pro-death people or someone who thinks that eternal life would be some sort of curse, but I do think that, given eternity, folks will eventually have experienced everything. So unless you additionally have limited memory and can re-experience old things as new (which I think some people would also have a problem with), I think anyone would eventually get bored. You will eventually have read every book (and maybe even written every book), and explored every possible planet, and mastered every possible pursuit. While some people would probably be fine with this end state of affairs (I have no idea how I would react since I literally can't conceive of it), it isn't shocking to me that some people would not want it to continue and choose to leave. Given eternity, some people /will/ have trained the monkeys, and built the gokarts and mined the materials and coded the video game, and every other conveivalbe thing that you can do. Eternity is a long time, and the Good Place is purposefully (and appropriately) vague on how long they have been there before opting out.
