I don't think that's correct. I'm pretty sure that in a finite space, atoms can only be arranged a finite number of ways. I don't see how your book example disproves that. The point about the good place and physics is true, but at that point you can just argue whatever you want and say that the good place has special non physics laws that allow it.
