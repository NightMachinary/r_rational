Given a finite but arbitrarily large amount of space, you can have infinite arrangements. (Ex. There is an infinite sequence of unique books where the first book is 1 page long, second is 2 pages long, third is 3 pages long... even though each book in the sequence has a finite amount of pages).

Of course, that's not even getting into the fact that tgp doesn't even give a fork about the laws of physics.
