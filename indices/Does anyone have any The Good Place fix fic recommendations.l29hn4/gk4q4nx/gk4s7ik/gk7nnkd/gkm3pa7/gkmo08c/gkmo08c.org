I also enjoy doing things I've done many times over. And I absolutely agree that having the option for eternal life, and having the time to figure out how it works, is the more ideal option compared to "doesn't matter what you think, you are going to end after 100ish years". However, I'm not sure how valid it is to extrapolate from having had a bunch of avocados for a few decades compares to having already done every meaningful thing it is possible to do after a few billion years.

I'm sure that some people would, as you suggest, be perfectly happy repeating enjoyable things for eternity. I'm also relatively confident that some people wouldn't. The show happened to show us some people who weren't. I'm not sure that's something that requires a fix.
