The only way to milk infinite experience out of infinite sets such as memorising more and more numbers of Pi would be to render yourself functionally insane by being enamored by an endless trivial pursuit.\\
Eventually there would be no more physical laws to learn, no more new ideas to be had, just an endless monotony of finding which of the 10 digits show up next. Repeated to infinity.

That's not life. That is worse than death.\\
This is pretty much true for any technical infinity people come up with, they usually rely on zooming in on some mathematical constant further and further until it loses all meaning outside itself.

Ergo, you would run out, and want to move on.

(I enjoyed reading your post, :) )

Some people might cheat the system by erasing their own memory, but some people would consider that death by another name.
