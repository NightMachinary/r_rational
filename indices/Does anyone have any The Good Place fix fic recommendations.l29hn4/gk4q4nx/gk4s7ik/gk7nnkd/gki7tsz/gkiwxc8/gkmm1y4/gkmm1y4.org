I mean, technically you probably can, in the same way that pi never repeats even using only 10 digits (especially if you consider "n+1" to be a distinct ordering from n). However, your brain is made up of atoms, so your brain state can only exist in so many configurations, which means that the majority of those "infinite orderings" of experiences result in the same brain state as a different ordering of experiences, which means that, while mathematically distinct, from a practical standpoint for the human experiencing them, they aren't any different.
