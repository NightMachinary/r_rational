Carmin is a threat.

The PRT/Protectorate has seen one use of Carmin's power... and it killed six people and injured a dozen more in the space of 5 minutes when she felt threatened.

Presto probably isn't in any danger... true, because she has powers. The building and any civilians who are in a 200 foot radius... however.

Carmin's power is dangerous... her control is tenuous at this point... Presto doesn't know the limits of it (All the experimenting was done with Carmin's friend, not a Protectorate member.)

If something had gone wrong, if Carmin had folded up the car, or put a pit trap in the parking garage, or booby trapped the shifter... Is Presto just going to apologize? "Yeah, I'm sorry, director. I know you need to spend 200,000$ to fix the building and rebuild 4 vehicles, but I thought it was really important that I startle a prospective member with an untested power in a public area as opposed to waiting a day to use our purpose built facilities. Also, she's probably suffering a lot of trauma from the attack that triggered her powers in addition to feeling responsible for the deaths of several people. So again. Startling her in a parking garage was the best call."

It was stupid and took me out of the story because our "fun mentor" character is clearly an incompetent idiot and the author of this webfiction, which is good so far, didn't realize it. That was the difference in Worm between the Undersiders and the Wards/Protectorate when we had our interludes. The Undersiders were irresponsible and did some stuff for kicks, while the Wards and the Protectorate were always shown as being bound by regulations with more strictures. Sometimes hypocritically, but they made sense. Startling someone who is potentially dangerous in the car as an introduction is something I'd expect from Regent in the original story, but not from any of the Protectorate capes who have been shown to have protocols about things like this.
