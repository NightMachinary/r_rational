Ah man, Laura /had/ to come knocking just as we were about to get some juicy powers exposition!

Tentative rating for Sepulcher: Shaker 7, Thinker 3, Mover 2. Depending on how big her range is and how many things she can do at once I think anything between Shaker 5 and 8 could be appropriate. Knowledge of any structure she's touching, including other people touching it, is a very useful but not particularly strong Thinker power, and the ability to boost herself and move through walls gives a low Mover rating.

I don't know why you're getting downvoted. This is better than a lot of stuff on here.
