I enjoy this but Presto was stupid and it takes me out of the story with how stupid she is

Carmella last use of her powers when she felt threatened killed a half dozen people.

Presto decided it was a good idea to give her a jump scare 2 days later?

This isn't Presto having wacky fun, this is Presto asking to get smashed by spikes and have the parking garage ruined. So far the protectorate has looked like competent professionals. Presto's actions in this chapter make them look like clowns.
