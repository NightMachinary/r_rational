Sorry for the double reply, but this is a separate issue.

You ask "Is this really free will," and in order to answer that I think you need a good definition of free will. Can you explain what it is? Do we have it? What is the physical difference between someone who "has free will" and someone who only /thinks/ they do? If there isn't a measurable difference, I would be suspicious that the question is malformed.

What are you /actually/ asking?
