This is very close to an idea from "Tales of the Bounty Hunters". IG-88 replaces the Death Star 2 computer with a computer containing an uploaded version of itself. It even messes with Palpatine by not opening elevator doors when he's in proximity, and he's forced to use the Force to open them.

Of course, IG-88 loses and goes down with DS-2. So your story will be better :)
