At first, with military droids in mind, what you say makes a lot of sense. But then if you think of the other driods we see with protagonists, the ones that competently complete complicated orders, make abstract conclusions, communicate personally with humans, and hack into foreign systems... it's apparent that you conclusion is not the case. There must be some other reason for the incompetence of military droids.
