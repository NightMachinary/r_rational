I wasn't saying that all droids are completely stupid and incompetent, my hypo is that they are not nearly as fast, flexible or sane as they should be after several hundred years of development, what you've mentioned doesn't sound much smarter than a highly augmented human. Or a little bit smarter. "Smart enough to keep their monopoly" is very very smart, smart enough to prevent the emergence of competing agencies, but probably not Foom smart, not uncontrolable self-enhancing process running on a dyson brain smart.

I'd be interested if you could go into more details on the capability of the companion droids you've seen.
