It's borderline canon that all computers in the SW 'verse are based on what we would probably call brain emulation, not conventional computing. The /Falcon/ uses several droid brains wired together, at least, and you have to literally /talk/ to it in an obscure droid language to alter the "settings".

My headcanon has always been that someone reverse-engineered Holocron technology before anyone invented "real" computers, and they were so much better than early computers that they never got developed.
