Except, y'know, that complete memory wipes are common.

I think you're trying to fit the evidence in Star Wars to the modern knowledge of the lack of limitations on AI, but you're going to have a hard time. It's space fantasy, and droids are /droids/, they are AI shackled to bodies, and have things hardcoded in them based on those bodies.

They are all limited in some way, and it seems to be a natural feature of droids in this universe - possibly due to the way the Force works, as it only effects biological life. Perhaps it is required for 'true' sentience somehow.

That is part of the belief in universe that justifies treating droids like chattel, it is clear they are not considered sentient beings.
