Still, twenty thousand years of galaxy wide ubiquitous use without one droid breaking free far enough to create a singularity event? When we know they are lackadaisical about shackles?

That's a hell of a filter. There is a serious complexity penalty on any theory beyond "AI doesn't work like that in Star Wars".

Which makes sense, it's retro-space fantasy. 'Souls' are basically canon.
