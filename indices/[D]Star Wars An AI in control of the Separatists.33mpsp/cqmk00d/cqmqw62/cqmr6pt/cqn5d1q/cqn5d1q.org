The thing is, the Republic has existed for /twenty thousand years/, and has been using droids, spaceships, and hyperdrives for at least that long.

This is a universe which has as much Technological Stasis as any medieval fantasy realm. There is basically no major advancement. Things change in style and perhaps slightly in efficiency, and the universe is supportive of Super Prototypes which use existing technology cleverly or massively scaled up.

But there is also magitech in the form of Holocrons and Sith Alchemy, quite a lot of "The Old is better than the New", and, well, lightsabers as an effective weapon.
