Are giant superintelligent droid brains allowed in their star wars universe? I'd gotten the distinct impression that droids are not simply programs on computers, they're clearly extremely constrained, perhaps this universe has already had its butlarian jihad and now the secret to all droid technology is kept by a small sect of machinists who will never make or sell a droid smarter than a thing needs to be to keep their monopoly. Their real business is not AI or even robotics, areas in which they have stagnated for decades. Their business is drm. Tightly locked, highly obfuscated black boxes ensconced in trip-wires and self destruction routines. How else would they keep tinkerers from learning enough to compete and building something truly dangerous?
