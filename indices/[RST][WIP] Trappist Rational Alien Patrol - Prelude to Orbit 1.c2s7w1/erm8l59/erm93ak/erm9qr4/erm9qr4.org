We have a list of characteristics in the sidebar. The biggest point against this is that it's got unbelievable characters doing things that don't make any sense, sloppy worldbuilding, and a boatload of strawmen. If you want to mount a defense of this, you're going to have to do better than just stating the premise. And yes, the format/genre of the work means that it gets judged more harshly, because that makes it less likely to be something that the people who frequent this subreddit want to see. The discussion of real world politics (e.g. climate change) also raises the bar, especially given the thin frame.
