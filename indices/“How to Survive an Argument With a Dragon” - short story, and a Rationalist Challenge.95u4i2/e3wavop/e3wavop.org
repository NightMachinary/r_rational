I don't think there's a right or rational answer to this type of situation, when you find yourself at the mercy of the whims of an powerful being you know nothing about. After all, every single action you could take could be considered offensive and get you killed. Stay silent? The dragon thinks you're ignoring it and kills you for the insult. Talk at the wrong time? The dragon thinks you're disrespecting it and kills you. Try to munchkin its words? The dragon is enraged by your games and kills you. Run away? The dragon thinks you're playing tag and hunts you down and kills you.

Especially with something as inhuman as a dragon, you can't even do cold reading on it since its facial expressions and body language could be completely different from a human's. A smile could mean aggression instead of happiness. A glare could mean happiness instead of rage. There's no way to know unless you luckily and blindly fumble into a course of action that lets you stay alive long enough to learn what makes the dragon tick.
