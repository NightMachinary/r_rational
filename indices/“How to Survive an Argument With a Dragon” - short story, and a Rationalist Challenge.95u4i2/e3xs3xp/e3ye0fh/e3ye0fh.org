The dragon just decided that, in its own view, Mona is now fair game. Mona certainly could come up with arguments for how the dragon is wrong in this assessment. Humans are great at coming up with excuses for how, no, that one totally didn't count, and it should listen to our judgement instead of its own. ...Which means that if the dragon were inclined to listen any further to Mona begging for her life, then it would never be able to eat any humans ever. Which does not seem to be the case.

The main problem is: Having made the mistake, why would the dragon permit you to present any further argument?
