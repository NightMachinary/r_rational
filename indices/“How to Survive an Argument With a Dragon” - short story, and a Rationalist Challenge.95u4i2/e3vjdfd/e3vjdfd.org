The prompt could do with a rewrite. I'm going to ignore most of the body of this post in the spirit of answering the prompt in a more interesting way.

She jumped away as a huge claw smashed against rock and looked for a way out.

Mona had no experience with dragons, and she'd much prefer doing without this one. Before today, they hadn't been real. A PhD in archeology equipped her with endless ways to deal with things that were already dead, which was just how she liked it.

Unfortunately, while the mini rockslide had carried her into the cave with only minimal bruises and scrapes, the constantly shifting rubble also removed any chance of climbing back out.

She ran toward the other end of the cave. Escape was out of the picture. Could she distract it? With what? She had gear in her backpack, but the concept of managing to get any of it out before the dragon killed her was ridiculous, without even mentioning the time it would take to set up and use most of it.

She shot a glance back up at the hole and blinked at the cold light. It was dark down here, darker than she'd expected.

Maybe she could use that. She scooped up a larger rock that lay in her path, stumbling as she adjusted her grip, then skidded to a dead halt and flung it as far as she could.

'As far as she could' turned out to be maybe half a dozen paces. Even if she was right and the light had blinded it, the dragon could just swipe a claw through the general area.

Quickly but quietly she picked up a few smaller fragments of stone and flung one at the area the first rock had landed in. The next landed slightly farther away, and the one after that a little more. When she ran out of rubble in her immediate vicinity she went stock-still.

The cave was anything but silent. Blood pumped almost as loudly as the ringing in her ears, and the shifting and groaning of rock as something enormous moved its weight all served to put her an inch from panicking. But the dragon hadn't killed her yet.

She needed something to distract herself with or she'd bolt. Mona turned slowly, carefully. What she saw was dark and confusing. A fragment of an exposed vein of ore glinted here and there, a tangle of confused structures rising up and up and...

Then the yellow orb blinked, and in that moment everything became clear.

It could see her just fine. Its entire massive bulk had right there the entire time, and she'd carried on chucking rocks like an idiot.

But it hadn't killed her. What did it want? Entertainment? Was it like a cat, playing with its prey before slowly killing it? Fictional dragons were often portrayed as intelligent, with some fiction even having them as ancient hoarders of knowledge. And you couldn't hoard knowledge very well if you couldn't communicate.

"If it's food you want, I can have entire cows flown over here," she said.

Silence. The stillness stretched out just long enough that'd she'd just started to involuntarily relax before it responded.

The dragon's voice wasn't very loud, but it penetrated. She felt the vibrations in her bones, in the rock around her.

"I do not need anything you might possess. You will die."

It was the sheer, matter-of-fact /weight/ of the sentence that chilled her, sapped her of the will to do anything but shiver.

"Then why keep me alive?" she said.

It was a terrible question. But she'd had to say /something/ or the terror would have frozen her there forever. She had to keep moving or she'd /stop/.

There was that terrible pause before the dragon spoke again, where she was /sure/ she would die any second now, and then---

"Sometimes intruders say something interesting to me before they die."

Mona blinked.

"That's---wait, can I ask you a question?" She took the yawning moment of silence as assent. "What's the last time anyone else came here? Antarctica isn't exactly well-traversed, even in summer."

"It has been a long time. Enough for uranium-234 to decay to thorium-230."

A few thoughts went through her head in quick succession. The dragon was somehow translating languages---but that was obvious, there was no way that kind of jaw could make any remotely-human sounds. It knew about radioactive decay. And if she remembered correctly, the half-life for the decay of uranium-234 to thorium-230 was well over a hundred thousand years. Then she shunted all of that to another part of her brain because survival took priority.

"Other people know where I am."

"I am losing my patience."

She sped through the next words. "Our science has advanced a great deal during that time. We can track people anywhere at any time from all the way across the world. And if you kill me, we will kill you. You mentioned uranium---well, we can split it. We have thousands of bombs in storage, and while you might be big, you don't look big enough to survive a nuclear detonation."

The dragon let her go.
