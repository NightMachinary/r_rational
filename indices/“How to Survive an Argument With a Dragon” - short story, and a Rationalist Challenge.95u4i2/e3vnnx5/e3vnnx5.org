Hmm... Either this is either a real riddle with a true answer, or a fake riddle, where the dragon will try to claim that my choice is wrong regardless of what I say.

A real riddle can be solved, with or without additional info from the dragon. A fake riddle would basically be a verbal fencing match against the dragon.

I would start with "Will you answer additional questions about the decision, or must I face this decision with the information I currently have?"
