If you read HPMOR as it was going along, the Final Exam chapter [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/113]] laid out a seemingly impossible situation, then challenged the readers to solve it rationally. Spoilers: someone did. My story, written five years ago, resurfaced a little while ago, and it was suggested it be put here for the entertainment of those willing to embrace it. The conundrum is apparently either what would you have done in Mona's place (rewriting the story) or what would you do next, to counter the dragon's argument (solving the apparent problem). Personally, I believe solving the real problem, namely what IS the real problem (like with Ganto's Axe), results in the side effect of saving Mona. It was sincerely intended. If it will bring you no joy, then I've hopefully only wasted a few minutes of your day.

P.S. Unlike Ganto, I fear the dragon will not embrace Mu (the Zen concept of unmasking a question), so will need to be persuaded into a paradox. From my own experience - in Wales, where they still exist :-) - dragons are quite literal, principled beasts. They also get hungry.
