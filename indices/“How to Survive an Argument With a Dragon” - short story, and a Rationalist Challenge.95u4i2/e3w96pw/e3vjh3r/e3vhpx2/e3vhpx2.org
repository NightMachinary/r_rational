A minor quibble, first of all:

#+begin_quote
  “I have a name. Mona Fury.” the mortal cried
#+end_quote

This really doesn't sound like 'cried' in my head. Consider either punching up that dialogue with more emotion, or using a different verb.

As for how she survives:

The dragon lashes down to try to eat her, and in desperation she throws her backpack into it's open maw. The beast chokes on the bag and is distracted while the caver runs for the icey exit. Firing her flare gun into the floor every once in a while to drive back the chill, she manages to make her way through and to an exit from the cave system.

I admit I'm probably not very good at this, but i figured I'd take the shot.
