Mona eeped, and straightened. "Well, no, if just saying that counted as a choice, then it would be a self-contradicting incoherent sentence, and if uttering an incoherent sentence were a choice you would've killed me after what I said when I first saw you."

"'twas indeed a vile oath," chuckled the Dragon. "Very well. Only a logically coherent stated choice, if wrong, will result in your death...but so will a choice declared implicitly through action. Should you try to leave, then shall you be eaten, unless it be through the correct path."

"And that path is either fire or ice, but not both?"

"I'm pretty sure I said that already," grumbled the great creature.

Mona stood in uffish thought. She needed a way to exploit these rules to extract, literally, a bit of information. But the only way the Dragon was bound to communicate was to either kill, or not kill her, which was not a particularly helpful communication channel. Her best hope was that it seemed clear the Dragon hadn't thought all this through, and was making up the rules as it went along.

"But what makes it the 'correct' path?" she asked innocently.

The Dragon's horse-size throat glowed impossibly with suppressed fire. "Should thou choose it, thou shalt have my word that thou wilt pass through it unharmed."

So close..."Sorry, I don't quite understand your English when it gets like that. You're saying that if I choose the correct path, you'll promise me out loud that I'll be safe, and if I choose the wrong path you'll kill me?"

"Yessssss...." a long, drawn out hiss, that faded so slowly Mona could believe it would be decades in finishing.

"Okay, then I choose to pass down the path of fire and have you not kill me."

The Dragon started to rise up in terrible triumph, its jaws unclenching, then paused, and somehow contrived to look thoughtful. If the path of fire wasn't "correct", this wasn't a coherent choice by the Dragon's rules, so it had no right to kill her. And if it was "correct", the Dragon was bound to make her a verbal promise.

"Rather, I choose to pass down the path of ice and have you not kill me."

The Dragon settled down, its fire fading. Its voice was suddenly sleepy. "Go, then, thou shalt pass with safety, clever one."

Mona bent to pick up her pack, then again straightened up without it. "Wait," she said. She was an explorer after all. "Now that you've promised not to kill me, I do have some questions..."
