  My story, written five years ago,
#+end_quote

is there more to the story than what's posted here? ah, I see it's a 200 word limit challenge, and the fire/ice was part of the prompt. this explains why it feels chopped off.

I feel like there's probably a lot of subtext in your head that isn't coming across in the story itself that makes the challenge clearer to you than a new reader. this might be the source of some of the conflict.

What I'm now gathering is: there are two paths offered. both are potentially deadly. Additionally, the Dragon itself may try to kill Mona once a "choice" is made. The dragon cannot be overpowered. however, the dragon is extremely literal, logical, and principled. It can be persuaded and confused. I might further conjecture that it will not lie or break a promise.

The challenge is: what lines of argument might Mona use to convince the beast to let her go?

is this all accurate to your intent?
