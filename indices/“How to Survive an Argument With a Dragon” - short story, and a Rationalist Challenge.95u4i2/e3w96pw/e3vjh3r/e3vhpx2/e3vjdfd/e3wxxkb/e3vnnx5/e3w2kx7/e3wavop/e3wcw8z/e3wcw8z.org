Mona leaves the cavern using the path through which she entered.

After a moment the dragon calls out to her but receives no response. "Good. I thought she'd never leave." it mumbles as it curls into a comfortable coil and goes back to sleep.

Really though, the prompt isn't very good as a challenge. It doesn't establish a goal for Mona or the dragon, and otehr than the vaguely defined "spelunking gear" doesn't list any assets for either side to use to achieve their undefined goals.
