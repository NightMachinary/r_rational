There is a major key difference---we have more information in HPMOR. We know Harry's general abilities and we know Voldemort is a scary, skilled, basilisk-knowledge-using dude. And we have the book using magic unconventionally from the get-go. The answer is there.

Meanwhile, this is not a riddle. The prose is poorly written at best, and not enough information is given about the characters, their abilities, the environment, and the magic system to give any sort of rational answer.

Learn to write. Technical writing, creative writing, essay writing---you could pull this off if you did a bit more planning and had a lot of more skill in almost any type of writing. So write, or at least copy the text of someone willing who can.

You may not want to hear this, but you will never improve otherwise. The solution starts with admitting you have a problem.
