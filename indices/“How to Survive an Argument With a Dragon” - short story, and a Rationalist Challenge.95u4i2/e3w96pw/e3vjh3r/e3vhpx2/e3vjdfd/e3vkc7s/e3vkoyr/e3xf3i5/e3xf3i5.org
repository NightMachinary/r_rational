"And you honestly think that humanity won't ever discover you? You may be able to hide from the search parties sent after me, but this continent becomes less remote every year. Can you hide from the geologists who will scour every inch of this land for valuable resources? Governments often hide assets here; information sought after by their rivals. What will you do when it becomes economical for militaries to keep the entire continent under ground-penetrating surveillance?"

"You're going to have to deal with us eventually, and the sooner the better. We're close to creating self-improving artificial general intelligence- we might do it within decades. Right now, you can outsmart and overawe us, but that won't last forever. Every year you wait, your ability to influence the outcome of your inevitable meeting with civilization slips away."

"Here's what I propose: hire me. I'll work for a percentage of your future earnings, which we can work out later. I will bring evidence of your existence to investors, and use that money to found a corporation dedicated to developing a strategy for introducing you to society that will minimize public backlash, ensure that your legal rights are recognized, prevent your exploitation by powerful interests, and build a brand."

"Once everything is in place, you can make a fortune just from public appearances, and a larger fortune by auctioning exclusive access to information about yourself, your history and biology to governments."

"With that money, which will grow exponentially over centuries, you can influence the development of human civilization in a way that ensures your long-term safety. Instead of an unknown threat in a conveniently bomb-able wasteland, you can be a part-owner of civilization, protected and pampered beneath a city by the same humans or post-humans who might otherwise seek your destruction or exploitation."

"And on top of all that, I just have to ask... aren't you a bit bored?"
