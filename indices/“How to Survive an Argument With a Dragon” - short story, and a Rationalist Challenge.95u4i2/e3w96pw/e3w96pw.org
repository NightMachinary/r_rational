Literally every single thing Mona has said has been a stupid thing to say. The story as written suggests that she has just wasted her fourth and final chance to talk her way out of this. The dragon just mocked her for giving it permission to kill her and she is going to die in the next two seconds.

That's fine if this is microfiction. If this is something other than microfiction, then you have failed to convey some relevant information that would be necessary for you to get the response you want. Do you want me to say what Mona should have done? Then I'm basically just writing a completely new story in response to a vague prompt and you framing it as a "challenge" is disingenuous. Do you want me to say how the story should continue? Okay: The dragon wants to take the first excuse to kill Mona that its rules allow. Therefore, unless it is stupid or has motivations that you have not even hinted at, it won't accept take-backs. Mona no longer has any influence over the situation and the only possible next sentence is "GAME OVER." This isn't a scare-quotes "impossible" challenge. This is a challenge that has already been failed, and the screen is already fading to black. Is that your intent?

^{Her best option at this point is to shout, "The early modern English verb 'wouldst' is conjugated for second person, you great posturing lout! I bet you're not even 50!" That way she at least takes the dragon's ego down with her.}
