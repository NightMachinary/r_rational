If you followed Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Eliezer Yudkowsky, he placed Mr Potter in a “difficult” position, and asked readers to come up with solutions, the best of which (if any were good enough) he agreed he would write into the conclusion. I would say there is no one absolute right answer (of mine) that you have to rediscover. So it's not a fake riddle, or real (in the traditional sense of having only one true solution), but I will say: Criticising my writing isn't going to help Mona Rewriting the story isn't really answering the problem, especially if it becomes an action adventure script; this is Mona not Lara. Talking your way out of this seems the most ‘rationalist' approach

So, go for it. Ask those questions. Answer them too, in the form of a Socratic dialogue, or similar technique. We've had the nuclear threat. What else, hopefully more logical can save our heroine?
