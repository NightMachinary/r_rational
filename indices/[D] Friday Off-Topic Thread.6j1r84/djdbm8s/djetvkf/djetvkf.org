...one app that I've noticed the lack of is a calculator that works with arbitrary number bases.

It might be a bit silly - and I've never had /strong/ reason to use one - but it's one of the few things that doesn't appear to be on any of the app stores. (Binary, yes; hex, yes; arbitrary base, no).
