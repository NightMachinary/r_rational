Ok, reporting some ideas so far (1 day later, talked to ~4ish people on [[/r/rational]] briefly, probably 10-15 minutes of mental effort):

Starting with a better definition of the problem: how can a cellphone become a better /mental prosthetic/? How can the always-with-you computer help as a mind-extension?

1. It can generate random numbers. This is actually an upgrade, as people really struggle to be properly random. Helpful when you need your actions to be /unpredictable/ more than anything else. Also works as a tiebreaker/timesaver/introspection tool for hard decisions.

2. You can get device-automation apps that let you hook up various tools and apps into custom solutions to whatever problem you're having. Worth investigating, but I'm not sure anything out there has a unix-command-line level of modularity and composability yet.

3. When people want to use a computer to mathematically model something, they reach for tools like MatLab/Gnu Octave. I should learn one of these and/or figure out if anyone's shrunk them into a pocket version. This is more about desktop than mobile, though. I doubt I'll have problems to apply it to that also need /quick/ thinking.

4. I take notes with pictures, drawings, and text, but I should get a diagram editor as well for thinking about things that break down into clearly-defined parts.

5. Whenever doing day-to-day tasks I'm uncertain about, I can check against WikiHow. This seems like it could be an effective anti-akrasia weapon: fear of messing things up keeps me from doing so much basic, everyday stuff that it should be embarrassing.

6. More willingness to be a dirty winning cheater would lead to actions like looking up strategies for boardgames I play with friends. In fact, more willingness to check strategies against google in general would help. I could get a lot more out of that technique. Same goes for using photos of things as eidetic memory: I should use it more.

I also asked in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6j8m0r/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/djdbv6h/][Saturday Munchkinry thread]], please take a look at that as well.
