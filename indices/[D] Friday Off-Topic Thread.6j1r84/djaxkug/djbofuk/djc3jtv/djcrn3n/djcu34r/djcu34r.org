I kind of see it like comparing the wealthy of 2000 years ago to the poor of today.

Sure, I'd rather be a poor person living in the USA today than a rich merchant in an age before vaccines and smart phones, but I'm only saying that because I know what those things are. It's not simplistically arguable to me that the poor person today is /happier/ than the rich merchant of that age.

Serfs of the old-fashioned sort were almost certainly worse-off than modern chicken farmers, but relative to their time and culture, they're probably about equally unhappy with the circumstances of their job. At least modern chicken farmers don't have to worry about being drafted into makeshift armies to fight off roving bandits or other feudal lords.
