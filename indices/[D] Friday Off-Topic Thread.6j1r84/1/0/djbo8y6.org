I have apparently gotten a very different experience out of pokemon than you have. I play it, primarily not for the battles but for the experience of exploring the world, experiencing the detailed storyline, and seeing the npcs. I just played through the battles to get them over with. Once I unlock repel in a game, I use it constantly. You could get rid of the battles and I'd have just about as much fun. So honestly if you were to get rid of the overworld, you would have gotten rid of the enjoyable part for me.

Maybe that's why Pokemon is so popular, it appeals to different people for different reasons - the collecting, the battling, and the exploring.
