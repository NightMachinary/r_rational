You might be interested in the hacker's diet: [[https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/]]

In general, I would ignore exercise as a contributing factor and focus entirely on diet. I commute to work by bicycle (1 hour total) and that burns a paltry ~300 calories a day (I'm slow!): that's about the calories in a large coke. I don't know about you, but it would be easier for me not to drink a coke than it would to cycle for an hour.
