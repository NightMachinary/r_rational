I lost weight without any kind of special diet or exercise routine, so just going to list what worked for me in case it helps you too:

1) Reduce food portions and eat slower. Give yourself more time to feel "satisfied" by a meal, and practice stopping there rather than eating until you're full, or eating past that point before you realize it because your stomach hasn't finished sending you the fullness signals yet. Practice cutting extraneous things first. If you get fast food, don't get fries or a soda. If you eat at a restaurant, don't get an appetizer.

2) Drink water. Cut out all soda /including diet soda/, but also any fruit juice, which is just liquid sugar. /Water./ Tea and coffee are okay, as long as you don't add sugar or cream. Vegetable juices can be, though pay attention to their sugar content. Similarly, use more seasonings, less sauces. Salad dressing should be oil and vinegar based, not creamy. Lots of things can be made tasty with lemon juice and/or salt.

3) Exercise is /healthy/ but it is not necessary to lose weight. It can even be detrimental if it makes it harder for you to limit your food intake. Start by limiting your food intake: if you feel like you're handling it okay, try exercising. If you start snacking more after you do, you're undoing the calorie loss of the exercising. This could still be okay if you're replacing fat with muscle, but it is a slow process and will not be encouraging on the weight scale.

4) /Use social pressure systems./ Tweet or post your weight every week, if you have twitter or facebook. Yes, it's embarrassing. Still worth it. It's amazing how powerful a motivator it is to get support from friends and family, as well as have that extra voice of embarrassment speak up when you feel the urge to grab a cookie or soda once in awhile but you don't want to end up with a higher weight when you post that week. Shame is a shitty thing to feel, but if you're going to feel it anyway, weaponize it to your advantage.

5) Most of all, don't get discouraged if you backslide a little every so often. You are going to be undergoing a process, and should not expect yourself to master it immediately. You will fail once in awhile. You will learn from these mistakes. You will get better at recognizing the right balance of food to keep away hunger pains without ever eating beyond the point of fullness.

Good luck!
