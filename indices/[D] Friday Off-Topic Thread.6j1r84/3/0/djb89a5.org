Do cardio, the closer to running the better. This partly increases base metabolic rate, partly expends calories directly, and /mostly/ represses your appetite. You'll be /really/ hungry afterwards the first few times, though, as your body realizes it has to build up the resources to do /that/ again. Weightlifting can help raise base metabolic rate, but it mostly just makes you look good and have an easy time doing physical labor.

Learn to cook healthier. This isn't nearly as hard or as ascetic as you think it is; you just might not have been /taught/. For instance, putting lemon juice and the right herbs on things is /just better/: it turns dull steamed vegetables or chopped salads into delightful but extremely healthy meals. Favor baking, roasting, steaming, and grilling as preparation methods; avoid sauces. Favor fish, vegetables, and complex carbs like legumes or whole grains over simple carbs. When wanting something sweet, the right fresh fruit can really hit the spot -- but you have to know how to get /tasty/ fresh fruit, which can be hard in some places.

Don't ever get ascetic or make a healthy lifestyle into a punishment. In a related matter, when the health effects of exercise start to make a real difference, you are going to get horny as all hell (compared to a sedentary lifestyle). Pleasantly, you're also going to have greater sexual endurance. Incentives!
