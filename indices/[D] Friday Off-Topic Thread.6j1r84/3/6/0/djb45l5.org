  I know to lose weight, you're trying to maximise "calories out - calories in".
#+end_quote

This is the quintessence of bad information around there. Calories out > calories in is a /consequence/ of successfully doing things that lose weight, not a strategy to lose weight.

As to how to lose weight - yes, definitely try exercise, yes, definitely try different diets and see if they help. Start cooking for yourself, more as a friction mechanism preventing eating too much, rather than because eating out is particularly unhealthy (unless you fastfood. quit fastfood. also quit sugary things like soda / candy, if you consume regularly).

In the end you just have to try things, and hope they work. A dietitian will probably help, in that they should at least prevent you from starving yourself by accident.

But if nothing works for 6-12 months, at some point you might have to reevaluate whether it's worth the effort. If you're not mordibly obese, being a bit fat is not really that bad.
