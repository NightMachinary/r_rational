I think I like the 1 pound coins ([[https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000280063085.jpg?strip=all&w=960][old]], [[http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/pound-749763.jpg][new]]) probably the most pleasing to handle. However, they're heavy and big, so if you have more than 10 it gets unwieldy.

OTOH why would you have more than 10 coins.
