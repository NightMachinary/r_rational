Yeah, I was mostly attempting to identify the /mechanical/ reasons that one might be attracted to the game--after all, I'm trying to identify what systems ought to exist at a core, unchangeable level. Story and setting are things that were probably the primary reason that the games were so successful, but it's not something that I can enshrine beyond ensuring that dialog, visuals, and NPC interaction are things the game has, which isn't very helpful as a focus.

I can certainly respect the multi-group attractiveness of the formula, it brings to mind the four player archetypes. Rest assured I'm not attempting to change the design at this point, simply trying to organize it.

This entire line of thinking has certainly shed light on the broad appeal of the games, but has been nearly worthless for its original intended purpose. Oh well. You can't force eureka moments, I suppose.
