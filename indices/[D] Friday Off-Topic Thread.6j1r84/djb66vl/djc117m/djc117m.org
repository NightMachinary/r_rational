Can a /game/ be irrational? Surely the story parts of the game can, but the playable mechanics? You have a set of rules that define the universe, they are encoded in the game's program.

Ah wait, single-player games are always rational (story notwithstanding). But games where you interact with other characters, if those characters don't have a set of goals, could also be considered irrational. Even though those characters have /rules/ and act according to then, they should then be considered part of the environment, rather than agents. In any case the presence of NPCs can make a game irrational if you care that they have no goals.

EDIT: nevermind, you've thought about this. It's in the linked google doc:

  So, to recap: a rational game does not force the player to perform any actions that violate the agreed role of the player (or player-character), whether that be because all actions within the entire world have been constrained to fit a particular mould or because the role has been broadened enough that all actions possible within the game are reasonably within the bounds of the player role contract.
