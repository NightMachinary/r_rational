[[https://www.fastcompany.com/40429419/this-tiny-grocery-store-is-mobile-self-driving-and-run-by-ai][This]] seems high-tech but is in some way a throwback to older food sales logistics systems. Instead of the milkman delivering milk, the grocery-robot will come by and brings food. Probably only cost-effective if lots of people sign on, which is why it worked for milk and might not work for this.

  The big box retailer Costco is building a new chicken processing plant in Fremont, about an hour from Mueller's farm. The company plans for the plant to slaughter 2 million birds per week. To raise all those chickens, the company is recruiting about 120 farmers to sign on as contract poultry farmers.

  Mueller wants in. But to do that, he plans to take out a massive $2 million loan to finance the construction of four chicken barns.

  As pork and poultry production grows in the U.S., this is an increasingly common arrangement. Farmers sign multi-million dollar deals to do business with big corporations. The company provides animals and feed. The farmer builds the barns and cares for the animals. It requires a major investment from the farmers who enter into the agreement and hope the investment will pay off.

Warhammer 40k's 8th edition is out! I had a chance to play a game last week with my Ork army at my local game store [[http://www.40konline.com/index.php?topic=230288.0][(battle report link)]]. Any other 40k players in the house? What about in the SF Bay Area?
