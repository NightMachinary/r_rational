In the literal sense of the word, you're right.

In the realistic examination of human thought and behavior, career changes are hard and often times go against people's innate sense of identity or purpose.

Like, I'm a therapist. Therapy does not pay well unless you primarily work with wealthy clients. Which means that if you want to help the less fortunate, you have to rely on insurance companies, which means you have to be okay with an industry pay model that was developed about 40 years ago and hasn't changed since.

Yes, I could give up what I believe and care about and say fuck it (more and more therapists are doing exactly this as the cost of living and inflation continue to make the amount insurance pays inadequate) but many don't because a career change seems infeasible to them or because for whatever reason they really care about helping the underprivileged.

Chicken farmers are in a similar situation but have it way, way worse. And for whatever reason, a lot of them can't realistically just change the course of their life and stop being a chicken farmer to go to school for plumbing or programming or whatever.
