  Warhammer 40k's 8th edition is out! I had a chance to play a game last week with my Ork army at my local game store (battle report link).

I own an Imperial Guard army inherited from a friend who used to play, and have been wanting to buy Orkz. Haven't been able to get them at the nearest game-and-comics store, though, and don't have the time.
