I'm interested in the potential of the Death Note as a positive mind control device. After all, you can write about their actions before death.

So for example, you can write "X devoted the rest of his life to researching a cure for cancer, advancing the study as much as he possibly could, then died." Since X would be mind controlled, their emotions would be blunted and they would focus solely on research, allowing it to advance far more rapidly than if the Death Note wasn't used.

So I would kill volunteers. Or rather, I would get them to kill themselves. Write their own names in the Death Note along with the conditions of death, allowing themselves to single-mindedly focus on solving one particular world problem or another and use their abilities to their limit.
