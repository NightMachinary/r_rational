  In other words, you're conflating "morality" with "adherence to my worldview", making yourself the most moral by definition.
#+end_quote

Nope. I'm often rude, ungrateful, or selfish. I could be a better person. It's hard, and I'm trying, but I'm not there yet and there's bound to be people who are further along than me. I admire them.

#+begin_quote
  Agreed
#+end_quote

Please. You think "racial hygiene" is a thing. You judge people based on melatonin.

  You seem to be confused. I don't have any actual control here.
#+end_quote

And that's what drives you wild. That's why you hate the Jews - because it's easier to believe that someone has taken agency from you than to acknowledge that you wouldn't have had the agency you desire anyway.

  You deserve more and more direct suffering than you'll ever receive for it (again, assuming the materialistic nihilistic ontology)
#+end_quote

Oh no, see you're confused. Nihilism is the rejection of morality and the idea that people "deserve" things. Deserving things implies an order to the world and that's not nihilism at all.

And speaking of not using euphemisms - telling me that I deserve suffering (and implying that you don't) is saying that you're a better person than me because I don't adhere to your worldview! Talk about self-assurance.
