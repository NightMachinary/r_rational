It's not about proving him wrong. It's about speaking the truth in the hopes that he reevaluates his position. Maybe it is pointless, but maybe it isn't. If I can change one bigot's mind, even if it's just a little bit, or if I can put a chink in the armor their hate provides to them so that some other, better debater opens their eyes later... I think it's worth my time.

But you haven't answered my question, and I would be much obliged if you did.
