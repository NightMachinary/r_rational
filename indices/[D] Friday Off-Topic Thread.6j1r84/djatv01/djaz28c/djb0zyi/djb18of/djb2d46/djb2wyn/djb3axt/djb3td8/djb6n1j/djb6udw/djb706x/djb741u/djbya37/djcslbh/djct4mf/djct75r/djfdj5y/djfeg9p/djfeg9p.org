You're welcome to message the mods as a group. We can confirm that we were talking over the option of banning the guy after last Friday's off-topic thread, since he'd basically taken over half the comment volume.

What made me pull the trigger /wasn't/ his politics. You /know/ that: we would have banned him much, much earlier if it was that. The trouble was that he directly told a user that their happiness was irrelevant and that things they enjoyed were degenerate. Once the trigger was pulled, there was group agreement, and if the mod group disagrees, we can reverse the ban.

Advocate bad ideas, well, I'll make fun of you to high heaven, but no mod action. Devalue human lives or happiness, in so many words, deliberately and directly? Banhammer 40K, in the Emperor's name let none survive.
