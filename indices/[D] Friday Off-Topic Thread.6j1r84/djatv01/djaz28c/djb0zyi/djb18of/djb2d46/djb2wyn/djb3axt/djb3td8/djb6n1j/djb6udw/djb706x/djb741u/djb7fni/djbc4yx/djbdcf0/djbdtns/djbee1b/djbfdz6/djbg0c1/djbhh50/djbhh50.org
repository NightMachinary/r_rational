Right. I meant to write "a bitter game of chicken + value signaling", which is still kinda sad.

Also I'm hitting the point where I'm getting bitter and defensive about arguing that people shouldn't spend hours getting bitter and defensive on the internet. Which is the sort of problem you usually run into when you start playing rational debate police. How distastefully meta.
