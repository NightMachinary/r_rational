I'd rather let this stay firmly in the past, but with my mod hat on I'll confirm that we all discussed it, decided /not/ to ban him, set clear criteria for a ban (basically incitement to violence, dehumanising people, or apologia for violent hate groups), and then /after/ that saw new posts that met the criteria for a ban.

Personally I hate using bans, but if that's the cost of not-being-4chan I'll do it.
