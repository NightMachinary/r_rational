Well, it does help /me/ to see that people disapprove of BGWAG. It's usually just one person any time that he speaks up, but it's usually a /different/ person each time, and I've never seen anybody speak up in agreement with him, so I feel reasonably confident that the subreddit doesn't like his views.

If, on the other hand, I regularly failed to see any responses at all and then one day I saw a favorable response, well, I know that [[/u/eaturbrainz]] is Jewish, so that'd be at least one data point suggesting that the subreddit wasn't turning into a fascist and anti-semitic hot spot, but I'd still be getting worried about the possibility.

As it is, though, BGWAW is always met with spirited disapproval, which sends a strong (and reassuring) signal to me about this community's overall values.
