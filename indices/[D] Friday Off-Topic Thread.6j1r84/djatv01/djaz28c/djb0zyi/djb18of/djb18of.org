To the contrary, pretending equality is a thing (and forcing others to keep up the pretence) is not rational. The Catechism's ontological correctness may be disputed, but the instrumental value of Church doctrine as it applies to normal people's normal lives can't.

If anything, I'd also focus on anti-religion activists. This is a serious case of people arguing out of their depth and ignoring dozens of Chesterton's fences. Ontological truth in religion has historically had approximately zero bearing in people's attitudes towards religion - for good reasons.
