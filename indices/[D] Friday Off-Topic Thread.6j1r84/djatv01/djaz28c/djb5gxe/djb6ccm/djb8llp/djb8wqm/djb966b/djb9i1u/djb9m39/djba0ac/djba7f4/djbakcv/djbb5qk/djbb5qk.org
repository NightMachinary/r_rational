  I don't believe in the notion of an objective meta-ethical truth given the materialistic-nihilistic ontology
#+end_quote

Again, materialism is an ontology, nihilism is a view about objective meta-ethical truth. To claim there is no meta-ethical truth is to say there's no truth about what moral discourse actually refers to, which is logically contradictory. You can have discourse without a referent (nihilism, error theory), but you can't have no answer about the referent in the presence of discourse.

You're seriously not very good at logic. Take lessons.
