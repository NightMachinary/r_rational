No, you're kinda missing the point. The thing about ethical and meta-ethical views is that, unlike "free-floating" metaphysics, they /need/ to supervene on the natural/physical world to mean anything at all. Since morality needs to supervene on the natural while retaining a basic action-guiding nature, the precise nature of the supervenience tightly constrains what morality can logically be.

The upshot is: if you're a nihilist with a materialist metaphysics, you're going to have to be a nihilist with respect to "richer ontologies". Adding Platonic things which /fail/ to supervene on the natural in an action-guiding way completely fails to buy you a morality.
