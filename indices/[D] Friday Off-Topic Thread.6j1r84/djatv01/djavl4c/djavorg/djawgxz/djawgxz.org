  It's not so much killing them for disagreeing with me, it's more destroying organizations that actively support damaging and/or killing other people IN MY OPINION

fixed that for you, maybe you can see why this is not generalizable. After all, [[http://jezebel.com/interview-with-a-woman-who-recently-had-an-abortion-at-1781972395][already some people defect, and we must not add fuel to the fire]]:

  To be clear, if the doctors thought there was any way he might make it, I would have taken that chance. I truly would have put myself through anything. What I came to accept was the fact that I would never get to be this little guy's mother---that if we came to term, he would likely live a very short time until he choked and died, if he even made it that far. This was a no-go for me. I couldn't put him through that suffering when we had the option to minimize his pain as much as possible.

  *So you're going to Colorado.*

  There are a few doctors in the country---four of them, you interviewed one of them---who will do this. But my doctor had previously referred patients to Dr. Hern, who's in Boulder. He's this 78-year-old man who's been doing this for decades, who developed a lot of the abortion procedures that we know to be the most safe. He's had 37,000 patients and he's never lost anyone. And he's a zealot, but he has to be. There are websites dedicated to offering money to kill him; his practice has four layers of bulletproof glass. They've been shot at. He was there during the /Roe v. Wade/ decision. He's been through it all. And the only other peer he had at his level was Dr. Tiller, who was killed in 2009.

They're talking about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Tiller][George Tiller]], a doctor who provided abortions and who was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Tiller#Assassination_of_George_Tiller_in_May_2009][shot in the head while he was working as an usher at his church]]. The asshole who shot him probably had reasoning similar to yours.

America relies on people /not/ doing this. Peace between disagreeing people, even if you think the others are killing people. We lean on, value and believe in discourse, debate, and speech as a way to resolve our differences.
