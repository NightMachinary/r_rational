I /mostly/ agree, but I also think that, to some degree, deliberately speaking in bad faith ought to be more restricted, at least in a public sphere of mass broadcast. In specific, I'd like to have things like basic fact-checking and hate-speech restrictions written into the law regarding mass media. I think that many countries have hate-speech laws which form a decent starting point: they don't seem to have collapsed free social discourse despite banning, for instance, Holocaust denial.
