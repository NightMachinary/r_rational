Killing people for exercising their free speech is a violation of fundamental principles of Western civilization and represents a major defection from what I would have hoped would be our shared values. /Openly declaring/ that you would kill people for what they advocate is incredibly stupid because you're signaling to them that they should defect against you (more than they already have).
