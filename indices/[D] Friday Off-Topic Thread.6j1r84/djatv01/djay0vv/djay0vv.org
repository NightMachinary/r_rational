Probably the most moral use of the Death Note would be euthanasia.

In my home state, California, euthanasia is legal. However, it's still difficult and unpleasant. When my father was dying, he went through the process to acquire the medicine that he could take to end his life. He was worried he would become crippled and in pain, and didn't want that.

The medicine for ending your life is basically a bunch of sleeping pills with some anti-vomiting pills. You take them, fall asleep, and never wake up. However, nobody sells individual sleeping pills in doses that would kill you; you have to have a bunch of them. The procedure the doctors showed us involves crushing a bunch of pills, like 40 of them, into a slurry with water then drinking it. Unpleasant and difficult. Dad never used that option, but he appreciated the control it gave him. He knew he'd never be trapped in a painful body, wishing for death. If it came to it, it would have not been a great time eating those pills.

The Death Note, however, can provide something better. For example, you could write in it "painless peaceful death" for the person instead of having them do this pill protocol. If it works, you might even be able to write "30 days of healthy life, then painless peaceful death" (it's unclear how much the Death Note controls these things).
