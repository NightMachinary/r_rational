A few months ago, a Star Wars fanfiction was posted here about Sio Bibble, who regretted having to play along with Palpatine. The latter had some leverage over him. Now, I've been trying to search for this story in the sub, but I've completely failed.

Did I hallucinate this or does someone else remember this story? Also, do you have the link?
