Hold on, so you're saying...

If someone does some action, and other people find that action to be revolting and degenerate, that person is at fault and should be made to submit, even by force?

But I'm sure many people find your current actions in this thread to be revolting and degenerate... so by your own logic, shouldn't you be submitting to their will? Shouldn't you be condemned and suppressed?
