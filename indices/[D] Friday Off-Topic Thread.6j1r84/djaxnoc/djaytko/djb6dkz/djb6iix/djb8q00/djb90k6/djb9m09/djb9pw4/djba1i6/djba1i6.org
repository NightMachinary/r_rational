  The values of everyone revolted by their degeneracy and not weak enough to accept it anyway.

Is that really your whole argument? "I think furries are icky, so they should be suppressed"? I mean not that I expected a /great/ argument, but that's especially disappointing. Look, there are a lot of things that people find disgusting. I'm sure I could find a sizable group of vegans that are repulsed by the idea of eating meat. Do you want them to suppress eating meat as a whole? I've read posts by people that are disgusted by house pets, seeing them basically as cesspools of various bacteria that share your space and rub it on you. Should no one be allowed to own pets, then?
