How do you reconcile this "might makes right" viewpoint with caring about societal values? We have society so that it's not everyone for themselves.

Also, suppose for the sake of argument that vegans were the majority and had enough resources to enforce their diet on everyone else. Would you really be okay with that? Radically altering your lifestyle for no reason you care about, just because another group was strong enough to enforce it on you?
