  Why constrain yourself in this manner when they have no qualms about infringing on society and its values?

What values are they infringing on?

#+begin_quote
  I have a very strong feeling this only holds for groups that don't oppose your fundamental world views.

Hell no, and that's the /whole point/. Trump supporters oppose my fundamental worldview as a general group, but if someone was trying to suppress them I'd be on their side in that moment. Suppressing people is antithetical to my fundamental values. I hate what goes on in the name of religion, but if someone's being suppressed for following their beliefs without breaking any laws? I'm on their side too. I understand the need for laws, because someone's freedom to swing their arm ends at someone else's nose. Other than that though? No, I don't think conformity is best. Not at all.
