  Where does the "furry" art style come from?
#+end_quote

Personally, I'd think this would come from a combination of anime/the neonatal instinct and body image/self-identity issues. *

If you look at any piece of furry art, they tend to have

- large heads
- large eyes (in proportion to their heads)

These are characteristics humans are ingrained to find "cute." You see them pretty much everywhere in media not deliberately designed to look realistic. Cereal boxes particularly exaggerate this, as they're aimed towards children for whom cute things must be /really/ cute, but even looking at American programming like /Archer/ or a Seth McFarlane cartoon you can see elements of this.

Combined with the fact that furries are a very visual subculture, and that much of furry art is derivative from sources like Sonic, pokemon, catgirls in anime, whatever, that explains why those traits are so exaggerated.

For a literary comparison, look at the people on royalroadl-- because they're so influenced by translated Chinese xianxia and light novels, many adopt the same style of writing, even if their work isn't, strictly speaking, a fanfic.

Similarly, garish colors are probably inspired by the crazy, colorful hairstyles of anime characters.

But I mentioned another cause, too-- body image/self-identity issues. You probably know that furries are a rather isolated subculture. From other comments in this thread, people get /really/ up in arms about them. But as a result of human psychology, group persecution makes it easier to take up a more "us versus them" psychology. As a result, furries are predisposed to be accommodating of members that are also from other minority groups, such as (most notoriously) gay men.

So you have a whole bunch of people who aren't quite comfortable with themselves and with their place in society. And, in keeping with the traditions of the internet, they craft themselves avatars distanced from their mundane real-life selves. Deliberately unrealistic, because a realistic avatar would defeat the point of having an avatar.

And then, even if these people account for only a fraction of the furry population, you hit a self-reinforcing affect with regards to the art: the unrealistic stuff is popular anyways, so versus the extra effort of makin realistic art, artists make unrealistic stuff. Which makes the unrealistic stuff more popular, and so on and so on.

Of course, I may be overthinking this stuff-- maybe furry art is just unrealistic because people feel guilty about fapping to animals.

* Disclaimer: I'm not actually involved with the furry community, although I've read furry works when they intersect with my other speculative fiction related interests. (ex. the stuff DataPacRat writes.)
