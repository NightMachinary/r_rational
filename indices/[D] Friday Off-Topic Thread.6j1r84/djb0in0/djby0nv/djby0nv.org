Mostly what [[/u/eaturbrainz]] said, but:

- Don't drink your calories. If you want to get drunk, strongly prefer hard liquor, neat, to beer.
- I'm OK with strenuous cardio, but I'd worry about high-impact things on your knees and lower-body joints while you're fat. I don't know how fat you are now. You may want to walk at a fast pace (3 MPH) and crank up the incline to something high (10% or higher).
- I like lifting weights, too. I'd do that on the days you're not doing cardio work.
- I like swimming because it's cardio, but not lower-body.
- I prefer something in the vicinity of paleo/keto; [[/r/paleo]] and [[/r/keto]] can help.
- Frozen vegetables are the best thing since sliced bread in the universe of semi-convenience foods sold at supermarkets. Nuke in the microwave, put salt, pepper, and butter on top, and you're done prepping a respectable side of broccoli.
- sure, there are lots of fancypants paleo recipes, but my go-to is ground beef cooked in a pan with some random herbs and spices and maybe some cheese sprinkled on top.
- [[http://www.marksdailyapple.com/blog/][Mark's Daily Apple]] is neat.
- I find it's a lot easier to not get cravings for sweets and carbs when I'm not eating carbs; that's why I tend to stay away from carbs.
- Fake sugar sometimes triggers sugar-and-carbs cravings; you may or may not be vulnerable to this.
