With regards to exercise, I'm told that if you're not panting, you're unlikely to be losing weight from a given exercise. (Exactly at which point you start panting depends on your current fitness level and so forth). You don't want to be so intense that you injure yourself, but you do want it to be at least that difficult.

Also, keep hydrated. Water's easily taken in and just as easily lost - drink as much water as you want. (Dehydration can be nasty).

Thirdly, other people have already talked about diet. Diet is /very/ important, and what's mostly important there is portion size. Try cutting back a little on that. Once you're used to the cut-back portions (and your body realises it's not actually starving on the reduced intake), then the cut-back portions will become the new normal. Then cut back just a little again. Rinse and repeat.

...I hope that's helpful.
