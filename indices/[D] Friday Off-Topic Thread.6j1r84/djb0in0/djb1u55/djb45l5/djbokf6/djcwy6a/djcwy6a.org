There are things you can do to increase your willpower or to make things take less willpower. For example, instead of stopping eating candy and constantly focusing on not grabbing that chocolate bar, you could just remove candy from your house and fill it with healthy food. Now, you can still eat candy if you go get some, but it's easier to eat healthy food and the candy isn't literally right next to you tempting you constantly. Avoiding candy consumption in such a situation now is easier. So there are things you can do, willpower wise!
