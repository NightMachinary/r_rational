So, munchkin this: you have a pocket computer. It's kinda like a supercomputer from the 1980s in terms of computation power, but /way/ easier to use. Also, it magically sends information to other people's pocket computers. What could you do with said pocket computer to help you win at life? Which specific computations can you perform to lead you to better outcomes?

What are you doing with your phones, basically? What would you /like/ to be doing if there was an app for it? How has your pocket computer improved your life?

So far, I've found that having an infinite library in my hand helps with patience and waiting, and that a microphone/camera and data storage helps with memory. Using timers and the stopwatch helps with time sense and short-term memory, and having wikipedia/wolfram helps solve silly debates about known facts. If I ever start a company or otherwise complicate my finaces, it seems that spreadsheets are and always have been the killer app for personal computers in general, but with my current budget having instant access to my debit card amount is enough.

But none of these really feels revolutionary. I have a sense of /so much potential/ that I'm not taking advantage of. It feels like everything so far has been /small/ compared to what could be done.

In particular, I think there's potential to try and use it to automate doing-the-math and therefore make the results of actually calculating things out more available.

How are you using your pocket computer to be more rational?
