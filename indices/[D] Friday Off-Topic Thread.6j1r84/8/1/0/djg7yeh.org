There's something to be said for coding on the device the code is for.

There are general automation apps for Android and iOS that follow simple instructions. IFTTT and tasker for example.

But I don't think they'd let (you + phone) score higher on an IQ test or win at boardgames, let alone less contrived / artificial tasks... I should probably investigate them further anyway.
