Putting aside the unethical nature of your plan, it is too optimistic.

People aren't idiotic enough to not notice only political leaders with leftist views are being killed. And they are going to realize it's not a god doing the killing, since you will almost certainly make errors. They are going to be angry, and want vengeance against the killer (you).

Now, they don't know that it is you specifically doing the killing, but the fact that only political leaders with leftist views are dying strongly suggests that it's someone with rightist views doing the killing. Tensions will run high, and conflicts will break out between left and right. And as more and more leftist leaders die, those conflicts will escalate, eventually becoming a civil war. And a large number of nukes are currently being guarded/controlled by soldiers with leftist views...

So odds are, nuclear war will happen, what's left of society will be in ruins, and you will probably be dead. No happy ending for anyone.
