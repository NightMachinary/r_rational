Okay, on one hand this whole thread is awful and disturbing and I really don't like the whole "Who do you think deserves to die" dynamic.

On the other hand, I would love a story about what would happen if someone started visibly making examples out of political figures of a certain movement and using a magic book to kill them.

How would they react? Politicians are being picked off by a threat they can't fight against or defend themselves from; some of them might continue on anyway, out of confidence, ideology or hoping to stay below the killer's notice. They would try to find ways to protect themselves from the killer's power, like maybe looking for ways to militate for their policies from an anonymous position (if the killer keeps killing off elected official, the government will probably restructure itself to have some sort of anonymous senate). A climate of paranoia would appear, with politicians doing everything they can to protect their identity.

Uh.
