Then you get the politician who /deliberately/ becomes a martyr to the cause. Who dares the "killer" to kill him on national TV, who rallies up crowds of supporters, with cries of "We Will Not Be Controlled", and "He can't Kill All Of Us".

Who takes /advantage/ of the fact that people of his opinions are being killed to create a massive Us Vs. Them situation with the "mysterious killer" as "Tham" and everyone else as "us".
