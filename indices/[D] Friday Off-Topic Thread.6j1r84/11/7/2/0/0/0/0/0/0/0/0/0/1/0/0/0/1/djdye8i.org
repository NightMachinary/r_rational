After about 24 hours of exchanging messages, I can confirm this guy isn't just a hateful prick. He's an unbelievably moronic hateful prick that can't back up any of the reasons he uses to justify his views with any sort of actual fact. It's been interesting talking to someone who's on such a completely opposite side of the moral spectrum from myself.

But he mostly just slings around fancy words in an attempt to make his hateful rhetoric seem legitimate. He's a white supremacist, anti-Jew bigot that has no good reasons for any of the views he has. And can't give me any supporting facts for why that is. Ugh.
