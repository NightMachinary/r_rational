I'm sorry to dig up a quasi-dead horse, but I'm not really comfortable seeing you ban someone after you had an extensive, heated political debate with them; especially since you've demonstrated political bias before, and *especially especially* since during said debate you said things like

#+begin_quote
  You're seriously not very good at logic. Take lessons.
#+end_quote

and TRIPLE especially when you delete every post he made, even though most of these were no less constructive than your own posts, political opinions aside.

I understand that the ban was a result of a mod discussion, but I really wish the whole situation had been handled by [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] and/or [[/u/PeridexisErrant][u/PeridexisErrant]], with one of them announcing the ban and officially ending the thread; I don't think you should have put your mod hat at all to close a debate you were part of.
