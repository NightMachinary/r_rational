Nope. I'm not an "omni-hedonist" and I'm not sure what moral suicide even is! Besides, I think I'm way more moral than you are because I am not a racist or a sexist or any of those things. People are people and their inherent worth is not derived from chromosomes or chemicals but from their awareness of the world. Letting go just means "giving up control". The only reason you'd think that was meaningless is because you don't know how to do what I'm talking about. It's the blind spot of fascists.
