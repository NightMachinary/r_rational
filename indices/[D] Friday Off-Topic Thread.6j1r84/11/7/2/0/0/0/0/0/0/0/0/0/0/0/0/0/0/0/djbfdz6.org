I took your question as a rhetorical one, with the implied question being "His worldview is about dehumanizing me, why should I hear what he has to say?".

And sure, it's true. I'm not saying you should listen to him, or accept his opinions. I'm saying that, given that you're already both committed to not changing your minds, you may as well skip the debate. All you're achieving is a bitter game of chicken /Ã  la/ "Who gets tired of the argument first?"

Also you're really not going to have anyone reevaluate their position by promising to perform a fellation to spite them, or by telling them how more ethical you are than them.
