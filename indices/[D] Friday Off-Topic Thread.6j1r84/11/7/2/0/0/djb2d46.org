  the instrumental value of Church doctrine as it applies to normal people's normal lives can't.

You are a self-described fascist who blames all of the western world's ills on "kikes" and wants to kill people who think that racial and gender equality under the law is a net good. You use the term "racial hygiene" unironically. If this is Church doctrine (and may I remind you that the Church worships a Jew who lived in a multicultural empire that happily mixed people up and down the Mediterranean even after adopting Church doctrine), its value in normal people's lives is clearly non-existant. If this isn't Church doctrine, they aren't doing a good enough job of keeping society free from people like you. Either way, it's pretty disputable.
