There are no words for how much NOPE this deserves.

Why do you think you can tell the difference between organizations that actively support damaging and or killing other people? Pretty much every organisation supports damaging people to some degree. Life is tradeoffs.

Not to mention everyone would /freak out/ about this, and pretty much everyone would support damaging/killing /you/ for the vigilante killings. Therefore now everyone else is fair game for your death note?
