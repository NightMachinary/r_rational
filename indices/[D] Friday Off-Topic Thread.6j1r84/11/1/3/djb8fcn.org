  Killing people for exercising their free speech is a violation of fundamental principles of Western civilization and represents a major defection from what I would have hoped would be our shared values.

Really? And can we justify "free speech" in terms a little closer to the ontological fundamentals?

That's not to say I think we can't. I think the basic justification for free speech is freedom of conscience and freedom of inference: the freedom to acquire, share, and act upon one's own model of the world. The problem is, speech and an earnestly believed model of the world often fail to coincide.

  Openly declaring that you would kill people for what they advocate is incredibly stupid because you're signaling to them that they should defect against you (more than they already have).

If there are no principles you'll fight for, you have no principles. Sorry, but liberalism and pacifism can't be bedfellows. Pick one and only one.
