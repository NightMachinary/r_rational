  I'm pretty sure it would be ethical to go back in time and kill Hitler

I'm not convinced of that, actually. If you kill hitler, let's say you save a few million people who would have otherwise have died. But then, under the butterfly princinple, there would be an incredibly low chance, for any conception, that any specific sperm reaches an egg. That means there would only be a 2^{-48} (24 chromosomes, two parents) chance of that sperm having the same chromosomes in the altered timeline as the original. (A little better if you're inbred.) That's would effectively mean that every single person created after the divergence point would be a different person, killing the original timeline's version. So to save a few million people, you kill billions. Really, this isn't just limited to killing hitler-- any timetravel would do this, assuming things are actually "changed."

Now, you'd get billions of /new/ people to replace the dead ones, but ethics really starts to break down if you try to assign moral value to people who don't actually exist yet, so from the perspective of a pre-timetravel person, it would be unethical to timetravel, just as a post-timetravel person would fine it unethical to not timetravel.
