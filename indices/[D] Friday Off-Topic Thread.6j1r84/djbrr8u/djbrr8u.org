I like guided meditation tapes. There's a sub genre of guided meditation that uses visualizations like "walk through a garden" or "beach at sunset."

I've found that these can be neat. The visualization exercises end up feeling like something between a 'memory palace' and a lucid dream.

Unfortunately, most of the image-based guided meditation tapes seem to be built around some specific goal like improving public speaking, or dieting, or whatever.

I'd like to find something that just had the imagery, without any kind of purpose beyond enjoying a cool lucid dream.

Have other people tried guided meditation? Any recommendations for good readers?

And does anyone know of a series that does the visualizations without attaching any specific self improvement goal?
