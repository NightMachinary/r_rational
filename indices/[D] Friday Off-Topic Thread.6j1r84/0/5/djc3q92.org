Excerpted:

  So what makes a cartoon character cute? You could reduce the answer down to a few basic characteristics: big eyes and head, fluffiness, warmth and chubbiness. “Cuteness is based on the basic proportions of a baby plus the expressions of shyness or coyness,” wrote Preston Blair in Advanced Animation . According to Blair, other cute traits include:

  - Head large in relation to the body.

- Eyes spaced low on the head and usually wide and far apart.

- Fat legs, short and tapering down into small feet for type.

- Tummy bulges---looks well fed.

  But cuteness is far more complex than even Blair's set of rules; some consider E.T., Yoda and WALL·E to be the epitome of cute, despite their furless, odd appearances. Cuteness and a character's perceived hugability aren't always determined by aesthetic appeal. “Cuteness is distinct from beauty,” wrote Natalie Angier for The New York Times . “Beauty attracts admiration and demands a pedestal; cuteness attracts affection and demands a lap.”

  But with any extreme comes another. If a character is too cute and sugary sweet, the audience can develop skepticism. “Cute cuts through all layers of meaning and says, ‘Let's not worry about complexities, just love me,'” philosopher Denis Dutton told The New York Times . It is for that very reason cuteness stirs uneasiness and sometimes feels cheap.

  After all, the adorable, smiling face of a child can hide the havoc he just wreaked by breaking all of his toys. “Cuteness thus coexists in a dynamic relationship with the perverse,” writes Daniel Harris in his book Cute, Quaint, Hungry And Romantic: The Aesthetics Of Consumerism . You could call this the Gremlin Effect---a character with an underlying creepiness. Troll dolls (which were recently acquired by DreamWorks Animation) and Cabbage Patch Kids are the inexplicable result of this paradox.
