Actually, let me backpedal...

In my opinion, the vast majority of "anthro" art falls into the uncanny valley. (Compare illustrations for, e.g., [[https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/redwall/images/6/6c/Redwallfeast.jpg][/Redwall/]] and [[https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1439673381l/119146.jpg][/Mistmantle/]], which are the only non-uncanny examples of such art that I can think of, but are significantly less anthropomorphic than the norm for the category.) Most anthro art also /happens/ to be drawn by mediocre artists, who share the stereotypical cereal-mascot//GURPS//DeviantArt style.
