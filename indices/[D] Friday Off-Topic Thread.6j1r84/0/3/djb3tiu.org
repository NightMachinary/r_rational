Do you have examples of the kind of art you do like, and the kind you dislike? Is [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/76/81/ea/7681eab092b60f6a3336208f8bbbc95f.jpg][this]] what you call the furry style? I can't really imagine this kind of art style on children's cereal, but maybe US cereal have different marketing strategies :P

([[https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/casey-milne-the-wolf/images/3/30/Female_wolf_or_fox_base_png_by_bluesliver_star-d4czzpn.png/revision/latest?cb=20130305171133][very cartoonish]] style sounds closer to what you describe, but I don't really see much of that when searching for 'anthropomorphic wolf')

I think a large part of the reason furry porn is popular is that it safely keeps to the far side of the uncanny valley. Drawing things that clearly aren't meant to be people means we don't pick up on the bad proportions etc, and ingest in a more abstract way - which helps stimulate/enables imagination in case of porn, and helps emphasise in case of plot.
