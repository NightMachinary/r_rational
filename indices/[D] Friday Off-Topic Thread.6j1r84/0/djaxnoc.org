Where does the "furry" art style come from?

I really like anthropomorphic animals, and my current campaign in D&D features them heavily. The problem is that I want pictures for them, but searching "anthropomorphic wolf" brings up a lot of furry stuff, and it's all an art style that I find extremely aesthetically unpleasing (like a cartoon wolf you might see selling children's cereal, I guess). This probably relates to some subcultural norms that I'm ignorant of, but I find it quite annoying.
