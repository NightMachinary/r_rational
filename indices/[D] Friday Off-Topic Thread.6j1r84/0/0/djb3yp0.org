A while back, I worked on some werewolf mods for a couple of games where the point was to make the werewolves look more like natural animals rather than your typical slavering monsters. Unfortunately, finding good, non-creepy reference images was a challenge. I did come across a few artists on DeviantArt who might have what you're looking for:

[[http://darknatasha.deviantart.com/gallery/]]

[[http://lhuneart.deviantart.com/gallery/]]

All three have also linked to works by artists with similar styles in their favorites section.

edit: Browsing a bit on DeviantArt yielded some similar artists who might be worth looking at:
