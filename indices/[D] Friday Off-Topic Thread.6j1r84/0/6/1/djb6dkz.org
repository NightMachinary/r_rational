I already knew you were prejudiced since you believe in [[http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Racialism]["racial realism"]], but how can you possibly claim to be a rationalist when you believe in a baseless stereotype like this? All available evidence suggests that a person's sexuality, including fetishes, are something they are born with and cannot be changed.

There is a huge network of support groups for pedophiles endorsed by the government specifically for this reason. They don't believe anyone should have sex with children and any who do are evil, so they need help to deal with their own feelings and educate others about them.
