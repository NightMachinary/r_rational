No, it really doesn't. I find the whole "furry" thing really weird and a bit cringeworthy if I'm being honest, but those are just my personal feelings and shouldn't infringe on other people in any way. Your argument boils down to "it's okay to suppress a group that deviates from the majority", and that's no way for people to live.
