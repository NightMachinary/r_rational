So if I'm getting this right, you innately prefer social groups with different values to engage in violent conflict rather than civil compromise? You fundamentally disagree with the social contract between humans that our society is based around? Isn't that dangerous from your perspective? It means I have as much a right to harm you as you do to me and whoever's values get optimized is decided by violence.
