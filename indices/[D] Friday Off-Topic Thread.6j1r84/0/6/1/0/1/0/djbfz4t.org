I don't know how else I can break this down.

Even assuming the predisposition towards sexual degeneracy is natural, there is obviously something about our society that makes it far more prominent than more traditional societies. I don't value their suffering, I value their submission. If we had a saner, more rational society, this could be achieved without suffering, just like it always has been. Instead, we first lie to them that they're our equals, then they suffer upon the realisation that they really aren't. I'd much rather put the truth out there and let society sort it out, without state-enforced toleration or pretence of equality.
