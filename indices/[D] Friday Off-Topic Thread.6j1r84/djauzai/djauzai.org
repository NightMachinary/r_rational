Which coins do you consider to be the most pleasing in form? (Note that I'm talking /primarily/ about the overall size, shape, weight, and color of a coin, rather than about the designs pressed into each of its faces.)

As a USAian who has only minimal experience with the coins of other countries, I'd hazard a guess that the plain quarter is my favorite. I'd rate the Sacagawea/presidential dollar coin a little lower---perhaps because I feel offended at the pretension of a mere layer of brass to make the coin look like a gold piece from a fantasy story. I vaguely remember also liking the Anthony dollar coin (basically, a quarter with an undecagon on each face), but it isn't around nowadays.

The approximately-1-inch size of the coins enumerated above definitely is the size that I like the most. I consider the 1.2-inch half-dollar coin (of which I happen to have controlled a single example for many years) somewhat fantastic (not =cool=, but =unrealistic=) in its largeness, while the 0.7-inch dime is right on the edge of being annoying in its smallness. The nickel seems just a hair too thick for its diameter (diameter รท thickness = 11, compared to 14 for the quarter and half-dollar and 13 for the dollar, dime, and penny). I can think of no objection to the penny, other than perhaps its tendency to gain a patina, which can be ugly.
