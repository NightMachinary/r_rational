Honestly I feel like AK's canonic killing power is difficult to know. HPMOR would make it out to be this I-win button, and maybe it is, but Voldemort mostly uses it as a terror weapon to kill children and otherwise helpless victims. If it were so effective in canon, why wouldn't death-eaters be using it at every opportunity? Why would anyone be scared of, for example, dragons or dementors?

My interpretation, which the story doesn't really dwell on because good /lord/ this Hogwarts arc has gone on a lot longer than I thought it would initially, is that it is a difficult spell to begin with, but also something that most people's magic would normally be disinclined to cast- the anthropomorphized emotional core of most people is really not going to be thrilled about being stabbed into someone else's soul, even when it wouldn't balk at say, causing explosions or something.

Sorry, I know it's not a direct answer to the question.
