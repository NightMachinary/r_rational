The "Guardians of the Flame" series maybe counts. A group of college students get portaled into the world of their RPG and become their characters. They have adventures and eventually grab some land and start a settlement where they develop modern technology -- mostly guns, which they use to combat the slave trade. That's not really the focus though.
