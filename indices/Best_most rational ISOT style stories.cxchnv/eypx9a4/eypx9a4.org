Destiny's Crucible by Olan Thorensen

Definitely a good read. About a modern chemical engineer who gets sent to an AU with 1600's tech equivalent. The story isn't just purely plot (heres plans for a steam engine, now go revolt against the empire), but shows little nuances and interactions of elements, such as language, customs, culture, and even morality which makes its setting ever more realistic.
