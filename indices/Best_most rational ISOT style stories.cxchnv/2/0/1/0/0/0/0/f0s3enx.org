Nah, I haven't read the manga. I just said that in general ridiculously stupid politicians, while something that one would /hope/ are too irrational to happen in real life, can sadly be a real thing. Though comic relief levels of stupidity are usually just unrealistic as a whole, as in, actual stupid people aren't that /entertainingly/ stupid.
