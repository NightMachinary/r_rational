Isn't that more of an Isekai than an ISOT? More on the lines of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court][A Connecticut Yankee]] than [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_in_the_Sea_of_Time][Island on the Sea of Time]]? While ISOTs can include no land, see every one where a ship is transported back, portaled to the past is a slightly different genre, I think.
