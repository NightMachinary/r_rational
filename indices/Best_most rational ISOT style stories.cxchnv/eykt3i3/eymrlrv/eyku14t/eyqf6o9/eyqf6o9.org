Would Jerry Pournelle's Janissaries series count? He'll never finish it now, obviously--I've no idea what will happen to the mostly-done draft of book four--but it's midway between what you've described here and an isekai story. A group of American soldiers get kidnapped and transported to another planet where aliens have been taking humans for thousands of years to grow drugs for them. The world is developmentally backwards, so the soldiers are a little outpost of modernity in a medieval society, trying to use their knowledge (and a very limited supply of modern weapons) to get a grip on power. It's sometimes silly, but good fun.
