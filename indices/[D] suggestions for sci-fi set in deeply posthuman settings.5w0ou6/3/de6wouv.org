The tabletop RPG [[http://eclipsephase.com/][Eclipse Phase]] is very much in that genre. It's set after a hard singularity has left the Earth covered in self-replicating war machines, forcing trans-humanity to flee to space stations and colonies, mostly as uploaded minds. You can play as a huge variety of post-humans- from a swarm of robots, to an uplifted crow, to a being adapted for living in the sun's corona- and a central part of the setting is that everyone's mind is being backed up digitally, leaving most people almost immortal and able to change forms at will.
