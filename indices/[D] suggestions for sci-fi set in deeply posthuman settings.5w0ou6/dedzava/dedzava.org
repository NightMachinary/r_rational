I seriously enjoy [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePolity][The Polity]] series by Neal Asher. It's got a great ideas on human augmentation and, particularly in the book Polity Agent, the blurring lines between obsolete human, human augment, and AI.

Not to mention their military strategy is hilariously awesome.
