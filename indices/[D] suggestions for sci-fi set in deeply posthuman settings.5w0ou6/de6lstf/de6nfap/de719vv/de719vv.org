Gonna brag for a sec here, but Hannu is actually a friend of mine (not strongly - we exchange emails every so often, and grab meals when we're in the same city).

If you haven't tried to look up what he's up to other than writing, you should - it's pretty amazing, although I never remember a solid understanding. He's working with programmable DNA (not DNA computers) and is active at Singularity University.

We've batted about various ideas before (I pointed out once the transhumanist trope that the "first past the post" elders - like those in FP - end up as gods, and yet kids always do better with tech than the prior generation), but we haven't discussed if he's writing anything new.
