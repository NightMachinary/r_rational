If you're up for a suggestion of something a little different and not entirely serious I recommend A Miracle of Science. It's a free and completed web comic about the interactions between a member of a fairly traditional sci fi human society from Earth and a member of a post-human society from Mars.

One part of the premise is silly and much of it lighthearted, but in a self-aware way that doesn't take away from the more seriously examined topics. It's worth a look.
