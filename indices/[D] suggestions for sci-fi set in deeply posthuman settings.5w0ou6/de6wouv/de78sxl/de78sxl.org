If you're more interested in hearing a story than playing through one yourself, I recommend [[http://actualplay.roleplayingpublicradio.com/know-evil-an-eclipse-phase-campaign/][Role Playing Public Radio's Know Evil Campaign]] (available for purchase as a campaign book). It's pretty damn long at 27 episodes averaging 3 hours in length, but if you have the time you will be rewarded with a excellent conspiracy cosmic horror epic. It's a lengthy adventure across the inner solar system that shows just how much story can be made with even a small piece of this detailed setting.

There's so much stuff that happens it's hard to describe everything, but I think it most resembles Ghost in the Shell meets The Expanse with Lovecraftian horrors. The Game Master is one of the most intelligent and imaginatively demented creators I've ever seen and continuously pulls off creative and interesting sci-fi ideas without losing sight of the larger conspiracy. It's one of the few overly convoluted stories I've seen that all makes perfect sense in the end, even with subplots.

The only problem I have with it is the slow start when everyone is still figuring out their characters, but once they do the characters become fantastic. The cast features a talking octopus with his own radio show butting heads with corporate overlords, a sociopathic psychic who's trying to be ethical despite being raised in a simulated hell, a naively optimistic robot who keeps dying or being driven insane and having to be restored from a backup, and that's just half the main cast. There's also a ton of memorable villains and side characters.
