This is like... you know how some religions believe that there's spirit in everything, that animals are conscious and trees are conscious and rocks are conscious. Mind suffusing every level and every aspect of existence.

This is usually taken as a thing of beauty. But realistically, that's a romanticized view of how mind behaves.
