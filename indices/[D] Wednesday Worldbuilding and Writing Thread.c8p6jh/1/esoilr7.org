The setting of [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4025200][/The Unincorporated Man/]]: At birth, every person is "incorporated"---divided into shares (which grant voting power over the person's major decisions and a portion of the person's earnings) and put on the market.* Automatically, each parent gets 20 % and the government gets 5 %. (Usually, a parent refrains from selling stock in his child, and wills such stock to the child upon death.) Primary+secondary education typically costs 10--15 % of the student's shares, and college 5--10 %,** leaving the graduate with self-ownership of 30--40 %. In order to prevent situations where a person owns so little of his own stock that his cost of living exceeds his retained earnings (forcing him to rely on shareholders for room and board, and making him effectively a slave), minimum self-ownership is set by law at 25 %. (If that sounds low to you, remember that the story is set 300 years in the future and the productivity-to-cost-of-living ratio has risen dramatically.)

I wouldn't recommend bothering to read the book,*** but I do think that the setting is interesting. Does it have any glaring holes? What if there were no 25-% minimum on self-ownership, and every person started out completely owned by his parents (or a 45-45-10 split between parents and government)? Would something like this system (e. g., everyone carries around an officially-stamped share-book, and every town and village has a registered share-stamper) work in a lower-tech setting (with or without magic)? (E. g., new law: Once per year, the king must provide proof that he owns a majority stake in himself. If he fails to provide such proof, he must immediately abdicate.)

*If this sounds completely implausible to you: The book opens with a 1962 Milton Friedman quote that suggests a system where people could pay for college by pledging a percentage of their future earnings.

**You can get a lower rate for college if you've been working toward a particular career path through high school. A person who doesn't know what major he wants to pick and who took random courses in high school with no particular goal will be a riskier bet and therefore will have to pay more.

***Summary: The titular person, a 300-year-old human popsicle from the 21st century, is revived, is outraged by the proliferation of what he sees as slavery, and starts a crusade to wipe it out.
