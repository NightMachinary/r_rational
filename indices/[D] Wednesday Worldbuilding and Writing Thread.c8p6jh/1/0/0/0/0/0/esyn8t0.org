It might be solvable in that the system can technically function, but it's still a huge broken window fallacy.

I'd possibly be less critical of it if there seemed to be any kind of point to it (what problem did the people who devised this think they were solving?) but even with clarifications and assuming a competent implementation this seems like it's just straw-manning Corporate America as slavery with more steps. (which while fun doesn't seem like a valid basis for a system of government).
