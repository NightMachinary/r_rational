I actually read most of this book! (not OP)

But in general each person is considered their own CEO. Meaning they effectively make all decisions about their life, and must report to their shareholders with a monthly earnings report and justify it, and so on. Life decisions might be put to shareholders, but not smaller stuff like buying food and furniture.

Also the couch would probably come out of their personal stock dividends (the 25%), unless they could justify it as a "business" expense. For example as a software engineer I might be able to justify buying a top of the line computer with my (pre-dividend earnings) revenue (or like with the IRS, claim that it will be used 60% for business and 40% for personal use and split it 60% revenue, and 40% personal dividend).

Shareholders don't have to be consulted everytime. But they do have certain rights, like requiring a psychological investigation of the person's behavior. And I think at one point, a character (as a shareholder) even forces another character (the person whose shares are held) to undergo some sort of brain re-wiring procedure.
