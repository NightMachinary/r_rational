I saw this on the shelf at the bookstore once... thought it looked cool, but never saw it again (i wasnt going to pay hardcover prices).

the premise is fairly similar to the old company store model in some ways, a rigged game where everyone loses except for a wealthy few in charge. setting-wise, enforcement of the law matters more than details of the law. how do you deal with the rebels that fight against the system? thats where the real story is.
