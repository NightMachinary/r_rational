I mean I assume a lot of that is solved with computers, and I think it's more likely to be quarterly or yearly. And I would point out that people are expected to file quarterly earnings reports (or yearly if you don't make enough money) with the government already.

But I do agree with your points to an extent, I just don't think it makes it totally unworkable.
