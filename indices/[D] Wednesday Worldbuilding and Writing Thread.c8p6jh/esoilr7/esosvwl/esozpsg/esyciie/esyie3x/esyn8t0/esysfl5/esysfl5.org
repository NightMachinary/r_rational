I mean considering it's meant to be a parody of libertarianism (not corporate America), and specifically anarcho-capitalism (and how corporations can also have the same problems as governments, like slavery), I'm not sure you are understanding it correctly. (this is made clearer by the inclusion of things like cryptocurrencies and smart contracts before bitcoin was well known, and also the behavior of the main character when it comes to precious metals)

It solves taxation by rephrasing it as a 5% flat tax post earnings. It takes corporate person hood to the literal extreme (there is no legal difference between a corporation and a person now). It solves education and other long term investment in people's futures without the need for a government. It uses /the best economic system ever/ the free market to solve all problems.

I don't agree with those positions, but they are the core problems with anarcho capitalism, and this was a system designed to solve them.
