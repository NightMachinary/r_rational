The logistics of holding a vote on someone's decisions escape me here.

​

If I am trying to buy a couch am I suppsoed to call a shareholder meeting to vote on the matter?

Then, don't all my shareholders have to call their own meetings to decide how they're going to vote on my couch purchase?

​

How does anything actually get done with that cascading series of votes?
