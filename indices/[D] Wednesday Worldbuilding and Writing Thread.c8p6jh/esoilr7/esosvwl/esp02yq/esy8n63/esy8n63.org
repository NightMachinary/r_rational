I still think this becomes an unworkable mess fast unless basically everyone is juts ignoring the whole system.

For example, instead of filing a tax return to the government annually you need to file that earnings report with every shareholder you have. That includes the government, your old schools, and parents, but also anyone who's happened to buy a share you sold in the past, which means you need to keep track of those sales. So any time a mutual fund buys a share from another mutual fund you need to be notified and keep up with your own records.

Then there's the meetings themselves. Institutions like schools now have to have investment boards that brief representatives who attend the shareholder meetings of former students, or decide when to sell shares in former students.

And remember this has to be done not only by Mr.Colledge educated investment banker, but also by Cletus the slack jawed yokel, who's shares were sold down to the minimum legal self ownership level by Dureen the neglectful mother to buy cigarettes meaning he has a lot of shareholders to track and notify.

As anything other than a make-work program fro accountants, I don't see this being successful.

Some other failure points:

1. Unless it's specifically outlawed expect every employer to require you to sign over a share or two when you are hired, because it's easy money and if they all do it you can't really say no.

2. Governments will get into all the shenanigans that wallstreet does (sub prime citizen backed securities anyone?) but there's even less accountability between soverign powers than there is between banks.

3. The drama surrounding any combination of choices regarding how marriage interacts with this system.
