Mine is a writing question. I am working on a web serial that is still a ways away from being ready...but when it is, I am hoping to submit it for "rational review" so to speak.

Is it acceptable to post it here a single time to ask for opinions on if it should have a "rational" tag on it? Alternately, is there any kind if writing review group that checks out works for that purpose?

Ive worked fairly hard at making it a rational story, but I dont want to just declare it a success at achieving that without any input.
