I don't see every citizen compiling a monthly earnings report as a sustainable system. While it's less egregious than calling shareholder meetings at decision time, it's still a major increase in the accounting burden of the general public and aggregated across a whole society adds up to a lot of wasted labor.

It'd be like filling tax returns with an employee self evaluation attached every month. And presumably there are legal consequences to getting it wrong. There's also the issue that these reports are either public, or you have to track the ever shifting set of people who own your shares to send the report to them (again with legal consequences if you mess up).

And that's not even getting into the issues related to making schools into major stakeholders requiring them to have people to manage those stakes, or the conflict of interest between governments owning shares in citizens who vote on government matters.
