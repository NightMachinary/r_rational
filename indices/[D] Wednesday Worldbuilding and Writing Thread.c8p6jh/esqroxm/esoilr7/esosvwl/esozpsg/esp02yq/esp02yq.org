The book doesn't really go into the details---but I think you're overlooking the existence of [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097][rules]] that govern shareholder voting.

Even IRL, [[https://www.hutchlaw.com/library/the-basics-of-corporate-governance][not every decision requires shareholder approval]]. The +CEO+ incorporated person has leeway to do /some/ things, but what those things /are/ depends on what the shareholders have agreed to. Maybe /some/ shareholders want to pass judgment on your every little action before you take that action, but most are content to check on you intermittently, look back on the past few days/weeks/months of your behavior, and take corrective measures accordingly. Maybe they'll pass a rule stating that a shareholder meeting must be called before any purchase that exceeds one percent of your annual gross income and before any unusual action that poses a large risk of impairing your future earning potential by at least ten percent (worded more precisely than that, of course). (And, really, how often will you be buying a couch?)

Likewise, to me it seems overwhelmingly likely that the larger shareholders will push through a rule mandating that no shareholder under a certain threshold (1 %, 0.1 %, or whatever) need be consulted for a vote. (Small shareholders might still be counted toward the quorum, though.)

Under such a system, cascading votes probably wouldn't be a problem too often.
