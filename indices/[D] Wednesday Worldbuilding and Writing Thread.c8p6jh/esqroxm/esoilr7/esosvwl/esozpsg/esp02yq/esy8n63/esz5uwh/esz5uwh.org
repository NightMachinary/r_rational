  [I]nstead of filing a tax return to the government annually you need to file that earnings report with every shareholder you have. That includes the government, your old schools, and parents, but also anyone who's happened to buy a share you sold in the past, which means you need to keep track of those sales. So any time a mutual fund buys a share from another mutual fund you need to be notified and keep up with your own records.

Again, you have to remember that /the shareholders/ decide on how much information they want to see. Shareholders don't want to have their time wasted with zillions of reports and meetings about penny-stock people any more than the penny-stock people do. If the shareholders want to switch from monthly, highly-detailed reports that are sent to every shareholder to yearly, less-detailed reports that are sent only to larger shareholders, they can do so.

  And remember this has to be done not only by Mr.Colledge educated investment banker, but also by Cletus the slack jawed yokel, who's shares were sold down to the minimum legal self ownership level by Dureen the neglectful mother to buy cigarettes meaning he has a lot of shareholders to track and notify.

This society is high-tech enough to have secretly sapient AIs, which presumably handle a lot of this stuff.

  Unless it's specifically outlawed expect every employer to require you to sign over a share or two when you are hired, because it's easy money and if they all do it you can't really say no.

I don't see how that's a "failure point".

  Governments will get into all the shenanigans that wallstreet does (sub prime citizen backed securities anyone?) but there's even less accountability between soverign powers than there is between banks.

The government's constitution specifically forbids it from owning any more or any less of any person than the five percent that it received at that person's birth, so it can't buy or sell any shares in people.

  The drama surrounding any combination of choices regarding how marriage interacts with this system.
#+end_quote

Mention is made of a "traditional exchange of stock" (the amount is unspecified) before marriage, as well as of marriages between more than two people, but no details are given of marriage or of divorce. In any event, I don't see why it would have to be worse than the current system.
