Hmm. So you need to justify a HYDRA-esque conspiracy keeping Magic (which includes demons and parallel worlds alongside other stuff) a secret, within a larger organization that appears mundane and benign. They've killed famous scientists before.

I've got one word for you: memes.

Spells - not all spells, not even most spells, but some - are infectious. Your average memetic threat is bad enough, jumping from mind to mind and infecting those who try to study it; but this is a universe with /magic/, and that means thinking the wrong thing can literally summon demons. Messily. Possibly inside the brain that was thinking it at the time.

They can point to other realities that were consumed, in places where this stuff got out.

The scientists, being brilliant and inquisitive, got too close to The Truth, and were killed mid-summoning of something gribbly.
