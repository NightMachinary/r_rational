Maybe you need to consider the motivations of the 'demons' that this organisation deals with. Are they things that sway the organisation that controls them? Are they desperately scary and need to be contained at all costs? Do they provide incentives to those who are trying to control them? Are they just inhabitants of another realm?

These could all affect the motivations of those high up in your organisation.
