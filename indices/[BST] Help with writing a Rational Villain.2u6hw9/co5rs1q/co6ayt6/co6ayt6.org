First of all, I'm a big fan of your work.

As for the story, I'm aiming for the the conflict to be as close to "Good x Good" as possible, with the end goal being making myself at least a little bit unsure about which side is right.

Most authors, when looking for a motivation for their antagonists, seem to choose "justifiable" instead of "morally Good". By which I mean, and let's use your definition of Abstergo as an example, trying to control the world because everything is going to go out of control otherwise does make sense, but immediatelly triggers the "Well, ok, but their actions still feel evil to me" reaction in my mind. And I think the reason might be that my mind can't actually properly picture that potential scenario, because it's just too abstract. It's a lot like that one example about how people care more about one bird affected by an oil spill, then 1000 birds, because our mind just can't process big numbers in that context. (I'm paraphrasing of course)
