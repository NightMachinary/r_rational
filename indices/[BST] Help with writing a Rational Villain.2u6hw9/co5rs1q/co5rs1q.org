I've always liked Abstergo from the /Assassin's Creed/ franchise as a pretty good example of an "evil" organization. They seek control over the world, because they believe that without that control, humanity is just going to spiral out of control and all the progress of centuries past is going to be lost. It's not even really clear that they're wrong - they've been responsible for the majority of the technological advancements in the past centuries. It's sort of an authoritarian/anarchic dynamic between them and the Assassins, which is a much better dynamic then simply good/evil.

And as with many evil organizations, you will have members ready with "Oh, well /that guy/ was evil, but we've formally distanced ourselves from him" in the same way that a lot of real world organizations do.
