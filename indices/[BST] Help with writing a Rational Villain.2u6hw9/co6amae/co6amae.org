Is the top leadership aware of the criminal leanings of part of the organization, or is it a hidden splinter group with outside funding?

The social dynamic that you describe would be a lot easier if the organization had lots of separate departments that were highly islanded, very little cross-fertilization of staff or resources. One or two strong outside funding sources could allow a department to have far more resources than the main organization itself even knows about.

This gives the organization itself real innocence, and might throw the heroic types off. Heroes put the CEO under a truth spell, and she knows absolutely nothing. Same with the other organization officers. The government gets upset and tells the heroes to back off.
