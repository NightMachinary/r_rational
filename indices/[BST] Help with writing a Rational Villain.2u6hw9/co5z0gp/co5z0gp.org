For them to be villainous they either need villainous goals or actions.

1. Why did they kill the scientists? Did they believe that they were doing dangerous science? Were they about to spoil some monopoly? Personal hate?

2. What research and actions are they willing to take that are villainous? Mass murder? Torture?

I'd suggest you have them not care about stopping the apocalypse but care about stopping small scale massacres. They want to stop local demon incursions and dangerous magic. There are many different factions in the organization, but at a higher level they are happy to authorize mass murdering every red haired person in a village if the demon grows stronger when they eat a red haired person. They will take this method even if there are easier ways. The higher ups also seek political power and dominance and so a number of their actions will use the excuse of a demon incursion to slaughter political enemies and foes.
