Here's a set-up that I think fulfils all those criteria. Although I suspect it'd have to be altered to work in the setting. Use or discard whatever parts you want.

The organisation is only the latest of several branches established across multiple realities, working in tandem with forces in the home plane/s of the demons to bar demonic entry to their respective worlds. Without this context, any one branch appears to do evil for the sake of it. As their work continues, demons will be barred from entry, saving far more then they harm maintaining the interdictum.

Or, if that's too close to "greater good", make their actions in this reality actually help protect another reality, one which contains their friends and loved ones. They're only doing harm in the eyes of the protagonists, but to them it's truly necessary.
