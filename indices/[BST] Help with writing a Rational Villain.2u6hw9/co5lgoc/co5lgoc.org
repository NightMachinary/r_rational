What are you asking for help with? Just figuring out a reasonable-yet-villainous motivation for them?

My thought: Their mission statement is to look for ways to protect Muggles from magic. Motivations for joining the organisation can vary from person to person: helps make interesting characters.

Some want to integrate wizards into normal society, which makes it necessary to prevent them from doing certain magics at certain times. For example, you have to be able to put them in prison without them fireballing their way out.

Some have seen what wizards do to Muggles (c.f. some important event, ideally one the players participated in, to show that their actions have Consequences), and want to make it possible to remove a wizard's magic, to protect them from their own stupidity.

Some want to give Muggles magic. Magic is great, everyone should have it! Hence the focus on magic symbols and demons: I imagine those don't require innate magic to use.
