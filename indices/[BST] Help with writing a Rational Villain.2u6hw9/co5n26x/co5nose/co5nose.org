Ah, I should have explained that better. The villains are supposed to be the "upper management" if you will, the folks who actually know what's really happening behind the scenes. Until now in the story, they were in the background, basically doing evil things just because there needed to be someone doing them. But because I'm now trying to make a whole story arc around them, I'd like them to have an actual rational reasons and motivations for doing those things, so that the protagonist isn't just fighting another Greater Good, Hydra-style villains.

As for the protagonists, one of them is a former member of the organization who found out the truth about their involvement in the big exorcistic accident and then got captured by the organization before and spent some time inprisoned before escaping through mysterious means while drugged. Even he doesn't yet fully understand how he did it. As for their moral standing, motivations and such, they are mostly just your everyday wizards trying to beat the big bad, getting revenge and such. (because it's an online RPG, they are basically player characters. By making the antagonists rational and giving them moraly Good motivations, I'd like to force the players to make the characters more rational and interesting in response)
