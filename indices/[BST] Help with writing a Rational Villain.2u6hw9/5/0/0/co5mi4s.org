Level 1 Intelligence: If you were a Muggle in this world, what would you do? If you thought you were crazy because you just saw a woman disappear into thin air? If you were childhood friends with a wizard? If this secret organisation already existed and you knew of it? If you were a physicist? A lawyer? A cop? A venture capitalist? A fishmonger? If you were Elon Musk? Douglas Adams? Taylor Herbert? Taylor Swift?

Vary the parameters until you find a course of action that's reasonable and also fits the required role in the story.
