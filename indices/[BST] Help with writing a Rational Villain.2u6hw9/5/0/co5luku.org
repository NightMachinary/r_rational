Thanks, I've rephrased my plea slightly to make it more clear what I need.

I really like your ideas, mostly because nothing like that has even occured to me! I think I might have a small case of tunnel vision, because I had a really hard time coming up with motivations that were actually Good without the clich√© "greater good" bs (like preventing an apocalypse or something).
