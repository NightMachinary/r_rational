Ok. First question: are they publicly seen as "villains" at all? Does anyone actually think they're evil to [[http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100730161648/simpsons/images/c/cf/Republican_party_headquarters.png][this extent]]?

No, right? Because no halfway intelligent villain, particularly not one who believes in their own goals, actually lets themselves wind up with bad publicity.

Also, VIP science club? Shield-vs-Hydra sort of deal? This organization sounds like the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP Foundation]] to me. They don't just prevent apocalypse, they keep the public safe and /sane/ until such time as your local Phlebotinum can be understood without snapping the untrained human mind and comforting sense of reality into little itty-bitty pieces. It's an important job, you know, and if organization members occasionally engage in small graft, take an Item home every now and then... well, people take things home from work everywhere. No helping it, is there?
