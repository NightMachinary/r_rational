Is the division between magical person and nonmagical person absolute, like in Harry Potter? Or can anyone learn magic? Or can anyone learn magic, but some people or naturally gifted at using it?

In Nasuverse (the setting for Fate/Stay Night) the magus association believes that magecraft degrades the more people there are using it. Also, anyone with open magic circuits can use magecraft, however there is an advantage all the old magus families have in the form of artificial magic circuits that the have developed and passed down. Thus, the standard magi is extremely motivated to protect their secrets from both other magi and from the rest of the world. The magus association views any action necessary to keep magecraft secret as justified, hypnotizing people, killing people, covering up events, etc.

In your setting you mentioned they killed off a bunch of scientists. Perhaps the scientific community was getting close to uncovering how some of magic worked, and they killed them to protect that knowledge. How morally ambiguous they are is a direct function of how important it is to keep magic from degrading and how much magic degrades with common usage and usage by more people. If magic is needed to stop demons, and mass scientific examination of magic would completely disrupt or divide or degrade its powers, then killing the scientists can be framed as a cruel but necessary action.

Edit: I just reread your prompt and noticed you said you don't actually want to retcon the setting. The solution I present could still work with reduced retconing, you would just need to restrict the degradation of magic effect to some paticular branch or area of magic that is both important and about to be discovered by that group of scientists.
