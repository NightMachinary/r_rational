Thank you for this recommendation. I've enjoyed this story quite a lot.

Some things just bugged me throughout though. The first is the extremely, improbably human-like aliens which [[/u/ignirtoq]] has already touched upon. The second is the anthropomorphised as hell AIs.

Now, I get the reasons for these things, namely the source material and the ease of empathy with protagonist, respectively. It still annoys me how each AI must apparently be 'soulful' in this story. I just want to read about a damn emotionless optimisation engine that wins at everything by virtue of recursive self-improvement (or at least by virtue of rationality if self improvement just breaks the story too much). What I don't want to read is AI angst, human angst is quite enough for me. There is one decision in particular that is so blatantly, obviously suboptimal as far as Red's utility function goes that it just boggles the mind. The AI is irrational and it is irrational in a distinctly human way, which is disappointing.
