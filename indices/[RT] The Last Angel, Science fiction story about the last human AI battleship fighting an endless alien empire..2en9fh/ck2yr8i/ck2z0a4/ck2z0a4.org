Your criticism is mostly about it not being hard sci fi- that isn't a requirement of rational fiction. HPMOR, the spawning fiction, was about a magical universe. Soft sci fi universes can still be rational.

For example, there is no reason to expect magical spells to work as magic isn't real. But we still accept it in the story and in many other popular rational fictions.

Also, with your second message, did the alien actually say alcohol caused drunkedness in them?
