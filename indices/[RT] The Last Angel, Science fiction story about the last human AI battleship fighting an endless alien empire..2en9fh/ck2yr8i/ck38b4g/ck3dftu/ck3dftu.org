I find it extremely hard to believe that the only difference in two (much less more) independently evolved intelligent species' response to psycho-social stress is whether their bodies sweat or itch. Their mental responses are /identical/. Do you really buy that the bodies can vary so dramatically, but the minds are bound to this extremely specific paradigm, including cognitive biases and instinctual emotional responses?

And the Great Filter argument breaks down entirely with the descriptions of artificial general intelligences. In this story you have three options: exactly human-like (with possible boosted speed and "cleverness"), too dumb to think creatively (on the cusp of sapience, but not quite there), or completely insane. Just like the aliens, they suffer from most of the same emotional hangups and cognitive biases as organic intelligences.
