There are 300 billion stars in the milky way, that there are only a couple dozen species is some crazy filtering. So I don't think it's that crazy that the filter restricts intelligent life to only being able to come about through the exact evolutionary processes which produced humans (through the same social pressures, etc)

Yeah, the AI thing is an issue but compared to other sci fi stories with AIs it's a pretty damn good job. At least it's an immortal, fast, clever, psychopath. Remember they managed to restrict it from self-improving.
