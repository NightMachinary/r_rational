#+begin_example
  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

  Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent."

I think it meets those guidelines pretty well.
