It's not a non sequitur.

The story is based off Halo and The Excalibur Alternative. They are using established ideas from two pre-existing universes to write a story. The aliens there were humanoid so these aliens are too.

Another story I submitted was Mother of Learning. Would you criticize that for pretending magic was real (because the author likes DnD) and that souls were real (likely based of Naruto fanfiction?) Most rational fanfictions submitted here would not withstand your rejection criteria.

The FTL is similar to The Excalibur alternative.

  and I'm saying if it's not required for rational science fiction, then where do you draw the line?

I don't really draw a line around this. Most authors are humans, I don't expect them to write non humans that well. There are limits to how well the average person can generate alien races plus the less humanoid they are the less popular a story will be. Besides which, it's based on fiction filled with humanoid aliens.

  My point about alcohol is that they drink it recreationally.
#+end_quote

So the effects are vague, and you somehow based on your extensive knowledge of ethanol chemistry have decided it can have no effect on alien brains?

Besides which, the source material has drunk aliens.

  My TL;DR in all of this is ultimately that any specific facet of this story is perfectly reasonable for a story to have, but if the story is rational then there has to be a reason for the facet other than "plot" or "atmosphere".

That is your rule, not the subreddit's.

"The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent."

"The main character uses (or tries to use) rationalist and scientific methods to demystify seemingly mysterious phenomena."

None of your suggestions violate that.
