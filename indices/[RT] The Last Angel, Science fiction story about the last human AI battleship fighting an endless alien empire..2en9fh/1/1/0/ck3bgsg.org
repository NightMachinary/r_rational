Talking about HPMOR is a non sequitur. The suspension of disbelief there is that some magical system exists. Once that's presupposed, it must follow rationally. That is the paradigm of rational fantasy fiction.

This is clearly science fiction. And even here, once again you can insert something like FTL travel with a similar suspension of disbelief, although the requirements are a bit more strict (e.g. you need some kind of "jargon" to "explain" it, in this case shocking is some contortion of general relativity). After those select additions are made, the rules of the universe must again flow rationally.

You say that "hard sci-fi" is not a requirement of rational fiction, and I'm saying if it's not required for rational science fiction, then where do you draw the line? In this, you have aliens with psychologies effectively identical to human psychology, apart from very minor variations. They experience arrogance, racism, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_blind_spot][bias blindspot]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error][fundamental attribution error]]. They experience psycho-social stress in exactly the way a human would, and they even have a specific physiological manifestation that differs from race to race in minor detail only (e.g. Builders get itchy skin and Thoughtful rapidly blink in identically socially stressful situations that make a human sweat). Except for the descriptions of extra eyes, extra height, head-tentacles, a reader could easily mistake this for a space opera about different human nations warring with each other.

My point about alcohol is that they drink it recreationally. That's clear. Whether or not it specifically causes drunkenness doesn't really matter. If it's recreational then it causes something closely analogous to drunkenness. Plus, there is a whole section of the story where a Tribune /drinks himself into a constant haze to mitigate what is clearly Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder/. That requires a mighty suspension of disbelief.

My TL;DR in all of this is ultimately that any specific facet of this story is perfectly reasonable for a story to have, but if the story is /rational/ then there has to be a /reason/ for the facet other than "plot" or "atmosphere". Most of the details of the universe have clearly been chosen to enhance the reader's relatability, not because they follow rationally from a predefined set of rules.

Whereas you are restricting "rational" to the motivations and actions of the characters in the fiction, I apply it to the entire piece. That's why the sub has tags for "hard sci-fi" and "hard fantasy" but not just "sci-fi" or "fantasy".
