While this is a very good, enthralling story, I really have my doubts that it's rational. At the very least, there are a lot of qualities of the setting that aren't explained and that one would not expect from what we know about the universe and the nature of life and the mind right now.

I can't really do an analysis with spoiler tags liberally peppered through, so if you haven't read it yet

*SPOILERS FOR MOST OF THE STORY BELOW*

The most glaring difficulty I'm having is the nature of the mind of most of the sapient alien species. Barring racial proclivities (e.g. "Builders" being predisposed to engineering, "Thoughtful" to scientific careers, etc.) and very minor eccentricities, everyone is extremely human-like.

We are reasonably certain that a significant chunk of the nature of human thinking and consciousness is the result of the evolutionary path our species took to get to where we are. We have instinctual responses to certain stimuli, but even on top of that our default decision-making processes are heavily biased by what worked for our ancestors. In other words, humans have a very irrational baseline mental structure that's shaped heavily by our evolutionary history.

There's no reason to expect alien species that evolved on other planets completely isolated from our own to have such a phenomenally similar baseline mental structure. The story takes this as a baseline, and though I'm only halfway through, given the writing style I don't expect an explanation to be coming. Alien characters are motivated by personal beliefs and values, which is rational yes, but their actions and responses are highly human-like, which without an explanation is very irrational /as a setting/. I grant that a rational story can and should have irrational characters, but aliens that are irrational in /precisely human ways/ is not rational /writing/. It feels like a choice that was made to allow readers to empathize with the characters at the expense of realism.

Beyond that major point, I just happen across speedbumps every once in a while that really impede my immersion. For example, one alien remarks in his internal monologue that humans produce some excellent wines. What? First, there's no explanation of how the alien can consume organic products from a human environment, but there's a deeper problem. Implicit in this assessment is that more than one species produces "wine." Now, one could say that maybe it's artistic license in the rendering of the alien language equivalent of "ethyl-alcohol-containing liquids" that fits the flow of prose better, but even there is a problem. Why would alien physiology respond the same way to alcohol as ours? Granted, for any species we are likely to be able to interact with, chemistry is universal (i.e. for the acceptable pressures, atmosphere compositions, etc.), but biology is not. There's no reason to believe an alien species would process alcohol in any way similar to the way we do, especially with it suffering analogous side-effects to its biology to the ones that affect humans.

With a proper explanation, stuff like this is passable, but with all of this lumped together, it really feels like the setting has been slapped together for the story, rather than the story emerging from a rationally constructed setting. There are too many artistic details and remarks that make the story a fun read but otherwise implausible.
