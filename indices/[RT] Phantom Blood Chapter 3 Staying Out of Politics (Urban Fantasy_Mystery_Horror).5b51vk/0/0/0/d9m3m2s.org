Nah, that's just my Fictionpress avatar. My username over there is Kyubey the Kid, so that's why there's a cute little alien sociopath there. I /will/ say that this story is very much inspired by shows like Madoka/NGE/Serial Experiments Lain in that it eventually devolves into a depressing, metaphysical insanity, but I'm doing that gradually. I can't really have characters going crazy if no one cares about them. I guess a more apt comparison would be: "What would happen if Hunter x Hunter meets Madoka".
