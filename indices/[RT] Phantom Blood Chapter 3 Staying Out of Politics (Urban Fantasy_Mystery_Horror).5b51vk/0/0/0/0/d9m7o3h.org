Are you going to write about the reason why Joshua wouldn't use some kind of trinket to demonstrate magic to any nonbeliever he met and also why magic isn't a fact of life for everyone, especially at a place of learning which I'd imagine would be even more interested than an average city in research into such a beneficial field?
