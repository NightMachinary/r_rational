I haven't read the story yet, but here's a suggestion:

Priests are required by their church to help keep the masquerade up. To this end, most hospitals have at least one priest on their staff with a bland name like, "medical assistant". The church also restricts the amount of healing that a priest can do. They're allowed to enhance a hospital's rate of success, but they are strictly forbidden from solving any injuries that couldn't be duplicated by the existing medical technology.

Additionally, priest magic depends on a priest's belief that they're doing the right thing. So if a priest attempts to do something that they've been taught is forbidden (like, say, use their healing magic outside the church-sanctioned uses), it will probably fail because of their own internalized guilt.
