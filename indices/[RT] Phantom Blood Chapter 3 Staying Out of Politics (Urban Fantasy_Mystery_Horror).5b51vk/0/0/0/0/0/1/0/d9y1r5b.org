I guess it also has to do with his character. I didn't show his argument with the editor, but the guy barely let Al finish talking before taking a jab at him. His mindset afterwards was more "fuck this guy" over "let me show him i'm not lying". I dunno, does this sound like a bad explanation? He does show Elizabeth magic in the next chapter, mostly because he was fed up with being called a fake and they were in private. Maybe it doesn't work well.
