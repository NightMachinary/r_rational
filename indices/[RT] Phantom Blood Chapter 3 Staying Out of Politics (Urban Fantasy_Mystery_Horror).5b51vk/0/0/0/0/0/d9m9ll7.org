Yes! Thank you for reading! In the next chapter, Elizabeth literally asks why they didn't show their magic to the editor. The talisman she picked up can transform into a gun, so just doing that could be enough to prove it. There's actually a couple of reasons for magic being so unknown:

1) The first lesson every mage learns, no matter what tradition they follow, is to keep their unique spells a secret until it is absolutely necessary to do otherwise. You never know who's an ally, and even then, things like hypnosis and mind reading aren't uncommon. Since half of all mage battles are figuring out what your opponent is doing, their culture has developed a stigma against sharing the extent their abilities. Only close friends get to know it, and it's a huge display of trust. Also, Al didn't bother finding out any of the thug's spells because [[#s][mild spoiler]] He's kind of an exception to this rule. Even then, there are situations where he has to figure out the opponents spell. It's just that he was too focused on escaping to care about it in this particular moment.

2) Al didn't transform his talisman in front of the editor because, in the past, bringing a gun out of nowhere usually ended up badly for him. People normally get nervous when someone suddenly brandishes a weapon. Joshua can't transform the talisman because it only works with Al's mana.

3) Mages are such a tiny percentage of the population, that they've become a very insular community. Out of the twenty million people in Xeistoria, only a little more than a thousand are magic users. That's .005% of the population, so it's very unlikely that you meet one, let alone see them in a situation where they have to use mana.

4) A bunch a shit went down thousands of years ago where the church would persecute any magic users that weren't "blessed by their goddess". This was usually a flimsy justification, and was used by the church as political tool to monopolize all magic users, but it created a bit of paranoia among the magical community. Right now, it's still taboo to openly display magic and while not illegal, it won't score you any points with the Tribunal. The church is a bit more chilled out in this age, but they maintain an uneasy truce with the magical families of cities far enough from their capital (like Xeistoria). Al and Joshua are kinda skirting a loophole where they're not really showing their magic, just helping people with magical problems.

I /think/ this works in general, but I'm still running into trouble with certain details. For example, healing magic is an average ability possessed by low-tier members of the church, like the usual priest. Right now I'm banging my head against the wall trying to come up with a reason for why they aren't famous for these abilities, since they can be easily shown. They can literally cure any type of cancer if they wanted to! You'd think they use this as proof, but for some reason doctors are considered more trustworthy than a guy that can heal you with just a touch. Honestly, if you have any ideas about this I'd love them. Really, anything to make the setting less flimsy, because even after thinking about it a lot, I still feel like it has some holes.
