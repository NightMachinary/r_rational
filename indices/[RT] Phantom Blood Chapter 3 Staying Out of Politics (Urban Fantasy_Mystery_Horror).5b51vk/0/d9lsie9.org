I'm still unsure about posting here... I'm very paranoid that there's a huge problem with this story, even though I'm only on the third chapter. I guess I'm just afraid someone's gonna tear apart what I've written so far, but at the same time, I kinda want that to happen so I can fix whatever flaws it has. Human desires can be so paradoxical at times...

Anyway, this chapter has the first action scene of the story so I hope it's enjoyable. Feedback is always welcome!
