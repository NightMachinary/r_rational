I don't think any of this prevents Al from imbuing his arm with magic and then hitting it full-force with a hammer in front of the editor. Mana imbuing doesn't seem to be a unique spell and since it's a defensive one it shouldn't make anyone think Al is attacking. The church is unlikely to find out about one demonstration in a private room too.

  I think this works in general, but I'm still running into trouble with certain details. For example, healing magic is an average ability possessed by low-tier members of the church, like the usual priest. Right now I'm banging my head against the wall trying to come up with a reason for why they aren't famous for these abilities, since they can be easily shown. They can literally cure any type of cancer if they wanted to! You'd think they use this as proof, but for some reason doctors are considered more trustworthy than a guy that can heal you with just a touch. Honestly, if you have any ideas about this I'd love them. Really, anything to make the setting less flimsy, because even after thinking about it a lot, I still feel like it has some holes.

Dunno, sorry. I'm a lot better at pointing out holes than filling them.
