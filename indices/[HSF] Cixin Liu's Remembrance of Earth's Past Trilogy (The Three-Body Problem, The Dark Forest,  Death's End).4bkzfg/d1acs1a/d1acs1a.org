I bought and read The Three Body Problem without knowing it was the first in the trilogy, and was surprised that it ended so abruptly. I've been waiting until the final book is out before reading The Dark Forest.

I certainly enjoyed the insight into the Chinese perspective on science, especially wrt the cultural revolution.

Is there any possibility that Ken Liu would translate The Dark Forest?
