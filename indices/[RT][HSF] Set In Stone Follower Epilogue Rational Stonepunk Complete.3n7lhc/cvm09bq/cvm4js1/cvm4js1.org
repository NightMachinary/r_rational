Rationally though, do you think that Allen would have been allowed to participate in high level political discussions? The end of the story was the end of chapter 28. The epilogue was just to tie up some of the loose ends and set up the next story, which will definitely include Speedy and a dolphin in a shallow-water meeting, heh.

Stateman Taylor is the leader of New Tokyo, the state whose population will be starving if they do not get food. They are going to take agency as soon as it's offered to them, and they do, in the epilogue.

I'm not saying that you don't have a point, because from a story-writing point of view you do, and it's valid, but I didn't see Allen as the one to solve the problem completely. He was always intended to be the catalyst, the source of the idea, not the one to do the political behind-the-scenes wrangling to make it actually work. Think tank vs. implementation.

Unlike swords-and-sorcery books where the young hero can hack and cast his way into the throne room of the evil overlord and save the day, Allen is restricted by his ability to convince other people to do what he wants. He's not very good at it, except for when he has ideas that are undeniably good. When it comes down to negotiation and diplomacy, Allen needs to get out of the room, stat. And he's come to recognize that, even if he's agreed to try to work on that weakness with the Stateman.

One of the greatest weaknesses of the story from a writing point of view (for me) is the lack of violence as a viable option for conflict resolution. Being violent to some extent was allowable for Allen due to his age and circumstances, but he could easily overuse it. Albert might forgive him violence transgressions until he was sixteen, but the human government certainly would not, for serious transgressions. After sixteen, he would have both Albert and the human government against him for violence transgressions.

Writing mostly without violence as a resolution-generator was definitely a much greater challenge for me that I imagined possible.
