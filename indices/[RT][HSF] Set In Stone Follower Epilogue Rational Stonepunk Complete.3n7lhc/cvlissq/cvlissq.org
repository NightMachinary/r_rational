Well, that's a wrap on the first draft. I'll be starting to edit and prepare it for E-Book publication over the next couple weeks. I will look into selling it from other sources in addition to Amazon.

I am very keen to get your takeaways before I begin editing.

What did you like? What did you hate?

Was there anything that just drove you nuts?

Did Albert suck too much agency out of the characters, or did I balance that well, keeping him relevant but keeping the story about the characters?

Did anyone grab the idiot ball who wasn't clearly intended to do so?
