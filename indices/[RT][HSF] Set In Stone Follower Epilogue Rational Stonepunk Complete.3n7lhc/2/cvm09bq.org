Albert didn't suck any agency out that I could tell, but Taylor ate all of it - as soon as she stepped into the scene, Allen didn't get to make decisions or perform many effectual actions. He 'resolved' the central plot with his idea, but that doesn't grab you very much, especially because from /our/ perspective it's a really obvious idea.

It felt like it was developing well as a Hero story - a gifted young man tossed into a dangerous situation, and struggling upwards - and then the conflict was suddenly (and off-camera) largely resolved by a new character, and the main outcome (that we can see) from this gigantic conflict and his dangerous situation is that he /gets to go to school/. Overall, it feels at this point like I just read a backstory.
