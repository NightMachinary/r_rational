I don't mean to be overly critical - I enjoyed it, and I'd read it again (probably after I finish rereading Worm). And I don't have a way that I think it should have gone, I just know it broke a lot of narrative rules - the ending let out a bunch of built-up plot tension without making anything out of it, and it felt strange.

You certainly treated it well from a rational perspective, and you did an awesome job with building the characters and the narrative tension too. I found Allen especially to be /much/ more relatable and interesting than the characters in your other works, and I hope you can keep whatever wizardry you mixed up to make that happen. His concerns concerned me, and I was upset when he was manipulated and hurt - at a guess, it was because you managed his character flaws well, and because you had to model him more carefully.
