All I know is you're supposed to filter absolutely nothing, no matter how obviously terrible the idea is. I type out notes in a plain old text file because I have bad working memory and I don't want ideas to slip away a while I'm writing the previous idea. If you're running out of ideas, try drawing a thought web / directed graph of how your ideas relate. Go through each of your ideas and add the opposite / reverse / etc of the idea if that's meaningful, keeping in mind that statements can have multiple opposites (she gives letters to everyone, she takes letters from everyone, she doesn't give letters to everyone, she doesn't give letters to anyone, everyone but her gives letters to everyone, etc). If that's still not enough, try enumerating through each pair of ideas and try to come up with a way to combine them in an interesting way.

When possible, sleep on it and come back later. Don't bother thinking about it until the next day. Sleep does mysterious magical things for brain organization.
