If you are not physically active, you might consider exercise. Being in good physical condition can make a significant difference in your chemical balances and your emotional state. If you are in very poor condition, it may take a lot of work to get to the point where the good aspects of being physically active will be more significant than the sore muscles and tiredness.

In and of itself, exercise won't help you change your personality, but a lot of traits/behaviors that you do not like might be linked to your current chemical balances and physical condition.

If laziness or excessive procrastination is one of the traits you have, this might be a problem.
