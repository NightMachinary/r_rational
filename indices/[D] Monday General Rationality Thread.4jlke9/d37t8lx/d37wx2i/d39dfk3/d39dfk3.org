What I find particularly interesting in the communication-allowed unenforceable-agreements situation is that you could end up using some shared external factor as a randomizer, to prevent cheating. For example, we agree that I'll live if the test takes place between the new moon and the full moon, and you'll live if it's between the full moon and the new moon.

Once such an agreement exists, neither player has an incentive to violate it before the other, so it's a Nash equilibrium. And that's how you can create a situation where two perfectly rational, perfectly informed actors are making decisions based on astrology.
