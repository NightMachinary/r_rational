I've always had a nagging suspicion that for mathematical statements it is incoherent to talk about the probability of them being true, because either it is logically impossible for them to be true or it is logically impossible for them to be false. Is that related?

If the links you sent explain it all it's fine to just tell me to RTFM. I'm just asking because I'm curious.
