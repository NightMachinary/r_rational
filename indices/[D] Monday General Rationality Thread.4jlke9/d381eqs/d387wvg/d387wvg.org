  I feel I can't make an informed decision until I've read a criticism of bayesianism written by an intelligent frequentist or group of frequentists.

Why make a "decision"? Employ statistical methods as they suit you. It's all sigma-algebras underneath; Boolean propositional combinations are just a discrete special-case that don't need the sophisticated machinery of real measure theory to map its algebra elements onto the real unit interval. (I guess that's a "frequentist" philosophical opinion, even though I like "Bayesian" methods better, though on the other hand, my only actual publication uses Fisherian statistics, though on the gripping hand, the publication I'm working on as a labor of love uses Bayesian probabilistic programming.)

As it is, [[http://meaningness.com/probability-and-logic][here's a critique of Bayesian epistemology on grounds that it's not very good math.]]
