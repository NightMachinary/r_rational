I've read how bayesians describe bayesianism, I've read how bayesians describe frequentism, I've read how frequentists describe frequentism, but I've never read anything about how frequentists describe bayesianism. I feel I can't make an informed decision until I've read a criticism of bayesianism written by an intelligent frequentist or group of frequentists. Where can I find such a thing?
