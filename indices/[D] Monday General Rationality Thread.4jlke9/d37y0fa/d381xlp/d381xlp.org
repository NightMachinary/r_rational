It really depends on what you're trying to brainstorm ideas for. Your process for "new things I could invent and get a patent on" will necessarily look a whole lot different from the process for "stories to write".

Personally, I think "random" buttons are really helpful, whether that's online generators, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random][random Wikipedia articles]], or rolling some dice against a big list. You can also use that with my other favorite brainstorming technique, which is to randomly mash two things together in order to see where their interesting points of contact are.
