IME, the major thing is to focus on acquiring some positive habit or practice to override the negative "traits". You can't have a "null" personality trait.

Tips from the s.o. are to seek help from an actual behavioral therapist and/or read about those techniques, since we've heard good things about them from friends. And to start training yourself with positive reinforcement to behave & hold attitudes more similar to how you wish you were behaving/thinking - replace negative lines of thought with preferable ones, catch yourself in unwanted behaviors and re-direct to better alternatives, and reward yourself for good days and small goals achieved. :D from "coping with anxiety ALL the time"

Back on my own account now: yeah, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy really ought to be the first and default recommendation.
