[[/u/ayrvin]], I own /Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy/ and this is 100% the right answer. I don't know of any other books about CBT, and that's pretty much because I didn't feel that they were necessary after I had read this one.

From what I remember, it can get a little wordy and belabour the point. It also might have much that doesn't apply to you. However, the core technique/s were like a silver bullet for my depression. I was so relieved to find that it's also something that becomes /more/ useful the stronger you get as a rationalist, not less. As a bonus, it's also very cheap to get.

So +1 to that recommendation.
