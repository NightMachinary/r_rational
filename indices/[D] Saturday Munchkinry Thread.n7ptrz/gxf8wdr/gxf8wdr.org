You have the ability to grand someone super-empathy. By super empathy, they are able to conceptualize and process how their actions would affect the people around them, or even how their actions will affect the recipient. If you've read Ar'Kendrythist and are caught up, you know what blessing I'm talking about.

How would you use your ability to give people super empathy to do the most good on earth?
