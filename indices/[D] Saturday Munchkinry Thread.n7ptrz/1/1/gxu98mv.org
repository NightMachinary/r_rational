Look for signs of wealth.

Large land. A huge house decorated with artwork. (But not if it's too close to extreme poverty - I want someone who /won't/ starve his own son to save another coin for his overflowing vaults). Ideally, I'd want parents who are wealthy and already have exactly one healthy child; I wouldn't be the main heir, but the second-to-inherit is still a good position to be in (without attracting nearly as much hostile attention as the main heir).

Wealth is an excellent way to ensure both that my needs are met and that I'm in a good position to launch a bid for Influence once I've got a better idea of how this world works.
