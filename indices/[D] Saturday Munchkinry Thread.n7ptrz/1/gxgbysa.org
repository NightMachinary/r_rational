You are on your "+loading+ character creation screen", about to be reincarnated in a generic medieval fantasy setting (although with realistic psychology / consequences / etc).

What you see, before actually being born, looks like the satellite version of Google Earth --- except:

- it's in real time and also feeds you human hearing-range sound;
- you can zoom enough to see inside most of the buildings (some have strong enough magical protections to negate your scrying, but they are very rare);
- all speech / faces / facial expressions / texts / pictographs are incomprehensible to your mind;
- you can see highlighted outlines for all the available-for-choice "vessels" --- unborn children that haven't yet developed a "soul" of their own (which happens the moment they are born) or haven't yet been chosen as vessels by other reincarnators.

There are enough other reincarnators like you that, approximately, .01% of the vessels end up becoming hosts for reincarnators. There doesn't seem to be any time limit on how long you can drag your feet and keep staying on your character creation screen, although you haven't received any instructions or warnings either, so you can't be sure there won't be any negative consequences for waiting too long.

Your preliminary goals after incarnating will be to 1) ensure your basic needs; 2) become as influential as possible by the end of your 35th birthday.

Question: How do you go about deciding which child you want to be incarnated into?
