You have the power to apply [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism][lamarckian evolution]] to plant and animals you work with and breed. For instance, if you dye a bunch of mices fur pink, their offspring will be born with pink hair. The resulting adaption/mutation in the offspring must be vaguely biologically plausible. So any dye color will work for mice, surgical alterations will work, training them to be smarter/stronger will work, but outright cybernetic implants won't be properly inherited. You have an intuitive mental control over what lamarckian traits you want passed on.

You also have the power to crossbreed life. This power is most reliable (no miscarriages) when breeding within taxonomic Class or below separations (i.e. birds with birds, mammals with mammals, reptiles with reptiles), but with a slight rate of miscarriages it is possible to achieve across Classes (reptiles with mammals, birds with mammals, etc.). With a high rate of miscarriages and failures, you can achieve extreme cross breeds across entire phylum: fungi with animals for example. You can use this power with artificial insemination, so you don't have to figure out the logistics of cross species mating

You have intuitive mental control over what mix of traits are passed on and how they combine. So crossbreeding an eagle and a lion could give you a hairy bird, or a quadruped with feathers, or a hexapodal griffin depending on what you wanted. Size can be anywhere in the range of the two species, but they still need to be born, so to avoid fetal deaths from splitting the mother open, you need to make the mother the larger one in the case of extreme size difference. For biological features that depend on particular size scales (minimum brain sizes, square cube law, flight), you can cheat biology and physics by around a factor of around 2-8. So you could make a flying creature around two times as big as its parent bird that can still fly in spite of physics. Or a hybridize human intelligence and vocal chords onto an animal and still have human level intelligence with only 1/2, or pushing it with a few failures, 1/4 the brain size. Note I have been a bit ambiguous with size: length vs. total mass (2x length is 8x mass)... you can push the exact limits by tweaking the trait to compromise with physics a bit more: giving disproportionately large wing span to the flying creature for example.

You can draw a set of circles with symbols with symbols around them. By placing a physically immature life-form in the center circle as well as raw biomass, an electrical terminal, detailed written instructions on how you would have trained the life form as it aged, and various nutritional supplements in the outer circles, you can perform a ritual that rapidly grows, matures, and trains the life-form to adulthood drawing a huge amount of electrical power and raw material in the process. The biomass is about equivalent to how much food the lifeform would have eaten as growing and the electricity used is about how much energy its metabolism would have used growing up, so this process is very expensive even if it is time saving for long lived lifeforms. You have an intuition for how much power and raw material is required as well as how detailed the instructions have to be.

To leverage these powers, you can mentally influence (and with enough focus outright control) up to dozen lifeforms at once. You must be in line-of-sight range to establish control and can maintain control as long as you stay focused, or maintain influence with just the occasional thought. With humans and similarly intelligent life, you have issues with precise fine control and maintaining even loose influence. Influencing and controlling lifeforms you have created is easier than natural lifeforms.

Traits you have bred through lamarckian evolution or hybridization breed true without your continued influence after just one generation, even if they have to cheat physics to work.

So what ultimate life form will you create? What utility lifeforms might you make? How might you accumulate resources in the early stages of bootstrapping this power?
