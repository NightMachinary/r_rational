Mundane: Become a gynecologist with a reputation of never having any patient suffer miscarriages.

Mild: Make super crops that grow quickly and are resistant to everything you can think of. Maybe farm for a few months for starting capital, then sell seeds for more money. Solve world hunger in the process.

Medium: Breed immortal jellyfish with humans, transferring their immortality trait onto humanity.

Megalomaniacal: Break physics and biology by letting your crossbreed plants produce biomass ex nihilo. Pretty sure this is possible under the given rules. This is incredibly awesome for turning humanity into an intergalactic civilization, because you are no longer bound by planets. You can just keep growing more and more plant biomass in space, practically Von Neumann style. Then you can eat/drink them for nutrition, burn them for energy, crossbreed them with animal blood cells to get iron production for building more spacecraft, etc.

On the other hand, if you ever lose containment, things will go REALLY BAD. If those plants spread all over the earth, producing mass ex nihilo, that means the Earth's mass keeps increasing, gravity keeps increasing, and soon it will be uninhabitable.
