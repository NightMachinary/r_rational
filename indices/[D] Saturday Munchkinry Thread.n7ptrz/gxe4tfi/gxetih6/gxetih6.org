Human with star-nosed mole, breeding for alacrity of thought and intelligence. Cross Ophiocordyceps unilateralis (ant controlling fungus) with something like an ant or honey bee (for communication at distance). Breed those two bad boys together (we only need one). Then, ideally, you have a khepri style being, capable of taking over and controlling any number of animals or people. Theoretically.
