First I would get a pet axolotl and cut it and dismember it repeatedly to improve it's regeneration abilities and pull it and stretch it as well as cutting it open and pulling and stretching it's reproductive organs specifically to enlarge them faster until it is large enough to survive birthing a human child. I would then breed it with immortal jellyfish and then breed tardigrades and mentally control them to make them stretch themselves and each other until I have ones big enough to breed with the giant axolotl jellyfish.

I would then breed sugarcane (for its capability to convert an extremely large amount of sunlight into chemical energy) with psychedelic mushrooms and aphrodisiac herbs. I would then selectively breed these plant/fungi to make them spew spores as far as possible so that once they're inhaled the victim will see the producers of those spores as extremely sexually attractive and have their vision of their appearance distorted by psychedelics. (Ideally I would want the effect to be that the victim sees the producer as the person that they love but I don't know how I'd do that. Let me know if you know)

Now that the sugarcane mushroom hybrid is a fungi rather than a plant it is less likely to fail when I breed it with my giant axolotl (assuming fungi is considered closer to animal than plant is but even if it isn't I can afford to fail as much as necessary).

I would then lure 12 men from all over the world to my home by pretending to be in love with them, when they enter and see my giant axolotl I'll put on a gas mask and let it blast the unsuspecting victim with the spores and reproduce with them until they succeed in having offspring, I would also transfer the aphrodisiac hallucination effect to their sweat as opposed to spore production.

I would then have them work cash paid jobs that don't require an ID to earn some money for a couple of months and use that money to buy armour and weapons and other historical weapons as well as training in using these armaments (using the circles and biomaterial and electricity to speed up their development) I'd even get a small Viking canoe. Then, I'd suit up my regenerating, photosynthesising, immortal, extremophile warriors and send them to the country they originated from e.g. my immortal samurai would go to Japan, my immortal Viking would go to Scandinavia, etc. They don't have IDs so I'd use traditional transportation such as the Viking boat-style canoe for the Viking. (These are the only real major expenses so far so it's the only time I'd have to gather up money)

Now that my 12 immortal warriors have landed I'd have them fight against the modern people of their nation to see whether the medieval warriors would slaughter them or if the citizens would suppress them. (The purpose of the aphrodisiac hallucinogenic is to prevent easy imprisonment and it's unlikely an in humane special isolated prison would be received well considering how human they look).

Since it's been a while since I've done a munchkin I figured I'd go for totally evil, amusement driven, fujoshi chaos!
