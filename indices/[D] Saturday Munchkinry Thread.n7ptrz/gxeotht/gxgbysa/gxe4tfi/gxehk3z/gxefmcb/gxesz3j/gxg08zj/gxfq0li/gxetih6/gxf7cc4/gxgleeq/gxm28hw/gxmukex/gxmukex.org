In the early stages to get this power started I would breed plants together to make valuable yield crops grow very quickly and/or much larger than usual and get money from winning agricultural competitions and selling high value crops. Might also make it so that crops such as desert melons can survive in regular conditions so I can be the first person to grow domestic dessert melons and make a ton of money which I would use for the scientific equipment I would need to monitor and cultivate certain life forms I want to use. I might also breed extremely proficient decomposers to mass produce oil or program micro-organisms using a virus to get them to move gold particulates into a particular area so I can concentrate gold in lakes or other valuable minerals. I could also make microorganisms which are bioluminescent that bind to particular ores, gems, minerals, etc. And release them into the environment and then at night go and collect them and the valuables they highlight.
