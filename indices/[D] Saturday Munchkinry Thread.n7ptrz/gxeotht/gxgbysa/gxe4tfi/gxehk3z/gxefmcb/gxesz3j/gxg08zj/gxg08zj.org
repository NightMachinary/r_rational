Creating /a/ singularity with this is trivial. Making it /aligned/ and corrigible is even harder than for an AI. What you really want to to is enhance your own personal intelligence, but none of the examples like toxoplasma or cordyceps actually work in a way that lets you add computational power.

Horrifically, I think what you'd need to use is the way transmissible cancers become distinct organism lineages, breed that with neural stem cells you fiddle around with lamarkialy in vitro until they become sufficiently organism-like, breed that with toxoplasma... and then you're finally getting somewhere, and can start injecting it in the brains of mice and experiment around to find something that will grow and enhance their intelligence, but not kill them or cause to much insanity. Traits from lichen, male anglerfish, Sacculina parasites (experts in having a large amount of tissue in the host for a long time without killing it), etc. might be useful.

Then you do another round to increase potency; human traits for brain architecture, corvid to modify that for more efficiency, bee for neuron size to fit more in etc. Also, labrador retriever for personality, ants for coordination ability and altruism, and whale for whatever traits are needed to scale and supply a brain to much larger than human. Then it's time to inject yourself.

Then you work on the alignment problem in a way that can't really take advantage of the powers directly.

One thing you'd probably do once you're sufficiently confident they wont be able to "catch up" intelligence-wise is combine ants, ducks, and dogs to make an animal that will imprint on your scent and act in an eusocial submissive role, fix the loyalty in on being always you by taking it as a lamarckian trait, and then reinforce that for a few generations until you can add it to humans to make scientists immutably and perfectly loyal to you, and with the coordination abilities and mutual altruism and loyalty of social insects. Then add the size (mainly brain volume) of whale/elephant, and neuron size of bees, and a lamarckian-transferred copy of these biology powers since those are an acquired trait. And again, whatever you can in terms of personality to make them extremely altruistic, friendly, and submissive.
