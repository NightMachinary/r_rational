Some sort of microorganism that eats atmospheric CO2 and poops carbon nanotubes in architecturally-useful form would be interesting. Or likewise but it poops ions (run air through the algae tank full of this organism, get more electricity out than it cost you to run, plus cleaner / decarbonized air). Upgrade it to eat plastics, heavy metals, whatever.
