This will take a generation to be stable (which you can cheat with enough electricity and biomass), and it will be making new people, not transferring it to existing people, but yeah that works. Actually... you could cheat a bit, make and rapidly grow non-sentient males with all the other human traits right, then sell their sperm to women that want immortal super-babies.

  Megalomaniacal Pretty sure this is possible under the given rules.

How... ahh the 2x to 8x cheat. Breed plants that store large amount of water with plants that are super efficient on water needs and you can get 2 to 8 times as much water out as you put in. Do the same for plants efficient on micronutrient needs and plants that need lots of exotic nutrients for trace elements.

  iron production for building more spacecraft

You don't even need iron for spacecraft if you get really ambitious with your Von Neumann plants. The plants initial structure and body are derived from really ambitious crossbreeding of fast growing plants and vacuum resistant organisms and durable organisms/plants. With a bit of lamarckian direction of growth you could get an O'Neil cylinder type of design with internal perpetual energy from bio-luminescence. Its thrust could come from out-gassing ex-nihlio created gasses. Lamarck a generation of humans to be adapted to living under spin-g and bioluminescence and to be good at orbital calculations and station maintenance. Actually, your post-humans could be adapted for zero-g.

To avoid green-goo scenarios, game what counts as one organism. The primary mass-energy conservation breaker should be one big super organisms that needs human (or post-human) guidance to bud, and the various supporting symbiotic organisms should be bred to need a light touch of human maintenance and not to break mass-energy conservation too hard themselves. The entire primary von-neuman super organism should be lamarcked to have a central control unit that humans can use to influence long-term flight direction by controlling the out-gassing and such.

I had intended for this power to be an Impossible Creatures minion creator and a Panacea-lit biomanipulator with enough creativity and time, but instead it can scale all the way up to create immortal biospace ships
