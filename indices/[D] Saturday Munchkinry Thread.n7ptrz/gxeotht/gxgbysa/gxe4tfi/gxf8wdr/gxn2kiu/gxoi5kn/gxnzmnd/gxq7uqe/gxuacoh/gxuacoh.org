Some options:

- The weapon is a deadly poison. The 'vampire' can't taste it without risk.
- The weapon is a bullet made of ice; the death happens late at night. By the time the body is found, the weapon has evaporated; nothing to taste.
- The victim is encased in concrete and dumped into the Pacific ocean, far from shore. There's no sign of the body, and nothing to taste.

In the second case:

- Frame someone that the Detective absolutely hates. Make it look like he tried to clumsily hide the evidence and failed. Since the detective hates him, the Detective will find it easy to believe he did it, and will therefore easily convince everyone else
