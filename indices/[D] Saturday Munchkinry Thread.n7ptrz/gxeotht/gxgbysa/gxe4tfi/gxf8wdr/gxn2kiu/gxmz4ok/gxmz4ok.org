You possess the ability to amalgamate (like mercury) materials. Your body is used as if it were mercury in this reaction so if you try to amalgamate too much you will destroy yourself or damage yourself beyond what natural healing can repair.

You can control the speed of the reaction and you can use parts of your body that are no longer attached to you in the reaction e.g. blood, urine, sweat, etc. Can be collected and used.

The scenarios I'd like you to munchkin are;

- how would you use this ability? In a modern day setting as well as any other setting including a fictitious one where you believe it would be of immense value/use to whatever goal you desire to achieve with it.

- how would you use this to rule the world/country in medieval times (you can choose whichever country/area you wish to conquer, especially if your country is too easy/hard to conquer).

- how would you become the worlds richest person using this ability.

- how would you survive a battle royal scenario with 99 other participants (one scenario where only you have the power, some of your opponents have the power and all of your opponents have the power. You could also reverse munchkin here to see how you'd survive as one of the normal people or the only normal person)

- how would you colonise another planet using this ability.

- How would you destroy the earth. How would you destroy the universe.
