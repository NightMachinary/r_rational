Bird brains are more efficient at thinking than most mammalian brains, so Crossbreed a crow and a human to make a superintelligence. Maybe for the second generation crossbreed the result with a dolphin/octopus hybrid that also emphasizes intelligence, just to see what's up. Of these, I would be most worried about the octopus brain, because all the other animals are pack animals, while octopoid are solitary predators. If there's any hints of problems in the youngest stages of life with cooperative advancement, then probably terminate the experiment before it gets smart enough to manipulate me or engineer my death. I dunno, I guess with the other portion of the power you could just "slowly" encourage intelligence in humans and discourage more destructive behaviors without the threats of alien intelligences having different objectives or morality.
