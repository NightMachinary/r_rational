The Mimic Octopus. It can change appearance enough to look very much like any of almost a dozen other sea creatures; through a mix of rearranging its tentacles and changing colour.

It is, in other words, pretty close to a shape shifter. The closest we've been able to find, anyhow. And, being an octopus, it has an octopus brain...

Mix it with the immortal jellyfish to get an immortal shapeshifter of reasonable intelligence. Mix with a human to improve and refine the intelligence and get an immortal, shape-changing, colour-changing human.

...I wonder how long it will take for those traits to spread throughout the whole human race...?
