Step 1: Overcoming weaknesses. First weakness: reliability and genetic distance. The failure rate of a given lifeform is proportional to the 'distance' the two parents have from each other and the 'intensity' of the change. Thus, if you're guaranteed at least SOME success at a high risk of failure, you minimize the cost of failure.

My first goal is some sort of axolotl chamber. (see Herbert's Dune, although I wouldn't use human women). A lifeform grown specifically to grow other life forms. As this is the basis of the next stages, we can afford some early testing failures.

I feel like there are a couple of directions you can go depending on which branch of the tree of life you pick, and what your specific goal is for the life forms in question. You'd probably want a few different options to keep your path broad.

So you could have a sort of large placental creature that is basically just a giant uterus. Over a couple of generations you refine some mammalian source such that the brain and nervous system atrophy, and only those nerves required for gestation and the associated digestive and metabolic systems remain.

No organism exists in a vacuum. (Metaphorically. By the time we're done they'll be able to do so literally.) We are all products of our environments, and our environments are products of us.

So we need an artificial ecosystem. But as we're cronenbergian horror villains, we're going to grow our own in a creepy wet basement or sewer somewhere.

So, we start at the bottom of the ecosystem. By tapping into the city's sewer line, we have basically an uninterrupted and untraceable source of biomass and other chemicals. We can even do good deeds by purifying the water out of the waste if we want.

So we build a filter feeding system. Bacterial mats with enhanced metabolic rates help us break down the waste into component parts, and they are held by long strands of algal netting to become a sort of living biofilter. Like a giant aquarium. But that's just the bottom of the pyramid. Purpose made harvesters will gather the bacterial mats and feed them into the digesters, where they will be broken down into basic nutritional components.

The digesters, of course, being purpose bred 'stomachs' sourced from bacteriophagic sea creatures that over the course of a few generations have similar neural atrophy etc.

The basic gist is that we can turn flora and fauna into plumbing. Need pipes? Grow some lampreys until they're six inches around and fifty feet long. They bite onto the side of a digester and begin 'pumping' the slurry out and to the other end, where it an be deposited where it needs to go.

In similar fashion, we can basically create unlimited source materials to feed into our axolotl tanks.

A hive structure such as those built by hymenoptera is another option. Bees grow in larval chambers in the comb. Starting with bees is a path you can use for invertebrate minions, which will save on failure rates. The placental axolotl tanks are for mamalian/reptilian types.

So we've now got a steady base of operations and a way to generate minions with more reliability. I'm going to assume this can be integrated with the rituals described. The 'immature' lifeform is in its axolotl tank in the center of the circle, connected to the artificial ecosystem network. The training instructions are fed in digitally, in the form of AI trained by adversarial networks and genetic algorithms.

So what's next? I suppose power, if actual electric power is required. Biological processing is hyper-efficient compared to anything people can build, but we'll still need quite a lot of energy if we're going to force-grow minions.

Electric eels can generate ~500w for a very short time, but we're going big here. We can stack up and super-charge a biological power-wall. A living battery pack that converts metabolism into electricity. Plug it into the artificial bio network. Now we've got the lights on!

OK, so at this point we're basically living 'inside' a composite living organism the size of a building.

We can integrate all kinds of biology, using biomimicry, genetic editing, and of course good old surgery to put whatever traits we want in.

One idea I had is an ant-queen trained to control her swarm based on mental commands. The swarm of ants aren't normal ants though.

They are architect ants. Ants the size of cinderblocks with heavy armor plating. The ants can link their armor together, and will feed each other by trophallaxis indefinitely. So with a thought, your building's internal structure itself can move and change, because it too is alive. The ants provide the walls and floors and scaffolding, and hold the infrastructure of the base together safely. And in an instant they can be cinder-block sized heavily armored ants that respond to your mental commands.

The vibe is basically 'everything is alive'. The car is alive. It looks like a sports car but the hood is a beetle elytra and it's organs underneath. The house is alive. The doors are made of chitin and wood and the hinges are knuckles.

But it all looks like ordinary stuff. It's hidden in plain view. Overnight there's a new warehouse in the old industrial district and nobody notices. the Sewage treatment plant reports increases in water quality.

Now we're established and we can do whatever we want. I like the idea of protecting the city by growing it bit-by bit to be alive. Replace things a bit at a time with organic replicas wherever possible. Street lights made of coral with bio luminescent glands. Jersey barriers that brace for impact and catch cars softly.

The city is alive, and the people are its cells and I am its mind and we will defend ourselves if we have to.
