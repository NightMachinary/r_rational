I'm no expert in committing crimes, but the first thing that comes to mind is to do the deed using some weapon that is somewhat difficult to taste safely, and clean up in a similar way. Of course, that still requires the ability to commit any crime at all. But presuming you can do that semi-reliably, poisons to kill and acid to clean seems like a safeish bet. That all depends on what tasting the history of something actually means, and the particular circumstances of the whole thing, of course.
