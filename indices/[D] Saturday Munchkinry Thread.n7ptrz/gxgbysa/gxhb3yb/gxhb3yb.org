Optimal choice is to be the only child of the most powerful country's king and queen.

But now we have a problem: with so many other reincarnators, there will be uplifts happening everywhere. People spreading the recipes for gunpowder, cement, hot air balloons, etc. Spreading scientific knowledge all over. There will be chaos and an arms race.

The natives are going to realize there are reincarnators in their midst, especially since some reincarnators will see no problem with blabbing about their origins. There will be hatred and discrimination. Reincarnators will be kidnapped and interrogated for knowledge, or burned at stake for being demons.

This makes (2) pretty annoying to achieve, because becoming greatly influential greatly increases the probability of becoming suspected of being a reincarnator.

If you manage to incredibly luckily find very loving and and open-minded and powerful royal parents, the good path is to set up a safe fortress for reincarnators to live in... but they won't accept you as leader because democracy.

The evil path is to kidnap and interrogate other reincarnators, and pass off any reincarnator knowledge you have as knowledge extracted from your captives... but this will make other reincarnators hate your guts and want to kill you.

Either way, trying to achieve (2) will be a extremely bloody and messy path.

And this is assuming there is no way to combine modern scientific knowledge with magic to achieve utterly game breaking powers. Like von Neumann self replicators. Or time travel.
