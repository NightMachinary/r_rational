Super-empathize all world leaders. I'm assuming there's some compulsion to avoid hurting others, otherwise some of these super-empaths would make optimal choices for the benefit of their countries/their parties/themselves at the expense of other people.

In fact, if there's no limit to how many people I can super-empathize, I don't see any reason I shouldn't make as many people super-empaths as possible. Again, assuming no evil super-empaths.
