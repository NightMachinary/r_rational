I'm co-writing this quest whith dwood .

Years ago, you worked for Rocket Laboratories, on a team responsible for the cloning efforts to recreate the thought-to-be-extinct Mew. While on those teams your daughter became terminally ill. In your desperation, you were allowed to use the most advanced medical imaging technology of the time to create a full scan of her. Using her DNA, you had hoped to clone her body and bring her back to the land of the living.

Unfortunately, Mewtwo destroyed the whole lab, and set yourself and all of humanity back a full decade. Branded, and associated with morally gray research, no university or research lab in Kanto would accept your work, so you turned elsewhere, places where your name was less known. Application after application for new research position denied, you had nearly given up, when a letter arrived in the mail.
