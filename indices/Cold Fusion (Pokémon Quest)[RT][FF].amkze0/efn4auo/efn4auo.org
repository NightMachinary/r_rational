Second vote: Help Matthew run as much additional analysis on the human profiles as there is time for. A half hour before lunch interact with the Pokemon with Ashley and get them into a compliant state of mind

Third vote: Jez and Ryan run the expansion. Matt and I continue on the human profiles. Adjust the process on each Pokemon based on the new information from Jez and Ryan's experience, and from Matt's and my new insights. Enlist help from the IT guy and Skylar for the longer processes. Ryan and Jez work split shifts those days to ensure they are available for the start and end of the process.

Fourth vote: The numbers don't add up. 2 assistants can get paid but I have 3. 6 Pokemon chosen for expansion but I have 7. Rotom knows 5 moves instead of 4. What gives?
