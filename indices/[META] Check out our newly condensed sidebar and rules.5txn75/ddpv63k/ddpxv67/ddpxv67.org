Reading the discussion (and checking a few submission histories in more detail), the rule is either too loose or too strict depending on interpretation. Given that pre-publication announcement posts would be disallowed by another rule, I've changed the rule to read

#+begin_quote
  Post your own work at most weekly.
#+end_quote

to match the most common regular schedules. If you're publishing chapters more frequently (and occasionally if not), let your loyal readers post some of them to [[/r/rational]]!
