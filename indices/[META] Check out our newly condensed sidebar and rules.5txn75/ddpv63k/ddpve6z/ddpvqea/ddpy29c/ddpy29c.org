For what it's worth, when something happens we usually just explain what we think should be done differently.

eg. I haven't removed a good-faith comment or post on [[/r/rational]] for ages (ie I think two or three last year) and only perma-banned one human troll (and many shitty bots). A human with poor sidebar comprehension got a temp-ban once. That's it - over the years I've spent more time debugging automatic threads than enforcing rules!
