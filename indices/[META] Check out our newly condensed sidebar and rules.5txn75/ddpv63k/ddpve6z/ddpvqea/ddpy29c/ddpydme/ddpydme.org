  I haven't removed a good-faith comment or post on [[/r/rational]] for ages

That seems like a good way to do things. Until I started getting serious about my own fic, I would occasionally briefly glance at this subreddit after checking the [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]] sub; I had assumed that people would post "rational" fics there, and that discussions about "rationality" would be posted here, and I didn't notice for an embarrassingly long period of time that this sub never had posts about "rationality" and that it was almost exclusively fic recommendations and updates.

It would appear that the vast majority of activity on this sub comes from people sharing fics and announcing updates, and curtailing either of those activities seems like an easy way to turn this into a dead/inactive subreddit.
