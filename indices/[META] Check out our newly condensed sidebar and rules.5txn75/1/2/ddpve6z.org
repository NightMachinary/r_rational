I strongly doubt posting a link to a chapter qualifies as self-promotion. Self-promotion would be something like posting more than once to the same book/chapter when there is no new material to read.

The boundaries can be a little fuzzy between promotion and update posts, but generally posting chapters don't qualify as self-promotion.
