Well it's sort of a roundup chapter isn't it? It's entirely necessary and it needs to be there to bridge the gap to whatever they plan to do next and beef up the characterisation a bit. Hell knows if you skip chapters like this bad things happen but that doesn't make them the most interesting. I did still enjoy it.

It's like a structural supports in a building: necessary to keep the thing from falling over but people spend more time admiring the fa√ßade.

I wouldn't worry about it much.
