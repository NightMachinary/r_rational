On a related note if you want feedback and discussion FF.net isn't the best place. I've had better results from spacebattles where people can have a decent argument about the points involved, and recently people made some fascinating points on the similarities between konoha and the cold way in terms of national assets as well as chakra and computer programming as a thing a person can do that makes them more awesome but few people do.

Reddit's pretty good for it as well. I like using all of them at once personally.
