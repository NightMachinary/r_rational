I read quite a bit of translated work, and I think translation can be really tricky thing. A bad translation can destroy tone and beauty of the language, as well as stripping out a lot of the idioms, puns, etc. Douglas Hofstadter (of /GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach/ fame) writes about this a lot in /Le Ton beau de Marot/, which I recommend.
