You are sooooo not getting the mortifying stuff out of me.

Non-rationalist pleasures:

- I enjoy basically everything listed on [[/r/trigger]]. None of it makes any goddamn sense, but it's all /completely fucking awesome/.

- Actually, since when has anime in general made any goddamn sense?

- One of my pleasures is not remotely guilty, but /very/ embarrassing for someone who's normally as much of a blustering, blunt, loud, not-even-that-wannabe-anymore shounen hero-type as me ^{pinkie} ^{is} ^{best} ^{pony} . But seriously, that show has terrible wallbanger-quality writing sometimes but I still quite like it.

- I'm subscribed to David Brin on Facebook and find it kinda cute the way he gets so /outraged/ at the mess of American politics and the ultra-right, since the rest of us who don't feel any need to pretend to conservatism have been pointing out the same damn issues for /years/.

- Actually, David Brin and other ignorantly conventional futurists are a fine guilty pleasure. And [[/r/Futurology]]. Seriously: have you /seen/ those guys? And they call /us/ ridiculous.
