I've been reading a few of the Star Wars expanded universe books. Star Wars just makes /no/ sense whatsoever. Forget for a moment the whole concept of the Force and the Light Side and Dark Side or whatever. The technological stagnation that lasts for thousands of years is /so dumb/. They have a demonstrated capability of making intelligent droids, and it's just routine practice around the entire galaxy to wipe their memories.

I can maybe handle a world where some technologies just never come to fruition because of the economic considerations, or due to some rules in place within the fictional world, but there are so many "missing" technologies that are implied by what's in the books and movies that I want to start banging my head against the wall if I think about it for too long. Reading is just a matter of suppressing that part of my brain that hates the conceits of space opera.
