The manga Peach Girl. It's my dreadful secret. It's high school drama with misunderstandings and lies and gossip and main characters pining away over the perfect boy and crying because he kissed another girl first etc etc etc. Because half the problems stem from people not understanding themselves and the rest from not understanding each other... It's not very rationalist.
