My big guilty pleasure is in superhero stories. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless][Reed Richards Is Useless]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod][Status Quo is God]], but dammit do I like seeing people fly through the air and punch each other to death. I've been rereading Invincible lately, and there's something that's just so satisfying about superpowers.

But yes, from a rationalist standpoint I do wonder why the world hasn't been revolutionized a dozen times over with all the super geniuses running around that have demonstrably solved a wide variety of problems. Some of my favorite stories are the alternate universe ones, where the writers are free to say "fuck continuity" and actually change the world as it should be changed. (And of course I've read Worm, but Worm - which tries to justify a lot of the tropes - isn't as wholly successful as I might have hoped.)
