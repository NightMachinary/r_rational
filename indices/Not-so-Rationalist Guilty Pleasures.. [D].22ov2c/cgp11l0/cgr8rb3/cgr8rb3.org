Personally, I really like how Worm handled RRIU.

Firstly, powers awaken in times of great stress, and are tangentially related to the cause of the event. Trigger events are traumatic, and while they might "solve" the problem, they often do so in a violent way. As such, a majority of capes are villains.

Secondly, the "tinkers" of the world, who have the power to create supertech, don't actually /know/ how their technology works. Any tech they can make is several technological steps ahead of the curve. Reverse engineering is essentially impossible, a tinker can't teach another how their tech works, and anything a tinker makes needs regular maintenance by the maker to continue working. No mass production.

Then there's the Endbringers, a trio of nigh-invincible kaiju who regularly attack the highest value targets of the world. The worst of which is the most powerful precognitive, and has set up conceptual rube golberg paths which cause people who actually have a chance of defying RRIU to die, or worse become villains.
