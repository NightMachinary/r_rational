Not necessarily true. There are two other options:

A: Get people to do what you want despite not believing the treatment actually works, for example with my make-anyone-do-anything exploit.

B: Just make the chemical(s) and put heaps of them in the right places at the right times. If you told them it was a cure (for whatever), they wouldn't believe you. But if they just stumble upon a chemical, happen to decide to check its structure, and eventually test it and get it approved? It might take a few tries to get someone to get that far, but it's possible, if you're really committed to "no mind control whatsoever".
