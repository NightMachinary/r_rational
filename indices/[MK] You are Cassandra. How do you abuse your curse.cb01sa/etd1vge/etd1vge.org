I would argue that it is not exploitable. Generally speaking, Greek prophecies tend to not be things that you can control; you can't choose to have a prophecy about a given event or situation so there would be no way to game the system that way by choosing what to prophecy about. Secondly, said prophecies are in stable time loops; there is no action that you can take to cause them to happen or not to happen. In fact, in many Greek stories an attempt to avert a prophecy directly causes it to come to pass. The curse of the prophecy is that nobody will believe you when you prophecy; it doesn't mean that they are immediately going to do the opposite of whatever you tell them. It just means that they're going to look at you like a homeless guy on the street muttering about the alien voices in his head.

Finally, even if you managed to find some way to exploit it, Cassandra's curse was given by (and monitored by) a literal God who would be able to quickly patch out any exploits. It is a punishment for not fulfilling a commitment to sex with Apollo, not a way to munchkin into ultimate power.
