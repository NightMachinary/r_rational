Man, I like this idea, but I can't figure out a way to make it work:

Cassandra: I predict that you wont believe any of my predictions!

Victim: No, I'll believe you! Really!

Cassandra: The king will die tomorrow

Victim: Nope, don't believe you

Cassandra: So my first prediction was right!

Victim: Nope, I'm still gonna believe your other predictions

Cassandra: But you don't believe me now

Victim: Nope.

Cassandra: Okay, the queen will die the day after the king.

Victim: Yeah, I don't believe that either!

Cassandra: See! My first prediction was right!

Victim: Nah, I still haven't heard all of your predictions yet. I'm sure I'll believe the rest of them!

Repeat to infinity :(

It seems to me as long as the belief is forced, then acceptance of the belief must also be forced. If the belief conflicts, you just shrug it off because your acceptance of the belief is forced too.
