Easy as pie, surely.

- To get some initial capital, be boring and play the stock market with your future prediction powers. Short stocks that will fall, buy stocks that will raise, make cash, keep quiet about your powers.

- After you have some arbitrary amount of initial money, start up a consulting firm with a fancy name (this will be relevant later). All it absolutely needs to have is a fancy-looking website where you can publicise predictions and be a legal explanation for what you do so people don't look too closely at you. Everything else is optional. Consulting firm making accurate predictions makes sense, some random nobody is a bit more suspicious.

- Hire a small bunch of actual normal economists and what have you to work in your firm - better front & backup income flow if your powers cut out suddenly. Pro tip: hire the guy writing this post and tell them about your powers.

- Publicize a couple predictions about e.g. future worldwide elections, economic events, football game wins etc, then spread them online with a combination of moderate clickbait writing (buy out a yellow pages magazine to write clickbait articles for you if you don't want clickbait on your fancy conservative-looking consulting website) and old - fashioned marketing.

- After you get some name recognition, you can make even MORE money on the stock market by publicising your predictions. E.g. say you predict company's stock will raise. Then you publicise that prediciton and short the stock as soon as investors start to sell it (after all, anyone that read your article assigns probability 0 to it raising), making a butload of cash. Then, once the price hits the lowest point, you buy up all that stock and wait until it goes back up, somehow, even though 100% of the investors sold out(after all, your predictions always come to pass). When it does, you sell the stock again, and get a second butload of money. Rinse & repeat.

After a while, people will see that:

- Your firm has a 100% track record of predicting future events. (If you are trying to avoid suspicion, sprinkle in some posts where you predict the future with good old-fashioned guessing, without using magic, to bring the accuracy percentage down a bit. Alternatively, just use your normal non-supernatural analysts to do their job and that'd also bring the accuracy down)

- Some events you have tried to predict were seen as very unlikely by the worldwide community at the time (everyone that looked up your blog before the event happened will assign the probability 0, right, so the more clicks you generate the lower the belief of the worldwide community will be in that prediction, and you can generate A LOT of clicks with all that stock money)

- On the most ridiculous predictions with the least amount of public information, you have the highest accuracy of anyone on the planet.

Now, this is the best part. Obviously noone will think you have the curse. They'd just see you being somehow ridiculously accurate. If you try to make a new supernatural prediction they will (naturally, since the curse) think it is all nonsense, but you don't have to do that. Whatever you say is now going to be paid a whole lot of attention to, even if you are completely making it up - after all, everyone sees that you are (somehow) very accurate, and noone can guess how you do it (Not even IRS! Prophecies do not count as insider knowledge, and all your business is legal). Basically, you don't actually need to use your power to affect people.

At this point you can do a lot of things. Hire yourself out as election consultant, perhaps, and shape their policy decisions by blatantly relying on your magically-earned reputation. Keep using your power on other things, though, to keep up your prediction accuracy.
