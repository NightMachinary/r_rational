You don't write the articles to the clickbait; your yellow journalist friends write the headlines and the articles. They headline would be something like "Ten Things You Wouldn't Believe that Experts Think Will Happen in the Next Year!", and because you didn't write the title they're just as likely to click on it as they would anything else.

Then when people read it, they'lll be like "Yup, I wouldn't believe that."
