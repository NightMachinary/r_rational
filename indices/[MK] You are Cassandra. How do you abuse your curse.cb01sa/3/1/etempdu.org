Thanks for posting this, I was picturing the prophecies themselves "appearing" rather than you being able to concentrate on what you want to see, so it was really disappointing to see everyone saying "predict whether your friend is in pain" / "constantly predict the stockmarket"! Ditto with people saying they should just give fake predictions and then people will believe the opposite: you're not blessed with people never believing you, you're cursed with people not believing your /real prophecies/.
