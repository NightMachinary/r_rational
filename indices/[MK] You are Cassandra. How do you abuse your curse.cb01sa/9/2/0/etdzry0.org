  It only works if it's a prophesy.

Which it is.

Through mere analysis, one can assign a ridiculously high probability to an event. But analyses can always be wrong. (Heck, people didn't even understand the laws of gravity back in the days of Cassandra.)

It is only through prophesy can you actually assign a probability of 1 to an event because you have seen it happen. So if Cassandra prophesies almost any event happening tomorrow, that actually updates her probability assignment about the existence of the world tomorrow from 99.999 (add a ton more 9s)% to 100%.

If the magical curse triggers the disbelieving effect when the probability changes from 50% to 100%, why wouldn't it also trigger for when it changes from 99.999 (add a ton more 9s)% to 100%? Both cases rely on magical knowledge of the future attainable only through prophesy.
