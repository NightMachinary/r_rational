  Any action taken to reveal these prophecies to others will result in them assigning a probability of 0 to that which the prophecy describes (yes, I do mean a probability of 0! Axiomic certainty) until the events transpire.

Err, what happens if you prophesy something obvious and tell someone? For example, you could prophesy a sunset, and then tell someone "the sun will set in the west tomorrow". Will that actually make them assign a probability of 0 to the sun setting in the west tomorrow, even though it is obviously true?

For that matter, if you prophesy just about anything, that proves that the world still exists in the future. So if you tell someone that the world still exists in the future, do they now believe the world is going to end?

Because holy hell that makes you a psychological weapon of mass destruction. Prophesy anything, then go on television and tell the public that the world still exists in the future. They now assign a probability of 0 to that, so everyone starts acting like the world is ending and entire societies will fall into total anarchy.
