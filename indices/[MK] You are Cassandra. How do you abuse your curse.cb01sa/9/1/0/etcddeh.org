  Wouldn't work, unless you're prophesying that the world will still exist in the future /specifically/

Okay, so can you tell people that the world will still exist on the date of your prophetic vision, and that will make them think the world will end on or before that date? That still lets you be a psychological weapon of mass destruction then, you just need to only go on television when there's only a short time left before one of your prophesied events.
