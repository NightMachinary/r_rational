Technically, you can't know that the world will still exist tomorrow in any way other than living until tomorrow.

After all, you can't know whether a true vacuum has formed somewhere in space, and is now destroying the world in all directions at the speed of light.

So if anything, it's actually infinitely easier for you to obtain information about a volcano erupting tomorrow (under the assumption that the world still exists) than for you to obtain information about the continued existence of world. (Substitute "Earth" for "world" if "world" isn't well-defined.)
