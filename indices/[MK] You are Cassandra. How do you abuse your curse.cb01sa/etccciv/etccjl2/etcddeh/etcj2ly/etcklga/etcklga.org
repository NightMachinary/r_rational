Hmm... can you chain prophecies? Say for example, you prophesy that something happens tomorrow. Then prophesy that something happens the day after tomorrow. Then the day after that. Basically have a prophecy for every day.

Then now go on television and say "The world still exists tomorrow and every day after".

Would people then keep constantly believing that the world will end tomorrow, because each day that passes only invalidates one prophecy?
