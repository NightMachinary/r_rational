Still, that means you can make the hysteria last for an almost arbitrarily long time, so long as you have the time to make more prophecies. It doesn't need to last that long anyway: a month of everyone living like the world is ending tomorrow is almost certainly enough to utterly wreck everything.

Most people won't be going to work since they rather spend their last day with their family or enjoying themselves. That means most of the farmers, transporters, etc. won't be doing their jobs. The food supplies will run out quickly and a large fraction of the population will starve to death in whatever area you target with your television broadcast.
