  once the event has occurred everybody will go back to normal.

Actually, that is an interesting problem with this version of Cassandras curse.

If they literally assigned probability 0 to the event having occurred they would not go back to normal, because you can never update away from having assigned a probability of 0.

(Any evidence you would receive that something with probability 0 happened has a non-zero chance that you are misinterpreting or imagining it, so you would update in the direction of disbelieving the evidence rather than believing the prophecy)
