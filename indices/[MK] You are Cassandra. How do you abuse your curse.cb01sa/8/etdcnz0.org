Predict whether or not it is true that for literally everyone in every situation, doing whatever you say is the best possible decision. When this predictably returns false, you can use this to make anyone do whatever you want. This also allows you to get around the limitations of your power, since even if people won't believe you you can order them to act AS IF they believe you.
