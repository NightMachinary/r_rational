The actual way Cassandra's curse works, is that she can foretell the future accurately, but it cannot benefit anyone else because no one believes a word about her prophecies. Lying about her prophecies falls outside of the scope of the curse and cannot be exploited. Inventing fake prophecies also is out. Also, in most versions she does not control what she sees, nor when she utters her prophecies, so timing cannot be exploited either and there is no way to "aim" for the purpose of predicting specific events' outcome.

So, yeah, it is only useful for benefitting herself, only when there's an opportunity to do so presenting itself out of blind luck. But you can trust Apollo won't let her, and might actively undermine any efforts of her to escape her tragic condition.
