Well, first we have to figure out what we have.

Suppose that I run a prediction on the value of gold, with the precommittment to inform the public of what I see. There are three possibilities: Gold is not significantly different, gold is significantly lower, gold is siginificantly higher. My precommitted reveal will use unified language. If I see gold as literally valuless, I'll say that the price of gold will not have decreased by 99% tomorrow. Otherwise, I'll swap 99% for 100%. This way, I'm revealing my knowledge of the future.

Given that people now believe, regardless of the truth, that the value of gold is going to fall through the floor, a selling frenzy should occur. As they see the prices drop, news will spread, and the selling frenzy will become more intense. Now - either I'll have seen gold drop to nil, or I won't have. But if I haven't, then I've created a condition where the restoration of gold's price will require an event of supreme improbability. We know the event has to occur per samsara.

...If I always see the value of gold as low/zero, this means that this ability accounts for my decisions. If it accounts for my decisions, then I can cultivate predictions that create some desired end state. Beyond that, it means that the entire set of all outcomes - past, present, and future - is predetermined, which is far too boring, so I game the ability by killing myself to either the boredom or satisfaction of the ability-giver. It doesn't matter, because nothing does! Samsara!

On the other had, if we don't constantly see low/zero value, then that's suggestive that the ability does not take into account the user's choices, but actively manipulates developing events to enforce outcomes. That (probably) being the case, I'd like to see what would happen if I tell Vladimir Putin that the US will not launch a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia after first predicting that it won't and even before that prediction, predicting that the US will remain un-nuked for the next /n/ years and that relations with russia will continue as normal, or something similarly ridiculous, but less genocidetastic. You know, really make the power /work/ for whatever contrived bullshit it gives me.

In the meantime, I'll set up a timestamped random character generator and predict timestamps to read a total syntheses for the most powerful lifesaving drugs that will ever be invented, and other useful knowledge.
