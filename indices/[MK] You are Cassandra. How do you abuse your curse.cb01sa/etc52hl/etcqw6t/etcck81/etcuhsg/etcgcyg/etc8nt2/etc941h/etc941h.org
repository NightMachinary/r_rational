  Publicize a couple predictions about e.g. future worldwide elections, economic events, football game wins etc, then spread them online with a combination of moderate clickbait writing (buy out a yellow pages magazine to write clickbait articles for you if you don't want clickbait on your fancy conservative-looking consulting website) and old - fashioned marketing.

Literally nobody will believe the clickbait, though. It'll work as anti-clickbait, unless somebody's managed to make clickbait out of "gravity makes things fall upwards".

But people just have to read it, not click on it!
