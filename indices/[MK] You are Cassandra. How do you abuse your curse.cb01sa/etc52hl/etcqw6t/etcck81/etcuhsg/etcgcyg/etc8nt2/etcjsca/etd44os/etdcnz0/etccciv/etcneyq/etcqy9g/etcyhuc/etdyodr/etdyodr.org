If she says "tomorrow the world will still exist" without looking then sure, that wouldn't trigger any magical effects.

But if she says "tomorrow the world will still exist" /with looking/, i.e., because she actually prophesied an event occurring tomorrow, that means she assigned a probability of 1 to the existence of the world tomorrow /because/ of a prophecy, and so the magical effect should trigger and cause people to assign a probability of 0 to the existence of the world tomorrow.

This should work because the existence of the world tomorrow isn't 100% certain. It is incredibly likely that the world still exists tomorrow, but nothing is absolutely certain. Only prophesy can let you actually assign a probability of 1 to events.
