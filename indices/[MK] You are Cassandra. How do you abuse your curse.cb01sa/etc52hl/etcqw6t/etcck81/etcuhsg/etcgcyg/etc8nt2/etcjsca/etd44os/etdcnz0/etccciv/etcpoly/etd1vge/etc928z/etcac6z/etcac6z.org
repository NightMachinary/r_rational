Something I notice is that as long as you have the credibility, and you don't tell them why you want them to do stuff, you can get them to act on your prophecies.

Like, you can tell someone, "If you're near a burning tanker, get as far away from it as possible", because that's not revealing future events. If you did manage to run afoul of the cassandra curse, and they think they'll never be near a burning tanker, they'll still remember your advice and be able to act on it.
