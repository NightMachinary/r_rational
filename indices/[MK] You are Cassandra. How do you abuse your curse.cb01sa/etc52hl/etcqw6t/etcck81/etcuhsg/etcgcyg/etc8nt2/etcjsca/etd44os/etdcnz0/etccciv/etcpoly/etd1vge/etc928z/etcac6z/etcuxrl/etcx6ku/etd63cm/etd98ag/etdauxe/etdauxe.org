I feel like a number of people are going about this wrong. It'll probably be much less abusable than it's being portrayed (note: still eminently abusable).

Any prophecies we see have to come true, thus they will take into account our actions after seeing them. Thus, all prophecies must be able to come into play even with our actions. Aka they may be different from what was going to happen by the nature of our using our power via observer effect.

Ex: the stock X was going to stay steady tomorrow. We use our power. The power takes into account how we will act on the prophecy. Tomorrow now holds a drop in the stock X, which we see in our prophecy.

Regardless of what we do, the new future is now a drop in stock X. Maybe it's because we tell people and they panic sell, leading to our buying it at the peak low tomorrow following the drop - but the stock price is locked in to fall.

The simplest way a prophecy will come true could always be the person with the power has a heart attack and dies immediately after the prophecy is given, since if the person was free to act they would do something to irrevocably nullify it. If anything, one should be super cautious with this power if the universe HAS to make prophecies come true, because the only variable is the one with the power. It may just be easiest for the universe to "smite" them whenever they use it.
