  Once you are aware of one of your prophesies, it /will/ come to pass.

So it's inevitable? Time to outcome pump like crazy.

If you can prophesy anything at all about yourself, like say you prophesy that you do some action X in 10 years, that means you cannot die before then. So go absolutely nuts and pre-commit to killing yourself unless your desired outcomes happen, and the universe will bend to your will to ensure you survive until 10 years later.

If you can only prophesy things about other people, then that's harder. You need to find some way to kill them in order to outcome pump, but then the pump works much harder against you since it could simply kill you to prevent you from killing the other. On the other hand, the fact that this other person survives until the moment of your prophesy suggests that wherever he goes, the area he is in is relatively safer than normal, so you could abuse this simply by sticking to him like glue.
