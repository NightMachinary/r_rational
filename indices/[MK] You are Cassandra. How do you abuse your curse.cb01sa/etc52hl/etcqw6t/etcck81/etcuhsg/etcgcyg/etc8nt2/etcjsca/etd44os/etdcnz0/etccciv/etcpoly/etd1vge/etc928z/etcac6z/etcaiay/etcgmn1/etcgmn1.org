  Well, it is revealing future events. They'll think "oh, the tanker's going to explode"

Does it happen if you cause them to think that by any means whatsoever, or is it limited to direct communication? Ie. if somebody would happen to believe the thing that you prophesied through a process that does not at all resemble communication, do they still disbelieve? For instance, if you prophesize that a company will collapse, so you short it, and this causes people to think it will collapse, which is a consequence of your prophecy, so they disbelieve it? Can you use this to make people take any bet, no matter how obscenely imbalanced?

edit: Gonna toplevel this as a proposal.
