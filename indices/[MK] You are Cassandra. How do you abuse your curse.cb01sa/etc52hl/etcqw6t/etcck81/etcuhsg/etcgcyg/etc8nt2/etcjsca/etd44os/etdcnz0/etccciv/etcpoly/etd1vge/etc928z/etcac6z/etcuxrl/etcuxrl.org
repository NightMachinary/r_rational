A few ground rules that I think are worth clarifying:

​

* 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section
  :END:
1 - Can Cassandra affect the future she sees?

I would argue yes, since making everyone ignore her is the proxy for helplessness... but she's not bound to enter a room if she sees herself entering a room.

​

2 - Can Cassandra believably lie about what she sees?

I would argue that she probably can. The curse seems targeted toward people not believing her future-speak... but there isn't any clause against fabricated-speak.

​

3 - Can Cassandra conjure a future she wants?

I would argue not. She can /see/ the future, not /conjure/ it. So while some of the comments here are fun, she can't invert gravity by making people think gravity sticking around is implausible.

​

4 - Can Cassandra see alternative futures?

I would argue not. She can see the result of any present mix of factors, barring her own involvement (since she's the only one with future-sight). If she changes something, the future she sees shifts accordingly once she's done it.

​

5 - Are indirect actions given zero believability in addition to direct communication?

I would argue anything that could reasonably be interpreted more than one way is not discounted. Telling people to build a fence (to stop some wild hounds tomorrow night) "because it looks nice" is fine. If a piano is about to fall on someone, yelling, waving, gesturing, and so on to get them to move are all not believable.

  :END:
With those out of the way, I think there are a few major avenues for abuse, which I'll define as subverting Apollo's objective of making Cassandra a helpless witness to fate.

​

1 - Influence Systems That Rely on People's Beliefs

Market gaming has been mentioned elsewhere, but I'm thinking about tampering with democratic elections. Votes are influenced by people's beliefs, and changing those will affect the outcome. If Cassandra can affect the future she sees, she should be able to declare any future leader she doesn't like will win and then they won't. This would be particularly handy in the world right now given the dictatorial populism that's on the rise.

​

2 - Become Someone who Distributes Research Grant Money

She'll be in the unique position of distributing funds where they can best go for society based on how the research turns out in advance.

​

3 - Achieve any powerful position where she alone has the power of selection

This could be recruiting, picking stocks, detective work, sales... anything where she has enough authority to make the choice herself /without/ having to convince anyone else of it. The most powerful of which (if she can get there) is probably CEO / CFO of a multi-national company. Which one largely depends on her choice of impact on the world, because it could equally be Facebook, Tesla, GE, Sony, or any other.

​

4 - Accelerate Humanity's Development

One thing that isn't mentioned is how far into the future Cassandra can see, and how much she can comprehend. As long as her actions are sufficiently ambiguous or nominally false enough, she could peer into future human developments and help alter humanity's course. She could nudge research labs into productive directions by leaving certain items out and arranged in certain orders, steer future Hitlers to art school, and avoid big disasters by prominently broadcasting how safe they are.
