  Will that actually make them assign a probability of 0 to the sun setting in the west tomorrow, even though it is obviously true?

Yes.

  For that matter, if you prophesy just about anything, that proves that the world still exists in the future. So if you tell someone that the world still exists in the future, do they now believe the world is going to end?
#+end_quote

If that's specifically what you prophesied? Yes. You'd probably get more details, though, like /when/ the world would still exist.

  Prophesy anything, then go on television and tell the public that the world still exists in the future.
#+end_quote

Wouldn't work, unless you're prophesying that the world will still exist in the future /specifically/. Giving knowledge of the framework under which the prophesy must be valid is conveying zero information about the prophesy.
