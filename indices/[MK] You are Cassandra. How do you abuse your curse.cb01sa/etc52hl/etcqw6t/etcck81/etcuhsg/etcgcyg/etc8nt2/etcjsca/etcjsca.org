I know it wouldn't be the most epic, broken, or efficient thing to do with the power but I think it would be interesting to be a reporter.

1. You would see the future and gather information on a story before anyone else.
2. You could then publish it immediately after it happens, because it isn't a future event anymore
3. -Maybe- you could still influence how the future action happens, by purposefully telling someone about it. Like, if some tragedy is about to happen perhaps you could tell a friend about it and it could change. I'm not sure how this part works, hence the -maybe- in the front.

Really the main advantage you would have is your visions giving you the scoop on every news story possible.
