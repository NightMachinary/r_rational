Easy character assassination: Predict obvious things to target, target repeatedly believes things that are seemingly irrational. Example: "The next NASA mission will not prove that the earth is flat" will turn anyone into a flat-earther.

Alternatively, start a cult by predicting that those who do not join your cult will not be cast down into the fiery depths of Hell for all eternity. More general applications of this up to and including world domination are left as an exercise for the reader.

Easy actual assassination: "If you kill yourself in the next hour, you will not be miraculously resurrected and lead humankind into a golden age of peace and prosperity". Or whatever incentives will work for your target.

More generally, you can predict that people won't get <highly desirable outcome> if they do <thing you want them to do>; this is almost certainly true (and thus predictable) and will lead to them doing <thing> motivated by <outcome>. This is a simple way to compel arbitrary behaviour from arbitrary people if worded correctly. As in the cult example, negative outcome avoidance can also be used instead.

Hmm. On second thought I'm not sure if conditionals like that are permitted, but wording along the lines of "Anyone fulfilling <conditions specific to target> who performs <thing you want target to do> will not receive <highly desirable outcome>" should get around this; it's a simple future statement rather than an if/then thing.

Assuming I'm reading the conditions correctly; if you can prophesy any event and not just events that are actually going to happen, then you have arbitrary future control powers and can simply warp reality at will (e.g. predict you'll become omnipotent in the next second). I'm assuming this isn't how that works.

On a related note, I am curious as to how this scenario handles, for example, telling someone the venture that they are planning will succeed. It seems like to satisfy all the conditions, the person you tell has to be axiomatically certain the venture will fail but attempt it anyway. How does their mind reconcile this?
