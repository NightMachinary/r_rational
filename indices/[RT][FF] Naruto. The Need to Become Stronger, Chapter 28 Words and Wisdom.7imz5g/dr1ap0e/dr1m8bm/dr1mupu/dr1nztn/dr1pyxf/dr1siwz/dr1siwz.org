Yes.

Okay, serious answer: The current Hokage figured out a ton of stuff in his ~40 years in office, partly because he's simply spent a lot of time in doing so and partly because the clans are much more willing to part with secrets to the leader of their village than to their rivals. One can easily imagine them sitting across the table and going, "fine, I'll give you access to our ancient Nara medical herbs book if you finally tell us about techniques X, Y and Z". With conditions about not revealing that kind of thing to anybody else, of course.

And yes, it's expected of any budding Hokage to already to be strong enough to win respect and fend off assassination attempts, and in NTBS the fastest way to do that is by acquiring secret knowledge. Or by bluffing and pretending to be stronger than you really are. Deception is the name of the game, basically.
