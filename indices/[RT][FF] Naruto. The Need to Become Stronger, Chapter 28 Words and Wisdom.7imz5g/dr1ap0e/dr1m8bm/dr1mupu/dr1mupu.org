Wait but would that mean that the ANBU are doing research? So that joining ANBU is less of a loyalty thing but also a bit of a tradeoff: you can either do really dangerous missions and gain access to all the techniques they've developed, or you can do normal missions and work it out by yourself?

And also does this mean that the gap between ordinary ninja and ANBU is widening overtime, as ANBU do more and more research they don't share? Or is the academy material revised / enough jonin sensei picked from ANBU often enough, to maintain a certain constant gap in ability that sets ANBU apart?

And would the first village to abolish secrets really get dramatically more powerful, or would that advantage really only last gmail the first captured chunin/jonin?
