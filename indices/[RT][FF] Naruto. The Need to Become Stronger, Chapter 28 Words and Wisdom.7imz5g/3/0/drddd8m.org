Since you're unlikely to get any replies at this point, and my own opinion is not objective, I'll just quote the most common phrases from the reviews I received:

"Your technical writing is incredible"\\
"I don't like any of the characters"\\
"Excellent pacing and plot"\\
"Naruto is not smart enough to be the MC"\\
"Amazing characterisation"\\
"Too similar to canon"\\
"Your action scenes are the best I've ever read"

It's still not entirely objective of course since I'm selecting the quotes, but hopefully that gives you an indication of what to expect.

As for the plot, it's mostly character driven, based on the question of what would happen differently if all the important characters pursued their goals in a rational way. For example, NTBS Naruto does not want to be hokage, but instead tries to end the conflict in the world by understanding and breaking the way ninjutsu works. And the villain does not have cheap insta-win powers and so has to be smart and act from the shadows, a bit like in HPMOR.
