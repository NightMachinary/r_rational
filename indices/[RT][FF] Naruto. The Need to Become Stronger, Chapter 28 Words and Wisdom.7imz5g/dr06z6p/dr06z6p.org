In a village with Tsunade in the medical division, genuinely trying to make someone quit being a ninja actually is worse than beating someone half to death. There's also the element of Naruto's words being unnecessary. Nobody believed that Naruto actually wanted to kill Lee, and misjudging an attack in a moment of anger is bad but understandable. When Naruto continually used his words throughout the fight to break Lee's confidence in being a ninja at all, especially combined with his previous record of attempting to get Hinata to quit, it makes everyone think his intentions are geninely hostile and underhanded. And that is worse than any sparring accident, because accidents can be mitigated through training, while hostility towards your friends and allies can't.
