I agree with what you are saying but am still a bit disapointed that Neji and Tenten were not more specifically angry at Naruto for the disrespect he showed their Sensei.

It seems like it would make sense for them to care deeply about their sensei even if they are not willing to consciously admit it given the crucial role he plays in their lives.
