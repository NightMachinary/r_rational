Honestly I think you're a little too hung up about the authority thing. Sure, they're basically in feudal Japan which has a culture that is very much about respecting your elders. And if Naruto publicly insulted someone like Danzo, there certainly would be consequences (though it would also look bad to care too much about the opinion of a mere genin). However, what Naruto said was A) in a world of ninjas who are all about ruthless pragmatism, B) during a tournament which explicitly encouraged cheating, and C) about Maito Gai, a man who cares so little about anyone's opinion that he decided to wear a green jumpsuit one day and never looked back.

Frankly, if Neji and Tenten stopped to think for 2 seconds, they'd realize that trying to shield Lee from criticism is the absolute last thing he'd want. In fact he explicitly said to Naruto during the fight that he did not want him to hold back as "nothing is more painful than being pitied by your peers". And Neji in particular has no business telling Naruto not to be rude, IMO.

But of course, Naruto has that special aura of obnoxiousness that makes it impossible to agree with him even when he's right :P
