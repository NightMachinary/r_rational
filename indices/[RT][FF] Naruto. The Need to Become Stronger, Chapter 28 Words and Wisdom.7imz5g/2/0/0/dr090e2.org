Good eye, both of you. Yep, that was definitely what I had in mind when I cave Naruto that seal - that plus the fact that it made sense, of course.

The general idea behind NTBS is that all the most powerful BS techniques in canon actually have rational explanations behind them. Nobody is just randomly capable of beating an army like Madara in canon, they just use trickery and lies to make people think so. So in fact bloodline limits like "explosion release" actually turn out to be achieved with seals in this case, and it's not hard to see how explosive clones follow from the same principle.

If you check back on the Itachi fight scenes in this story, you can even tell that he's using this ability throughout - which of course implies that Itachi is at least as smart as Naruto is. :>
