I think I cut it from the final edit for the sake of pacing (like 90% of my worldbuilding) but originally I had a scene where Kakashi explained how paranoia was holding the ninja world back. I.e. the strength of a ninja lies in their secrets, which stops them from sharing techniques and working together to find out how it all works. There is research but it is mainly done in Anbu and by a few individuals like the Sannin who again don't share their findings with anyone, which results in having to invent the wheel from scratch each time. And since it's only been a 100 years since the founding of the Village and most people have been fighting nonstop during that time, it's not hard to see why there is still a lot of low hanging fruit to pluck.

I am definitely planning to have Naruto adress and take advantage of this in the future.
