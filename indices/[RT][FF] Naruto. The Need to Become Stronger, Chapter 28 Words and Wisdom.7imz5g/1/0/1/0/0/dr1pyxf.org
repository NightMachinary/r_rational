Wait (sorry, I know I say that a lot) do you mean that the current Hokage (the Professor) knows most of the secrets, that Hokage's, on election, are taught the secrets (making them stronger), or that prospective Kage's are expected to have already figured out most of the secrets floating around their village by the time they're even considered for the job (like how Naruto figured out Explosive Release, but scaled up)?
