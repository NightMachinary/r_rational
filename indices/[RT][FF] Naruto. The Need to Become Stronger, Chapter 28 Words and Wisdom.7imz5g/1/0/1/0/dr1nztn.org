The thing about ninjas is that their abilities vary enormously, and you simply can't teach everyone the shadow clone technique for example. So carefully matching students with compatible teachers makes a great deal of sense. What sets the Anbu apart however is not their power level, but that they operate much more like swat teams in that they go looking for ninjas with certain incredibly valuable talents like sensing and put them together in squads. And yes, because they report directly to the Hokage there is a much higher trust level which lets them gather and share techniques so that even a group of chunin level ninjas can take on Jonin level opponents (see hunter ninjas vs zabuza at the end of act 2).

Basically what makes the Anbu so frightening in NTBS is... Teamwork.

Edit: So yes, it would be a big advantage if the clans were all to share their techniques, but it wouldn't scale as well as you might think, as bloodline abilities etc could not be copied, and it would be a huge security risk, which is why only the Hokage knows most of the secrets, and it is mainly the Anbu (or rather the intel division under Inoichi) that does research.
