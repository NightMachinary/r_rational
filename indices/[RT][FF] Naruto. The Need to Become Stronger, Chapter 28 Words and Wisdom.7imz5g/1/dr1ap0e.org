Just a quick question; how many other options are for there ninja, except for front-line battle/other dangerous jobs? Does the whole ninja weapon development division we saw in Boruto exist yet, if seals are so useful in this universe? Because with Tsunade still heading the medical division I can really see how that would greatly contribute to making Konoha one of the strongest villages (better medics mean more ninjas make it home, where they can continue training and gathering strength).

And at the same time, in a world where all the greatest, seemingly OP techniques are based on an essential trick, a division of chakra users specialized in developing/deciphering those tricks for other ninja to use would seem like a pretty great force multiplier for any ninja village. And, given Naruto's personality (how he's always wondering about new techniques/thinking about why people don't use more techniques for peace time benefits), it seems to be the perfect thing he would think of starting up / be a bit pressured to join if it already exists and his ingenuity became more common knowledge.

Plus it could kinda work as character development, given his recent actions. He keeps telling people to try less hard or just even quit, yet doesn't seem to be very aware/have much respect for people who do decide to leave the frontlines and do something else with their ability to use chakra. I don't see why Sakura deciding to become a medic should be seen as quitting; it's a highly demanding, necessary job that someone needs to do, and she could be very good at it. Sure her leaving the team is sad, but still.

And maybe, in a rational world, Naruto might learn that he doesn't have to do everything himself, and that might do better if he made the village stronger, rather than just gathered personal strength himself.

But still I'll admit that a story about a support ninja would be kind of boring, unless Naruto still got into danger by venturing out looking for ideas / techniques to decipher.
