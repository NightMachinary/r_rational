He used wish to create the magical item that did reducio so the water cannon was the direct result of the wish spell and the new spell created for it.

Yeah, make a potion of intellect, make a better potion of intellect, repeat.

I believe the fastest speedrun for Morrowind does something similar. There's a wizard who has a scroll to boost your jump to catastrophic levels (though no feather fall spell nearby). You grab that. You then use a weapon glitch where you switch weapons rapidly and the game gets confused and repeatedly applies the weapon's bonuses to you. You then jump to the final boss and kill them. A very quick infinite loop which wins the game in three minutes.
