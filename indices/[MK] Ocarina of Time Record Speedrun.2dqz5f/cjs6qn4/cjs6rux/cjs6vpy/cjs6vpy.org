Heh, fair enough; I should have paid attention to the tag. Better phrasing: how is it munchkinly? I know what a speed run is, but I don't want to watch someone else playing a video game for 18 minutes, especially since I don't know the game and therefore likely wouldn't notice the cool stuff anyway. Can someone summarize what the munchkinry was?
