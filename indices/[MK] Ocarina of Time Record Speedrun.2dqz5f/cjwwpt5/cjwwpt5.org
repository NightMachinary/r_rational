This is amazing.

Also a ripe thing to base a PeggySue!Link off of. Link the first couple of time loops,trying to be a hero the traditional way with his adventures and all manner of super swords.

Link after hundreds and hundreds of time loops, pushing the physical boundaries of his universe in an attempt to find a way out of the endless, mind numbing loop. Link, who in his endless endeavor to escape his loop now understands his universe so well that he can defeat the villain in twenty minutes with a bottle, some worms, and a Deku stick.
