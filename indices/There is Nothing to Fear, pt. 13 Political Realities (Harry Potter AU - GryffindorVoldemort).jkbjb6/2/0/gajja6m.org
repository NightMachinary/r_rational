That's a mistake, sorry. Folks here and on Ao3 were asking for the unabridged Margaret Thatcher letter, so I was setting that up, and then I was called away for work stuff. I didn't realize that it would show up as 1/2 while the letter was still in draft.

I've fixed that. Thanks for bring it to my attention.
