Is this a standalone story, or the first of two chapters?

All of the text above, as well as the author text at the end, and the fact that it ends when the description says it should (1993), seems to suggest to me that this is a complete update, and that the next update will be the first chapter of the Hermione story.

The only thing weighing against that is:

Is that a mistake, or is there a second chapter of "Political Realities" coming?

Edit to add: looking more closely at the metadata, I love the "CW: Margaret Thatcher" tag.
