An RT Breaking Bad would have him never getting into the business to begin with. It was never a rational act and, if he'd thought about it much more he would never have gotten involved. A rational!Walt might have never gotten out of Gray Matter Technologies and instead have been rich and happy. It was sort of implied that he got out due to a bad breakup?

As big of a fan as I am of Rationalist fiction, not every story can be improved by a rational protagonist. The very thing that makes Breaking Bad great is Walt's irrationality. He is a little man in a bad situation and is the villain protagonist of his own little story.
