Note - "Peggy Sue" and "Mary Sue" are entirely different tropes and, despite the similarity in name, are etymologically distinct too! The former is derived from the film [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Sue_Got_Married][Peggy Sue Got Married]], and the latter (I believe) from an old Star Trek fanfic.
