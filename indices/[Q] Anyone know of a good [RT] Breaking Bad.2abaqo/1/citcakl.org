I think the problem is that many of the things that advanced Walt's 'career' were very high-risk acts of desperation that in no way would have seemed rational considering the information he had at the time. Often he survived and progressed due to sheer luck and was close to getting killed several times by Krazy 8, Tuco, Gus and the nazis (and the desert!). But had he not risked himself this way, he'd have no chance of success.
