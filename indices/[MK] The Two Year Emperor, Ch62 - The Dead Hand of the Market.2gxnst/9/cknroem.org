Yeah, the only thing I'm not getting is if there is an easy way to effect undead with mind-affecting spells. Mindscrape (which I'm assuming is just a renamed BoVD [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/book-of-vile-darkness--37/mindrape--165/][Mindrape]] as it does the exact same thing) is explicitly mind-affecting and so does not normally work on undead.
