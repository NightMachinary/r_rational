I don't think it's /Mindscrape/ - on a meta level, because HPMoR already used that trick several times and it's becoming overused in my mind. If the whole event was fake, then all the details we're given about it are literally meaningless, they don't even work as red herrings. Red herrings still have to be explained - the silhouette on the hill was Watson out for a walk, the butler's scar is an old war wound.

If the events Hammond saw were /Mindscraped/ into him, Afi could have revealed that Manghild was actually two midgets in a robe, and that the entire D&D universe was magically created from the subconscious of Twilight Sparkle and will end when someone learns a lesson about friendship, and the scenario would have otherwise played out in exactly the same way.

If we start calling out "Memory hacking!" every time something impossible happens, we might as well dismiss the entire story up until Chapter 57 as Icefi's fabrication.
