Hammond's story was filled with so many remarks upon the lines of "that should have been impossible", that I am made extremely suspicious. The ability to command a goddess especially seems implausible for a non-deity. He could've been getting help from Neklos, I suppose, but this doesn't really sound like Neklos' style, and I am uncertain if he would have had the ability to so easily convince a goddess to give up such a valuable worshipper.

We know that Afi has access to spells which alter people's memories, with which he could easily achieve a memory like that with comparative ease. If it seems plausible that he could summon all the Lich Kings, it ought to be plausible that he could find a way to get them into a scenario where he can hit them with a mindscrape. A memory whose effect seems to have greatly benefited Afi. So, Afi has both the means and motive to Mindscrape such a memory, and seems unlikely to have the means to actually do the things detailed within

It seems far more likely to me that he Mindscraped the memory into Hammond rather than actually doing the things detailed therein

EDIT: I am also suspicious of how Hammond could possibly know that "There is nothing like the presence of a deity, no way to fake it", since he has no way of distinguishing there being a secret way to do so from there being no way to do so

EDIT2: Apparently mind affecting spells do not work on undead. However, my hypothesis could still work, albeit in a more complex manner. If Hammond was PAOed into a human, Mindscraped and then PAOed back, the Mindscrape could still work
