The XP charts aren't part of the SRD; they are only in the books. (I believe PH, but not sure.) You can find PDFs of the books online if you look.

Power levels cap out on classes - a level 20 wizard gets the exact same number of spells as a level 1,000,000,000,000 wizard, all else being equal. (Which it wouldn't be due to increasing ability scores, but you take the point.) Beyond this capstone, the character only gains minor benefits such as a few more HP.

You're absolutely right about an effective limit due to inability to find a challenge, but that wouldn't happen until quite late. I'm not sure how late though.

It's an interesting question; if anyone more familiar with the monster lists wanted to poke at it, I'd be curious to know the answer.
