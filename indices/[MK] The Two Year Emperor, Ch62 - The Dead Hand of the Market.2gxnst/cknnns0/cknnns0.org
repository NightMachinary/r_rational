Hey, here's a thought I had: Is there a maximum level you can reach in D&D? Within the 2YE ruleset, I mean, where you can keep going up levels past 20 but there's no epic rules.

I can't find the "player level \ monster level -> XP gained" chart online, but I recall from Order of the Stick that if you're so many levels stronger than the enemy that they literally provide no challenge to you, you gain 0 XP for defeating them. If that is true, then it suggests this: once you've gotten to the point where the strongest monster in the entire game can't challenge you (or at least, the strongest monster that you can find in large enough quantities to train against), then you'll hit a level cap. You'll only gain XP at all when you fight other people who've had the same idea as you, which is not exactly ideal level-grinding material.

Any idea what the hard limit on levels might be? Less than 50? More than 1000? Or are there creatures in the outer darkness of arbitrarily high power that could provide decent XP even to a level googoolplex character?

(I wouldn't try actually hitting this level cap unless I were a god, or an Afi, but it's still useful information.)
