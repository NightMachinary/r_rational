Huh. For some reason I went in expecting something better. I guess seeing it on here multiple times caused me to expect some kind of serious story. It turns out most of the postings for it here are by you. Your words have allowed me to take a step back and adjust. I'm sure your writing gets better, but I'll be stopping here. Thanks! :)
