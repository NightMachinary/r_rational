About the Grappling Run (wrong chapter but meh), Shouldn't they still be unable to run through enemies? Or at least those that take up all the corridor space? Bull Rushes don't become stronger through speed (i.e range of the Bull Rush) and in any case Initiative still applies as normal (although the raids Dex should be far beyond average so that might often not be an issue). If 2 Iron Golems stand next to each other in a tunnel you cannot run through them according to RAW. And if you cop-out is that they get knocked aside by Mach 7, well that would be real life physics in which case Mach 7 also squishes soft humans all bunched up in a 5 ft square.

Also, isn't it possible to fire conjuration spells into an Anti-Magic Field as long as the casting of the spell happens outside of the field? Damage dealing conjurations actually summon a non-magical projectiles as far as I know. Or in RAW words:

  "The effects of instantaneous Conjurations are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result."
