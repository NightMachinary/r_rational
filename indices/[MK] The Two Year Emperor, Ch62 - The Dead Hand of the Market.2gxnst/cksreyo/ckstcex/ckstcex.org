[dealing with creatures]

They didn't Bull Rush anything. As per canon, they killed it.

My take on it is that they get a surprise round because they're traveling hypersonic. During the surprise round they run up to the enemy, stab it with five or six dozen daggers, then continue running past its bleeding corpse. (Assuming that it bleeds. In any case, corpses do not block movement AFAIK.)

[conjuration spells into AMF]

That's how I read it, yes: conjurations that manifest outside an AMF can still go into it. Fireballs, Lightning Bolts, and Manyjaws (the things that Hammond was asserted to be using) are all Evocation spells, so the AMF nullifies them. If he had had spell traps that:

1. Used Conjuration spells...
2. Which did not require targeting or manifesting inside the AMF...
3. Could reasonably affect the Meatball by RAW...

...then yes, Hammond's traps could have affected them.
