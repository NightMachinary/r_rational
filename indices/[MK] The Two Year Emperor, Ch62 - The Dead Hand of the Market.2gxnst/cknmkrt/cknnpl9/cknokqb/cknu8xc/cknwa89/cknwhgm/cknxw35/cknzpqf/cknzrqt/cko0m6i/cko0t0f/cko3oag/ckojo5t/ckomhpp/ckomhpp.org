[languages] Interesting, thanks for the reference.

[Inevitables etc] Heh. So, basically, they are the deputies for the gods and do the exact kind of "don't do that" message deliveries that I've had gods doing themselves?

Ah well, I still prefer having the relatively human deities do the work instead of sending minions.
