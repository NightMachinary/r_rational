The idea of an intelligent sword wanting to be the best sword there ever was and desperately seeking to power Wish spells for self-improvement is a pretty amusing premise, though. Maybe it gets the Extraordinary "Charm Person" ability and sets about trying to convince anyone who comes across (who's still low enough level to fail the DC check) it to enroll in Wizard School, urging them along the path towards getting Wish.

Basically a ridiculous take on the AI-box thought experiment.
