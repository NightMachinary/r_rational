Notable also is that both languages (Dark Speech and Words of Creation) have actual magical effects on the world when spoken aloud in specific combinations, regardless of who is doing the speaking.

They are sometimes mentioned in the fluff of other spells or abilities as well. the Warlock's Shatter invocation is performed by speaking a word of the Dark Speech - 'unmaking' or similar.

The Words of Creation ability for Bardic music is especially valuable, as it flat doubles the bonus provided from Inspire Courage (an ability that is already eminently exploitable in the 3.5 ruleset) can be used even by nonmagical characters to get a +4 sacred bonus to Craft checks or to automatically Extend a Conjuration (Creation) effect.

The Dark Speech can be used to weaken physical objects, permanently reducing their hardness by half, or to create (and this gets overpowered fast) a hivemind of insects which gets mental stat increases and *Sorcerer caster levels* for free as it gets larger. The hivemind can also /ignore spell components/. Including expensive or rare ones. So, they could for example Ice Assassin a God without having the requisite piece of the God to do so.

They have Int/Charisma based on size. 500 centipedes have a Charisma 14. 1000 have Charisma 24. 5000 have Charisma /104/. They get 1 Sorcerer caster level per Charisma over 17, so my last example is a level 87 sorcerer with spell slots per day of....

0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9

6/26/25/25/25/25/24/24/24/24

And it just gets crazier from there.
