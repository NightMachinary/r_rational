True. All of the ones I can think of offhand--golems, intelligent magical weapons (or items in general, I guess), and...hm, actually, that's it. Everything else I'm coming up with is either a non-created magical being (e.g. elemental) or was once human (vampire), or doesn't really have a mind (zombie, skeleton).

Ah, and the SRD says that golems are animated by a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth, so they aren't actually AI. That just leaves intelligent magic items.

Anyway, magic items are created by humans using magic which clearly works off of intent as much as literal interpretation -- when you cast Move Earth, you don't have to understand the structure of the earth or the different amounts of force required to shift clay as opposed to loam, you just wave your hands and it DWYMs. Ditto for Wish. Under those assumptions, it's not unreasonable that AI in D&D would have a human basis.

Also, since the only way to modify a magic item is through Wish (can you do it via the car acting process? Not sure) then it's unlikely for an intelligent sword to be able to self-improve. Most magic items lack significant ability to influence their environment, providing anothe defense against paperclippers.
