  Why didn't the cannons just explode when the thing to be launched grew to normal size?
#+end_quote

The only thing that changes size is the firing rod. At full size, the rod is designed to fit snugly in the barrel.

  Commoner railgun: doesn't it only work if initiative rolls line up correctly?
#+end_quote

No. You can always delay your action.

  Optimizing space: I don't get what they're doing with the reshuffling.
#+end_quote

Zephyr1011 is correct.

  56: ~" //I don't remember what this means but I suspect it was a typo 57 hold you tongue -> hold your tongue

Thanks, will fix.

#+begin_quote
  58 begs the question -> raises the question //unless it's intentionally wrong
#+end_quote

It's correct as written.

  I was toying with the idea that undead is relative
#+end_quote

Nope, sorry.

  "evil" just means selfish.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/description.htm][Not in D&D.]] From the SRD:

""Evil" implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others. Some evil creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without qualms if doing so is convenient. Others actively pursue evil, killing for sport or out of duty to some evil deity or master."

#+begin_quote
  If there were some sort of "smite evil" effect, it would work just as well on selfish people as maliciously evil-in-the-classic-sense people which is counter-intuitive.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm#smiteEvil][There is]] and I'm afraid it doesn't.

#+begin_quote
  I assume the main reason for the gods being persnickety is because of the supergods, and the supergods are persnickety because of the supersupergods
#+end_quote

Nope. The Overgods are pretty hands off for the most part, and there's nothing above them.

#+begin_quote
  Just as a brief note, it is nearly impossible to describe how much of an understatement your description of Graham's number is.
#+end_quote

I'm well aware, and so is Jake. It was a simple way to get the general idea across without having to explain uparrow terminology and draw out repeated power towers.

#+begin_quote
  A lot fewer people know about the Busy Beaver numbers.
#+end_quote

I'm aware of them. They aren't necessary for the story; Graham's number is far larger than needed.

#+begin_quote
  They didn't actually use this strategy, but what did you mean by "one level maze" for the wall following method? It only works in very simple mazes.
#+end_quote

Yes, I'm aware. I wanted to demonstrate Jake being wrong about something, showing that he's not perfectly all-knowing.
