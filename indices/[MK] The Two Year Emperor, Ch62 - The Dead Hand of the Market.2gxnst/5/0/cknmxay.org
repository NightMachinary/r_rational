When they rearranged Grofhamr with a commoner railgun? I believe this was to reorganise Grofhamr to make it more efficient and so that people are closer to the exit for the Herrun ritual. Grofhamr is essentially a tree, with each node being a portable hole and each edge being the connection between a portable hole and the holes inside of it. Its start node was at the entrance, and each node led to up to 3 other nodes, but pre-reshuffling it was extremely disordered, with some nodes extremely far from the start. The reshuffling made it so that each node led to 3 others, which led to 9 more etc, so that if there are less than (3^{n+1}-1)/2 nodes, no node is more than n holes from the entrance

  With this many high-level people around, would the resurrection engine be feasible again?

I don't think resurrection is very feasible, as Drifa has said that 1 in 4 times they miss something, which can be extremely damaging. Even using Ice Assassin to avoid casualties on the part of the resurrectors, it isn't really worth it
