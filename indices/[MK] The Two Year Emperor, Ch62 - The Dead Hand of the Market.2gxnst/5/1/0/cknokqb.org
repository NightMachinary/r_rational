  ""Evil" implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others. Some evil creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without qualms if doing so is convenient. Others actively pursue evil, killing for sport or out of duty to some evil deity or master."

So, in D&D utilitarian calculations are explicitly evil? I don't see any provision in here for "... or through inaction allow people to come to harm". So ... is there an Evil God of Good? Maximizing the cause of Good through possibly-Evil means?

[edit] So I've been reading through the SRD and it looks like the creators simply didn't /anticipate/ acting Evil/disrespecting lifes and dignity out of altruism. So .. does that mean utilitarians fall into Lawful Neutral? It seems like the catch-all alignment ("act according to some personal code [that we didn't anticipate in our Good/Evil spectrum]"). Sort of the alignment of Blue and Orange Morality?

So.. do the Gods strictly operate on SRD RAW re Good/Evil anyways?
