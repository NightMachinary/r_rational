From the SRD page on alignment that I quoted above:

#+begin_quote
  "Good" implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the dignity of sentient beings. Good characters make personal sacrifices to help others.
#+end_quote

It seems pretty clear to me that utilitarian calculations are based on a respect for life and a concern for the dignity of sentient beings. Good doesn't mean Stupid -- Good people are allowed to choose the lesser of two evils.

#+begin_quote
  People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have compunctions against killing the innocent but lack the commitment to make sacrifices to protect or help others. Neutral people are committed to others by personal relationships.
#+end_quote

Serious utilitarians have the commitment to make personal sacrifices for their beliefs, and their code operates on a high level (concern for all humans / all life), even if they don't have a personal relationship with the people involved. Therefore, utilitarians are not Neutral.
