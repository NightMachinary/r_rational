I may have confused it with the Dark Speech, which is the precursor language to Abyssal and Infernal in the same way Latin would be to our English - BoVD page 32:

#+begin_quote
  There are no words in the Dark Speech for good concepts such as kindness, mercy and purity. However evil characters can speak of misery, anguish, hate and betrayal with an accuracy impossible in any other tongue.

And on it's flip side, the Words of Creation, the precursor language to Celestial, BoED pg 32:

#+begin_quote
  It [The Words of Creation] has no words for evil concepts such as misery, despair, hate and betrayal, while the subtlety of it's terminology for beauty, kindness and mercy is astonishing.

So, while it is possible that Abyssal/Infernal and Celestial adopted those concepts out of necessity as those languages evolved, older demons and Angels likely learned with the basic forms of the Dark Speech and Words of Creation, as their precursor tongues, so their minds would have been formed with those understandings of the world.

As an aside, in a world where Angels and Demons are canonically birthed from the minds or powers of Gods, created wholecloth from nothing, can we really say they are not artificial intelligences? The Modrons and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inevitable_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29][Inevitables]] of Mechanus would certainly qualify as AI, likely in form as well as origin.

They were created to enforce universal law on the planes, existing only to do so. There are ones who serve Justice, Death, Time/Space, Divinity(as you have the gods do directly here), and Oaths. They hunt down transgressors like the Furies of Greek mythology hunt down kinslayers.
