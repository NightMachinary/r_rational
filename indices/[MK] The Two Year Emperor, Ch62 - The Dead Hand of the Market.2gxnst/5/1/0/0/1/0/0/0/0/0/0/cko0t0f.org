Outsiders.

Natural outsiders are the definition of alien intelligences. Allison is an example in system, as she likely has different values - although she approaches human norms - but for alignment based outsiders?

Infernal and Abyssal, the languages of devils and demons, literally /do not have words/ for concepts like 'mercy'. These beings are literally made of evil and law/chaos. What they think is part of their being. Demons are, in general, Omnicidal Maniacs because they are trying to return things to the primal chaos that spawned them. That they take pleasure in suffering is almost incidental.

Devils are basically tyranny personified. Angels are the opposite - Celestial doesn't have words for torture or anything like schaudenfreude, but it has dozens of words for mercy and joy.

Imagine a group which literally cannot conceptualize (in most cases) the thought patterns of the other side. Who feels their morality in their very being, because their utility functions are representative of their makeup in the same way our genetics defines ours, only moreso.

That's alien in my book.

This isn't even getting into Far Realm outsiders. That stuff gets really weird.
