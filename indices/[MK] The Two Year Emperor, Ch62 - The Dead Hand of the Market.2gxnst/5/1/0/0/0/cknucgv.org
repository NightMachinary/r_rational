The SRD is interesting in that it's inconsistent - Good is based on outlook, but Evil is based on /actions/.

#+begin_quote
  "Good" implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the dignity of sentient beings.

  "Evil" implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others.

So I'm forced to agree with the other commenter in that utilitarian behavior can end up both simultaneously. Agreed about Neutral though.
