All caught up. Note thought dump.

Some kind of explosive in case people go zombie would be useful in high-level troops if you can make it trigger automatically and destroy the newly zombieified / vampified creature.

Why didn't the cannons just explode when the thing to be launched grew to normal size?

Commoner railgun: doesn't it only work if initiative rolls line up correctly?

Optimizing space: I don't get what they're doing with the reshuffling.

I'm enjoying it but I regret that my knowledge of D&D isn't quite strong enough to solve the puzzles. I played a lot of Baldur's Gate and I played D&D itself once or twice with various people, but that's it. I know nothing of all this version 3+ nonsense, hehe. Is there a list of spells somewhere I can look at? I would help a lot.

I was toying with the idea that undead is relative: every so often a bunch of undead swarm and take over the world, then a group of beings that are undead relative to them take over. This is incompatible with alignment, but I never liked alignment in the first place. It's all well and good as a starting point for a character, but if you really look at the definitions, "evil" just means selfish. If there were some sort of "smite evil" effect, it would work just as well on selfish people as maliciously evil-in-the-classic-sense people which is counter-intuitive.

I assume the main reason for the gods being persnickety is because of the supergods, and the supergods are persnickety because of the supersupergods and so on forever because this assumption amuses me.

With this many high-level people around, would the resurrection engine be feasible again?

Just as a brief note, it is nearly impossible to describe how much of an understatement your description of Graham's number is. Merely 2^{2^{1000000}} is more than can be expressed with a digit per elementary particle in the universe. Graham's number is, of course, much much bigger. A lot fewer people know about the Busy Beaver numbers. The short version is that BB(n) grows faster than /any function computable in any finite amount of time whatsoever/. Busy beaver numbers utterly stomp any other number sequence that isn't based on similar principles.

They didn't actually use this strategy, but what did you mean by "one level maze" for the wall following method? It only works in very simple mazes. There are one z-level planar mazes it won't work on.
