Upon doing some more googling:

I still can't find any official ways to gain divine ranks in 3.0/3.5. To quote [[http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?318362-Who-can-grant-Divine-Ranks-How-are-they-attained][an enlightening ENWorld discussion]]:

    Can a God make someone else into a God? That seems a bit over the top. But how do things even get Divine Ranks? Who give the okay? The Supreme Being?

  Strictly speaking, I don't believe there are any (first-party) rules for this in 3.0/3.5 D&D. It's however you want it to work in your campaign.

  The Deities and Demigods book suggests that the nature of divinity is possibly gained from a number of different sources. The Greek gods were born into it, being descended from Titans. This is called "Innate Divinity". "Earned Divinity" is when a person does some great or unique deed and is granted divinity based on that right. "Stolen Divinity" suggests murdering an existing God and stealing his power for your own. "Imparted Divinity" is when a God gives a mortal a portion of their own power, giving them divine ranks at the cost of their own. Zeus does this for the newest of the Greek Gods. There is also "Surrendered Divinity", when a God willingly gives up their divinity (temporarily or permanently), for whatever personal reason.

  As the DM, you decide when or how to grant divinity. These are just easy suggestions. In the D&D Cosmology, all of the Gods except Vecna (who earned it) and St. Cuthbert (who was imparted with it) were born into it.

The [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineRanksAndPowers.htm][SRD]] implies that rank 1-5 deities have hundreds of worshipers, while rank 16-20 have millions, but it doesn't specify how the causality flows.

Lastly, there are many mythos for D&D - there's canon D&D, Forgotten Realms, Eberron, the Pathfinder universe, which may or may not be different from the official Pathfinder shared universe that would best be described as a pen-and-paper MMORPG...

Basically, I'm sure it exists somewhere.
