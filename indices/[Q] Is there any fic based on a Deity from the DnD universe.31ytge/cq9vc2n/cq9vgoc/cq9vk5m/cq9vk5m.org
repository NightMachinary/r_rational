I'm not positive whether it's a 2YE mechanic or not. I've played D&D, but only have a casual understanding of the lore - I wouldn't be surprised if it's a D&D mechanic, but I hadn't run across it before.

If you're looking for a videogame, there are several that use that mechanic. I'm pretty sure both Age of Mythology and "Black and White" both do. (Oh man, remember when Black and White was this super-hyped thing? I never heard of it afterwards.) Reus is an indie game that superficially does that too, but it wasn't my thing personally.
