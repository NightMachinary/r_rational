If you've read Homestuck, then [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/420086/chapters/700061][The Land of Dragons and Dungeons]] is very well written, and has a lot of fun with the divinity systems. It does not use TYE's "gods get power from worshipers" mechanic, but does quite a lot of fun with the D&D mechanics regardless.

Cheesy name, but it has good writing quality, large archive, and it's updating regularly.

Edit: Teaser (tiny-spoiler): the patron-god of Adventurers has temples built in the middle of nowhere. His priests amass wealth and sequester it in secret passages beneath the temple, behind deadly traps of all sorts. They do this constantly until the local sect dies out (partially due to on-the-job fatalities), and the temple falls into obscurity. This is, in fact, deliberate.
