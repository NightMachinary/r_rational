The author himself! I actually loved the story as a whole, it was just jarring to read part 2 with such a different tone. It seemed like Suze suddenly went from a smart, deliberate character to someone stumbling around with an idiot ball stuck in their hands. That change from part 1 where Jake was a rational, albeit flawed character was what left me scratching my head and feeling dissatisfied.

It was also my first DnD story, so I found the mechanics of the world very fun to read/imagine, and the whole deity system was quite unique. It would have been fun to read someone try break it.
