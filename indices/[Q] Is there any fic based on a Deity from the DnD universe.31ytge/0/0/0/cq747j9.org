  to read part 2 with such a different tone.

In fairness, there was an extensive A/N at the start of the second book (Chapter 72) that said "this is not going to be anything like the first one."

  It seemed like Suze suddenly went from a smart, deliberate character to someone stumbling around with an idiot ball stuck in their hands.

The entire point of book two was that Suze was crazy the entire time she was a goddess. The times when she pushed her godhood aside were the times that she behaved rationally. I really wasn't subtle about that, but perhaps it still wasn't as obvious as I intended it to be.
