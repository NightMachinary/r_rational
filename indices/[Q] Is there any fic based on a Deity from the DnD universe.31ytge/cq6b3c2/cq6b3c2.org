I'm sorry to hear you didn't like it. It was intended as a different kind of story, so I understand why you wouldn't enjoy it if you went in expecting more of the same. It also had some flaws even within that new genre, because I tried out some new (to me) writing techniques, not all of which worked.

I don't know any D&D stories that fit what you're asking for, but the FFN D&D archive is here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/game/Dungeons-and-Dragons/]]

You might be able to find something with the "by character" filters, or else you'll just need to scroll and read summaries. I would check the filters myself, but I'm on my phone.
