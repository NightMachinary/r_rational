But what can Cordelia even offer to any of them that they would be willing to do more harm than they were already going to do?

Well i guess Ubua might be able to jerry-rig a redemption/rebirth type thing out of the angel bits/hell egg/whatever she drudged up, Grey has been bound by his word and by his people's word to Cat's cause at least for the foreseeable future. And Malicia who i'm not sure can do much more to Cat that she wasn't already going to do. By that i mean Cordelia doesn't profit in any way from it.

If anything the big thing that Cordelia is going to be using against Cat at this point is her better nature, which if abused probably leads to the end of Procer anyway. I mean Cordelia's already at this point fucked up like she's the reason that the province that she was responsible is currrently overrun, and in terms of her duties as First Prince she's also lead her people right into a bigger war than the civil war she lead them out of.
