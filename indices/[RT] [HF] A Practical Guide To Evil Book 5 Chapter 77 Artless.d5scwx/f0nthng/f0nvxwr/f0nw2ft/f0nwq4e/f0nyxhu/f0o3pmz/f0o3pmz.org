Akua, Tariq, and Malicia come to mind first. Attempting to drive a wedge between Cat and Viv to prompt Viv to attempt a coup seems like something Cordelia would do. Similarly Kegan. Similarly Black, though less a coup in that case than familicide. Pumping Cat up to "worthy for Ranger to hunt" status which she's been flirting with ever since mantling Winter, and she'd immediately jump into if she killed/was seriously antagonistic toward Black.

I kinda got the implication that Cordelia's twelve hours of "preparation" was really twelve hours of "desperately seeking any possible leverage to use against you and coming up empty."
