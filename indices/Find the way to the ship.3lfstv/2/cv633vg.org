Will the aliens follow a signal to you, or will they simply take off in seven days whether or not you are on board?

Is your memory good enough to recall details of the area around the landing site, the approximate time of day (assuming it was not night) that you left the site, and/or any constellations (if it was night)?

Do any of the local terrain features match those visible from the landing site (mountains etc)?
