I can recommend this; it has interesting systems and characters that feel distinct from most webfic I've read (and I've read a lot). I did kinda fall off it, but that was in no way due to the quality of the story; as I said, a lot of webfic. Sometimes I lose track of one and then when I try to pick it up I forget where everything is.

Kind of excited to see it posted again, actually; I'll probably give it a full reread to catch up at some point in the future.
