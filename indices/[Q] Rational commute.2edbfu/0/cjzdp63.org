As already pointed out: If at all practical, move. Long commute times do a really horrible number on your quality of life. It is a cost people consistently underestimate very, very badly. - It is, for example, an extremely strong predictor of divorce.

Secondly: Are you driving? Because if so, pretty much anything actually useful is going to divert dangerous amounts of concentration from that, so I would suggest just going with music.

If it's a long train or bus ride, and you can't relocate due to causes like SO's job/school for kids, ect.. well, Language tapes, podcasts. An audible subscription is a pretty good deal.
