  Long commute times do a really horrible number on your quality of life. It is a cost people consistently underestimate very, very badly.

People always think I'm crazy when I tell them that the primary factor in where I live is proximity to work. When I do the math for them (~250*hours spent commuting per day). Even a half hour commute to work gives you more than enough time to watch every Simpsons episode ever made, including time for sleep, in less than a year.
