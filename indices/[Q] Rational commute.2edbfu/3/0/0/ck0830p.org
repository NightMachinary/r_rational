About half of the Culture audiobooks are only available for sale in the UK, but you can purchase from them outside the UK at audible.co.uk (if you're not particularly concerned with TOS agreements) by paying with a pre-paid debit card without an address associated with it (such as a Visa gift card), and then entering a random, real UK address as the card's billing address.
