Dan Carlin's Hardcore History is amazing, and his Common Sense is good too. [[http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive]]

I also enjoy The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe [[http://www.theskepticsguide.org/]] Planet Money [[http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/127413729/podcast/]] and the Savage Lovecast [[http://www.savagelovecast.com/]]

Of course the most rational commute of all is the one where you drive less than 15 minutes cuz you live close to work. :) Except for the most extreme areas this is generally worth it, as the cost of gas/milage is not insignificant, and the cost in hours of your life is... hard to measure, but probably a LOT.
