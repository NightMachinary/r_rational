*Persona 3 R*

For the purposes of this story, Philemon is able to "save" any time someone with spiritual power touching his butterfly, and can keep as many saves/ timelines open as he wants. (Yay game mechanics!)

WoG is that Nyx/Death is older than all life on Earth and the deepest part of the collective unconscious, which explains why Philemon doesn't just go to a timeline where she never existed.

Let's assume that both the female protagonist and male protagonist existed when Thanatos was sealed in one of them.

*Snip*

Philemon observes humanity's invention battling Thanatos, and waits. The robot moves backwards, avoiding a killing blow, and bumping into his butterfly form. He saves the timeline. (r)

At one point, he moves forward into the monster's eyes, allowing the robot to seal Death in the girl. As it dies, it unleashes a curse that kills her brother. He touches the girl and saves. (rA)

In another universe, he distracts the monster by landing on one of its arms. The robot seals Death in the boy, but its curse kills the girl. (rB)

Through countless minor variations, Thanatos kills one of the two children.

He discards all of the timelines in which the robot does not seal Thanatos in the children, closing the others by turning his attention away from them. The abandoned timelines, left to their own devices, are quickly overtaken by darkness, Law, and Chaos.

*End Snip*

You now have Philemon acting as the player, having his butterfly flap its wings in order to create countless variations of useful universes. However, he can't alter brain chemistry; he can't touch genes; and it turns out, at least for MC and FeMC, that a huge amount of their personality is due to genetics, giving a reason for why MC and FeMC have similar personalities in every derivative universe.

MC is a loner who's trying to munchkin his way to Nyx as quickly as possible, but doesn't quite get how to rely on other people. He tries to minmax his Social Links without necessarily feeling friendship for anyone, only understanding that they feel friendship for him (hello, players!). In a universe where friendship is a force for good, /this is a Very Bad Thing./ He either sleeps with multiple romantic options (because if the act of making other people get close to you empowers you, then be a friend to as many people as possible) and ends up breaking links too often to recreate them (because he doesn't think broken links are a problem if you can fix them later, and ends up pissing people off even more), or he ends up with one romantic option and doesn't complete all of his social links, meaning he can't summon the Universe in the final battle. We spend a chapter following his many fuck-ups.

Philemon fine-tunes SEES with his timelines.

He then moves on to FeMC, our protagonist. At this point, we start seeing the story from her perspective as well as his. Each chapter ends with a Bad End, at which point the timeline is cancelled by Philemon, and he loads an earlier save.

(To be continued with FeMC's storyline)
