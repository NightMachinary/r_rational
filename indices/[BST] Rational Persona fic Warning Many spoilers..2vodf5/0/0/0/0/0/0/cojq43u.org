Ah, okay, haven't played Arena. Still, a rationalist protag would probably try to figure out how Aigis worked/ how to make more, instead of accepting it without question.

Izanami basically /is/ a wireheader, and she comes back every few decades, right? So Takeharu - or Strega, or Ikutsuki - hear about a town with supernatural phenomena, where an incident nearly caused everyone to live blissfully in ignorance, and decides it's much better than dying horribly when Erebus inevitably gets to Nyx,

P4 crew now has to stop the killer and a conspiracy that knows more about Personas than they do. Conspiracy obfuscates the truth further, so it's easier to lose the game.
