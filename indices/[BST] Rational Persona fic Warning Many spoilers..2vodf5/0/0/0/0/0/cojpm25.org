I haven't played The Answer, but is it even possible to eliminate Erebus? You'd have to change the entire human collective unconscious in a way that runs counter to every human's instinct. Even if it was possible using Izanami or something (how anyone would control Izanami in the first place is another question), would it actually be better to modify every human's minds against their will? You could argue that would destroy humanity just as surely as Nyx would. You also run the risk of the story getting hard to follow/appreciate if you include too many elements from multiple games in the series. Most Persona fans haven't played 2, for example. I've only played Innocent Sin myself.

I don't think the AIs would be a solution to the problem. The Kirijo group didn't actually do any of the programming of the AIs' personalities and don't know how they work. According to Persona 4 Arena, the AIs were built with rare artifacts called Plumes of Dusk.
