Well, Mitsuru hides stuff about how Shadows work.

There's the fact that you know Shadows can distort spacetime, which is a very high end ability, and a rational antagonist will want to use that, instead of what actually happened with the antagonists.

The fighting death aspect is actually what I'm talking about - Death isn't the /real/ problem, Erebus is. It's rational, in this sense, to figure out how to get rid of the impulse to die before getting rid of death.

Let's say... Mitsuru's dad lives due to butterflies, realizes that you have to get rid of Erebus to really get of the threat of Nyx, and attempts to use Izanami for wireheading in the sequel.

P3 has a functioning Magitek Robot Girl, with all that implies. Why is she being kept secret? WoG is that all Earthly life is tied to Nyx - therefore, shouldn't AI-type posthumans be the only way to escape death?

Mitsuru know that personas come from the strength of the heart. So why isn't she trying to find a way to give everyone with a heart personas, or figuring out why people have potential?

How about minmaxing the Answer's time loop to figure out as many plans as possible to fight Nyx?

The thing is, there should be lots and lots and lots of butterflies.
