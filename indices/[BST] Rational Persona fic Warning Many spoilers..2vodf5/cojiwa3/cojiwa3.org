I think a Persona 4 fic could work well since it would have a larger audience and the truth theme is the most relevant to a rational fic IMO. Some points to consider:

In the original game the characters don't tell anyone else about the TV world for a variety of reasons including that they don't think anyone would believe them, they didn't know who to trust, and that they are teenagers who are reluctant to talk to adults about their problems. Some of them, Yosuke in particular, just wanted to be heroes. It might have been more rational of them to tell Dojima, though, since he was a detective that they could trust with resources that he could have used to help them. They'd have to demonstrate entering the TV to him and they might not actually take him into the TV world, at least not without telling him ahead of time what to expect from a shadow.

Souji/Yu would be the aspiring rationalist, naturally, since he had the most rational traits in the game, keeping a level head during the scene where they could have gotten the bad ending.

The other characters would have different contributions to solving the mystery. In a rational story some of them like Kanji, Teddie, Yukiko, and Rise would have to have to play a larger role in solving the mystery rather than just being extra muscle or a navigator. In-game, Yosuke was the one who initially drove everyone to try to figure it out and solved some of the early riddles; he's the aspect of rationality that's about willingness to act. Chie was the one who pointed out the simplest, most likely explanation for phenomena that the others overlooked. Naoto was the one who had the training, experience, and talent for detective work in the more mundane parts of the mystery.

Maybe in addition to combat abilities, Personas would make it easier for the user to think in a certain way related to the arcana.

I would expect that some of the more obvious parts of the mystery would be solved faster, like the link between appearing on TV and being the next victim, but the villain would also be more effective in leaving very few traces of their involvement.
