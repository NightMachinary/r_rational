I'm not sure how often Izanami comes back. Did they mention it in the game? For all we know, Persona 4 was the first time she did anything. A plot where Persona 3 antagonists team up with Izanami (I can't see them overpowering her but I can see them convincing her to work with them) to prevent Nyx from killing everyone could work. My main question is whether that's necessary for the plot to be interesting. I think one of the main appeals of Persona 3 and 4, and why they're so popular, is that the stuff with gods and so on isn't really the focus of most of the story, which instead is more about people living relatively mundane, relatable lives. In Persona 4 the characters did most of their investigation in the real world, for example. Of course, you totally can write a fanfic that shifts the tone of the story significantly. HPMOR did just that, after all, and it's very good. If I were writing a Persona story, though, it would mainly be a story of man vs. man, the Investigation Team matching wits with the killer, which forces them to become more rational, with Izanami not getting much attention and issues with Philemon hinted at to occur after the story ends.
