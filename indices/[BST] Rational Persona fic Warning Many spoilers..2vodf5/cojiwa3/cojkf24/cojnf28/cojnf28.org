Not necessarily, just focus less on the background and more on the conflict with the villain, who you would make smarter too. Persona 3 can work too but you'd have to make it less about accepting death and focus more on the fighting death aspect of it. Another thing is that I'm not sure how being rational would have helped the characters fight Nyx.
