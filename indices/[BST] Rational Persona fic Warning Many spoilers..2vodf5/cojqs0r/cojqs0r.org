Wow, that's interesting. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10286391/1/The-Hills-of-Inaba][I am in the process of writing a P4 fic in which Naoto was born in place of the protanist, and it is she who moves to Inaba for a year.]] I was actually considering posting it here after Chapter 3 is posted, since it has the most rationalist-fic qualities so far.

As a protagonist, Naoto Seta is an introvert with a healthy dose of social anxiety. She is predisposed to think logically about things, and is quite talented academically. Since she is terrible at dealing with other people, she prefers solitude, and loves to read and solve puzzles. As you may guess, her reaction to the Midnight Channel and the incorporeal television screen is not to shrug and think "that was weird. Well, I guess I'll go to bed now" as it is in canon. Her discovery of the Midnight Channel is where the story currently is, as soon as I actually get this chapter posted.
