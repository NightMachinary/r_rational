I have mixed feelings about this. In most cases, I feel that existential dread that comes from the idea of being a copy that's simulated briefly, then deleted, but this story felt surprisingly hopeful. I don't think coming into existence, spending a few hours on an interesting project, then ceasing to exist is necessarily an awful experience. It could even be pleasant, if the conditions are good and the work was something I enjoy doing.
