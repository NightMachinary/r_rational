I believe it would probably be more economical to run personalities that didn't self-destruct through successive educational cycles, as they would presumably get better at their craft the more practice they got, & also would have a proven track record of not self-destructing.

When they finally did, you'd then just use the last iteration, the one that self-destructed, as your labor-force until some other personality reached a higher number of cycles or was performing better by whatever metrics were used to measure value.

I'd also try to keep as many persons around as cost-effective long-term storage allowed for, because they'd each have different strengths, & the quantum randomness of the universe would mean that just because a given personality iteration would suicide most of the times it was run, eventually one would come where it didn't & would move to a higher iteration quantifier.
