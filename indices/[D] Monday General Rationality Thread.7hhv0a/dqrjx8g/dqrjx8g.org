Has anyone mentioned the possibility of training a neural network/reinforcement learning system or whatever on "Twitch plays x" (originally [[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/twitch-plays-pokemon][Pokemon]]) data in real-time? That could be a fun experiment.

Is the computational power there for something like that? What are the potential issues? (Can such systems even work that way? I admit I don't understand machine learning as it is currently done.) Or has something like this already happened and I'm just unaware?
