The main reason I see is to see if you can teach a computer to distinguish "signal" from "noise." In a "twitch plays X" there's generally two competing groups of people, those trying to genuinely play to beat the game and those trying to screw things up for the other group. I'd be interested to see if a neural network or some ML system could learn to distinguish between these groups of inputs and choose "good" actions for itself, given that humans are generally non-random (or even if the inputs are random, it's still possible to "denoise/deblur" if the distribution is learnable). I expect people would, as it learned better "moves," try to deliberately mislead it, which should if the system is set up right lead to it learning "who to trust."

It would be a challenge in online/live ML and probably attract attention to the subject from the layperson, perhaps leading eventually to a greater popular understanding of what real machine learning is actually about and can do, as a contrast to the current view of Skynet, The Matrix etc. People treat AI as a joke or science fiction, which is unfortunate given the probable huge impact it is having and will continue to have on people's lives.
