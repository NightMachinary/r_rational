You got yourself [[http://www.irobot.com/us/][a vacuum cleaner]]? That's nice, I suppose... but what's it got to do with Isaac Asimov? :P

  Ughhh, you're no fun!

No? You've all had fun at my expense, arguing with the crazy person and his old-fashioned ideas of intellectual property. :)

I'll be nice. Just this once. Some of the better stories (in my opinion) are:

- The Ugly Little Boy

- The Bicentennial Man

- The End of Eternity

- Liar!

- The Caves of Steel

... all of which are based on characters who do *ir*rational things for the sake of emotion, rather than rationality.

See ya!
