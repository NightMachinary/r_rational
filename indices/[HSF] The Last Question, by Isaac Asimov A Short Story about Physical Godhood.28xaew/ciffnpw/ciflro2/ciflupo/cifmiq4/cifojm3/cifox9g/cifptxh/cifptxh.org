  If you wrote a book, would you want people giving away free copies on the internet just for the sake of spreading knowledge and appreciating your work? No payment to you or your family. Just free copies of your books for everyone to read and enjoy. Yeah? Sound good?

Yes, actually! Terrific! I've done it before, and I'll do it again, and a lot of people obviously feel the same -- online fiction is basically what this sub is for. Look at [[/r/rational/hot]], or [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/top?sort=top&t=all][/r/rational/top]]; I'm clearly not alone in this opinion.

  That's because Google ranks webpages by the number of other pages which link back to them - and this Multivac.com page gets linked to a lot from reddit. I did try to contact the webmaster of that page once, to see if I could fix the problem at the source, but my email came back with the message: "Delivery to the following recipient failed permanently".

Have you tried contacting the yt account behind [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojEq-tTjcc0][this video]]? Or [[http://web.archive.org/web/www.ecf.utoronto.ca/%7Engn/misc/last.html][this page]]? Or [[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByoueGSWXluVVUtHYnRJVEg4YnM/preview?pli=1][this doc]]? Or [[http://www.swiftgear.com/last_question.html][this page]]? Or [[http://www.thrivenotes.com/the-last-question/][this one]]? Or the university behind [[http://jhu.simon.rochester.edu/public_html/writing-others/last-question.htm][this page]]? Just curious. My point is, if people want to read this story, they'll be able to.

Would it be more acceptable to you if OP had linked to the Wikipedia page, which in turn links to the full text of the story?

Btw, I checked out your sub, and there are two separate comments linking to hosts of Asimov stories just in the most recent thread (from 4 days ago). Are you just removing this particular host of this particular story, or was that negligence on your part? Or do those not count for some reason? Just curious.

Look, I really don't want to get into an argument on the internet. How about we do something cooperative and actually talk about the story, instead of copyright law?
