  I have no idea what "Rational Fiction" is or what "rationalist and deconstructionist or munchkinesque works of fiction" are, or how to discuss a story in that vein.

Fyi, rational fiction is basically fiction where the characters act intelligently and aren't throwing around the Idiot Ball all the time. It's a loose definition, and different people might give you different details, but that's all there is to it. Nbd.

  It's a story. Asimov wrote a clever story with a clever punchline. Lots of people see it as mind-blowing or eye-opening. Some people have even had their religious faith shaken by it. To me, knowing Asimov's works and style... it's just another case of Asimov writing for the sake of a punchline. He did like doing that: he wrote many many short stories which are nothing more than extended jokes (have you read his Azazel stories, for instance?). To me, this is just another one of those stories. The content involves some science-fiction-y stuff, and it's not written for humour, but it's still just a punchline to me. I don't see much to discuss here. He wrote much better stories than this one.

That's exactly what I wanted. No, I haven't read his Azazel stories -- would you recommend them? And what are some of the "much better stories"?
