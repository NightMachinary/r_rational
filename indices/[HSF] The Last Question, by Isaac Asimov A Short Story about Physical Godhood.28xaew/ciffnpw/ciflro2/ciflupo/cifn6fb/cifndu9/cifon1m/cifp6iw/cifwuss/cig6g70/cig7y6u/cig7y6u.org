I'll again take the chance to point out that you could've saved everyone's breath by simply PMing [[/u/eaturbrainz]] with your issue. It would've kept the convo between people who matter, and he could've dealt with it by deleting the thread and PMing OP. But by posting in the comments, you sparked a debate, distracted from the flow of the subreddit, and now nobody will be happy with any result. Please don't take this personally -- just consider this as advice for future copyright campaigns.
