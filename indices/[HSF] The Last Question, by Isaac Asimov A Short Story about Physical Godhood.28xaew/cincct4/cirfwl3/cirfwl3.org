When I read it, I do indeed see Deus ex machina, just like you.

However, I see that it is a story about the potential evolution of technology. Humanity created the Multivac, and then, Multivac improved itself while serving mankind.

It goes beyond that though. In terms of storytelling, I'm trying to remember if I've ever read a work where the entire purpose is to introduce a carefully crafted, meaningful, deus ex machina.

Did I manage to say all that without spoilering too badly?
