  Part of spreading knowledge and appreciation of Asimov's works is having people read them, right?

If you wrote a book, would you want people giving away free copies on the internet just for the sake of spreading knowledge and appreciating your work? No payment to you or your family. Just free copies of your books for everyone to read and enjoy. Yeah? Sound good?

  For some reason, [[/u/Algernon_Asimov]] seems crazy about discouraging the makers of new members for his own subreddit.

Maybe that's not my priority at all. Maybe my priority is more focused on giving a shit about what Isaac Asimov actually wanted - and /stated/ that he wanted - for all royalties from his works to continue to go to his family even after he died.

  Well, the fact remains that if you google "the last question" -- just like that, nothing special -- the link in OP is the actual first result.

That's because Google ranks webpages by the number of other pages which link back to them - and this Multivac.com page gets linked to /a lot/ from reddit. I did try to contact the webmaster of that page once, to see if I could fix the problem at the source, but my email came back with the message: "Delivery to the following recipient failed permanently".
