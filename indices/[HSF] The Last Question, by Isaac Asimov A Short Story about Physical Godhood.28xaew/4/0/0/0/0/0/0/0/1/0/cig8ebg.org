  So you do admit you're fighting a losing battle?

As I said, I may be crazy, but I'm not /stupid/! I know that popular opinion is against me. I know that many people want the freedom to distribute all art works for free without ever paying the creators of those works. I'm not blind.

  I was personally inviting you to offer your point of view on this veritable classic of the genre.

And I was subtly and politely /turning down/ your invitation. I have no idea what "Rational Fiction" is or what "rationalist and deconstructionist or munchkinesque works of fiction" are, or how to discuss a story in that vein. I have absolutely no idea what you want from me regarding that. It's a story. Asimov wrote a clever story with a clever punchline. Lots of people see it as mind-blowing or eye-opening. Some people have even had their religious faith shaken by it. To me, knowing Asimov's works and style... it's just another case of Asimov writing for the sake of a punchline. He did like doing that: he wrote many many short stories which are nothing more than extended jokes (have you read his Azazel stories, for instance?). To me, this is just another one of those stories. The content involves some science-fiction-y stuff, and it's not written for humour, but it's still just a punchline to me. I don't see much to discuss here. He wrote much better stories than this one.
