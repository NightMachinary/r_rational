  No, I haven't read his Azazel stories -- would you recommend them?
#+end_quote

Not if you're into rationalist fiction. They're light humour, written in the style of P.G. Wodehouse. Azazel is a small demon/alien (depending on which story you read) who grants wishes using his magical/scientific powers, but in ways that always cause disaster.

  And what are some of the "much better stories"?

/Now/ who's de-railing the thread? :P

Aren't you here to discuss /this/ story as a piece of rationalist fiction? If you want recommendations of other works by an author, you should go to [[/r/Books]] or [[/r/PrintSF]], or even a subreddit devoted to the author you're interested in (there [[http://www.reddit.com/r/heinlein][are]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/arthurcclarke][a]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/marktwain][few]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/Bradbury][out]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/vonnegut][there]]).
