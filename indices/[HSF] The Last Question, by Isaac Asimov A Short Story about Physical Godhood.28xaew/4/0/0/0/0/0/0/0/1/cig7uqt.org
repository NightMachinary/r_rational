  I may be crazy and old-fashioned, but I'm not stupid! Even I know I can't take on the whole internet. I've even given up checking every single time that someone on reddit links to The Last Question. I only focus on the submissions now (like this one), not the comments.

So you do admit you're fighting a losing battle?

  I haven't stopped anyone from talking about the story. You're the one arguing with me about copyright: I was discussing this with the moderator when you butted in, uninvited.

Actually, you're the one arguing with me about copyright: I was offering my advice to my friend [[/u/eaturbrainz]], as the annoyingly involved former moderator of this subreddit, when you butted in uninvited. If you'd really wanted to have a 1-on-1 conversation with a moderator, you would've used the private messaging feature. Which I do recommend in the future, by the way -- see [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/28xaew/hsf_the_last_question_by_isaac_asimov_a_short/cig7y6u?context=1][here]].

  If you want to talk about the story, go for it!

You misunderstand -- I was /personally inviting/ you to offer your point of view on this veritable classic of the genre. And the offer still stands! I'd love to hear what an Asimov expert such as yourself thinks. :)
