  or was that negligence on your part?
#+end_quote

Negligence. Thanks for pointing those out. I've removed one of them. However [[http://www.reddit.com/r/asimov/comments/28lbpb/read_the_last_question_mind_blown_thoughts_just/cicfiy7][this link to the BBC radio play]] is okay. The BBC would have paid Asimov for using the story, and the BBC collects a licence fees from its listeners to make those payments. Asimov isn't losing anything from those recordings - they've been paid for.

  Have you tried contacting the yt account behind this video? Or this page? Or this doc? Or this page? Or this one? Or the university behind this page?

I may be crazy and old-fashioned, but I'm not /stupid/! Even I know I can't take on the whole internet. I've even given up checking [[https://www.google.com/search?as_q=&as_epq=%22the+last+question%22&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=reddit.com][/every single time/ that someone on reddit links to The Last Question]]. I only focus on the submissions now (like this one), not the comments.

  How about we do something cooperative and actually talk about the story, instead of copyright law?

I haven't stopped anyone from talking about the story. You're the one arguing with me about copyright: I was discussing this with the moderator when you butted in, uninvited. If you want to talk about the story, go for it!
