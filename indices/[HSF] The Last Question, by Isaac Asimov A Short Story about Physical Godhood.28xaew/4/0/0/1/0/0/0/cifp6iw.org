  I don't think you really believe this either, at least for the reason you stated.

That's nice. I'm glad you know my mind better than I do. Why do you bother to reply and ask me questions, then, if you already know what I think?

#+begin_quote
  Would you agree with an author who wanted all copies of his work destroyed on his death? Would you then consider preserving a copy of that work immoral?
#+end_quote

I suppose I'd have to. There are works which are temporary anyway, like ice sculptures or dance performances. I don't have the right to keep something which isn't mine. I would dislike it a lot, but I would have to respect the author's wishes in this.

#+begin_quote
  How about if the author does not want to let you convert formats - an act you have already claimed you find no moral issue with?
#+end_quote

Tough luck. The author sold their work to me. It's mine now, to do with as I please (as long as I don't give or sell it to someone else).

#+begin_quote
  Why do you believe what you believe?
#+end_quote

Because I think it is right and fair and proper that an artist should get paid for their work, just like everyone else who makes something to sell to other people. Pirating and giving away free copies of books or music or movies (or whatever) takes away that right and fair and proper payment.

Some artists happily and freely choose to forgo that entitlement. There are musicians and writers who will give away their works. And, that's their prerogative. Isaac Asimov did not. He requested and required payment for his work. And, not only did he want if for himself, he wanted to keep the payments going for his family after his death - which is his prerogative. So, as well as it being wrong to withhold the rightful payment, this is compounded in this case by going against the writer's wishes.

/EDIT: P.S. Let me turn this back on you. Why do you think it's okay to give away someone else's creative work for free, against their stated wishes? What's the rational moral argument in favour of that?/
