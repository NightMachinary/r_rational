See, you don't even realize that what you are saying is not internally consistent. You hold one sentence that the right of an author to have all copies of his work destroyed is absolute, and then in the next deny that right if the author has sold that work.

Why can you do whatever you want at that point apart from your oddly specific restrictions? It can't be the law alone, the law also applies other restrictions to a work which you do not mention here, such as moral rights in the case of an artist, but even those do not extend to destruction of the work.

In this case, the author has been payed for his work. I payed for my copy. If I then loan that copy to a friend, by your definition I have committed an immoral act.

In fact, under your definition of copyright, libraries are dens of depravity desperately distributing deplorable dissertations.

As to my moral code, I prefer to have an internally consistent one. That an author or inventor, what I will call a "creator" can maintain profit from his creation for a set amount of time is logical. It encourages creation. 20 year terms or similar are eminently rational.

His heirs on the other hand had no hand in that creation, they merely exist with a portion of his genes. They have no more inherent right to future profits from the work than anyone else. This doesn't change simply because someone has an opinion. They are of course entitled to whatever already existing money he has.

The existence of effectively indefinite period for copyright and trademarks is actually in most cases mitigating creation of new entertainment or inventions, especially in the software and bio science spheres. This runs counter to the whole reason for having a copyright schema in the first place.

My terminal value is not "authorial intent". Creators are to be commended, but they are not Gods. Their creations, especially after their deaths, belong to all of humanity. Another page in our long, long story.

And after they have had their reward for adding to the collective history of humanity, we will thank them, but not blindly obey all of their wishes.

I'm not going to justify all piracy. I'm not going to yell from the rafters about how all information should be free. But this is just a story. An old story, a good story, but just a story.

All we are is stories. We communicate by sharing stories. That's what humans do. We just have much better ways of doing it now, with basically no cost. Few industries have adapted to this so far. I doubt it is going to stop happening any time soon.
