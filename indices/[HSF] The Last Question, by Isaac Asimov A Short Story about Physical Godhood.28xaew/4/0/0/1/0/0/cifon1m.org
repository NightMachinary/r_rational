I understand where you are coming from, but I do not entirely agree with your reasoning. That he wished his work to be profitable for a century does not by itself make it moral. I don't think you really believe this either, at least for the reason you stated.

"Because the author wanted x to happen " is pretty clearly not the real metric you are using to judge the morality of this action. This is clear when you simply think about other things the author might intend about their work. Would you agree with an author who wanted all copies of his work destroyed on his death? Would you then consider preserving a copy of that work immoral? How about if the author does not want to let you convert formats - an act you have already claimed you find no moral issue with?

That is the least egregious example, I could think of several more immoral ones, but it makes my point. You have a different reason for finding this act immoral. I therefore ask you the basic question of rationality : Why do you believe what you believe?
