Well, see that's the thing -- part of the subreddit flow is /letting it flow/, and deleting comments goes against that. But you obviously missed that part of How-to-Build-a-Community 101, seeing your copyright Nazism and subsequent dead sub ... so I'll cut you some slack. Just consider my advice in the future: Bring up your issue with the mods, and let them discipline OP.
