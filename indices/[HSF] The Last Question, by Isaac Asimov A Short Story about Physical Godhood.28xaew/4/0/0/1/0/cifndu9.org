  and more 'not seeing the point to a 95 year copyright term which prevents you from even so much as converting the format of a work you have purchased'.

This OP goes a lot further than merely "converting the format of a work you have purchased" - it's publishing the converted format for others to copy and read. Distributing the work without paying the creator (or his beneficiaries).

I have no moral qualms about copying a work you've purchased into a different format. I've got lots of MP3 files which I've ripped from CDs that I bought. And, if there was an easy way to convert a printed book into an ebook format, I'd readily convert my print books. I bought the work, paid the artist and all the people involved in its production, and I'm entitled to fair use of it. Me. Not hundreds of random people who did /not/ pay the artist in any way.

  That something is against a law doesn't make it immoral or even logical.

On the other hand, just because you personally disagree with a law that doesn't make it immoral, either. Some laws actually do reflect morality. And, in this case, Isaac Asimov deliberately renewed all copyrights on his stories until the day he died, so that his family would continue to benefit from his work (he wrote this in his autobiography). He wanted to provide for his family even after his death. Therefore, to pirate his works and publish them is to go against his stated wishes - and that makes it immoral.

If an artist were to allow free copies of their work to be made, even while the copyright still existed, then it would not be immoral to make those free copies.

I'm not basing my idea of morality simply on legislation, but on the author's stated wishes, and his actions in renewing his copyrights.
