It's less 'not wanting to pay for copyrighted works' (I own a compilation of his short stories which has this in it) and more 'not seeing the point to a 95 year copyright term which prevents you from even so much as converting the format of a work you have purchased'.

A short term copyright which allows the creator of a work to actually benefit from it is a good idea. There is no logical reason, however, for that copyright to extend almost a century. The original idea has been twisted, mostly by those seeking profit through distribution and not even the original creators of the works.

There are still laws on the books in some areas against riding bicycles in swimming pools. That something is against a law doesn't make it immoral or even logical.
