Isaac Asimov was /very/ fastidious about renewing the copyright on /all/ of his stories, [[http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#starters3][right up to the time he died]].

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States][According to US law]], the copyright on 'The Last Question' won't expire until 2051, 95 years after the story was first published.

There is only [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_(Asimov_short_story)][/one/ story of Asimov's which is out of copyright]], because Asimov missed renewing its copyright - and it's /not/ 'The Last Question'.
