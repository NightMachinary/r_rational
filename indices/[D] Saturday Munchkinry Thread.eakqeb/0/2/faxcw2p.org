- Combat: useless. It's worse than a gun; I guess you can create ice inside people's mouth/nostrils so they suffocate from a distance so I guess you could be an assassin. But seriously just use a modern sniper rifle, this power requires you to be within 20 metres whereas you can get kilometres+range with modern weapons that aren't even guided.

- Money: Example options:

- Do some training in health & safety & become extremely highly paid for your work in colonising Antarctica

- Become a performing bartender (combining art with drinks mixing) - work in a high quality establishment (eg. michelin star or something)

- This power essentially doubles the power output of your body for free. You can use the ice to make a LOT of personal conveniences such as exoskeletal limbs which make movement easier, if you can lift yourself you can fly etc. So it's a pretty arbitrary power, but again, all that stuff is just convenience. Also requires that you're covered in or on ice so you'd need some kind of heating tech.

- Regardless of what you do, you're gonna need some kind of support, both legal and possibly military. Likely you wouldn't be able to do /anything at all/ obvious because drawing any attention could draw the attention of spy agencies or whatever, and they might be hostile, in the sense that your very existence with this power could spark global war. Not an /incredibly/ likely possibility, but something you'd want to be aware of.

  For money, my genuine "Level 1 Intelligence" solution would be to go to a local law firm and see if they'd act as my agent.

  I expect that they'd be able to line up a bunch of mundane work in construction or heavy industry that would amount to "use your magic ice powers to move that broken, high-voltage line to safety."

Very sensible, but even before that you'd need to have reasonable confidence that, should some hostile organisation (even up to a nation-state) take an interest in you, you'd have some defense against that. Your personal power, regardless of how hard you munchkin is never going to be enough - you need another nation-state or entity with similar resources that is going to be able to defend your right to exist as a free person.
