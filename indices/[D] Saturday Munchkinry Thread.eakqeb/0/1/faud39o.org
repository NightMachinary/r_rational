One combat trick would be to accelerate little bits of ice until they're going really, really fast.

A .308 Winchester round has about 2500 foot-pounds of energy. So, if I can push on my "ice bullets" for 20', it will take 125lbs of force to get them up to rifle speeds. That's basically a rail gun.

Alternately, I could swirl the bullets around myself like I'm using a sling. That lets me get them up to speed with much, much less energy.

I could also create an ice disk (or ice chariot) to fly on, and just leave combat, or just drop cubic meters of snow / ice on people, both if which would get pretty fatal.

For money, my genuine "Level 1 Intelligence" solution would be to go to a local law firm and see if they'd act as my agent.

I expect that they'd be able to line up a bunch of mundane work in construction or heavy industry that would amount to "use your magic ice powers to move that broken, high-voltage line to safety."
