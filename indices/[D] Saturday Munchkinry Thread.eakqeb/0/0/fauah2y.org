- Small ice bullets. F=MA, since M is super small A will be really high.

- flying disk, or ice packs strapped to boots/limbs

- power breaks conservation of energy, so there's probably an infinite energy exploit somewhere

- exercise a lot, since power is directly proportional to how physically strong I am

- testing to determine how small a particle of ice I can control. there's probably all sorts of fun exploits if it's small enough, but the obvious one is nanoscale assembly

- if someone's got a shield or something, cover the bubble in opaque ice flakes to disable them

- power generalizes to a form of telekinesis, since you can use crushed ice to form pseudo-hands. you can control anything that's not hot this way

- assassination by mixing ice with other substances (easy delivery method, untraceable, and everyone will think someone with poison powers did it)

- test whether "line of sight" includes things like cameras, windows, etc. if it doesn't, figure out why air works but those don't
