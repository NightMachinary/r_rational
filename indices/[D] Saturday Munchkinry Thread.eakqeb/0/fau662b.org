Ok, say you have the ability to move and shape a cubic meter of snow/ice and the ability to generate about a fourth of that every five seconds via a line of sight cone with a range of 20 meters. You can only either make ice or control it, neither at the same time. the force you can put in to move/shape ice is the same amount of force your physical body could produce to move things normally.

How would you best use this ability in combat and to make money?

Edit: additional power details based on responses\\
You don't get tactile feedback from ice, so unless you have a microscope and some really good focus small ice particles wouldn't be able to be used for anything complex.

I'll expand upon the ice creation power, it's a breath attack, a kind of blue flame that eats air and forms ice onto solid matter while lowering the temperature.
