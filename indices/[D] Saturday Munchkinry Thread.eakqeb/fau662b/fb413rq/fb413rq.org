You are teleported to a far-flung fantasy realm. All you have on you is the clothes you're wearing, and anything in your pockets.

However, you have one link back to Earth: a black tablet computer, with an inexhaustible battery. Aside from its touchscreen, the device is perfectly featureless and seamless. It has no ports or vents, no camera, nor any way to access or remove the battery. It is a solid lump of sleek plastic.

The tablet has a single app: an internet browser, that appears to connect to Earth's internet. This connection is comfortably fast, and 100% reliable. However, the only site it can access is Reddit, and then only a single subreddit: [[/r/818296][r/818296]]. You are the mod of this sub, and your account name is [[/u/818297][u/818297]]. The subreddit is set to private - only you can post links. This cannot be changed.

Furthermore, any links leading outside your subreddit do not work. Images and videos consistently fail to load. This appears to only happen for you - everyone else looking in on your subreddit can follow links and view videos and images just fine. Most of these people are coming to your subreddit from links being dumped in other random subreddits, supposedly by your account. These visitors have no idea what your subreddit is about, at first.

None of the locals in the fantasy world you're stranded in can see what's on your tablet. To them, the screen appears like the rest of the tablet's black plastic - blank and featureless. Further, the screen does not appear to emit any light, no matter how bright its contents are. It is unclear how you're able to view the screen's contents.

How do you make use of this connection to Earth, to aid in your survival?
