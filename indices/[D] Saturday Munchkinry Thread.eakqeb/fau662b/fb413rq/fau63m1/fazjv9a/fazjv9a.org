[Reverse Munchkin] A Hive mind entity is capable of taking over dead bodies. It is also capable of taking over living bodies but the consciousness within can fight them so, optimally, dead bodies.

This Hive mind has the capability to send its people through time via FTL that is commonplace in setting. The only thing stopping causality breaking completely is a complicated series of laws for inter-stellar navigation, the suppression of the knowledge that FTL=TT, a police force to enforce these laws, and an extra dimension or two for time to fit all the extra universe in.

The Hive mind can only spread information to itself "in person" though. Signals still travel at c, and are ElectroMagnetic in nature, but you can't spread information to alternate histories or back in time without going there first.

The entity is bloodborne and needs to be able to maintain body pressure. Wounds causing massive loss of blood are fatal to that body, but the blood is still infectious and awake. The entity does not require a nervous system, and the only way to tell them apart from humans for sure is the lack of neural activity. The entity is capable of being quite personable.

The Hive entity is bent on "Temporal Anarchy" in that everything should play out as close to "natural" as possible. This is obviously bad because we die. The entity is hippocritical though and does not realise it. Think of it as an AI where ("This History" - "My home history")**2 is your cost function. It is very much a non-human mind.

Going back in time creates new histories rather than overwriting anything, and once you leave a timeline you can go back but Bill and Ted Rules apply. (San Deemas Time, TV Tropes) Time will have passed then as it has passed now.

Your resources:

-A similar entity that, for moral reasons will only inhabit one body at a time and requires permission from the previous occupant. The utility function for this entity is essentially Prefferential Utilitarianism but it understands it can be wrong sometimes and will usually accept advice from you. When one body dies this entity uses technology to send a signal out and using that as a beacon, sends another iteration of itself in to replace it.

-The ability to time travel yourself

-The ability to manipulate EM fields pretty much as precisely as Heisenberg will allow with the power output of a small nuclear power plant. Power requirements scale exponentially with precision.

-Hard Sci-fi weaponry. Think handheld railguns, bullets that break skin but not metal, shockthrowers.

How do we kill it? Or prevent it from enacting its goals permanently?

(For ease of chat, the badguy hive mind can be called N and the goodguy hive mind can be called H)
