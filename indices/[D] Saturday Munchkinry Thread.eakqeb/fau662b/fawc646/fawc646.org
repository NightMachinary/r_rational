Depending on the precision of the control, ice sculpting could be a viable business. Without the need for tools, you could churn out high-quality sculptures to sell.

The ice itself could also be a viable product, depending on its purity. 100% pure ice, and the subsequent pure water, could have some use in scientific areas.

Speaking of science, as with any superpower (and depending on the structure of society), you could sell your time to researchers to research your supernatural power.

The temperature manipulation might be useful in cooking, or hand-done metalworking, or anything else that involves lowering the temperature.

The "eating air" part could also be exploited. If that means "destruction of air", then it could be used as a substance disposal method. Grind up radioactive waste into dust, spread it out on an airtight space, then have you breathe on it to solve one of the major problems with nuclear reactors.

In terms of combat, there's the obvious "freeze your enemies to death" route, or even "freeze their blood then rip it out of them". Else, turn the ice into needles and shove them into people. Or trick them into eating shaved ice or something and mess up their insides.
