You still have to hold the other end of the string. So, sling-speeds & sling bullets will take sling levels of force.

But, to explore the idea, a .308 Winchester bullet weighs 10g (0.01 kg), and has a muzzle velocity of around 900m/s. If I swing it in a circles with a radius of 2m, then I need a centripetal force of about 405 N.

Converting back to Freedom Units, that's a force of 91 lbs.

But, having done all this, I'm realizing that my math is silly, since if you can do 91lbs of force over a distance, then you can just railgun the bullet directly
