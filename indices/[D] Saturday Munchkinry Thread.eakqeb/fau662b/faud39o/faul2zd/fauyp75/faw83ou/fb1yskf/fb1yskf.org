That's a fantastic combo! Carry around some cable and create the center pillar of ice as needed to set up anywhere.

That being said it's not super useful: the set up, spin up, and low arc of fire are pretty limiting. It's essentially a terrible anti-materiel rifle you don't have to carry and have unlimited ammo for.
