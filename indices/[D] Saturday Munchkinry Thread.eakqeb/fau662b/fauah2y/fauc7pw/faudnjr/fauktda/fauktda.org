Nanoscale assembly isn't something you use in combat.

I don't know very much about current nanofactory efforts, but I'd bet that someone capable of quickly assembling prototypes would be invaluable to the people researching that stuff. High end scientific equipment is /expensive/ (like millions of dollars expensive) and I'm sure you could convince a big company to pay you gobs of money to sit in a lab and stick atoms together. And under those circumstances, having high-end microscopes isn't a big deal.
