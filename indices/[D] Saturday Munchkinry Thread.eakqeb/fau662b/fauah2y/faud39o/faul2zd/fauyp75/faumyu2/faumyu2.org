  In a sling, you get the radius-maintenance force for free because of the string.

I think you're probably right about that, so my solution is "sawblade with attached marbles above head." But then, my intuition is that ice's tensile strength isn't super great, so the blade might break before it got up to speed.

  So, if I can push on my "ice bullets" for 20', it will take 125lbs of force to get them up to rifle speeds. That's basically a rail gun.

How about a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-gas_gun][light gas gun?]] Instead of an explosion, you'd cause the ice cylinder to expand and leave a vacuum inside. The atmosphere only gives 14lbs of pressure, so you'd need the piston's surface area to be 10x the bullet's, but that's easy. You could go 20-30x and reduce the length of the gun... or increase its final velocity!

Edit: You could also add your power to the piston, but the main trick here is that expanding the vacuum inside the main chamber allows you to do all the work for the bullet over a longer period of time. The other thing is, you'd best leave a little bit of gas in the chamber so it can efficiently transfer the energy to the bullet. Pure vacuum wouldn't work as well, unless you took your ice gun and stuck it right against the thing you wanted to destroy. Could use it for breaching walls, for example.
