Couldn't you use an actual sling? The munchkiny part of this is that you can apply the acceleration regardless of the speed and current location of the ice. You could put a block of ice in some container, attach it to a strong cable that's clipped to a pole and rotate it in a circle until you hit insane speeds before releasing it to fly off and hit your target. You could use a counterweight, or even a second block of ice, at the other end of the cable to reach higher speeds.
