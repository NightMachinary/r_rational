It really depends on how far you are able to stretch the definition of ice, since there are over a dozen theoretical varies that can be made using different pressures and temperatures, so you could probably get up to some shenanigans with prepressurized materials and such In constructs, there's also the option to have ice form as a bose Einstein condensate so that can get really wacky really quick. And probably some shenanigans from fractal patterns in ice all the way down to the molecules or quarks or other extreme microstructures
