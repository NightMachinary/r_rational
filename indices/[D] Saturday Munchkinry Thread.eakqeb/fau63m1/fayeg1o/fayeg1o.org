Hah, child's play. He solves it with acausal trade.

He already precommitted to helping an AI come to power in the future and helping usher in its post-scarcity future. In counterfactual worlds (which by their nature are simulated and thus the AI has the capability to act), the AI comes in and saves him. It's a reverse Roko's Basilisk.

This does very little in the event that Eliezer is trapped in the one true /real/ world, but considering the overwhelming probability that we're in a simulation, he should be fine.

If the AI truly wanted to be efficient, it would make sure that it's intervention didn't impact the rest of the simulation so it could continue running. Perhaps at the moment of his death, the AI could come in and whisk his consciousness away to some partition where it could have endless happiness forever. Truly, the only thing that Eliezer has to do is precommit to consenting to this salvation.
