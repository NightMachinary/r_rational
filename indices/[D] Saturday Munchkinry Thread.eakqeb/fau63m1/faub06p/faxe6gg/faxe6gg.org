Just in case though, he should be carefully experimenting with planting acorns (just in case he has to wait a while); making sure to plant each one with all of:

- In a different location
- in different soil
- using different materials as fertiliser
- Using /everything he knows/ about plants to hopefully make them grow (for example, does singing to plants actually encourage them to grow? This is his opportunity to test this theory)
- Practice swimming in a maximally energetically-efficient way in order to find algae/seaweed, which can potentially be food both for him and plants.
- Always keep an eye out for animals that may approach the island
- Perhaps early on, make a spear. Spears are incredibly useful; people can fish with spears, you can lean on it if you get tired, and in the case your only food option comes to be a shark or something you have a potential weapon to catch it.

A lot more preparations you could do, but yeah. You can't just assume the owner is going to come around soon - he might have forgotten about the island or even specifically wanting to test to see whether Eliezer Yudkowsky can escape by himself.

A further note: thinking is energetically expensive too, and you have extremely limited food. Just slowly and carefully doing one of the first things that come to mind until you get better ideas seems like a good way to start.

Edit: Oh and /whatever he does/ he should not burn that copy of GEB unless it's literally life or death.
