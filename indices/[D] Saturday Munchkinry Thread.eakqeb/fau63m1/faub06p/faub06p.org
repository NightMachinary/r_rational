Food source: acorn bread.

- Make a bowl out of wood.
- Fill the bowl with clean seawater.
- Gather acorns, shell them, and place them in the bowl. Leave for a while to leech out tanins, occasionally replacing the water to maintain a high concentration gradient.
- Drain out the water, and grind into flour. Make a dough.
- Burn some wood, and cook the bread. It'll be bitter and flat and salty, but it's food.

If he can't grind them into flour or make fire (to preserve wood supply), he should just eat the acorns as-is. They won't be very tasty, but he will die later.

If there's an oak tree on the island, but only one, and there's no other vegetation... this island is definitely geoengineered, and recently, so he should just survive until the owner comes 'round for a visit.
