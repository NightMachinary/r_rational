small Ward spoilers. Can't figure out why spoiler tags aren't working

[[#s][If I were a cape drawing on the same shard as Contessa power, and my trigger vision tells me a story on what would happen if I didn't exist; having perfect precognition but instead of Contessa's Blind Spots, the only blind spot is myself...\\
In other words, if I were a worm reader that got isekai'd into the worm world...\\
(also assuming that the Simurgh didn't use me in her plots, because that would mess up everything)]]

[[#s][1. Join Cauldron.\\
2. Ensure Aegis doesn't get killed by Leviathan. We'll need his power. Just in case he does get killed, get Yamada to talk to Glaistig Ueniae early, and make sure she's around whenever Aegis is in danger. If needed, awaken within her the ability to create Shard Clones.\\
3. Get Cauldron, during the Slaughterhouse 9 arc, to capture Bonesaw and convince her to be good. Also, warn Cauldron about 'David and Goliath' (Eidolon and his opponents), just because.\\
4. Make sure Oliver doesn't make it back to Aleph, or ensure we can grab him with Doormaker when we need him.\\
5. Train Aegis and Oliver to talk to Scion, manipulate his human side.\\
6. At some point, once I consider the world ready, get Bonesaw to combine Oliver and Aegis into a gestalt being. Aegis's power should be uniquely suited to dealing with Bonesaw's modifications without rejecting them, allowing for crazy tinkertech additions. If necessary, Bonesaw could teach Dragon to do biotinkering as well.\\
7. Aegis/Oliver approach Scion, and convince him to begin a new kind of Cycle. If they succeed, the world is saved. We can design a utopian future that projects humanity into the stars, and eventually humanity can become the collective Thinker in a new Entity Pair.\\
8. If they fail and Scion does Gold Morning, then get Panacea to break Aegis/Oliver (just like she did to Taylor) and fight scion straight up. His power is adapting his own body to stay physically effective, but it (I think) also works on mind attacks so his jail broken power should be pretty costly/slow for Scion to destroy. If I think it's necessary, I could get Bonesaw to graft Perdition onto the gestalt as well.\\
9. If that doesn't work, I can probably pull off a backup plan by teaming Scapegoat, Panacea, and a duplicator cape (Spawn or Furcate, preferably) along with Yangban-Null (power sharing), Yangban-Two (power magnifying) and any power-granting Trump (Teacher preferably).]]

[[#s][I'd probably also pull some real bullshit by teaming up Teacher, Noelle, and Valefor (or some other mind-altering Master). Together, they can clone key capes and keep the clones from being /too/ evil.\\
If the Mind-Altering Master doesn't end up being enough, Dragon can learn brain surgery from Bonesaw.]]
