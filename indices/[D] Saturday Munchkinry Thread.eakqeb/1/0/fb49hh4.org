I probably don't use the tablet, at least not socially. If I've determined that the tablet can only be used to access text data from a practically abandoned private subreddit in a world that doesn't share the same geography or even necessarily the same rules of physics, there's not much use in the tablet from a social perspective. Being in a far-flung fantasy realm, my best bet is to start learning about the things that don't work as I would normally expect, like magic (if applicable). If I can just one day show up in this weird realm, perhaps I can also learn how to get back.

About the only use I'd have for the tablet is as a way to make searchable notes. When doing experiments, I could log my results in the tablet and use it as a searchable reference. I could also copy other useful documents I come across that I'd like to be able to keep in a convenient and searchable format.
