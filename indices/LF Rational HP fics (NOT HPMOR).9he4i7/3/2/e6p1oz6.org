This thread was the first I'd heard of it. 21 chapters in, just finished the "big" interlude, and wanted to add my support and desire for more! If it helps at all with the anxiety, I (and I think probably a lot of others) don't care nearly as much about regularity of updates as about reading a good story. And this is a very good story.
