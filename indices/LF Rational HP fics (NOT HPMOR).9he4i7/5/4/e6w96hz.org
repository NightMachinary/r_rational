  I remember a lot of talk a while back about Horry Patter and the Philologer's Stone, but it's not really rational. Like, at all.

I /heavily/ disagree with this statement. We just haven't reached the part where 'Horry' is properly introduced to magic yet. And even still he's made great starts, such as copying parts of his self-book. Take this excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  A portal appears across from Lucas, "/Oblivius/, expedited ceritificate. /Now/,"

  Lucas rolls his eyes and points the wand through the portal, "/Oblivius/," he says. The portal closes with a 'pop'.

  The speaker on his desk chimes, "/You are in mortal peril in two seconds/,"

  /What?!/

  A thundercrack, and the old man stands across from him, eye blazing blue. Another small portal opens, and the brilliant glow diminishes.

  "/Oblivius/, standard certificate," says the him on the other side. A speaker on the other side says something imperceptible.

  "Immediately," the other him says, again.

  Lucas looks past the portal at Alvin, and raises an eyebrow. "/Oblivius/," he says, pointing his wand towards the portal, and it slams shut.

  Alvin watches Lucas, silent. Then, "You're too clever for you own good, Lucas,"

  Lucas eyes the threat assessments blaring in red all across Britain to his right. Six...seven...eight...all eight locations?

  "Can...I help you, Alvin?"

  "Burning the candle at all available ends, it would appear. For how many years now? Ten? Twenty?"
