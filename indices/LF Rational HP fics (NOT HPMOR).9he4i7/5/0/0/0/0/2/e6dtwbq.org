  Friendo, if you're on here to sneer at rational fiction, you're gonna have a bad time. Just a word of warning.

That doesn't really come off well at all. He's making some pretty reasonable criticism, and you sound like you're making some sort of threat.

  I'll admit, I'm getting a wee bit creeped out by how you're ascribing sexual pleasure to this stuff.

See below, "masturbatory" in this case is just a way to say it's very self-indulgent. Equivalent to calling it a self-insert Mary Sue/Gary Stu power fantasy or something like that. I think it's justified IMHO in HPMOR as it was the first time it was done that way, and in itself it provided a hilarious subversion of the canon - not to mention, being overconfident is actually an established in-universe flaw of Harry Potter-Evans-Verres. However I can see how it would quickly get old. In a way, when things go /too/ easy for the "rational" protagonist it feels like it contradicts the same thing Lucius said to Draco in HPMOR: super-complicated plans never work, because there's too many factors that you just can't control, no matter how clever you are. So even in a ratfic, it can break suspension of disbelief to see a protagonist just outperform everyone else all the time and crack in a few months systems that had resisted centuries of study.
