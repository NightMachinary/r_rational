[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][*The Arithmancer*]] is a good read, though not strictly rational. It focuses on Hermione, who in this fic has an eidetic memory and a love of maths, and delves deeply into (obviously) arithmancy and spell creation. The book goes through years 1-4 in Hogwarts. I enjoyed it more than its sequel, Lady Archemedes (covering years 5-7), which I didn't actually finish... though looking online I think I just got to the end and never went back, as it's now finished. I might do so at some point...

I remember a lot of talk a while back about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717474/1/Horry-Patter-and-the-Philologer-s-Stone][*Horry Patter and the Philologer's Stone*]], but it's not really rational. Like, at all. But it appeals to a lot of readers on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] (somewhat like how Unsong does, I think) so it might appeal to you too. I'm not up to date on it, but it basically sets up the world of HP as an alternate timeline where everything is slightly, uncomfortably, /off/. Don't get confused by the character names when you're reading - they are definitely different people than the normal HP timeline, and the seemingly annoying changes to the spellings are that way for a reason.

And [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][*Significant Digits*]] is the unofficial (but endorsed by Eliezer Yudkowsky) sequel to HPMOR if you haven't read it yet.

Finally, I second the other recommendations for Harry Potter and the Natural 20. It's highly amusing if you have any fondness for D&D. It's also unfinished, though; we've had, what, one update in the past three years? So be warned of that.
