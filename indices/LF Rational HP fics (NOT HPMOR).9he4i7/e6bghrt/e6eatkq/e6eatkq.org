I have to give an anti-recommendation for this one. As stated it has a "ruthless" protagonist, which in this story translates to edgy with a really slapdash tragic start.

If I hadn't seen it here the premise alone, of an emotionally-abused-by-Lily-and-James Harry with a spoiled twin who defeated the dark lord, has enough red flags to make me drop it. The first tragic event happens before I can connect to anyone and falls completely flat. Later I find that "ruthless" means he casually casts dark magic on people for little more than the pleasure it provides?

I'm having a lot of trouble connecting with anything in this story and given how the first few conflicts were handled it seems to have at least an order of magnitude more "self-sure mary sue wankery" than HPMOR.
