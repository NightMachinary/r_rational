[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] is a great fic centered on a Slytherin!Hermione. Includes psychologically realistic development, a smart/competent but not overpowered protagonist, and a sufficiently "agenty" cast that it doesn't feel as if the protagonist's actions alone are driving the narrative.
