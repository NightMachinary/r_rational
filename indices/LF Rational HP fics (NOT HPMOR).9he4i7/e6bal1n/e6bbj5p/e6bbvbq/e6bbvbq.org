Hmmm, it definitely has mystique but to me it felt more like "The Magicians" than "Harry Potter," despite the obvious HP setting and influence. Rather than magic feeling mysterious and cool and amazing, it felt like magic was powerful and fearful and dangerous. It felt like a disaster was always looming just out of sight, and things would come crashing down at any moment. It's a sign of good writing that it inspired that uneasiness in me, but it was definitely a different feeling than when I read HP for the first time!
