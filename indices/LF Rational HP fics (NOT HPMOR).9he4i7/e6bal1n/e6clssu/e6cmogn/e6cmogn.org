That's... nowhere close to the word I'd use to describe the series. I disliked the series as it went on because Hermione seemed to become a Mary Sue who could do no wrong. Exploring the magical world and making sense of its rules? I loved it. Mastering those rules when convenient and becoming an overpowered shounen protagonist? Eh... not appealing to me.
