Some anecdotal data for you: When I do programming, I find the environment very distracting. What helps me is having headphones that block out sound ("closed" headphones that cover the entire ear) and playing pink noise (for high-focus tasks, designing/problem-solving) or voice-less music (for medium-focus tasks, implementation).
