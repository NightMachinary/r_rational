For example, I currently have two and a half devices to type with: A Thinkpad laptop, an iPhone with a touchscreen keyboard, and an iPhone with a (folding) full-size Bluetooth keyboard. Should I look into some other input device?

Or: Is there some aspect of nutrition or hydration that I should pay more attention to?

Or: How significant is the audio environment? Should I pick a particular soundscape or playlist and hook up the headphones, or would there be minimal effect compared to a library's shuffling or coffeeshop's satellite radio?

Or: Would turning off my connection to the internet, save when I'm looking up some reference, be useful or annoying?
