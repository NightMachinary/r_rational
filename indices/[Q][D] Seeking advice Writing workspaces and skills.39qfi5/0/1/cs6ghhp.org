  Scrivener ... free trial

My primary OS these days is Linux, so I have the free beta available to me. Not sure I want to start writing SI on it, and another poster has recommended emacs as a further alternative, but I'll keep it around to start poking at for whatever I start writing next.

(In case you're curious, I've been using Geany, and generally ignoring all the advanced IDE features.)

:) For SI, I've been using square braces, for exactly the same purpose.

  making a sculpted soundscape/playlist is one of those non-writing things that writers do to procrastinate from writing

I just spent five minutes searching Youtube for hours-long mixes of various non-vocal genres, and using the tools I already have to download the audiotracks into MP3s. Now I've got something like fourteen hours of "melodic dubstep" alone to drown out any external distracting noise.

Silence isn't always possible; a desk fan may not be enough white noise to drown out irrelevant speech ( [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrelevant_speech_effect]] ). Non-vocal music may not be mathematically ideal, but it can be a handy tool for allowing easier access to the flow state.
