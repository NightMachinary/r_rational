I recommend checking out Coworking Spaces. They are not too expensive and *really* help me to focus. They have fantastic atmosphere, cool people, and no distractions - there's really nothing to do there except to focus on writing.

In terms of tools, if you are good with tech I *highly* recommend you to learn how to use emacs. It has a learning curve but will make you 100 times more productive. I use emacs, markdown, git, and a pelican blog. Most awesome writing environment /ever/.

Alternatively, you could use an iPad. It blows my mind how awesome and convenient it is, software for it is also fantastic.

In terms of productivity tools - read on pomodoro method. Basically you set a timer for 20 minutes and then do /nothing/ except for writing. Focusing for a short time is easy, and then you just take a break, then repeat.
