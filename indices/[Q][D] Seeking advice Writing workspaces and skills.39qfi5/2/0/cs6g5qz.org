  Coworking Spaces

Hunh. Now there's a thought. I've just finished checking, and there are two such spaces in my area, both of which are available for $100/month. That's a better deal than hitting the coffee shop daily would be, and with a bit of budget rearrangement, I could probably just afford it. If the public library is unavailable, or unsuitable, I like the idea of the additional option; thank you kindly.

I started prodding at my system's copy of it a week or two ago, then put it back on a back burner. It's one of those things that always seems to be /almost/ worth the time to learn, like Lojban.
