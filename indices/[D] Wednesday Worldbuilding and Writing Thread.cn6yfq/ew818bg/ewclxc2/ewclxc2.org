Putting together all your responses, you really need to elaborate on how much /energy/ is actually being produced for people to get an idea for how much it can be used.

Think of things in terms of power, joules, which we can reach by using watts, the rate of power used. The wattage used by an average LED bulb is around 6 watts, or in other words, it needs 6 joules every second to power it. From there, just consult an [[https://www.wholesalesolar.com/solar-information/how-to-save-energy/power-table][appliance power chart]] for the appropriate scale.

The only other major consideration is whether a mage can moderate the release of this electricity, or if they can only discharge it all at once. If it's the latter, it puts a lot more limitations on how much tech development can happen due to it, since big bursts of electricity are not easy to work with compared to a steady flow.
