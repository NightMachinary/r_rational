Er, volts are a measure of electric potential but not of energy (How much current can you deliver?). You can be shocked by a small Tesla coil at many kilovolts and be more or less fine, because the amount of current is very low and therefore the amount of energy imparted to you is small.

I'd usually take "effects are measured by how much energy output they have", which would be easiest to understand as, for instance, kilowatt-hours like on your utility meter (or use plain ol' joules). An 80W incandescent light bulb uses 80 joules of energy per second.

The wattage is also relevant -- it's how quickly you could deliver the energy.
