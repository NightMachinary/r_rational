I'm gonna echo others and say that doesn't really seem super useful then - you'd run out of memories way before you could do anything other than zap someone. Except in extremis, you're probably better off stabbing them, since swords are reusable and don't mess with your brain.

What if the people who could shoot electricity can always do it, with the power determined on how many "memory points" you've sacrificed? You'd have a cadre of electrical generators around, progressively less stable the power powerful they are.
