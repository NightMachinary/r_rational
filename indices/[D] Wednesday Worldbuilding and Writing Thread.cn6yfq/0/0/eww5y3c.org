One in a thousand are natural steppers? That's much higher than the impression I remember having, I'd have said one in a million maybe.

(Also, for those who haven't read the books: there's a natural continuum of stepping ability. There are borderline-natural steppers who can jump with a broken stepper box, borderline-phobic people who get sicker than normal and it's really unpleasant but not life-threatening, etc. Natural steppers don't get nausea and so can travel unusually fast. They can still use stepper boxes, and may not realise they don't need it.)

Although maybe you're changing those details.

When is Step Day in this setting, i.e. what is the point of divergence from Worm? What's the status of Professor Haywire (the dude who built a portal between Aleph and Bet in canon), Doormaker, Cauldron?

Have you read Ward? Because there's a lot of stuff regarding non-Aleph and Bet Earths in Ward and the way parahuman powers interact with them.

Implications:

- Dragon should be a natural stepper, obviously. But what about other capes? You could argue that stepping sickness is more of a psychic thing and so not all Brutes are immune to it, or the opposite.

  - Either way, Alexandria should be able to step pretty fast, if not an actual natural stepper. Aegis is another strong candidate for a near-natural (he can live without his head per WOG by shunting processing to his spleen or whatever, and feels no pain), and on the villainous side Crawler seems likely to have adapted.

- For sanity's sake I would assume shards have a countermeasure to prevent simulated human minds inside them from actually stepping and taking them along for the journey. Otherwise a lot of Thinker powers become impossible.

- Weld will look very different if he has to purge himself of iron to step, and is probably physically weaker. Lung can't step while his power is active (steel scales.) Oni Lee probably can't either, which has interesting implications for the ABB - are they screwed over by being unable to claim/defend stepwise territory, or do they expand on Bet as other gangs split their attention between worlds?

- The Simurgh can definitely make some super Endbringer stepper box. But when will she? My guess: hang out and wait for Bet to colonize other worlds /hard/ as they think they're safer, then attack Brockton Bay and copy Taylor's tech (if there aren't any other step-related tinkers, IDK if you want Taylor to feel like the center of the universe.)

- Unless Step Day was, like, yesterday, at least some of the Wards should have triggered in a post-Step world and may, like Taylor, have different powers or something. (IDK how hard you want to play this since in a truly single-point-of-divergence fic Taylor should probably have a variation of her canon powers.) They're also probably more familiar and comfortable with the new tech.

- Statistically at least one hero and several villains in BB should be phobic even ignoring powers.

- Legally & culturally, people need to own the land a minimum of one step to either side of their land, in order to restrict access. OTOH this cannot meaningfully extend to infinity even if there weren't other inhabited Earths. Back on the first hand, if you try to use Wild West first come first served rules too close to home people will try to grab huge tracts of well-situated land. I think a cut-off point in the single digits is most likely.

- Contrary to the Long Earth series, I think "up" and "down" make better and more intuitive names for the 4D directions. In particular, you can easily make signposts with arrows pointing to and down, and maps that draw each earth one above the other (we have practice mapping levels in buildings), and number them +2, +1, 0, -1, -2 ... Aleph is probably Earth 0 for the same political reasons they got to be Earth A.

- Speaking of politics, Aleph is officially scared shitless and correctly so. War can and will break out the minute a single belligerent country/gang stabilises long enough to notice all those fancy buildings, manufactured goods, and people chilling on Aleph with no superhero muscle to defend them. I think there's a serious chance that both versions of a lot of countries unify to avoid this, which will be a massive legal headache.
