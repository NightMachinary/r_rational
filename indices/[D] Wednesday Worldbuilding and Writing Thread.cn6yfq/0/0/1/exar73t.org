Quick thoughts:

Endbringers aren't nearly as much of an issue anymore, specially if they can't step. If they can't, there's likely to be a migration from bet, where there will still be a lot of property damage from Endbringers.

Aleph will suffer parahuman crime before getting a chance to counter it effectively: it will have to depend too much on 'heros' from another earth. This and the absent of a real threat from the Endbringers will likely make Aleph's opinions of capes really bad.

Parahuman combat tactics will have to adapt to 9/10 people (capes included) being movers and strangers. Capture attempts will need forces on at least the contiguous earths. To even know how a battle is going, people are going to need to step a few times. Collateral deaths will be likely to go down.

That's all for now
