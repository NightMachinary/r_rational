I'm working on fleshing out a world where a small portion of people can generate electricity from their fingertips by sacrificing memories. Currently, I'm stuck at what level of technology they would have access to.

The magic is rare enough that not every family household would have access to it, but the government does do their best to employ as many mages as they can to keep them from turning to easy crime and to maintain a hold on the magic. So presumably there has been some technological developments beyond medieval times.

Any thoughts?
