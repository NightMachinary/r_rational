And to answer your other questions (the rest of your post didn't appear for me on mobile, my apologies):

1) There is no delay. As soon as you sacrifice a memory, you no longer have it.

2) Memories cannot be regained through magic or really by any other means, unless it was something inconsequential enough you could just do it again. Not exact recreation though.

3) I haven't thought of it, but it feels like a neat idea to have a means that could induce the sacrificing process on someone. The damage would depend on how much is forgotten. If the person makes the victim just forget all personal memories, then it would just leave them with unfixable retrograde amnesia. If they were to go too far though, I can see it doing permanent brain damage or death, especially if motor functions were removed and the person couldn't remember how to breathe.
