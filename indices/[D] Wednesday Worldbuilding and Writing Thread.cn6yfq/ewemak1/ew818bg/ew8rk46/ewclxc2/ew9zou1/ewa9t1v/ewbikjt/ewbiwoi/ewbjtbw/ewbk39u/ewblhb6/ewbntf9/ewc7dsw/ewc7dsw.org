Personally, I'd advise you do a bit more research on how electricity works. From what I've seen, you seem to be equating volts with watts. 240V doesn't mean anything. It's like saying 'oh, the water in the pipe is flowing at 10mph. How big is the pipe? What's the pressure? How much water is in there? Everything should be quantifiable in Joules.

A static shock from wearing socks on carpet can result in thousands of volts. Not something I'd waste all my memories on.
