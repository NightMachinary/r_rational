Purely aesthetic worldbuilding question here; I hope this is the place for it. The world of Pyrebound has five races, each with at least one associated major deity or belief system, and I'd like to have a symbol for each of the "big five." Haranduluz, inevitably, has a sunburst design, while Nidriz/Nythrys has her Eye (in different forms for her bazu and moonchild variants). The Heart of Tegnem isn't really described in-story beyond "crystalline," but it's a common emblem for humans who worship the murrush master. That leaves Kuara and the Sul.

​

Kuara is the mythical maternal ancestor of all tinapi, associated variously with water, fertility, prosperity, commerce, growth, and healing (if you haven't read the story, the tinapi are something like merpeople). Kuara's mostly benevolent from a human perspective, and has some human devotees. Her "priestesses" are known as matriarchs, females who gain respect for their superior age and fertility. Kuara's sacred sites are creches (where tinapi gather to spawn and rear young) and to a lesser extent wellsprings (magical fountains producing water with mild healing properties).

​

The Sul isn't a deity but a phenomenon; it's the term for the collective will formed when a sufficiently large group of reshki gather together, and for such a community of reshki. Individuals or small groups are aimless, distractible, and prone to faction, but if they manage to accumulate a critical mass they get much more focused and dangerous. The reshki themselves are somewhat goblin-ish, but much less articulate and clever than Tolkien's orcs; they have near-human intelligence, but are temperamentally incapable of using it productively over the long term. I have no idea how to represent the Sul--something like conjoined claws? The logo would be used as a kind of blasphemous graffiti, much like gang punks use swastikas in our world.
