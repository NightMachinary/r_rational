Thank you! Your ideas gave me a lightbulb--Kuara's symbol could be somehow egg-themed (tinapi are oviparous, and sort of frog-like as well as fish-like; they can sometimes go on land, but aren't very comfortable there). Fish eggs are rather simple symbols, so I'm thinking an egg with something in it, or perhaps a cluster of them? A cluster inside a circle? The Eye of Nythrys is a full moon flanked by crescents to form an "eye" shape, which could be too visually similar to either. Not sure. Kuara's symbol will probably be the least relevant to the story anyhow, so I won't worry too much about it.

Reshki don't form permanent tribes so much; all their relationships are chaotic and impermanent. They're extremely fertile and short-lived, and their population goes through continual booms and busts as they get big enough to form a Sul, go on a rampage, and get killed off (causing collateral damage in the process). Yes, they do fight each other, though their grudges are as short-lived as everything else about them; their destructive tendencies aren't sadism so much as an extreme form of ADHD that manifests as cathartic violence, in much the same way a bored dog will wreck the house. They tend to be thought of more as vermin than intelligent beings. The Sul is relevant in the story mostly as a perverse inclination of a few humans, it being a human-centered story.
