I love the idea!

I'm going to try to talk socioeconomic stuff, but this post is not about that: it's about a potato powered journey to the center of the Entities.

It's an extreme deviation from the angle you've mentioned, but I'm interested in how parallel earths that serve purposes for the Entities (as the homeworlds for the bodies of shards [I envision them as delicate continental organic machines with moving parts that follow around the linked parahumans] or their power wells [probably slowly disintegrating earths], for example) might be reachable for steppers.

Access to key worlds could allow them to hack into powers, for example, but they're more likely to have no idea what they're doing and unknowinly cause random effects. Powers are unlikely to work in these earths. The Taboo might also make them forget all about those worlds on exit and leave them believing they haven't stepped quite as much (except for fuel, clocks...).

Also: if the Entities are capable of stepping, there's no way they haven't found the way over their entire existence. Even if any alien species they've encountered has found the way to do it, the Entities might be ready for it. In canon, they seem to have taken steps to quarantine dimensions: some earths surrounding key earths might be hostile to trespassers.
