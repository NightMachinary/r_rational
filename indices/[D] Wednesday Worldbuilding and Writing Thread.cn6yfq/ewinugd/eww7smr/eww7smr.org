Sul sound like they would have different symbols, since each gang or community has one. But maybe not, if it's more like "this malevolent force can manifest more completely the more of us there are nearby" than "each tribe has it's own egregore-god". Can Sul come into conflict with each other?

Kuara - a chalice, perhaps? Connotations of water, femininity (yonic), bounty. Could have rites involving the spring-water, communion-like. Maybe a chalice with a watertight lid so it can be carried (esp. underwater) without spilling.

On Earth frogs and snakes are associated with water, fertility and healing - a lot of Egyptian deities with those symbols and connotations. Frogs wouldn't really work for an aquatic race, but water-snakes might; they undulate in a very watery fluid fashion, they're phallic and so invoke fertility, and they can be venomous (which evokes healing, both because poisons can often have medical applications and because if you get bitten you'd better start praying you get better.)
