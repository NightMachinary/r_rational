It's just a way to refer how powerful the memory is: "'Im going to do a terrible estimation and say a very important memory is worth 240 volts (enough to charge a house) and an insignificant memory would be .5 volts."

Therefore the power of a memory is quantifiable and can be assigned a numerical value. I suggest /not/ using the term "memory points" in the story, but it works for now :P

The way you described it, it seemed like you needed to sacrifice a new memory every time you wanted to shoot lightning. I suggested that the people with this ability can always shoot electricity in amounts proportionate to how many "memory points" they've sacrificed to their ability, which is a lot more sustainable. If that's how you were already planning it then never mind :D
