I should have explained more, my bad.

The magic operates on the basis of: the more important a memory is to you, the more electricity you can generate by sacrificing it.

On one end of the spectrum, a very important memory (i.e. your mother's face, your wife's name, a formative experience with your father) would be enough to kill someone.

On the other end, a very insignificant memory (i.e. the taste of a food you didn't like, the name of someone you just met) is only enough to make a small spark that will die out almost immediately.

It takes a long time to be physically exhausted by this magic, so unless you were constantly using the high end blasts, you could keep it up for hours.

For real world number, I'm going to do a terrible estimation and say a very important memory is worth 240 volts (enough to charge a house) and an insignificant memory would be .5 volts.

Feel free to question me on those numbers, and apologies if this doesn't help all that much, I'll do my best to answer any questions that might help clear things up.
