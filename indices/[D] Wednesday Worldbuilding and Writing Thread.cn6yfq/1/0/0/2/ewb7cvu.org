Whats the high end? Burning an important memory is enough to kill someone, but what if you burn stuff far more important then what you listed?

Like what if you burned out every memory of your 5 year marriage with your ex-wife, or the fact that you have 10 year old kids (and every memory related to them). Could you kill a dozen men close to each other? Fifty?

Or what if you went all out, and burned everything. Every single memory, from the normal ones to the automatic ones (eg. how to breath, how to walk), to your skills (eg. your knowledge of English/fantasy language, how to ride a bike, how to whittle or bake or read).

If you burned every single thing that made you you, could you kill an army? Or would you just flame out and die from a mere fraction of the charge, killing almost no one?
