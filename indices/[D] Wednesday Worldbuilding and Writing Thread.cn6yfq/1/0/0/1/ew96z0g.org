Let's say that someone decides to only burn their current memories as they form, so that from the moment the spell casting starts to when it ends, no new memories are retained; can this be done? If so, how powerful can it be? Can I just spend an 8 hour workday doing nothing but generating electricity and punch out with my most recent memory being punching in and have meaningful amounts of electricity in the 8 hours?

Is there a delay on the forgetting aspects?

Can I consult experts on an important matter, and be able to verify somehow that they actually used their magic to forget the memories specifically related to the secrets we discussed to ensure confidentiality?

Can the magic be reversed by absorbing electricity to regain lost memories?

Can the forgetting be forcibly induced to the point that everything is forgotten? How serious is forgetting everything? Death, complete dementia, or something else?

I think the forgetting things is more important than the ability to generate electricity and there will be aspects of the world that focuses on this while treating the generated electricity as almost incidental.
