I loved this chapter so much! A good amount happened, there felt like progress, but still unrushed. The therapy session was amazing, I really enjoyed the whole thing, it felt like a good way to empathize with Red and everything he was feeling, it was very vivid.

I am curious to see what will happen with Red's revelation at the end and the consequences of what he realised. And to find out exactly what it was he realised.
