I was a bit bored with the whole psychic arc so far. But the exegcute riddle provided the motivation to reread all the respective chapters to figure out the who, the what, the why and the how. Now I'm really invested in the psychics and their plotting.

And I fear for them a little now, since as Sabrina said "Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead." ;)
