That's kind of how therapy /is/, though. You interrupt your everyday, in-the-moment experience in an /environment/ and a /society/ to put some time and effort into working on something internal.

If anything, those scenes in this work are the /most/ heavily dramatized and streamlined to fit them into the narrative, and the seriousness with which Red approaches his issues with himself carries very smoothly from his analytical attitude toward everything else.

Is it possible you just prefer Blue's and Leaf's viewpoints, or that Red's boring internal monologue is more bearable when he's thinking about cool Pok√©mon things?
