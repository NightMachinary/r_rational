  In contrast, the therapy sessions do not really tap into the rich resources of this "alternative universe".

I considered making Red's therapist a psychic, or utilizing pokemon more in the sessions, but this is in fact the one area where I feel like anything that makes the process different or easier than it would be in the real world would be doing the issues addressed a disservice.

The pokemon world already has so many of our problems solved by magic or magitech, it felt like there needed to still be parts of the human experience that remain "unsolved" to not make it too unrelatable. Even Red's psychic abilities and partition are at risk of being too convenient, in my view. Of course it's possible to utilize psychic abilities more directly in therapy without just insta-solving people's mental health problems, but that would still largely erode the reader's ability to learn how actual mental health and good therapy work in the real world, which (for obvious reasons) I find more valuable than making every single scene feel like it's fundamentally tied to the pokemon world.

To put it another way, there are still plumbers and programmers and politicians and teachers in the pokemon world, and outside of certain very rare catastrophes, none of their jobs are meaningfully altered by the fact that they live in it rather than ours. Maybe outside their professions, yes, but their day to day job is still the same in both worlds, and none of them are relevant to the plot (not yet anyway) so none of them are being covered, but therapy is one of the jobs I imagine would be the same in both worlds (especially with non-sapient pokemon) and happens to be plot relevant, so I'm presenting it the way it would be in our world.

You and [[/u/ClaireBear1123]] 's points about the tone change or it being too text-bookish are valid reasons to not like these scenes, and may be something I can address through better writing. But I would challenge the idea that a protagonist dealing with trauma or grief or an ended friendship don't constitute meaningful plot development, or that any part of any story in the pokemon world must be intrinsically identifiable as taking place within it.
