  Thats not an aspersion at the discipline at all, just the nature of mental health

Personally I think it should be an aspersion against those who practice the discipline in general :) In the fun game of "what profession hates incompetent others in the same profession most," I think therapists are probably top 5 at least. It's gotten to the point where I actually add a bunch of caveats whenever I recommend anyone start therapy or go to a psychiatrists, and am thinking of writing up a guide for how to spot a bad therapist.
