The most unrealistic part of fiction: when a therapeutic strategy works for the first time as opposed to taking months for a "uh maybe???" :P

But seriously great chapter, as our esteemed author is a therapist the deep psych delves always have a ton of detail and work that goes into the internal growth that is generally underspecified in other stories.

I can't imagine Red though like emailing Blue out of the, well you know, just to say "hey, screw you", that anticipates being one awkward convo.
