The first section was very introspection-provoking to read, and I expected it to comprise the whole chapter. I really like the pace at which we're seeing Red's internal development; seeing critical moments like this interspersed with a fair amount of offscreen progress feels just about right.

And then there's a whole second part of the chapter! I really really really enjoyed the COOKIES as a lighthearted counterweight to the first part, even though it's a little undermined by the (unfortunately reasonable) sinister implications pointed out in the last part...
