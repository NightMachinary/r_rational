I have to agree. This fanfic has been slowly losing me since the Zapdos arc.

The therapy sessions could have been lifted straight out of a soap opera rat- fic or a case-study textbook, and seem out of place in a work about Pokemon. One of the strengths of HPMOR (imo) was its ability to largely incorporate its rationalist/scientific perspective /in the context of/ the Wizarding World (temporal concepts are explored in with Time-Turners, quantum physics with partial transfiguration, etc...). In contrast, the therapy sessions do not really tap into the rich resources of this "alternative universe". It is telling that the majority of the comments are directed at the exeggcute scene.

At the risk of prejudging, these therapy sessions seem to be incorporated for the sake of exposition on the topic, rather than any meaningful plot development. Either way, the therapy sessions still felt like a drag to read.

That being said, I remain grateful to the author for the work he has put into this fanfic.
