It is the complete opposite for me, my favourite chapters are those where we have more exposition of ideas and less plot development. I like the action-packed ones, too, but they are just for enjoyment and not that meaningful. The first part of this chapter was great, it made me stop reading multiple times to think about real life things and this is the main reason I like this story so much and rational fiction in general.
