Eh don't completely disagree, but I also do disagree.

I'll admit I'm a simple man. I enjoy the action of battles, adventuring, and Pokemon capturing the most of anything in this story. I mean, I read Pokemon fanfiction because I'm a fan of Pokemon. Perhaps unlike many other readers, I didn't start reading this story because I was a part of the rationalist subreddit many of these rationalist fanfictions seem to come from. Rather, I was looking for good Pokemon fanfiction and this happened to be one of the best I could find. I enjoy the story for what it is, and while I admit I'm not super interested in the aspects of the story where Pokemon just don't really come up at all such as Red's therapy sessions, I wouldn't go so far as to say they're unnecessary or bad. They serve as an important look into the psychological state of the protagonists and serves to help us understand how they are growing as people over time. Obviously I'd rather read about Red having a traditional Pokemon related adventure, but saying that the exploration of his psyche is unneeded or even bad at all would be missing the point.
