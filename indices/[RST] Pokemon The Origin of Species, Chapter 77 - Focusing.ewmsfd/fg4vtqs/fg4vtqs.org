Am I misinterpreting this, or was the end of the chapter implying Past Red was the one that projected the cookie thought without Red knowing? There was a Chekhov's gun sort of thing going on, why would Daystar mention Mewtwo's tulpas and whether or not Past Red was conscious when not fronting. The last line saying “Past Red was silent” also implies something ominous about him. That's how I interpreted the scene but I haven't seen anyone here mention it yet.
