Haha, well I was exaggerating for comedic effect but I do think a lot of people's experiences with therapy or medication are "i might be doing better, its hard to say" and thats probably the best they can aspire to. Thats not an aspersion at the discipline at all, just the nature of mental health - I imagine we could start linking meta-analyses all day to debate it, but probably not the venue!

I haven't tried focusing in a formal setting though (it has a lot of parallels to some meditation practices that I have done), so that is good to know that it can be unusually quick-acting! Def something to add to the toolbox.
