  Rei may have sabotaged the experiment to see how the people involved react in order to get more information on their connections to Sabrina. Simply put, if people know their first thoughts will get spread out to the other minds when they merge with the exeggcute, then they might be unintentionally thinking of their secrets when they first merge with the exeggcute in future experiments.

But how would Rei know beforehand that merging would broadcast a thought into everyone? I mean, it's not implausible, but it seems like many things could go wrong with that plan.

Also, cookies? It seems like a very random thing to be thinking while trying to merge with a seed. I guess that is evidence that whoever did the broadcasting was purposeful.

I guess my main issue is that they were supposedly doing something new and untested, and thus I have a hard time imagining that someone could have micromanaged the environment in order to get specific results. (Unless they already knew what would happen and were feigning ignorance, but that hypothesis seems way too complex to consider.)
