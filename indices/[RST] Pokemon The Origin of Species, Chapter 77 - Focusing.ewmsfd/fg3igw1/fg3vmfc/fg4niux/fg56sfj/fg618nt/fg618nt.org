I was confused at the ending but I think I gained a better understanding after reading your explanation, so thanks for that, first.

But I don't think, if someone did sabotage the experiment on purpose, that it was Rei who did so. This kind of ploy is rather blunt and obvious, and she risked drawing Tetsuo's suspicion for what seems to be very little gain. If Tetsuo didn't want to risk any secrets in his head from being leaked out, he could just call off the experiment or bow out of it for fairly justifiable reasons, being the Gym Second. Even if he did participate in the experiment a second time with no significant changes to its process, he's guaranteed to get suspicious if the same event happened again and would immediately know someone's digging for secrets about Sabrina, if that's what Rei tried to fish for. Finally, I don't think Red would be so nervous if he suspects it was Rei trying to fish for info about Sabrina, because he already knew about that.

I think it's more likely Tetsuo was testing the waters instead. Of course I don't know for sure the details of what exactly he knew beforehand, but it would explain Red's sudden nervousness about having a certain someone trying to see what secrets he's holding (Rei's "curiosity" about Sabrina), and anyone else trying to bow out would be a bit more suspicious if Tetsuo's the one who revised the experiment and claimed that it's safer now.
