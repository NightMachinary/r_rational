I don't think Rei planned it ahead of time, but rather was the first one to merge and quickly came up with the idea of pushing a thought into other people's mind. Cookies was an innocuous thought with minimal issue if anything went wrong.

Also I'm not saying that I think Rei may have sabotaged the experiment, but rather that I think Red is suspicious of Rei doing so. He's both worried about his secrets leaking and worried about someone sabotaging his proposed experiment, either Daniel or Rei.
