  Still, that thing with the Exeggcute was good, but what did happen with the cookies though?

Basically at the end of the chapter, Red thinks someone sabotaged the experiment. Daniel is the obvious subject, but he's also suspicious of Rei who may have arranged for Tetsuo to replace Daniel as a confederate of hers.

Rei may have sabotaged the experiment to see how the people involved react in order to get more information on their connections to Sabrina. Simply put, if people know their first thoughts will get spread out to the other minds when they merge with the exeggcute, then they might be unintentionally thinking of their secrets when they first merge with the exeggcute in future experiments.

If anyone drops out of the experiment after that session, then it's a potential clue.
