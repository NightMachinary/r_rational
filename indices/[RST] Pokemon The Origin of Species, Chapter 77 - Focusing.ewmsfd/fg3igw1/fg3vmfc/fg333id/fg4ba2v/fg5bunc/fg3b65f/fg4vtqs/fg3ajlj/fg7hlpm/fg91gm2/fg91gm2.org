Focusing is an interesting concept. I've always been pretty good at analyzing my own emotions, but I never thought of trying to analyze the feelings associated with them. I think I'll give it a try next time I can't understand why I feel a certain way, it seems like a novel approach.

As for how this will impact Red, it seems like you are trying to get to an end-game where he has tulpas of his own (I'm guessing one for battling and another for socializing?). Pretty suspicious this came out just after Mewtwo explaining the uses of having multiple mental states. hmmmmm
