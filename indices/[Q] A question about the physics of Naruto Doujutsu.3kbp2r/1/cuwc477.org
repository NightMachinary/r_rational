My knowledge comes only from the Manga.

From memory, Amaterasu functioned like a projectile launched from the eye and tended to burn whatever it touched, so I suspect it would set any mirror on fire.\\
The Moon's Eye Plan/Infinite Tsukuyomi effected everyone on the planet in the same reality as it, and the Moon retained the Rinnesharigan even when Kaguya was in other realities. I have no idea how it really worked, since the explanation we get in story both makes no sense and is given by people who are pawns for Black Zetsu.\\
The Sharigan specifically needs eye contact to pull off it's mind-control, hence the blindfolds.

I think the question is if mirrors reflect chakra or the "light" of chakra that some bloodlines can see. I'd personally say "no, unless convoluted Moon's Eye Plan to make the mirror have eyes" since the Sharigan users have a habit of standing in plain sight to use their abilities, and it seems like a basic enough tactic for the author to have thought of it and thrown it in at some point.
