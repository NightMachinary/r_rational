Well, both the Sharingan and Rinnegan create a "reflection" of themselves in the eyes of their victims/puppets. With the knowledge that they are both incomplete manifestations of the Rinnesharingan, the "complete" Doujutsu could take this from merely cosmetic to allowing the projecting of it's powers through the eyes of another.

The Sharingan can also perform Izanagi, a self-sustaining genjutsu prison similar to the Infinite Tsukuyomi which I seem to recall doesn't require eye-contact, but overloads the Sharingan that uses it. Similar to above, this gives precedent to the Rinnesharingan being capable of the lotus eater trap under it's own power.

I still can't think of a good reason that anyone would conclude the Moon was a suitable recepticle. The Moon was created by imprisoning the Rinnesharingan's only living user and is composed of inert rock, so how would Zetsu know it would work to the point of devoting decades or centuries to a single convoluted plan? Can it be used on any roughly spherical target? For that matter, how did Kaguya sustain it while in other planes of existence?
