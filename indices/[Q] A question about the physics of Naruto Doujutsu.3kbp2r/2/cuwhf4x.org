As far as the Moon's Eye, the interpretation I took from it is that the chakra of the bijuu was to be used to remotely project the sharingan onto the moon, essentially making the moon a giant sharingan eye, for the purposes of the tsukiyomi. Also, I think the implication is that due to both the bijuu chakra and the size scaling, the tsukiyomi would affect everyone, regardless of those who avoided making eye contact with it.

As far as mirrors, I want to say that genjutsu is about some form of chakra emission and I'm going to assume that chakra doesn't behave exactly like light, so bouncing them off mirrors wouldn't be a feasible option. And while Amaterasu was generally taken as "big ass black fire wherever the person looks", there was clearly some form of limit to its size, and I dont think the fire would ride along the L.o.S provided by a mirror. I think it'd just go to where the Uchiha is actually gazing, melting said mirror.
