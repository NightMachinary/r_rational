In my opinion, there are two ends of the spectrum:

- *Doujutsu depend entirely on the transmission of chakra.* Byakugan, Sharingan, and Amaterasu can be blocked by barriers of dense chakra. The Moon's Eye Plan depended on bouncing the chakra of a genjutsu off of the Moon, to reach the entire Earth.

- *Doujutsu depend entirely on the transmission of light.* Byakugan picks up on light outside the visible spectrum and uses chakra to convert that into a format interpretable by the human brain. Sharingan is just sharper-than-average sight, but with the associated brain functions accelerated by chakra. Amaterasu will bounce off of a mirror. The Moon's Eye Plan depended on... I dunno--somehow improving a Sharingan's vision enough that it can see everyone on Earth using the Moon as a mirror?

Obviously, the truth is somewhere in the middle, leaning (in my opinion) toward the chakra-based side--compare Mind Body Switch, which is much more explicit. Still, I guess the light-based system could be made to work.

Many fanfiction writers assume that Kakashi's hitai-ate incorporates a sealing array that blocks or deactivates his Sharingan, rather than saying that it can be rendered inactive by a simple layer of cloth placed over it.

  I don't know enough about WTH [the Moon's Eye Plan] actually was based on canon-wise to use that as evidence.
