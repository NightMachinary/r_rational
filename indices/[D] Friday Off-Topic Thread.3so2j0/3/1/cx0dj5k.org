Consider the stages of skill mastery ....(the Dreyfus model). Typically the master is not even conscious of the steps. A black belt doesn't have to think, they have 'muscle memory.' They may think at a higher level. Your brain has lots (hundreds, thousands) of modules. You don't think to walk (unless you are 18mos old). We are, in some ways, a collection of conscious parts, which sometimes interact.

For a rather chilling (and rationalist) take on the topic, I recommend Peter Watt's Blindsight.

PS. The author (a PhD in Biology) does not believe that humans have free will.
