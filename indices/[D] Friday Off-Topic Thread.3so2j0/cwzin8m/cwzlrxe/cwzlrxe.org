Some of the podcasts I listen to (that make sense to recommend here):

- Cortex, Reconcilable Differences (Two podcasts): Similar in genre to Hello Internet, but a bit less silly. Cortex has Grey from Hello Internet.

- ATP: Like the above but with a tech news (esp. Apple) focus. Can be boring if you aren't interested in that, but is often fun anyway.

- Rationally Speaking: Julia Galef (CFAR President) has conversations with people about their ideas.

- Econtalk: Conversations between Russ Roberts and various economists/people in related fields. Not fun to listen to if you dislike libertarian ideas.

- Worm Audiobook and HPMOR Podcast (Two podcasts): Enjoy great stories while doing other things!

- Dear Hank and John: Kind of embarrassing to admit, but I like this, even though I stopped watching Vlogbrothers videos a long time ago.

- The Weeds: Conversations between journalists about policy issues, rather than politics. Just put out a good episode about Basic Income Guarantees.

- StartUp: Short episodes about the business of being a Start Up. Very well produced.

- About Race: Occasionally frustrating exercise in overcoming anti-SJW sentiments through exposure therapy / conversations between mostly reasonable sounding people about why race is still a big deal and we should care a lot.

- Waking Up with Sam Harris: Smarter and less crazy than you'd think if you've moved away from "New Atheism". Haven't listened to many episodes, but I've enjoyed those I have.

General Podcast Tips:

- Think of something you like. Now google that thing + "podcast" or just search for that term in itunes or your podcast app.

- Slowly increase your listening speed. I listen at 3X speed, and it's great.
