It's going to be hard to run, considering that the author needs to imagine what /the entire audience collaboratively/ would have done in the failed loops. But then, you'll have access to their discussions, so that puts you at an advantage...

#+begin_quote
  The user-avatar gets one piece of information: the number of loops that have passed.
#+end_quote

Does this number change over the course of the story, or is the audience told at the beginning "this is loop #24, you've succeeded every time so far, good luck"? If it changes, does that mean the audience has memories from past loops?

It sounds pretty great. I'd love to know if you ever get this off the ground.
