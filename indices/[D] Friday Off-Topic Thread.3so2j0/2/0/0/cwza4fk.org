  The problem is that while you can say that a character doesn't know something, the player is still going to know. I've tried it before and it's difficult.

Players tolerate this a lot more if you use a system in which knowledge/memories have game-mechanical crunch. For any aspect of a game without rules, players think of themselves as the character; when rules come in, the character does things they wouldn't, and that's okay and expected.

For example, imagine a fantasy detective game: everyone keeps a list of clues they are aware of, must /present/ clues /from/ their list to solve the mystery, and must /make a check on/ a clue they possess in order to get a suspicion about a person/place.

Now imagine the mystery's villain has an amnesia spell. When they use it, a random clue gets erased from your list. It's now obvious to the player that something has been taken away /from the character/. /The player/ still knows that there /was/ a clue, but, like an item being stolen, the character no longer "has" the clue, so they can't use game verbs (present evidence; investigate) to /act upon/ the clue.
