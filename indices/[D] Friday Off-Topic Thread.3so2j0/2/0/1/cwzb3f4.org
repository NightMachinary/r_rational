Sorry, I should clarify that I didn't necessarily mean D&D- I've still never played it, somehow. That's exactly the sort of approach I was hoping to avoid, personally I don't think pretending not to know would work out at all. That's why I'm wondering about mechanisms that would avoid that- I feel like it would have to involve skipping steps to give the illusion of having lost memory. So like the stabbing example- instead of saying, "you got stabbed," the GM would just say, suddenly, "hey, you're bleeding" and have them try to react. Obviously the GM would have to do some pre-planning to give them options to survive. Or have them take an action and if it would involve them encountering the monster, effect a time skip of what you extrapolate would happen and tell them the results ("You open the door and... Huh, now you find yourself standing the middle of a courtyard, holding some blue pills" / let them find notes that give clues, something to that effect.
