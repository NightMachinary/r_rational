I tried TiTS, but I like it far less. In part because it's scifi with many planets and I prefer Fantasy with a single larger world, and in part because I just think the writing was better in CoC. It's true that TiTS has a better interface, though. And it /is/ more female player friendly, but I'm male, so that's not an issue in terms of game enjoyment.
