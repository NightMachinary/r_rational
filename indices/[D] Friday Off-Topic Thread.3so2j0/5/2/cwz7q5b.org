[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game][Go game]] is pretty amazing.

It is extremely fascinating and interesting. Rules are simple but very deep, and playing is satisfying and engaging at any skill level. You can start having fun within 20 minutes after learning the rules, and it will stay fun 10 years in.

I am sure that people on this sub will enjoy it a lot, so if you haven't tried it - you should.

There's a great website [[https://online-go.com][OGS]] - it is very well done, and you can play against real people over there.

I have also bought myself "SmartGo Kifu" app for my iPad, and it is perfect(but expensive). It has a lot lf exercises, very smart AI, and all kinds of useful options, it's really great. I've been playing for hours in the past few days, can't stop.

There's also a great [[https://www.youtube.com/user/sundaygolessons][youtube channel]] to learn theory, I highly recommend it.

Because there are different board sizes, game can last anywhere between 10 minutes and several hours, your choice. And exercises work like very fun puzzles, which you can solve under a minute, and it is very enjoyable.

Also I bet you guys would like Zork and other text adventures, they're very fun.
