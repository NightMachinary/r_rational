I suppose so. But for me, at least, the sadness I feel is from the reaction itself. Seeing all the passion, sadness, anger and fear simply drives me mad with bewilderment and frustration. Why can't we feel this way about all the death we can really do something about? Why do we see reports of thousands of children dieing every few days from malaria, a disease we can treat /efficiently/, and turn a blind apathetic eye towards it? Why do see a terrorist attack and proceed to give up the opportunity to save tens, if not hundreds, of millions of lives? Its as if we have a fire hose, we're staring at our home being burnt down, and we decide to throw petrol on someone's lighter.

If only there was some way to harness this aspect of human nature to do some good.
