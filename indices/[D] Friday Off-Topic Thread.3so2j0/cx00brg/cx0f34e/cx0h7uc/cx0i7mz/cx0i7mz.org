You are indeed correct about the mortality rate, I believe was thinking of vehicle related deaths(and upon further looking its actually more like 1.3m). Regarding the number of deaths, just the same as war funds could have been used to save X more lives than just avoiding said war by being directed to Y cause the outraged people could say the same about the resources the terrorists used.

You call that event "tiny", but in the end a war is also "tiny". its all about scale, and it seems fairly arbitrary for me to say one is more correct than the other.

Sure that is reason enough to be saddened if you feel that way about death, but as we mentioned the relevant scales you should only really be a little bit more saddened by that than by the deaths that occur without it.
