well, as you already brought it up

  compared to the many deaths in x or y area and suddenly you are one of them.

But isn't that exactly the same regarding whatever war you imagine will happen as a result of that?

If I remember correctly about 1.6 million people die every year around the world, on wikipedia it says that over the 4 years or so of the iraq war and occupation anything between 150k to 1m people died. so all in all anything between 2.3% to 15% for about 4 years. Which looking from an if historic point of view is hardly anything.
