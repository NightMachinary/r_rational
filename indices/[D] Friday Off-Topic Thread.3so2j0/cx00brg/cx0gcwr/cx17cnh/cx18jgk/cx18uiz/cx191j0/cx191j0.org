  Reaching limits ends in bigger crises. Either things will continue as they have or it will end in a bigger tragedy.

The world doesn't have an unlimited supply of "tragedy particles" that can just rush into the world whenever they're invited, eg: this isn't Warhammer 40k. Mostly things run on punctuated equilibrium.

  Islamic extremism is not a unified force (not just Daesh, but the Taliban, al-Qaeda, anyone who tries to claim a Caliphate). It's guerilla warfare on an ideological level. Retaliation by governments forms new generations of extremists. How will the cycle collapse?

Da3esh, Hamas, and Hizballah /are/ the end point: a terrorist gang gets big and mean enough to constitute an actual government, and while everyone hates them, nobody /actually/ wants to interfere deeply enough to uproot them until they become /sufficiently/ troublesome to powerful states, so they're /mostly/ allowed to just form their shitty little religious dystopias unmolested.
