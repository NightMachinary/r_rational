  I don't expect Hollande to do much, just like how America hasn't actually done anything effective about 9/11.

/It is not a question of what is effective./ America's efforts after 9/11 effectively birthed the influx of young defectors. The racism and ingroup thinking that the attacks inspire worsen relations with all of Islam, and pushes fence-sitters towards reaction themselves, particularly in areas affected by the war. America invades for no discernible reason and spends over a decade sitting there and ruining the region? I'd want to fight back too.
