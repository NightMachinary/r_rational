  Are humans only partly self-aware?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  I do try to be as self-aware as possible, and I'm aware of Alicorn's luminosity guide, but a lot of this is based on inference, working out why I feel a certain way and figuring out my thought processes by considering my past reactions, upbringing, etc., as opposed to just knowing why I feel that way.

This seems to be a varying trait. One of my confusions about other people has been that I seem to have more access to my "subconscious" than many people around me.

This means that, for instance, I don't have /subconscious/ ulterior motives, I'm just repressing ulterior motives I'm straightforwardly aware of.

  If you developed an AI that had full access to its own code, wouldn't it be more self-aware than a human?
#+end_quote

Yes. Enhanced self-awareness would also be an enhancement you could perform on humans if you understood neuroscience fully.
