Yes, we are. I don't know if everyone gets this, but... have you ever felt down "for no real reason", or cancelled a social engagement because you "just didn't feel like going out"? Most likely there's some cause for those that no amount of introspection will bring to mind. Considering your past reactions and the evidence of your actions rather than your thoughts is the only way to get past that barrier.

It might turn out that (to use an example from my own experience) walking to work in the morning makes you more likely to hang out with friends in the evening, even if you didn't consciously know that was the reason for your decision.
