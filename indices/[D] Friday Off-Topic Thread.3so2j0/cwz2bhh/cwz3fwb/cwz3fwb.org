1. That can be a hard thing to do in D&D unless you have roleplaying buy-in from all the players. The problem is that while you can say that a /character/ doesn't know something, the /player/ is still going to know. I've tried it before and it's difficult. (Having amnesiac characters trying to uncover the past is easier, because the player starts from the same position of ignorance.) Tread carefully.

2. Dread is good if you want it lightweight.

3. I tend to sketch out really quick maps if there's going to be travel involved. I spent a few years running a game set in a D&D version of Europe and found it helpful to mark important locations. Maps also help to give you a sense of place, and if you give the map to the players, it adds production values.

   For planning out encounters ... it depends. I have enough improv experience to spin up an adventure from a standing start (where the only notice that I'll be running a game is the regular GM not showing up), but it's again an issue of production values. If you rely too heavily on improv, you can improv yourself into a corner. I tend to write out some dialogue beforehand to cover most of my bases and get stats for all the monsters that I'll be using. If it's your first time as GM, I would highly recommend doing that so you don't lose your way.

4. I don't think there's anything wrong with just starting off with your own stuff. The perk of doing that is that you'll know the scenario backward and forward and have a deeper understanding of it than you'd have of something created by someone else. The big worry is in trying something that goes against either the conventions of your rule system or the conventions of RPGs generally, especially if you don't have buy-in from the players. Like, I wouldn't make my /first game/ of D&D have a party of all wizards, because that requires some adjustments that I might not be able to figure out without experience.
