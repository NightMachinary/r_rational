On a similar note, I've been considering a Quest (i.e. MSPA/RubyQuest-style Interactive Fiction game) that is a mash-up of /Mother of Learning/ with (a reversed perspective on a genocide run of) the game /Undertale/.

The userbase would play as someone who is aware that there is a serial killer loose in their closed community, and must stop them... only the serial killer is a looper, and the user-avatar is *not*. This means that the serial killer can reset the loop at any time of their own volition, and a reset will also be triggered upon their death.

The user-avatar gets one piece of information: the number of loops that have passed. The userbase must then try to infer and discard every solution they /would have thought to have tried/ in all previous loops, because the looper will have already seen and accounted for (i.e. gained reflexes against, as a speedrunner does with a predictable sequence in a game) all of those strategies.

To make this not just a bunch of debate on a forum, though, anyone can request, as a command, to /imagine/ the results of an action, the output of which will always be perfectly true and simulated equivalently to the story's own physics... given the set of facts that the user-avatar is aware of. Knowledge would be inventory in this game.

In other words, I basically see this as an escape-the-room game, where "the room" is you being tortured for a million years by a malicious AI. Or you can look at it as an AI-box experiment, which might immediately suggest solutions to some of you. Either way, the "true" solution would probably involve at least some timeless-decision-theoretic reasoning.
