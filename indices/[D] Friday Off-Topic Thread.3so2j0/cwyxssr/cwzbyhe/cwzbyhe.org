All of the following games have several things in common:

- they are multiplayer (except for /Captain Forever/);
- they are free-to-play, with restrictions posed upon them by their monetization scheme not affecting the gameplay too drastically for those who decide to not pay;
- generally, they do not require investing large amounts of time to gain in-game unlockable advantage over other players (e.g. levelling up a character, unlocking skills, etc);
- You can perform well in them with only gaining sufficient knowledge and skills regarding the game's mechanics.

--------------

- [[http://www.astroflux.net/][/Astroflux/]] ([[http://www.kongregate.com/games/fulafiskenab/astroflux][K]]) --- A space simulator, which I'd say has some similarities with Mass Effect series. You can visit different planetary systems, land on planets to collect resources and complete quests, attack other players and steal from them, etc.

  - (+) the game's design allows your imagination to work and fill in the blanks on its own.
  - (-) unlocking more powerful ships requires in-game currency, which can be bought with real money. It is possible to “win” against other players without doing so, however, if you develop a smart gameplay style.
  - (-) Once you investigate all the currently-developed planetary systems, the gameplay will likely become repetitive.

- [[http://www.captainforever.com/captainforever.php][/Captain Forever/]] --- You attack and destroy other ships, and then upgrade your own using the remaining debris.
- [[https://gameofbombs.com/][/GameOfBombs/]] --- Multiplayer version of the classic Bomberman, basically. Having a good reaction will give a significant advantage.

  - (-) the later versions have become needlessly overcomplicated with lootable power-boosting items, IMO.

- [[http://www.kdice.com/][/KDice/]] --- [[http://imgur.com/KHAZhfA][Multiplayer version]] of [[http://www.kongregate.com/games/trucbidule/dice-wars][Dice Wars]].

  - (+) Players can negotiate to cooperate with each other in short-term, can betray each other later.
  - (-) Don't remember any, though admittedly I haven't played it for a while and things might've changed.

- [[http://mitos.is/][/Mitos.is/]] ([[http://store.steampowered.com/app/389570/][S]]) --- Here you control a cell, which can get bigger by grazing or hunting smaller cells, split up to 8 smaller cells, feed allies or ambush bigger cells to steal matter from them.

  - (+) Players can negotiate to cooperate with each other.
  - (-) The current game mechanics makes cooperation in the Free-for-all mode overpowered.
  - (-) Higher level cells\players have some unfair advantages over lower level ones.
  - (-) Currently world-maps are too small, in my opinion (e.g. compared to GameOfBombs).

- [[http://www.realmofthemadgod.com/][/Realm of the Mad God/]] ([[http://www.kongregate.com/games/wild_shadow/realm-of-the-mad-god][K]] | [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/200210/][S]]) --- Having a good reaction will give a significant advantage. This is a [[http://i.imgur.com/rvKPr7a.gif][[bullet hell]]] game, in which the player gets rewarded for correctly deciphering/anticipating enemies' shooting patterns and the general movement of dangerous elements on the entire screen. It is possible to kill many bosses without any “top”-level equipment at all (though they help) if one stays concentrated and has the know-how.

  - (+) Once a character dies, all the gained levels and items disappear with him. This removes many advantages that older players would otherwise have over newcomers.
  - (-) Storage capacity is severely limited to indulge players in investing real money.
  - (-) One lag that's out of your control can kill your character and waste hours of time that was spent developing it.

p.s. Since CoC was mentioned, I guess I'll throw in [[http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/598364][Sakyubasu No Tatakai I]].
