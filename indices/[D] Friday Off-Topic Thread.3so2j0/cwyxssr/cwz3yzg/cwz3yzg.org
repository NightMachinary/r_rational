Is it okay if each individual playthrough is very short, but over the course of many playthroughs, you learn a lot about the underlying mechanics that you couldn't possibly have guessed on your first playthrough?

'Cuz my main timewaster as of late is HyperRogue, a roguelike that's currently [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/342610/][$3 on Steam]]. It's a really excellent game set in non-Euclidean space; it's also updated frequently by the developer with new areas and bug fixes.
