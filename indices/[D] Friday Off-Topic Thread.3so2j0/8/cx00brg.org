I know people don't like political things in here but I'm not really sure where I'd be able to talk about this with people who understand. I'm talking of course about the shootings in france and how Hollande has said 'We are going to lead a war which will be pitiless'. I think it is time for another cycle of war. It feels like it did before. The rage is there, and the pain. If you go into the news threads you'll see all kinds of people saying the strangest things. Using this to 'prove' that all muslims are bad people, that funding mosques should become illegal, that it was the immigrant's fault or that we should invade the Saudi.

The politicians are competing to see who can be most outraged, there are no real moderating influences. You go into a thread about Muslims condemning terrorism and expressing solidarity and all the comments are about how Muslims are being insufficiently contrite, as if all atheists should have to apologise for Stalin or similar. You enter these discussions and you can't be the moderating influence either. Any call for reason, or mention of how this is but a small number compared to the many deaths in x or y area and suddenly you are one of /them/.

Looks like it's about that time. There are enough armed forces members sitting idle, and there is a clear target. It is going to happen again and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. It saddens me.
