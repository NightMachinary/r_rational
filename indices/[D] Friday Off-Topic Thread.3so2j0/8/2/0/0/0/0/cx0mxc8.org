Isn't that because people are not equipped to truly handle that amount of sorrow or whatever no? I think its a thing.. And I don't think its really about people thinking they can do something about, i mean its not like people believe them saying that we should go to war so that we will actually go to war. they say it because that is what they feel.

All the while terrorists are a "them against us" kind of thing, so its easier to sell, its easier to get angry at.
