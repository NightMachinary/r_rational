Depending on how you look at it, the death from the wars could be considered vastly higher. The opportunity cost of the war could be said to claim far more lives than war casualties. Assuming the resources were instead spent effectively preventing deaths, that the wars cost some factor of a trillion USD and the amount of money spent (efficiently) preventing death is some factor of ten to a hundred thousand USD/life, then that's some factor of 10-100 million lives that could have been saved. On the other hand, ~55 million people die every year (not 1.6 million) so the ratio still isn't too different than what you said. Also, its not like spending money on effectively saving lives is something that's actually done on that scale. Still its hard to look at that and not be saddened, especially when you consider that the reaction is based on something so tiny. And also its the reaction that's exactly what the terrorists want in the first place.
