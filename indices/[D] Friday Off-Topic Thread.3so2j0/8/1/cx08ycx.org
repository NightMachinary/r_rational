I think it's far too early to say anything about the place of this particular attack and what the full consequences will be. It's barely been 24 hours.

We like to avoid political discussions for exactly the reasons you mentioned. Tensions are running high and people are picking sides, which makes this the worst possible time to try a reasonable debate (and it's not fair on the mods of [[/r/rational]] to have to run one).
