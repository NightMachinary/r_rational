Honestly? I don't expect Hollande to do much, just like how America hasn't actually done anything /effective/ about 9/11. The Western countries don't understand the Middle East sufficiently to actually fight Da3esh, and don't actually want to. They are financially and socially exhausted, and don't have a large enough base of combat-age citizens to draw into their militaries for a serious war.

Besides which, Da3esh is a great way to keep common citizens scared.

Now, if you'll excuse me, we should really get back to the thread about ponies. Ponies are nice.
