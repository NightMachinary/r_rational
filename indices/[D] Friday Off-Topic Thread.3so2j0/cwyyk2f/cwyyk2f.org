I took a look at my failed RaNoWriMo project and realized that, in spite of it failing to do what I wanted it to do, it felt like something I could convince myself to share with [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

That said, I don't trust my judgment on this particularly much, and also don't really have many options for less publicly-requested betas, so... anyone willing to beta? What it was supposed to be is not important, since what it turned into spent way too much time talking about simulations. It's also unfinished (there are only 7 complete chapters and the beginnings of an eighth, for a total of 12050 words). I can't promise that it's any good in general, only that I reread it a couple times and didn't hate it as much as I expected.
