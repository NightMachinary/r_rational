Spacebattles and sufficient velocity would also give you feedback if you wanted to post it there as well. In general their feedback would be less harsh, more encouraging and more frequent than here. However, it would probably be at a lower level of thought on average and they might be wary of actually pointing out any genuine problems. So ya'know, depends on what you're after.
