Hey, everyone! I am working on series of posts where I talk about what I've learned about writing so far:

[[https://medium.com/p/story-structure-5da799745034][Story Structure]]\\
[[https://medium.com/p/story-essence-60576fb1edc4][Story Essence]]\\
[[https://medium.com/p/how-climax-is-connected-to-other-story-elements-49e22cee3d68][How Climax is connected to other Story Elements]]\\
[[https://medium.com/p/story-writing-process-12c8560c7d21][Story writing process]]

I thought you may find this interesting.

(the articles are still drafts, I'm working on improving and expanding them, so I'd love some feedback).
