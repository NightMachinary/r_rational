My apologies -- I tried using a proxy from Dallas, Texas and that does seem to be the case.

Maybe you guys could also use a free proxy service? I have found [[http://www.proxfree.com][Proxfree]] (try France) to be generally reliable myself.. Or you could download the film somewhere -- [[http://torrentfreak.com/producer-thanks-pirates-for-stealing-his-film-071113][the producer heartily approves of it being torrented]].

I'd really appreciate if someone could dig up a link that works.. :/
