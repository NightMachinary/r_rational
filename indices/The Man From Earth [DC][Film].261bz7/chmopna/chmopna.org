What if a man from the Upper Paleolithic survived until the present day?

The Man from Earth is about a group of college professors and a grad student sitting together in a cabin during an intimate going-away party. They contemplate the plausibility of their departing professor friend's story: witnessing thousands of years of human progress first-hand.

One of the most down-to-earth depictions of a seemingly immortal man in movie history.
