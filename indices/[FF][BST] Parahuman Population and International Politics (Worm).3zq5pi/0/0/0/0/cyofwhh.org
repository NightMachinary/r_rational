You're right. The doctor is probably going to pass as a normal person. Bitch's case doesn't apply though, since she is separate from 'proper' society. But for a hypothetical animal Master, they might not get a pass. In-story, there is not clear logic to powers.

We know Bitch cannot control people, and the Protectorate might know that from experience, but the people in story that don't interact with parahumans? It's not difficult to draw false parallels between controlling humans and animals (they're both living things.)

"There must be a reason the Protectorate classifies human and animal Masters together," they'd think, either consciously or subconsciously (though the only reason they're classified as such is because the classification spread informally, then had been institutionalised.)

This isn't conclusive, or even true, but doubt is all it takes to seriously hurt a person's life. Some people are going to be generous ignore the doubt, but most are going to be cautious.

There's probably a movement to split the 'Master' Category to 'Master' and 'Beastmaster' categories or something like that.
