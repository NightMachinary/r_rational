It would depend on how many masters there were, who the strongest was, their ethical outlook, and generally how many human-controlling masters there are and how strong they are. There's Khepri, obviously, but even before that Skitter was terrifying and she was using insects. Were there even any human masters aside from Heartbreaker and his kids and August Prince? Maybe arguably Satyrical? Simurgh too I guess but that's thematically different.
