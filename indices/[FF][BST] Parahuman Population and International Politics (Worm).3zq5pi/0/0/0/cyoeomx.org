Depends on the master. I wrote a doctor with a minor thinker power that lets him know what tests to run on a patient and he also has a very minor calming aura. Not enough to pacify someone, but enough to make a patient feel a little better, set them at ease.

*Edit*: although I recall there being some question of whether this constituted a master, shaker, or stranger power when I first posed the question of what category a calming aura fits in.

In-canon there's a lot Bitch could do with giant beasts of labor. The dogs ended up plowing fields, right? That's a very useful sword-into-plowshare example.
