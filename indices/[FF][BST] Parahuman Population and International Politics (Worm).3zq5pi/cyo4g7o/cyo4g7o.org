Parahuman Population (Tabs 1 and 2):

Assumptions:

1. Scions grants powers to 1,000 parahumans per year. This contradicts canon of <100 parahumans in 1980s, but that results in growth rates that are either too low or too high (Population does not reach ~600,000 by 2011, or does, then accelerates into billions in <10 years). 1,000 per year is also about ~2-3 per day, and that seems a reasonable guess. Scion has no reason to be consciously grant more powers, and by period 20 budding growth >> Scion growth.

2. There is a limit to growth that ends in 1 in 100 of the population being parahumans. The Doylist reasons are that linear growth rates results in populations that are either too low or too high, and that I like the idea of fundamental inequality.

3. The parahuman population is distributed as such (w/ overlap):

Brute 30% Shaker 30% Mover 30% Changer 15% Blaster 15% Striker 10% Breaker 10% Tinker 5% Master 1% Thinker 1% Stranger 1% Trump 1%

This is based off of Brockton's figures, and balance issues (Brutes cause much less trouble than Thinker on a large scale, so there should be significantly less Thinkers).

International Politics (Tab 3):

Assumptions:

1. Scion grants powers and powers bud in proportion to population. The strength of the powers are also in proportion. There is no reason for Scion not to do this, and budding depends on the population of parahumans existing.

2. Parahumans are not geared to conflict. This contradicts canon, but is not acceptable in a rational setting. Because parahumans are not geared to conflict, they can be organised by states.

3. China and Russia, and especially China, are functional states. The idea of the C.U.I is not acceptable in a rational setting. Russia may be a corrupt hell-hole, but it is a corrupt hell-hole that can participate in international politics as a state.

Given these assumptions, you can see the immediate problem from the figures in Tab 3. China and India combined have 1/5 of total parahumans. The US is outnumbered by 5 by China. The US outspends China's military by 3. Not only that, parahumans are far superior to ordinary soldiers, and require far less training. Parahumans are also superior to: tanks, helicopters, bomber planes, rocket launchers, missiles, nuclear missiles, etc.

The US military advantage does not exist. Given that much of US foreign policy depends on US protection (Germany, France, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia etc. ), the political landscape should be completely changed.

Assumption:

1. Tinker-tech can be replicated by other Tinkers to some extent, and by non-parahumans to some lesser extent. That Tinker-tech cannot be replicated is not acceptable in a rational setting, but 'free' Tinker tech is likely to change society too completely. Some replication is a good balance: The tech is going to spread, but it's going to take some time. 30 years is sufficient only for the most basic and least controversial tech to be common.

Given that Tinker-tech can be replicated, and that China and India has the most Tinkers by default, China and India should be the technological hubs of 2011, give-and-take bad governance and corruption penalties. But by the 1980s China was already opening (Nixon met Mao in 1972, Shenzhen Special Economic Zone was established in 1980).

You know how DC and Marvel resort to having dudes punch each other in the face to resolve all problems? That's because the existence of superhumans change things complexly.

Does China's power cause Japan to develop nuclear weapons? Become more nationalist? Form a bloc with Korea and the South East Asian nations? Does the US become more hawkish and increase defense spending? Does the population become more conservative? Does Russia ally with the US to balance China? Does India? That's only some of the changes from one change.

I'd like to explore all these changes. If you can help me brainstorm more changes to explore, I'll be closer to a coherent, interesting and reality-conforming Rational!Worm :)
