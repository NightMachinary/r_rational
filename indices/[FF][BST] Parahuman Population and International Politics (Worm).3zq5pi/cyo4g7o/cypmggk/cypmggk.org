That doesn't sound like a very interesting universe. You're taking out the elements that make it widely interesting (emotional stuff) in favor of a purely factual approach.

#+begin_quote
  This is based off of Brockton's figures, and balance issues (Brutes cause much less trouble than Thinker on a large scale, so there should be significantly less Thinkers).
#+end_quote

Thinkers were common in canon as they were fun and interesting. Causing problems is amusing. You're making a story with less drama. Booooo.

#+begin_quote
  Scion grants powers and powers bud in proportion to population. The strength of the powers are also in proportion. There is no reason for Scion not to do this, and budding depends on the population of parahumans existing.
#+end_quote

The stories were fun because there were super emotional events in each person's life, so again, boooooo.

#+begin_quote
  Parahumans are not geared to conflict. This contradicts canon, but is not acceptable in a rational setting. Because parahumans are not geared to conflict, they can be organised by states.
#+end_quote

Sounds more like a marysuetopia. So boo, contradicting canon, and boo, removal of any obstacles to marysuetopia.

#+begin_quote
  China and Russia, and especially China, are functional states. The idea of the C.U.I is not acceptable in a rational setting. Russia may be a corrupt hell-hole, but it is a corrupt hell-hole that can participate in international politics as a state.
#+end_quote

Boooo, contradicting canon. Also, why is it not acceptable for parahumans to stage a coup? Why are you telling us that rationality can't accept coups? You are not the god of rationality.

#+begin_quote
  Given these assumptions, you can see the immediate problem from the figures in Tab 3. China and India combined have 1/5 of total parahumans. The US is outnumbered by 5 by China. The US outspends China's military by 3. Not only that, parahumans are far superior to ordinary soldiers, and require far less training. Parahumans are also superior to: tanks, helicopters, bomber planes, rocket launchers, missiles, nuclear missiles, etc.
#+end_quote

Most bar the toughest of brutes can be taken down by heavy weaponry. You're rating the general parahumans rather highly. They can certainly do a lot, but tanks and missiles often beat them. There's a reason why you have to get quite high in the prt rating before heavy weaponry is allowed. Nuclear weapons are superior to most parahumans.

#+begin_quote
  The US military advantage does not exist. Given that much of US foreign policy depends on US protection (Germany, France, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia etc. ), the political landscape should be completely changed.
#+end_quote

In assuming that parahumans are inherently all tractable to whatever goal you wish you overpower dictatorial nations. Someone like China who is continually working to suppress internal dissidence is going to face regular parahuman aided rebellions. A nation's strength will be heavily predicated on how effectively they can utilize their parahumans and stop them from going villain/ hero against the state.

You're radically changing society in a way that isn't going to appeal to people who like worm, and removing difficulties in a way that isn't going to appeal to those who dislike suetopias.

You might as well just write a superhero story in its own universe.
