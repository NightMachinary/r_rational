  On the third paragraph, that's bad phrasing on my part. There's still trigger events, but trigger events happen in proportion to population, because emotions happen in proportion to population. Though there might be some differences in classification (e.g Mexico has more Brutes because of gang conflict).
#+end_quote

Wouldn't places with more stress have a lot more trigger events, though? If you're in the middle of a civil war in the Third World, there's going to be a /lot/ of trigger-worthy events in your life.

This is kind of important in canon, actually; mild gender inequality in the US acts as an excuse for Wildbow's tendency to write female characters whenever he forgets, parahuman-enabled civil wars acts as an excuse for the Third World to get worse rather than being fixed instantly by Eidelon or Panacea, and the fact that people from lower-class backgrounds are disproportionately likely to trigger justifies the disproportionate criminality of parahumans (above and beyond the fact that the authorities have a limited ability to stop them.)

  I actually agree with you on the first Tinker point. I'm not sure where our disagreement is. On the second Tinker point, I prefer not to have them reality warp. I think that ruins the flavour of Tinkers.
#+end_quote

Yeah, rereading I think I had you completely backwards there. You're right.

  Panacea is not going to be able to break Shards. I think breaking Shards is a cheat to make Taylor important at the final battle. Given that, I think Panacea is fair in canon.
#+end_quote

Nooo. Definitely not.

Well, I mean, yes, the fact that Taylor's power could be jailbroken into such a convenient form was definitely a cheat, but Panacea is absurdly broken without that. She's probably the most powerful Tinker in canon, with the possible exception of Dragon.

She's able to cure an entire city of disease by creating self-replicating pathogens that remove it and then die off. She's able to create creatures that can fly and are strong enough to carry a human being, bugs that mimic Taylor's power, stuff like that; and that's when she's barely trying. /And everything she creates is self-replicating if she wants it to be./ And that's without even getting into the potential for transhumanism, or the fact that she has near-perfect instantaneous mind control.

If you want to remove mental restrictions on powers, you have to remove Panacea and Dragon (well, Richter.) Both of them are quite capable of fixing or destroying ... well, /everything/, pretty much, barring a few really strong parahumans.

They could be replaced with expies, though; a girl that can restore human bodies to perfect health with a touch, and a brilliant disabled woman who builds Tinkertech suits, perhaps.

  I've responded to the idea of coups earlier in this thread, but the CUI is also both communist and anti-parahuman.
#+end_quote

Hmm. I never got the impression that the CUI is anti-parahuman, exactly; and they seem to center around a restored Emperor politically. Still, I'm no expert in Chinese politics; you could just put it down to Cauldron meddling and replace it.

By the way, how are you planning to handle Cauldron? From your descriptions, they don't really seem to exist, but ... I mean, they have to, right? Worm would be completely unrecognizable without Cauldron.
