  Viruses that make people smarter might not even be all that noticeable.

Looking at [[http://www.sq.4mg.com/Image190.gif][this graph]] it seems to me, a rise in national IQ will lead to exponentially more successful states. Which makes sense because if everything in a country works better, the benefits accumulate.

Depending on how far human biology can be pushed she could make people so smart that it's like the difference between humans and chimps: sure chimps are pretty smart but we're the ones who keep them in cages and if we wanted we could easily kill all chimps on the planet. If everyone helped it would maybe take a week. Imagine if a nation got that kind of advantage from Panacea's virus.

Leaving Panacea psychologically broken is definitely necessary for her not immediately breaking the world. But it doesn't make for a rationalist story. In such a story every important character is awesome. Everyone does interesting things. Panacea not using her powers is simply frustrating. It's only tolerable if it's the shards that keep her this way.
