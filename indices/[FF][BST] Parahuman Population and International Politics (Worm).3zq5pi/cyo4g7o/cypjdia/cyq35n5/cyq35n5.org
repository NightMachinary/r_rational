Paragraph one and two are fair points. I can probably increase the proportion of Masters, Thinkers and Strangers, as long as most of them are low-rated.

On the third paragraph, that's bad phrasing on my part. There's still trigger events, but trigger events happen in proportion to population, because emotions happen in proportion to population. Though there might be some differences in classification (e.g Mexico has more Brutes because of gang conflict).

I agree, people in real life have conflict. From my perspective, therefore, there is no reason for Shard-induced conflict, that results in a lot of irrational even for irrational people.

Panacea is not going to be able to break Shards. I think breaking Shards is a cheat to make Taylor important at the final battle. Given that, I think Panacea is fair in canon.

If Brockton hospitals ship the most terminally ill or genetically disordered people to the hospital for Panacea to heal, and Panacea occasionally participates in research, healing to give insight to the healing process to medical professionals who can then scale up the process, that rationalists Panacea a bit without changing her character.

Of course, there are some healers that charge millions for, say, making aging celebrities young again. That can create a lot of conflict. Perhaps some people feel that parahumans should be forced to act for the common good. Perhaps some people feel that only rich people can afford not to age etc.

I actually agree with you on the first Tinker point. I'm not sure where our disagreement is. On the second Tinker point, I prefer not to have them reality warp. I think that ruins the flavour of Tinkers.

I've responded to the idea of coups earlier in this thread, but the CUI is also both communist and anti-parahuman. By the 1980s, and even more so by the 1990s, when the parahumans are coming into their own, China has started transitioning to Capitalism, and there is little political support for Communism.

China is surrounded by geopolitical threats: Russia, India, Japan, Korea. Tibet, Xin Jiang, Taiwan and Hong Kong are independence minded. The US is also chilling in nearby bases. There is going to be no political support for an anti-parahuman stance.

If some group manages a coup and takes an anti-parahuman stance, you'd expect immediate meddling by their neighbours who don't want civil war spilling into their countries, or millions of Chinese fleeing China into their country.

You'd also expect the military and every parahuman and parahuman group in China to oppose the group. You'd also expect civilians to oppose such an illegitimate government, especially if the legitimate government is agitating against them. No such group is going to last, though the exact outcome of such a Conflict is hard to predict.

The CUI is a result of the author thinking "Wouldn't it be cool if China were like North Korea?". But China is not North Korea.
