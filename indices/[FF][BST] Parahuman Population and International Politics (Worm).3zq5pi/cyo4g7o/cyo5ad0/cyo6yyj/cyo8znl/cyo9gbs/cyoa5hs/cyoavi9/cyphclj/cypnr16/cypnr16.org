That kind of makes sense. I think you're right that Bonesaw is a good example of the failings of the power classification system.

The point of the system isn't really to accurately describe how something works, its not like the entities actually created abilities in those different buckets. It's just shorthand for discussing powers.

I believe there is actually a discussion of pros/cons of the system in cannon (pros like improved response in emergency, cons like misunderstandings of the true nature of the power).
