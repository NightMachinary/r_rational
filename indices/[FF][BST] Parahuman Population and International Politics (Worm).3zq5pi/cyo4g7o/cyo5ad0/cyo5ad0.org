I'm confused...are you looking to write a Worm rat!metafic? If so, I don't think you're going to succeed -- Worm isn't a rational story and can't be made one.

You're talking about a setting where a strong FAI exists, free energy is trivial to generate, and space-magic tech is freely available. If you're playing by rational rules, that can't end up looking like anything other than post-Singularity. You can write a post-Singularity story that uses the flavor of Worm, but it won't be a Worm metafic.
