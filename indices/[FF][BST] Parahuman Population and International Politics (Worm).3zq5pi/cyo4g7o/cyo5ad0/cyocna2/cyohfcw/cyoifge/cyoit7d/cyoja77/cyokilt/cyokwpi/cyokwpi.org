The PRT /should/ have been doing that, but the PRT was also headed by a super who was part of a shadowy paramilitary organization, so their whole operation is in doubt. It was also never done on screen (to my knowledge) which leaves plenty of canonical wiggle room to explain why their efforts failed, who sabotaged them, the difficulties they ran into, etc.

I think I must be behind on Weaver 9; I never picked it up after it went dormant and there are more chapters than I remember. I think I'll give that a read tonight, thanks for point me at it.
