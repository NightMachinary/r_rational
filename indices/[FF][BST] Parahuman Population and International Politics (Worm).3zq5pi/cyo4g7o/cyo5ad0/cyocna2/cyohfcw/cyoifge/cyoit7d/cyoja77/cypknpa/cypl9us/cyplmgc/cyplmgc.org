All Doctor Mother really did was act as the non-parahuman face of Cauldron, and the only reason she got that job was because Contessa decided she needed some help. I suppose you're right that she got almost no characterization, but altogether she wasn't all that important.

I suppose what makes her interesting is that anyone with a reasonable amount of intelligence could have done what she did, which made her completely unique among Worm's character base. Every other important character was either a parahuman (and thus was the only person who could do what they did by definition), the relative of a parahuman (Mr. Herbert) ,or a politician. Dr. Mother really just got lucky enough to stumble on Contessa just as she realized what needed to be done to achieve victory over Scion, which makes her the only person in the story who had her position "just cuz."
