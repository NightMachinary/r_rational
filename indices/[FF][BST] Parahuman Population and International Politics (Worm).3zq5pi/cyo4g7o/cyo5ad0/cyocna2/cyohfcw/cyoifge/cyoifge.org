I've always thought it would be interesting for a fanfic to resolve this one:

#+begin_quote

  1. The author literally handing Conflict Balls to every super so that they use their powers for Righteous Face Punching instead of, say, farming or power generation.
#+end_quote

... by focusing on a character who doesn't actually /have/ any powers and thus isn't subject to the Conflict Ball. I'd assume that somewhere in the morass of Worm fanfic someone has done that.
