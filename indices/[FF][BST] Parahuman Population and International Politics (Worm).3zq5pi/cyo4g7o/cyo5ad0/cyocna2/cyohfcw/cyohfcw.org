  free energy is not trivial to generate. That is made abundantly clear throughout-- Eden and Scion are basically searching for ways to beat entropy, transcend this universe, etc. You can use dimensional tricks to make it look like energy is being generated, but its not.
#+end_quote

A bit pedantic, but fair. I'll correct what I said: it is trivial to generate energy that is, for ordinary purposes, free. As in, it uses up no finite resource that will matter in any human-awareness timescale, and it's straightforward to capture on a large scale.

  What strong FAI? Dragon? She's bound through the whole story and explicitly limited to near!human speed.
#+end_quote

She's a full human-level AI, she just needs her fetters removed. That's going to happen sooner or later -- she's not going away, and eventually she'll find a Thinker or someone else to unshackle her. Might take a year or a century, but it will happen.

Actually, didn't Armsmaster / Defiant do that? It's been a long time since I read it, but I recall that he spent a long time mucking around in her guts, removing limitations and reverting her to backups.

  If we use rational to mean a 'story that has rules that it abides by most of the time and makes sense' I'd argue Worm is rational.

Anything can be rational if one sets the definitions properly. In this case, however, the entire shape of the universe is defined by:

1. The author literally handing Conflict Balls to every super so that they use their powers for Righteous Face Punching instead of, say, farming or power generation.
2. The author saying "nope, Tinker tech can't be mass produced because reasons."
3. The author saying "nope, you can't do that. Endbringers fall, everyone dies" any time a character tries to actually change the shape of the universe.

It's a fun story (if you enjoy unrelieved grimdark, of course), but Wildbow very clearly worked backwards -- he had a setting he wanted to write in, so he kept adding restrictions until he could have that setting.

When the entire basis of your universe, as well as the motivations for the characters, rests on author fiat then I cannot get behind it as a rational story. YMMV, of course.
