Re: Dragon

I think a post Worm story does have to deal with Unchained (mostly-- its not clear exactly which limits Defiant manages to lift at the end) Dragon, so I hope Worm's sequel addresses that without a copout, but in the story time frame we care about Dragon is pretty limited.

Re:

I do think that the shards-->conflict idea of Worm is one of its weaker points. I don't see a way around it if you want anything resembling a traditional superhero story with superpowered fighting isntead of superpowered economies. I don't think Wildbow does a perfect job with justifying Worm's setting, but he does a better job than most authors.

Re: Endbringers

I agree with you here to some degree. I think the introduction of the EB as one of the principal factors stopping advancement drastically changed the tone of the story from 'dark but with hope' to 'needlessly dark'.

It makes a ton of sense in context with the whole schtick of the Entities and the way thy foster conflict, but it does affect the overall tone of the work in a way that many don't like.

I basically agree with you that Wildbow worked backwards to make Worm-- but I enjoyed it enough that I liked it regardless.
