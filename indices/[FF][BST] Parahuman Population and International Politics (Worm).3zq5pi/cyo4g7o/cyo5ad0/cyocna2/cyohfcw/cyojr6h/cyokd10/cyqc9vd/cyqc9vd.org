  Does it? Isn't the whole idea that the Entities are doing this because they want to drive humanity into advancing so that we'll invent a way to reverse entropy? How does artificially capping our ability to develop work with that goal?

No. The Entities have no interest in advancing humanity to the point that humanity solves entropy. They don't even think that humanity is capable of it, as far as we can tell.

Their goal is to squeeze every single bit of incremental improvement in using very limited versions of their powers from humanity, hoping for insight or just to catalogue all the uses of a shard.

If they actually planned to ride humanity to victory they would give it more than 300 years.
