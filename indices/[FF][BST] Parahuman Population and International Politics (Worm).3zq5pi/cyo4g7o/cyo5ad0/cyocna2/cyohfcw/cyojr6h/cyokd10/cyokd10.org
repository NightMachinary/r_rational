  It makes a ton of sense in context with the whole schtick of the Entities and the way thy foster conflict, but it does affect the overall tone of the work in a way that many don't like.

Does it? Isn't the whole idea that the Entities are doing this because they want to drive humanity into advancing so that we'll invent a way to reverse entropy? How does artificially capping our ability to develop work with that goal?

  I do think that the shards-->conflict idea of Worm is one of its weaker points. I don't see a way around it if you want anything resembling a traditional superhero story with superpowered fighting isntead of superpowered economies.

That's pretty much my point. You can't have characters behaving like real humans and also have a traditional superhero story.
