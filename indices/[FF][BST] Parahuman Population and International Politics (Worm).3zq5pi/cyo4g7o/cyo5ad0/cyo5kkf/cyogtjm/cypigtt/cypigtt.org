See, I'd argue it's /excellent/ author fiat. Don't look at Worm as a ground up build. It's entirely top down. It reminds me of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun][Shadowrun]]. If you're not familiar, Shadowrun is what happened when a late 80's rpg design lead declared "Let's mash up Neuromancer and Lord of the Rings. And do everything we can to race players down the rabbit hole of Authorial Fiat Bullshit." Wildbow started with the premise "world that looks recognizably like a superhero genre setting", and then tried to justify it as well as he could. "Nigh-Omniscient Idiot Space Whales" was a great one, pulled off extremely well for it's medium and editing realities.

  Actually, I should modify what I said earlier: you can tell a pre-Singularity story in the setting you describe, you just don't have a big window in which to do it. You have until Dragon becomes unfettered, basically. If she never becomes unfettered, then you have a decade or two. So, yes, there's scope there for some really interesting exploration as long as you rule that Dragon's fetters can't be undone.

In the story we see, her fetters can be loosened, but there have so far always been severe side effects. And I know people 'round these parts like to assume that the path from "strong, free AI" to "human irrelevancy" takes at most 3 hours, but it wouldn't violate my SoD if that took more like years/decades. Come to think of it, I'd love a fixfic in which Dragon Unbound shepherds humanity through a much more pleasant version of Accelerando.
