If that is the case, no Rational superhero story can exist, including yours eaglejarl ;) I'm going for the HPMOR route. Some aspects of the story are changed to allow for more rational decision-making (e.g. Shards not affecting psychology) and the core mechanics (Scion, Shards, powers, Endbringers, Protectorate etc.) and characters are kept. The problems of decision-making still exist.

Powers are not distributed 'fairly'. Some countries or family groups might have them disproportionately. Free-energy, for example, is considerably less free if it's tied up in one or two parahumans that can generate sufficient energy to sustain a power plant, and they are controlled by say... Romania. Powers many not have equal utility (Brutes vs Thinkers), and there might be exploitation of one group by another (Brute cannon fodder? Brute slaves in Thai fishing boats or Peruvian mines?).

You can dump future-tech into crappy planet, just as you can dump developed country-tech into a crappy country, but that doesn't mean all of them problems of the receiver of aid is resolved. Social institutions, co-operation problems, path dependency etc. all change the results for better or worse. If there's overall benefit, it still doesn't mean the receiver transitions overnight. It might still be interesting to explore the long-drawn transitions.
