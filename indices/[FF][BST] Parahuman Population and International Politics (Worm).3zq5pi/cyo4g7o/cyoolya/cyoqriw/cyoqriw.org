Scion's partner died because of the Third Entity. Her remains scattered across Earth-space. Scion, depressed, starts acting strangely. He distributes the shards (powers, Endbringers, etc.) that are meant for his offense and defense against other entities and inter-galactic cultures.

I don't particularly like the explanation of giving inferior life forms powers to 'harvest' them. It's probably be cheaper for the Entities to harvest the star system and not bother. Though at some point you just have to shrug and say 'it's magic.'

As for Mary Sues, some people are going to gain from powers, and some people are going to lose. Some people lose their jobs to more efficient parahumans, some parahumans create entirely new jobs. Some of Earth-Bet's technology is far superior to our time, in some places organised-crime becomes more entrenched etc.

Part of the point of the story is that powers change society like technology changes society.
