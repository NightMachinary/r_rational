  Characters need plausible reasons and Scion is one of them.

Scion is a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens][starfish alien]]. I am okay with rational fiction occasionally involving aliens so far removed from humans that we can only make vague, flawed guesses as to the reasons for their behaviour. As long as they remain background elements, anyway. (I.e. it's more okay for Scion than for Endbringers.)
