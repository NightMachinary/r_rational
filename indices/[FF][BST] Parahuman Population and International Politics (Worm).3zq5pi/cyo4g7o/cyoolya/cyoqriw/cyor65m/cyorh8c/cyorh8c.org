There has to be some point that 'the plot requires it', or you'd get silly like asking, 'Why is there magic?' in a Harry Potter universe. This is fiction, not real life, and there has to be a point of suspension of disbelief. The point is to minimise the points.

By letting Scion be the point of suspension of disbelief, the other characters can be more rational. Though I think depression is a fair enough post-hoc explanation. The point about entropy is noted, though it doesn't particularly matter. It's still cheaper for the Entity to try and do that on their own.

As for the Endbringers, Eidolon did not create the Endbringers. Scion created the Endbringers but they were dormant. Who 'woke' the Endbringers is fairly irrelevant to the story.
