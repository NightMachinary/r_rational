- Well, actually Rowling doesn't explicitly states 'Why is there magic?', so fanfic writter also doesn't have to do so. However if you contradict and throw out already estabilished lore, you should put something in it's place.

- The thing is that Scion makes rules of this particular world cease to be consistent.

- I think, that entities are just gathering data, that they can use to defeat entropy by lending people special abilities. And during conflicts they can gather more data.

- IIRC it wasn't neither Eidolon nor Scion, but Thinker/Eden and then they were unleashed by something else (possibly Eidolon).
