In order:

Thinkers are not common in canon. Thinkers appear to be common because the important people were Thinkers, because Thinkers have disproportionate effects. The spreadsheet represents a summary of the populations. This is necessary so that I do not create /too many/ Thinkers, because Thinkers are easy solutions to problems. By limiting the number of Thinkers, and defining those Thinkers, these Thinkers can cause problems, and I can expand on those problems. If I don't define the Thinkers, "Why didn't X do Y" is going to be a serious issue.

Strong emotions still cause triggers. Having triggers in proportion to the population does not exclude that. It just means people feel emotions in all countries, though some of those emotions might differ country to country because of culture. East Asia, for example, might have more Thinkers because of the stress they place on placing examinations.

The spreadsheet does not account for this, because it's a bit of work to do so, and regardless of the distribution of power classifications, the problem of China and India having 40% of the parahuman population still exists.

Conflict exists with and without powers. People are still greedy, lazy, hateful, complacent, etc. without Shard-induced conflict. I removed the Shard-induced conflict to remove the conflict balls in this story. If people gained powers, realistically, all societal order does not just break down.

It is rational for parahumans to stage coups. But China is united (sort-of, excluding the territories in dispute e.g. Taiwan) at the time of Scion. How does the they know who else is disgruntled, or who else has powers? The problems that apply to normal coups still apply to parahuman coups.

A group of parahumans that has no popular support is never going to topple the government of a functioning state. Because the state itself is going to control parahumans, and the state controls the parahumans of all of its territories.

That's not to say China doesn't have problems. With powers, Tibet and Xinjiang are going to be a lot more difficult for China to control. China probably forces parahumans to register their power in those territories. Hong Kong and Taiwan might become more independent.

I think most Brutes can survive machine-gun fire. I think that's a reasonable baseline to be considered a 'Brute', since normal people can survive, say, pistol fire. So Brutes are almost certainly superior to regular infantry.

Not all Brutes can destroy Tanks, maybe. But if Alexandria can stop on 100 tanks per minute, then tanks stop being viable for war against the United States. If Germany, France, the UK, Russia etc. all have high-tier flying bricks, then tanks stop being viable for war, especially since tanks aren't free. You can repeat the logic for any other weapon.

Statistically, there are going to be high-tier flying bricks in every major country, or high-tier flying cannons etc.

I hope that I've explained satisfactorily. I really do like Worm and it's characters. What I'm trying to do is remove the elements that are generally considered irrational by other users. Of course, if I remove those elements Worm is going to be different. But hopefully still Worm-y.
