  They have lots of less op powers. Like 360 vision, enhanced multitasking, perfect memory and enhanced intellect, mastery of skills. Their prophesy powers are often not as reliable as in canon. In a prt quest that wildbow ran he had one future seer who saw an alternative version of the future with a loose correlation to future events.

You're right. I conflated Thinkers w/ powerful Thinkers. There are probably going to be more Thinkers of a weaker sort, though more powerful Thinkers still have to be limited.

  But less. You're taking a universe with lots of interesting conflict and smoothing it out so that the moderate elements can take over. It's like someone looking at our world and going "Guns seem unnecessarily conflict forming and irrational, I'm going to make a world where they don't exist. But nuclear bombs still do, so states are afraid to go to war."

Fair enough. I don't think so, but this seems to be a matter of preference.

  Tinker powers for communication. Mobile phones and social networks come early. Masters to win popular support.

I don't think this is sufficient rebuttal. There are phones and charismatic leaders in our universe, but there aren't coups everywhere. You could argue that Tinkers and Masters are better than phones and charismatic leaders, but to the extent of ignoring all established societal structure? I don't think that's likely.

  Most in story can't. Aegis can't, as he's just very redundant. Glory girl can't, she's a one hit wonder. Fenja and Menja and Lung are vulnerable if ever hit at range before they power up. Night is vulnerable if you look at her. Even Alexandria is vulnerable to gas attacks, and she's almost unique in that she's got a top tier shard without the normal limitations due to Eden.

Fair enough. I haven't thought out the implications of parahuman warfare fully. Though I'd quibble that Glory Girl is likely dead in canon if she's fighting thugs and cannot stand machine gun fire, and Lung is likely also dead from being sniped. So it's not like canon is internally consistent.
