  You're right. I conflated Thinkers w/ powerful Thinkers. There are probably going to be more Thinkers of a weaker sort, though more powerful Thinkers still have to be limited.

Yeah. I think generalist thinkers are the big problem. Ones who can learn anything about anything. They have limitations, but those are easy enough to power around. Likewise with Tinkers, very generalist ones would be easier to munchkin in that they could build technology on a similar tech tree to ours. It's hard to reverse engineer crystal star alien technology.

  I don't think this is sufficient rebuttal. There are phones and persuasive people in our universe, but there isn't coups everywhere.

They allow popular support to be gathered quickly, and masters and thinkers and such allow you to take control of the local nobility. The right brutes or shakers or blasters allow you to assassinate the leadership. Popular support allows things like the arab springs, cape firepower allows a simulation of military support.
