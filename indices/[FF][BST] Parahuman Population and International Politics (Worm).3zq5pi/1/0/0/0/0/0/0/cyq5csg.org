  It doesn't seem widely popular in this thread.

Strange, I thought people only tend to comment if they disagree ;)

  They allow popular support to be gathered quickly, and masters and thinkers and such allow you to take control of the local nobility. The right brutes or shakers or blasters allow you to assassinate the leadership. Popular support allows things like the arab springs, cape firepower allows a simulation of military support.

A Master, Thinker, Tinker etc. alone is not sufficient for a coup. They'd need to gather other supporting capes. How do they do so? Nobody is going to openly tell your their powers and their political positions. The other capes might be geographically and culturally separated. If they disagree with the existing power structure, they might disagree in a different way from you. And in gathering supporting capes you're risking the state's (Thinker-enhanced) intelligence agencies detecting you.

It's simple to imagine an established rebel group that defeats existing power structure, but the difficulty is that such a rebel group is difficult to establish.
