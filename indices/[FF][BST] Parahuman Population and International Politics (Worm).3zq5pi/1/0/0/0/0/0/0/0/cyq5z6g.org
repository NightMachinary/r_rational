Disagree, yes, but with whom?

  A Master, Thinker, Tinker etc. alone is not sufficient for a coup. They'd need to gather other supporting capes. How do they do so?

Not very effective ones. China was very chaotic in those times since the state had encouraged mass mob justice and purged most of its more intelligent civilians. They were likely at their weakest levels in centuries.
