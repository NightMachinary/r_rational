  There's lots of organizations in China with hundreds of people, and lots of remote regions with less monitoring.

Political organisations outside of the CCP, I don't think so. I don't even think there are significant organisations outside the CCP. There's a law limiting gatherings of more than 40 people today, though I'm not sure if it applied then. The geographic dispersion is an issue, but it doesn't help the coordination problems of potential rebels.

Potential rebels also have the problem of personality and capability match. Some random peasant that can read minds is more likely to try to make money than take over the government, or they might not have the capability to stealthily expand their power. If the CCP is more unpopular or less centralised, its easier to coordinate; you could just go to the nearest opposition group and tell them you have powers. But I don't think those conditions exist.

In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood had long been established. In Iraq, ISIS's leadership consists of former Ba'athist leadership that had been displaced by the US.

  Not very effective ones. China was very chaotic in those times since the state had encouraged mass mob justice and purged most of its more intelligent civilians. They were likely at their weakest levels in centuries.

That might be true. I don't feel like I know enough about China's intelligence community to say for sure. But intelligence does not strictly need to be gathered by intelligence agencies. It could just as easily be passed up the chain of command. Mr. Li might report to the CCP head of his village that Mr. Wong is asking 'wrong' questions of the other villagers. The CCP head of the village is going to report to the CCP head of the province, etc.

I feel at this point, though, it's better to resolve these argument by writing rather than arguing.
