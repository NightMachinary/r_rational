  Thinkers are not common in canon. Thinkers appear to be common because the important people were Thinkers, because Thinkers have disproportionate effects. The spreadsheet represents a summary of the populations.

Nah, there's quite a few thinkers.

#+begin_quote
  This is necessary so that I do not create too many Thinkers, because Thinkers are easy solutions to problems.

They have lots of less op powers. Like 360 vision, enhanced multitasking, perfect memory and enhanced intellect, mastery of skills. Their prophesy powers are often not as reliable as in canon. In a prt quest that wildbow ran he had one future seer who saw an alternative version of the future with a loose correlation to future events.

  Conflict exists with and without powers. People are still greedy, lazy, hateful, complacent, etc. without Shard-induced conflict. I removed the Shard-induced conflict to remove the conflict balls in this story. If people gained powers, realistically, all societal order does not just break down.

But less. You're taking a universe with lots of interesting conflict and smoothing it out so that the moderate elements can take over.

It's like someone looking at our world and going "Guns seem unnecessarily conflict forming and irrational, I'm going to make a world where they don't exist. But nuclear bombs still do, so states are afraid to go to war."

  It is rational for parahumans to stage coups. But China is united (sort-of, excluding the territories in dispute e.g. Taiwan) at the time of Scion. How does the they know who else is disgruntled, or who else has powers? The problems that apply to normal coups still apply to parahuman coups.

Tinker powers for communication. Mobile phones and social networks come early. Masters to win popular support.

  I think most Brutes can survive machine-gun fire. I think that's a reasonable baseline to be considered a 'Brute', since normal people can survive, say, pistol fire. So Brutes are almost certainly superior to regular infantry.

Most in story can't. Aegis can't, as he's just very redundant. Glory girl can't, she's a one hit wonder. Fenja and Menja and Lung are vulnerable if ever hit at range before they power up. Night is vulnerable if you look at her. Even Alexandria is vulnerable to gas attacks, and she's almost unique in that she's got a top tier shard without the normal limitations due to Eden.

  I really do like Worm and it's characters.
#+end_quote

You don't seem to know them very well, or the ins and outs. Thinkers aren't just solve it alls, brutes vary a great deal in livability. Do you know who Glory Girl or Aegis are?

#+begin_quote
  What I'm trying to do is remove the elements that are generally considered irrational by other users.

Looking at earlier threads there's hardly general consensus. A number do dislike the violence motive, although the point is made that it's fairly subtle- if it wasn't pointed out it wouldn't necessarily be obvious.
