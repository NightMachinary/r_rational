There is a good chance that something akin to Toybox (a large, unstructured community of tinkers with no government affiliation) would still arise.

Once it hits critical mass, when all the cool toys are there and they're too tough and too useful to be worth opposing, it could even snowball into something much bigger. /Weaver Nine/'s Society, perhaps. The Endbringers are what prevents this in canon, and I'm not sure how much room rational!Worm has for Endbringers.
