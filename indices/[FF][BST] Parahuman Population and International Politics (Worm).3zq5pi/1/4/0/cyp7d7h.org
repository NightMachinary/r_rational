It's likely, but I'm not sure how influential groups like that might be. Contessa can surely PTV them into breaking up or selling out etc. There are likely other Thinkers capable of crippling group before it becomes a threat.

I don't think any government is going to tolerate a large, independent group of Tinkers just as they're not going to tolerate, say, a 10,000 strong mercenary force.

The Tinkers can claim to only use their power for self-defense all they like, but the government knows if they are subjected to some policy they don't like, they are going to use their leverage to ignore the government's authority.
