What you're saying might be the case. I don't know enough to say for sure. Most likely, I'll limit Panacea to affecting one person at a time (so no positive viruses), so there's some effect, but a limited effect. I highly doubt society as a whole will accept such a modification in any case. Eugenics has the potential to achieve what you're proposing Panacea to do, but it's completely taboo. I'd prefer to limit a parahuman's capabilities rather than a parahuman's psychology, but I realise that's a personal preference.

P.S. Your graph is broken.
