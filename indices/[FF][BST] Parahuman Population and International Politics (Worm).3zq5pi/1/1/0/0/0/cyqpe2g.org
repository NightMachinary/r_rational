  Wouldn't places with more stress have a lot more trigger events, though? If you're in the middle of a civil war in the Third World, there's going to be a lot of trigger-worthy events in your life.

True. That creates the problem of defining 'stress' though. Is being so stressed about examinations that you consider committing suicide as stressed as being nearly run over by a car? Being run over by a truck? Is bullying 'stress' compared to nearly being shot at by drug dealers? Is depression stress? Does apathy because of trauma mean you're not 'stressed'?

It could go either way, I haven't thought about it too much yet.

  If you want to remove mental restrictions on powers, you have to remove Panacea and Dragon (well, Richter.) Both of them are quite capable of fixing or destroying ... well, everything, pretty much, barring a few really strong parahumans.

I want to keep Panacea and Dragon as much as possible. I like them very much, and because I'm getting rid of a lot of elements of Worm, I need to keep some elements of it. Dragon is probably fine as she is for the reasons others stated.

I'd probably tone Panacea's powers down however. She can create diseases, sure. She can cure diseases, sure. She can 'improve' people and animals, sure. But no disease-curing 'plagues'. I'd keep her mental issues. Her crush on Victoria and her limiting herself from her 'true' potential power (e.g. making people younger or smarter, becoming more politically influential, spreading deadly plague) are still perfectly plausible for a normal human.

Then again, I could also imagine someone having the power to create viruses that can make people smarter, and not doing it. There could be all sort of implications that a single person might think is too much for them to handle, or they might not want to be burdened with people asking more from them (since you can make people smarter, can you make my child, specifically, smarter?).

Viruses that make people smarter might not even be all that noticeable. A lot of people in the US are probably smarter today because there's no lead in their pipes, but there's no horde of intellectuals roaming around the US.

  By the way, how are you planning to handle Cauldron? From your descriptions, they don't really seem to exist, but ... I mean, they have to, right? Worm would be completely unrecognizable without Cauldron.
#+end_quote

Cauldron still exists, and they're still messing around. I don't have a grasp of the consequences of that yet, but at least on first impression nothing much has to change.

Contessa could still perpetuate wars in certain regions as parahuman factories, and she might not mess around with political powers much as long as they are compliant to demands, since adding more criteria to her paths likely lengthens her paths. She is also not going to promote wars everywhere since she needs centralisation for her power to be useful, or she'd be herding hundreds of millions of cats.
