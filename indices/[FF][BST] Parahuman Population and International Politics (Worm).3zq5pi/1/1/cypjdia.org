These assumptions don't make a lot of sense to me.

If Masters, Thinkers, Strangers and Trumps are all vanishingly rare, then there's no reason to have separate categories for them in the first place - it would make more sense to lump them together as "weird/meta stuff", much like the actual Trump category in canon.

It also seems odd from a balance perspective, given that most of the Masters and Thinkers we see seem to be quite weak - danger senses, sensing roughly what category a person's powers fit into, mapping out the area around you, stuff like that; while almost all Masters in canon just create disposable minions. We don't see many Strangers at all (amusingly), but given that Shadow Stalker is classified as a stranger, I suspect the same is true of them.

It seems very strange to me that powers are given out "in proportion to population" - are you doing away with trigger events entirely? Why? Obviously this is going to completely break the canon setting to the point where it's unrecognizable.

You declare that Tinker limitations and subtle Shard influences are "not acceptable in a rational setting". Why? People in real life already have biases and shortcomings, and there's no reason for Shards /not/ to make use of mind-affecting abilities to prevent, for example, Panacea from immediately destroying everything. The entirety of HPMOR, /the/ original ratfic, takes place [[#s][with a hero who]]

Similarly, real technology requires a significant technology base in order to produce and maintain. Factor in the fact that many Tinkers canonically have other powers, the sheer flood of mismatched one-off items, and the fact that they're designed with little concern for safety or ease of production - not to mention the fact that Tinkers possess only enough information to operate the devices - and it doesn't seem unreasonable that we'd end up with "only" a technology boom. But if this really seems unacceptable, why not declare that all Tinkers are making heavy use of reality-warping powers? It makes more sense than setting your story in the middle of an immediate Singularity.

I'm also not entirely sure why you reject the idea of the CUI; parahuman powers can obviously lead to revolutions fairly easily if the population isn't heavily invested (or feels actively oppressed by) in the current system, and the CUI seems to do pretty well using a few core powers with great synergy to absorb most others into their power structure.

They have a great, effective system that scales well, and which they believe is the only way to avoid the world ending. Their only failing is that they violated international law in a quick power grab, and ended up isolated from the international community, which seems like exactly the sort of conflict you'd expect in a ratfic.
