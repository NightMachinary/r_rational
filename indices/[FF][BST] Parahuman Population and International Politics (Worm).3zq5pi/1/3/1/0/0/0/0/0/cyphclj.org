In Bonesaw's interlude, we see that her power is basically Contessa's PTV limited to medical applications. After she triggers, she always "knew what to do to fix" massive injuries. Though it doesn't really work for other tinkers, I would submit that Bonesaw is actually a hyper - specialized thinker who has minor tinker powers to steady her hands and make spiders.
