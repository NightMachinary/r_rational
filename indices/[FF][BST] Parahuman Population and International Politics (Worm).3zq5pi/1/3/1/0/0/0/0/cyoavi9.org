Further down in the thread [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/scourge-19-6/#comment-12315][Wildbow admits that might be a bad answer]].

I think the striker answer implies that there is good science backing the item, it's just science beyond current human understanding. The power just helps the tinker leapfrog the current manufacturing limitations.

The reason that their shit is always breaking is because the power does a half-ass job, fault tolerances are too low, it doesn't go through the equivalent of UL lab certification. The reason they can 'tune up' items is because of the power hackery being re-applied.
