The striker explanation that I didn't adequately describe, and one which you are probably already familiar with and may already be referring to, is not that the striker ability is actively making the item work, but that it periodically alters an item while a tinker is working on it, such as to alter its molecular composition, and so the tinker doesn't know it's happened. Having no basis in science I assume such changes could still be analyzed and reverse engineered, should the material be replicable, and so that's a plot issue.

Really, it seems to my recollection that most of the plot issues of Worm come from Wildbow either vastly underestimating or vastly overestimating how powerful X organization or Y superpower would be.

I'd have made tinkers only rarely trigger into being very good at complicated technology, and instead made them component workers. Tinker A makes amazing capacitors, Tinker B makes the best batteries, et al.
