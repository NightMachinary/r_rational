Word of God is contradictory on the subject. [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/scourge-19-6/#comment-12175][Here's Wildbow's first pass at it.]] This is a Bad Explanation, for a number of reasons. But I don't like the striker explanation either, because there are a number of cases where Tinker tech is loaned out for extended periods of time, or where Tinker tech requires no obvious interaction from a parahuman, or where Tinker tech continues on going even after the Tinker dies, or etc.

Mostly I just find Tinkers to be really problematic.
