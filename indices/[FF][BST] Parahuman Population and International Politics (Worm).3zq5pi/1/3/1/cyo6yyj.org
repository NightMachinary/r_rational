I think you could write a rational story set in the Wormverse, even if you include a lot of the head-scratching conceits. I think there's a lot to answer, but with one exception none of the answers are that hard (the exception being Tinkertech, which makes no damned sense, because reverse-engineering is a thing). You can keep the conflict-ball in play and free energy doesn't actually matter that much.

However, I also agree that making such extensive changes /probably/ results in a world that only has a weak flavor of Worm, since it's going to be so drastically different. If you remove so many of the supporting posts, you have to replace them with your own, so you're sort of just left borrowing characters and places and writing your own superhero fiction in Worm drag. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just ... different.
