You're right that it's going to be different. I do like Worm's core mechanics immensely though. My impression of the Rational genre (at least for fanfics) is: Keep the core mechanic and character backstory (but not necessarily their reaction to it), change the other mechanics and details of the story to be more 'rational'. Hence HPMOR's Harry bears no resemblance to actual Harry Rational!Narutos bears no resemblance to canon Naruto, etc.
