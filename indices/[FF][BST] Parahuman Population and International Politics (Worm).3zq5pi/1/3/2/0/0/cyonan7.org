Well, considering Simurgh's POV section, the Endbringers might be a counter to Dragon's unfettering, since she's using the flapping of butterfly wings to pwn Dragon's boxen. Actually by that token, isn't Simurgh basically a UFAI that Eidolon unknowningly created? So, the grace period seems to extend to Dragon unfettering and Simurgh's pacification.
