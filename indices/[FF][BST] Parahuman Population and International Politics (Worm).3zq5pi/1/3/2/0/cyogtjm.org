  If that is the case, no Rational superhero story can exist, including yours eaglejarl ;)

I was actually making two separate claims: (Worm is not a rational story) and (if you remove the parts that make it non-rational but keep all the flavor, you will end up with a post-Singularity story).

The reason I feel it's not rational is because everything about the story rests on "the shards are Conflict Balls" or "the Endbringers keep you from doing anything sensible." It's thinly disguised author fiat.

  You can dump future-tech into crappy planet, just as you can dump developed country-tech into a crappy country, but that doesn't mean all of them problems of the receiver of aid is resolved. Social institutions, co-operation problems, path dependency etc. all change the results for better or worse. If there's overall benefit, it still doesn't mean the receiver transitions overnight. It might still be interesting to explore the long-drawn transitions.

Actually, I should modify what I said earlier: you /can/ tell a pre-Singularity story in the setting you describe, you just don't have a big window in which to do it. You have until Dragon becomes unfettered, basically. If she never becomes unfettered, then you have a decade or two. So, yes, there's scope there for some really interesting exploration as long as you rule that Dragon's fetters can't be undone.
