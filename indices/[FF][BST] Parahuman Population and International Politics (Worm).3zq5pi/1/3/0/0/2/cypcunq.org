  She's a full human-level AI, she just needs her fetters removed. That's going to happen sooner or later -- she's not going away, and eventually she'll find a Thinker or someone else to unshackle her. Might take a year or a century, but it will happen. Actually, didn't Armsmaster / Defiant do that? It's been a long time since I read it, but I recall that he spent a long time mucking around in her guts, removing limitations and reverting her to backups.

Yeah. This is treated with an appropriate amount of caution by the characters (well, except Defiant), and only succeeds in extremely limited ways. It also prompts one character (Saint) to disable her for much of the climax for fear that she might successfully take over the world if unbound. (Also worth noting that she's bound to forcibly prevent anyone who tries to remove her limitations, although she circumvents this through the obvious method.)

Wildbow has mentioned that her creator was specifically made by his shard to limit his creations as much as possible, because "allowing an unbound AI to be created would be a grave error by the entities".
