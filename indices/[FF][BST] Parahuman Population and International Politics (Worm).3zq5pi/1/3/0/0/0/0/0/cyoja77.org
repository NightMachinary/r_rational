Yeah, either a scientist who interacts with supers in some way or a hidden mastermind who manipulates them into channeling their conflict drive towards something productive. Possibly both. Or someone working hard on the tinker problem to try to identify the issues with reverse engineering and mass production (someone who doesn't take "just because" as an answer). Which maybe fails or maybe doesn't, depending on which of the justifications for that rule you go with.

All of that still leaves the Endbringer problem in play, and it would be dangerous as hell (because of the supers), but those are to some extent interesting problems for an intelligent character to solve rather than simply intractable. If the Simurgh comes down every time someone tries to unravel tinker tech, then our protagonist can try to work around that in a variety of ways (in other words, make the first step of the story "secure self against Endbringers" rather than "break superpowers").
