Yeah, I was thinking of Doctor Mother to some extent. For someone who seemed to be behind everything, she got a very small amount of a characterization (in a serial that gave almost everyone loads and loads of characterization). It also seemed like she was supposed to have more of a purpose than she ended up having. But it's been awhile since I've read Worm, so I might be forgetting something important in that regard. I hardly ever hear her mentioned though.
