- Okay, why does Scion give people powers? What does he gain from that and how does it balance out energy loss?

- Also why have you kept Endbringers? In a world like that there is no point in their existence.

- And how do Trigger Events work in your fanfic? Because their trauma-based origin would mean, that Shards often go to less rational humans.

BTW be careful to not turn it into some [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia][Mary Suetopia]].
