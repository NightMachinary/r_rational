Just have it as a social experiment by sufficiently advanced aliens that went horribly wrong. The original purpose of scion and the shards was to stress test, shape and advance alien civilizations without violating their independence. At the end of the cycle the civilization would be assessed. If it has shown itself to be incapable of creating a sufficiently enlightened society then it is exterminated by Scion, otherwise it gets uploaded and introduced to galactic society by Eden.

The issue of the third entity completely screwed over normal operations which is why Scion is not operating as well as he should and will become genocidal at some point.
