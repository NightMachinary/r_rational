- Actually there is. If entities were to gather combat data by themselves, it would mean fighting exclusively between themselves, what could lead to their extinction. Not a clever idea.

- On the other hand giving sapient creatures access to their Shards lets entities gather combat data in RELATIVELY safe way. It doesn't matter if hosts die, since IIRC Shards may be redistributed.

- And why would entities care how humans evolve?
