On the gathering data point: there is no actual need for Scion to give out the shards to gather data. You could draw a parallel of shards to genes: It'd be as if humans randomly gave out their genes to viruses, then studied the viruses. Sure, you can do that, but you could also just use something like DNA recombination. There should be means of gathering data that don't involve the 1*10^{-x} chance that humans are going to evolve usefully.
