I agree. >90% of people are not criminal under US conditions. I'd argue that Masters are significantly more likely to be criminal though. Their powers don't have a 'good' use and the mere fact that they can use it creates suspicion.

If outed Masters cannot find regular jobs, they may have no recourse but to find criminal jobs. That further justifies the suspicion.

The suspicion also creates a biased sample: Masters that can hide their powers choose to use their powers like Shakers, for example (Glory Girl anyone?), or they may choose not to use their powers at all. So only criminal Masters are identified, further increasing suspicion.

Of course, given that triggers may correlate to emotional states and more controversially, personalities, this suspicion may be entirely justified. Not that your suspicion of someone that can make you love them is unjustified. If you thought that the person in front of you is a madman and could hurt you, you are in every right to not hire them.
