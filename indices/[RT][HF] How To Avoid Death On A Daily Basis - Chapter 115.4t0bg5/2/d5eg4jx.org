Thanks, Mooderino! Take a break if you need one, I'm sure you'll be just as awesome a week from now.

I am pretty hyped up about this development with Cheng, but the uncertainty of Colin/Jenny sustained from the very beginning has finally been resolved, so of course that's what most of the comments are about.

For weeks now we've been rather vocal about how we wanted that ship to sink. How does just-leave-me-alone Colin work with I-know-what's-best-for-you Jenny? She seems awfully self-righteous and the sort of person who would try to "fix" him with her love and make him feel guilty when it inevitably turns out that he isn't fixable.

Would Colin be happier if he were less prickly and insecure, and instead a more outgoing, trusting person with a positive outlook on life? Sure. Also all of them idiots would have been dead.

I just hope this story isn't going to take a turn to where he is "transformed by the power of love" or something. I guess I'll just have to trust the author. Mood has been good at subverting expectations so far.

I don't want it to turn all rainbows and bunnicorns from now on romance-wise because that would be unrealistic given the protagonist's personality. But neither do I want to read much Colin/Jenny relationship angst. That would be a bit too real for this lighthearted escapist piece of fiction.

Maybe my issue is that I recognize myself in Colin? Well, good luck to him anyway. As for me, I will die alone, and I will deserve it.
