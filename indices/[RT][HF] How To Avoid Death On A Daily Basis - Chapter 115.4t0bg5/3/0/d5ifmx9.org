Not at all actually. It was only after someone mentioned Moss that I saw the resemblance, but personally I always envisioned him more like Eddie Murphy's character from [[http://www.movieactors.com/photos-2003/murphy89.jpeg][Bowfinger]]. This is because that's what the real guy looks like and his name actually is Maurice.
