Thanks. I think I drifted into more emotional territory this book,with the whole Attica thing. The way i write means a lot of it comes down to whatever mood I'm in on the day.

Same with the side characters. I always mean to flesh them out more, but deadlines loom and I rush to write something that at least makes sense (barely in some cases).

As for the comments, it's such a relief to have readers I really don't mind them having a go, even if they sometimes horribly misinterpret what I'm trying to say. Better than being ignored.
