It's nice that you're optimistic about these things, that attitude can go far in dealing with constant disagreement on your work. Which is something that can stop or ruin creating works for many artists.

Now to give slight review of new book.

Ten days until new chapters? After such a tease? You are a cruel man.

humor is still great, though a bit sparse I feel in comparison to previous 100 chapters, though that can be due to be binging them and reading new ones as they come. Dunno.

I am a bit miffed that Colin didn't go pyro on the monsters that kill Attica. A deterrent works if it is used.

I also feel other characters need more development. Dudley, Flossie, Clara a substantial amount; Maurice (more comic/movie related shenanigans/playing) and Jenny (I don't feel her love of Colin and motives, also how does Colin look like? is he even moderately attractive? I think its my mental model that cant get over Jenny liking him based on personality) a moderate amount.

Shame if Laney doesn't play a bigger role in story, I adore her character and her interaction with Colin (general interaction, not romance related)

Keep up the good work. Know that I have refreshed your pages every day this week just to read a bit more of your story.
