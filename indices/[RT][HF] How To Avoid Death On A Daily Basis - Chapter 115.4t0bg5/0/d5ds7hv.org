Read up to the current chapter; I'm still very much enjoying it, even if I don't like all the characters. Which is not to say I dislike the story; Holden Caulfield being a totally unlikable protagonist doesn't make /Catcher in the Rye/ any less of a worthy read.

Then I read the comments on the final chapter. What the absolute hell is wrong with some of these people? I swear it sounds like some MRA group latched onto the story and hate that Colin is becoming less of a curmudgeon and gets "manipulated" into sex by a girl he actually fancies but fears getting close to.

It was just so odd to finish the chapter and think to myself "I wonder if anyone else has theories that Cheng is actually a Visitor like I do?" and then see the vitriol spewed there.
