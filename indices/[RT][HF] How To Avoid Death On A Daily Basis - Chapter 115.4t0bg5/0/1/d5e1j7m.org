My educated guess is the proportion of readers from [[/r/rational]] is much smaller and most readers come from Royalroad, where the overall quality of series and reader discussion is much lower.

It's a shame since the comments are the most active discussion platform I've come across, yet you have to dig through incessant complaints that the main ship isn't to their taste.

About your theory, I think that /if/ Cheng is a visitor, he's not likely to have a human form, which could be possible if baseline humans can be mutated into monsters (might explain the wide variance in species we see in the camp versus the homogeneous races introduced earlier). Some alternatives are: he could be a descendant of the first visitors, he's currently connected with visitor(s), Colin is the Chosen One to receive the heirloom scroll passed down the ages (jk), or someone taught him the magic word for dealing with Englishmen.
