I wish I had your imagination for fantastic technology and logistics because I love everything you've written here. I always just accepted this stuff as part of the plot, but you've addressed them in a way that fits so well into what we already know about the setting that I want both to be my headcanon. [[/u/NotACauldronAgent][u/NotACauldronAgent]] makes some great points too, particularly about the state of AI in this world.

The "miracle of logistics", in particular, is a concept I've always liked because it can be used to justify weird stuff while still emphasizing the mundane intelligence and hard work it required to create. I've been using the same idea so much while building the world for a [[http://www.baseraiders.com/about/][Base Raiders]] campaign that part of me just wants to throw crazy ideas at you and see how you creatively rationalize them.
