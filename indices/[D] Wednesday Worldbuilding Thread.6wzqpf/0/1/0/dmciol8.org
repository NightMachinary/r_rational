Yeah, I took this into consideration. Still, there's a problem with time and number of people involved. If that was the case, I don't think a single teacher responsible for hypothetical Weapon-Building class would be able to manage a large group of students, so that implies other people. Not everyone has a relative that is knowledgeable about this stuff, so they wouldn't rely on family. That leaves advisors of some kind, but even if they assigned one advisor per student to help them with building the Weapons, it would still take a lot of people to cover the whole school -- and would that even be enough? I don't think that's feasible -- it would make more sense to just make Weapon-Building easy enough for kids to do it relatively independently. A couple of people to give tips and tricks is alright, but actively helping with something that a student couldn't do themselves would be hard.

Also, I forgot that Atlas has robots. Still, the same ideas that apply to the Weapons apply to other tech, and if I remember correctly, these robots weren't even that intelligent. They had a humanoid design, sure, but I always thought that they were just simple â€˜target and shoot' type, not an AI like Penny.
