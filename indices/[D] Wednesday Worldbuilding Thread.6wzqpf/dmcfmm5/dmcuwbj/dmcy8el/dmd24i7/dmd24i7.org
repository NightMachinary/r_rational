Thanks. Base Raiders is a premise with so much story potential for a variety of genres that I've put together tons of notes filled with crazy ideas, at least half of which are thinly-veiled references. My intention is to use them for a improv-heavy sandbox campaign where the players can do whatever they want, so the GM will just grab ideas out of the bag as needed. PM me your email and I can send you the Evernote docs, though I should probably put them in Google docs instead.
