I've just realized most of my internet fame, especially here, is from these discussion chains. I've argued against and with much more famous people on this sub, in topics ranging from Harry Potter to AI balancing. I think that's pretty neat.

Also, I agree with the whole Logistical Primacy thing. With strange inputs and lots of cooperation, lots of things can be made possible. Discussing crazy ideas is one of my favorite things to do, so if you do do it, I'd love to help.
