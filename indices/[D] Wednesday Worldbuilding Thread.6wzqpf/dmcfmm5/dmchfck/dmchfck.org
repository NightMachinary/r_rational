Some minor points:

Crescent Rose isn't a pinnacle weapon. Qrow's scythe is even more out there with more functions, and many, such as Glynda's crop and Weiss's Myrtenaster can channel semblances much better. On a similar note, I'm pretty sure it's been implied that they are helped in construction by adults. It still doesn't explain folding technology, but it's not as though every kids a tech genius.

Similarly, Atlas has lots of subsentient robots, so have some skill. Haven't the slightest on how robotic souls work, but there may be a "system assist" involved-once it gets close enough to sentient it gains a soul and becomes fully sentient.
