For the first bit, how about a shop class? Here's the basics, sketch out designs, we'll come around and help you with the hard parts. Of our main characters, we've got two legacies of powerful hunters, (RY), apprentice of the leader of a powerful organization (B), Heiress to fantasy megacorp apple+standard oil (W), and a fighting champion with ad revenue(P). I don't know enough about N&R's backgrounds, but all the really cool weapons are at least kinda understandable, we have a sampling bias.

For robots, you have to remember they're pretty widely spread. Schnee Dust Company has Spider-Bot security for trains, and those have some strategy and planning. With enough Proliferation and both private and public sector research, reaching human level sentience might not be too much of a stretch. After all, if potentially mass-producible Aura-Bots are available, not only is that organization richer than god/savior of the four kingdoms, they also have under control, hopefully, a private hunter army, something Atlas and Schnee, so probably others, desperately want.
