Huh, I was pretty sure they were overpowered and would have to escape somehow rather than fight, given the previous chapter's very scary description of how dangerous even the single Shiftry was! I guess Shiftry do not account for allies hidden in pokeballs :D

As always, your writing gets better and better with each chapter. Really good tension! I like the relative lack of plot armor preventing things from dying, it will make future fights more intense.
