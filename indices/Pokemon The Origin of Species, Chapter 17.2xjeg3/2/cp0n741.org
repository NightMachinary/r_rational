So Blue got a Shiftry. At the loss of his Caterpie and Beedrill. I don't think it was worth it, especially considering how much that 'mon's gonna be hating him for dismembering it.

The part with Red and Leaf was interesting, as was the differences of pokemon between regions - even the same species can have differences it seems, just like reality! I also liked how Leaf gave the Pichu to Red, and apologized about his dead Hoothoot.
