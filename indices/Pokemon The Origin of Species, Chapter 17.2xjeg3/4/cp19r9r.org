I liked the fight scene. It did a good job of keeping up the tension. I didn't realize this before, but how does Squirtle expel so much water? Does it store compressed water somewhere? Do its attacks in this story use up less water than in the games/anime? It makes more sense for a Blastoise, which is large enough to hold a lot of compressed water, but not really for a Squirtle. Even absorbing water through the skin shouldn't give it access to that much - google tells me that at 20 degrees Celsius you can't get more than 15 mL per cubic meter.

Since the names Volta, Faraday, etc. exist, does that mean this pokemon world is a post-apocalyptic version of ours? Or is that just a reference. I'm looking forward to finding out.
