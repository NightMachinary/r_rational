I was actually thinking that it doesn't hold it inside itself as water, but as compressed oxygen and compressed hydrogen, in two separate bladders in its body. When it prepares to spit some, it releases a bit from both into a third chamber that turns the gasses into water.

The problem with this is it would require a source of high heat inside Squirtle's body, and on top of that the third bladder would need to be incredibly chilled.

(and of course the danger of exploding turtles during battle)

I'm not sure which is more feasible: that it has such a complex and potentially dangerous internal organs, or that the one bladder that holds water is able to exert absolutely insane amounts of pressure.

It's yet another one of those cases where I just look at GameFreak and think "Does *anyone there* own a basic science textbook?!"
