I think a bladder that exerts a lot of pressure is much more feasible. I'm not a physicist, I only know a bit about biology, but the oxygen/hydrogen reaction is explosive, and while it'd probably be possible to release the energy slowly through a chain of reactions with enzymes that would result in water slowly being produced in the third bladder, which would defeat the purpose of using a reaction to quickly produce the water. Compressing the water by an insane amount probably doesn't work either in terms of the physics, but in terms of evolution it's a lot simpler to just have really strong muscles compressing a tough bladder. The only real-life animal that shoots water that I found on google is the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archerfish][archerfish]], which simply applies pressure and doesn't have water storage issues for obvious reasons. Many fish store oxygen in their swim bladders to adjust their buoyancy, but it's kept in non-compressed, gaseous form. Perhaps for Squirtle it would make more sense for it to use very thin, very accurate, high pressure streams or bursts of water to target weak spots like eyes so that it could achieve more with less water. But you have to work with what Gamefreak gives you, I suppose. I'm looking forward to your explanation of how Pokemon use moves like Surf indoors.
