Hi!

I just stumbled upon this recently. I was looking for something to fill the void that HPMOR will be leaving. I really like that you've picked Pok√©mon to do a rationalist version of :D

As others have mentioned, your writing (and my enjoyment of the story) has steadily improved as you've written more. Perhaps I'll give critiques at a later time, but for now, please take this message to /keep on writing this story/! I'm very much immersed in this world you've adapted, the characters you've developed, and there's so much possibility! I'm very much interested in seeing where you take the story from here.

And above all else, thank you :)
