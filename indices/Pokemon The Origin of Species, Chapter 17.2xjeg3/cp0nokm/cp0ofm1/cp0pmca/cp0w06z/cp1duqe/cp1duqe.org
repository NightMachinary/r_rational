That just makes it even better in my opinion, Mat was my favourite character in TWoT. I'm really loving Blue and Red, they have a really interesting dynamic, especially with Leaf just sort of tossed into the middle of their friendship. There's so much potential in this story for interesting character conflicts, and it really seems to me that you're doing an excellent job of pacing and keeping the focus narrow enough (if we end up with more than 6 characters driving the plot, I'll be shocked). This is my favourite fiction that I'm currently reading.
