So your comment just made me think that there's more to the "reference" that [[/u/PrinceofMagnets]] mentioned than I thought. After a google that brought about surprisingly specific results, I regret to inform everyone that I have never read Wheel of Time, nor heard that phrase used in connection to it XD I didn't even know it was a "saying" of any importance: it's just what came to mind for Blue's thinking, the way someone playing pokemon in our world or a sim in his would have to, eventually, take a chance on a capture without knowing if it would stick. Since pokeballs work on a binary catch-nocatch system in my world, this was the closest thing to taking a chance on a capture that they'd get.

I'm not sure if that detracts from the enjoyment or not, but I figured it's best to be honest :)
