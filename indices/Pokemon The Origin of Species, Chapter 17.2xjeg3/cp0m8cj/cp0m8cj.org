Hey everyone, welcome back, and sorry for the cliffhanger! Also sorry for the slightly late chapter: those of you caught up on HPMOR can probably guess what distracted me.

So, one of the readers brought up some good questions about pokeball functionality and the hoothoot's death in his review, and I wanted to share some edits and clarification here:

Even if Red had registered his hoothoot with his pokedex, he can't just catch another pokemon and overwrite its data with the hoothoot's: pokemon don't become "energy" per se. They are basically atomized and compressed into a mass of what looks like energy, much like the light of the Star Trek transporters. The actual pokemon that was captured needs to be the one used, or else a pokemon that's almost literally a copy of it down to the atomic level, or else risk major complications. Just think of the gut bacteria and antibodies that need to be recreated. It's theoretically possible, but so difficult that it's rarely attempted and has never been successful.

Pokeballs are so arbitrarily powerful that the temptation to include more features and failsafes and capabilities than those included in the games/anime, like wireless data backup and automatic registry, have to be resisted. Since I need to draw the line of how powerful they are somewhere, I'm trying to stick to the games' capabilities as much as possible, and even come up with various miscellaneous restrictions (battery life, mass limits, "lock on" requirement) to explain why people in the games and anime don't, for example, fly over wild pokemon dropping pokeballs on them until they're caught.

Otherwise, taken at face value with how they /seem/ to work, the munchkinry would be so powerful and so obvious that the only explanation for why people in the games and anime don't use them that way and are still smart enough to tie their shoelaces in the morning is that pokeballs /can't/ be used that way, and it's just up to our imagination, or in this case mine, to come up with reasons why.

Hope that makes sense, and if anyone has new questions or objections to note, I'm really interested in hearing them, as always!
