  Perhaps for Squirtle it would make more sense for it to use very thin, very accurate, high pressure streams or bursts of water to target weak spots like eyes so that it could achieve more with less water.

That's mostly what I've been doing so far: the deluge of water used this chapter quickly exhausted his reserves, but before that he's been using short high pressure bursts.

  I'm looking forward to your explanation of how Pokemon use moves like Surf indoors.

Oh, no, screw that. I have no problem whatsoever simply dismissing that as a game conceit :P Same with being able to use fish-pokemon like goldeen out of water.
