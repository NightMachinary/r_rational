It is distinctly different from the Obliviate spell because, in this situation, the psychic can see your memories as well. So they'll know every countermeasure you put in place to remind yourself and systematically destroy it. If they can't destroy it, then they may decide to change their mind and kill you anyways to prevent the spread.
