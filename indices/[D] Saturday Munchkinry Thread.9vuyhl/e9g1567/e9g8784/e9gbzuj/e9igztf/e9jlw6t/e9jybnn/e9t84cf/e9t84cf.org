1) Don't give them reason to suspect that you know of their existence. Failing that, don't let them know where you are.

Also, if we're gonna rules-lawyer this point, wear clothes over your entire body and you're technically not in line of sight. Also, since earshot is dependent on ambient sound, play very loud noise.

Alternatively, upload evidence of it to the internet with a script that will distribute it unless you periodically give it an all clear from your fingerprint enabled phone. Have a friend change the password for you so that you can only get into the phone with your fingerprint. Leave your phone with a different friend. The being will know if they don't set you free they set themselves back, and from there you can escape.

2) Tell everyone you can think of, upload it to the internet, distribute it as much as possible. It can only delete one person's memories at a time as far as we know, so an exponential rate of increase in those who know it will far outpace a linear rate of deletion. It'll cycle back around to you eventually.

3) lure them to a wide open space with a single building (e.g. a farmhouse). Get some friends, get some guns, and get some loud music. Fill it with lead before it gets within earshot (again, assuming earshot is dependent on ambient sound).

4) Flee, leaving an obvious clue to a secondary where you're going next. Call your friends as you leave, and have them prepare the scenario outlined above. Have one of them leave directions to the farmhouse and then leave as you drive directly there. The being will find the directions; but since your friend is gone that will be their only lead on you. Now it has to come to you, and we're back to #3.
