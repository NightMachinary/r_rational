Well, 3 seems rather obvious. Some variation on delivering excessive amount of death from outside of your hearing range, such as traps with explosives, rockets with explosives, bombs with explosives, long-ranged sniper rifles, etc. Specific weapon would depend on the specifics of the setting, obviously, and resources you have at hand. Ideally, you'd do this while they sleep or are otherwise distracted, so as to minimise the chance of them dodging the attack, finding you and turning you into a vegetable.

4 seems somewhat irrelevant, as we don't yet have any information that would depend on time, and any strategies we could propose would either be too general or would depend on more than just time(see above). As for 2, that depends on how the mind reading works. Do they get your sensory stream? Your sensory stream + your internal monologue? Your internal monologue + translation of that monologue? Do they need to concentrate to read and understand the memories? If so, can they read 1 minute of memories in 1 minute of time, or is it faster? If faster, how much faster? When they read memories, how effective is their comprehension of those memories?

If they get your memory stream, but no translation, then it could be avoided by, for example, thinking in a language your opponent doesn't know, and then somehow convincing them you weren't thinking about them. This is for future encounters, as we can assume they would remove your entire memory stream for the last several hours just to be sure. To send information about this first encounter to your future self, obvious strategy is to write a message to yourself, hide it in a place where you would check, and then erase your own memory of writing the message, if you can edit your own memories.
