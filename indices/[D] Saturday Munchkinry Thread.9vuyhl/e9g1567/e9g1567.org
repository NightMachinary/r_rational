Reverse munchkin:

Your opponent can paralyze you (and anyone around you) by saying a word (you don't know which word, and it doesn't matter whether or not you hear it, so long as you're within their line of sight and earshot). While you're paralyzed, your opponent can look through your memories and delete whichever ones they want. You don't know what your opponent looks like, or whether there might be more than one of them. You're ignorant of whatever other abilities they might possess.

Your opponent doesn't appear to want to hurt you, which would presumably be trivial for them. Instead, your opponent wants to remove all knowledge of them from your mind and erase all physical evidence of themselves from the world.

You learned all of this five minutes ago.

1. How do you prevent your mind from being erased in the future?
2. Failing that, how do you hide evidence for your future mind-erased self?
3. How do you defeat your opponent, assuming that they have no other abilities than those listed above?
4. The above, but you don't think you have more than a half hour before your opponent comes back.
