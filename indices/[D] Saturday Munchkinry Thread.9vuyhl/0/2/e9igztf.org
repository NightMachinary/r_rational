  How do you prevent your mind from being erased in the future?

How motivated is my opponent to hide its existence?

Because if it's ready to kill me to hide its presence, I'm kind of screwed. It can paralyze me with a thought, and presumably slit my throat or something similar. Unless my opponent is a ghost which can't affect the physical world, in which case I'll just send an email to myself.

How much evidence do I have of the opponent's existence? If it's sufficient to be delivered to the authorities, I'll do that and let them deal with the problem. If it's not, again, I'm kind of screwed.

I guess the spirit of the question is that I should find some way to send the information that will automatically be sent back to me, and can't be canceled by the ghost mind-reading my password or erasing the memories of the people I told the secret to... If I only have 30 minutes, I could send a PM to MagicWeasel and hope that my opponent either can't use GeoIp or isn't able to travel to Australia before /she/ manages to spread the information however she can.
