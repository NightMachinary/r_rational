This is exactly the dilemma faced by the police constable in /Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty/, when she realises that Death Eaters are going around, killing people and wiping memories. Her method of defeating the wizardly /Obliviate/ spells involved a series of hidden messages to herself, reminding her of the problem in question...

Following on that basis; my memories are not safe. I must rely on external information sources which cannot be easily deleted - things like a server designed to regularly email me a given text file, or a lawyer told to hold an envelope until I /don't/ call every week and then send it to me, that sort of thing. (Ideally things that can't be taken down by anyone else, no matter how many passwords they may have).

As to the specific questions:

  How do you prevent your mind from being erased in the future?
#+end_quote

As long as I am in line-of-sight and earshot of them I'm vulnerable. The solution, then, must take one of two forms - either I must never be in line-of-sight and earshot, or it must never be safe to paralyse me.

The first option involves me becoming a hermit, perhaps even going to the International Space Station to make sure no-one can get at me.

The second option is to ensure that I am /always/ visible to a lot of people at a remote location; such as by having my entire life broadcast as a TV show. Since the Adversaries don't (and can't) know when anyone is watching the TV show, they don't dare paralyse me (because any watchers will immediately know that Something Is Up).

  Failing that, how do you hide evidence for your future mind-erased self?
#+end_quote

Any and every way I can. Sticky notes under my breakfast table. Replace the music on my music player with voice recordings of me saying "Alright, listen up, this is what's going on..." Leave a letter with a lawyer with instructions to send me a copy any time I haven't called them within the last eight days (then call them once a week as long as I remember). Leave a letter with another lawyer with instructions not to send the letter at all until I either stop paying a (small) weekly fee or ask for it - and then set up with my bank to pay the weekly fee automatically. (If I can't remember what I'm paying that fee for, you can /bet/ I'm going to show up to get to the bottom of that).

#+begin_quote
  How do you defeat your opponent, assuming that they have no other abilities than those listed above?
#+end_quote

That depends on exactly what my long-term aims are. If by 'defeat them' you mean 'prevent them from remaining hidden in the long term', then I create a wide-spread piece of fiction including people with /their exact powers/ as a major plot point - along with instructions for how to defeat those powers. Some people will follow the strategies given, and eventually they will become well-known...

#+begin_quote
  The above, but you don't think you have more than a half hour before your opponent comes back.
#+end_quote

This depends a /lot/ on what I have on me. I need to send out a message informing of their nature; I need to do so in such a way that the message cannot be easily stopped or intercepted. Options include:

- Write the message down and sneak it into something that will be delivered out of the area
- Carve it into a piece of fruit and throw it out the window
- Send out an email to anyone and everyone I can think of, and post the info publicly on reddit or similar
- Use a sharp knife to cut a message into my trousers (the Adversaries might take my shirt and make me forget they did it, but I'll notice if I'm suddenly pants-free or if I'm abruptly wearing pants that I've never owned before)
- Or, better yet, carve a word or two into the soles of my shoes (I don't own many shoes, so I /will/ notice if they're missing)
