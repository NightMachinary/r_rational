Does the opponent know I know? If not, is the danger just based on them routinely polling the memories of passerby to find someone who knows the secret?

If they don't want to hurt me, and aren't actively hunting me, then honestly, I have things I need to do. I don't have time to battle an antimemetic psychic monster. I'll instead try to use my memories to communicate cooperation.

I'll write a message in big bold letters, read it multiple times outloud, memorize it, whatever makes the memory obvious to the opponent when they're sifting through my mind. Then I'll shred and burn the message so the opponent doesn't feel the need to break into my house. I'll also take a short nap before and after doing this whole thing so that if the memory gets erased, I won't notice.

If the opponent happens to read my mind, the message will state that I don't intend to take any action to spread information about the opponent, and ask them to please just remove the directly relevant memories. If I really really want to keep my memories, then the message could also contain an offer to act as an informant. Ask them to leave a method of contact, and in exchange for avoiding mind-wipe, I can alert them of anyone talking about men-in-black or shadowy beings or whatever. Maybe they'd be willing to tolerate a small compliant leak to decrease the risk of noncompliant leaks.

If I know they are actively malicious and need to stop them, things become more difficult.

What does line-of-sight mean? I'm guessing walls block it. But what about a full body jumpsuit and veil. Is the shielding from mind-control based on thickness? Opacity? Whatever the details are, if I know of a way to walk around safely without getting hit by mind-wammies, I'm going to share that information with everyone I know.

If I'm a powerful individual, I could try to lay a trap. Gather a huge crowd of people, have a bunch of snipers that can see the crowd but are out of earshot. Have a bunch of armed guards hidden in the shadows wearing protective equipment. Then have an unprotected individual announce to the crowd everything we know about the opponent. Either they do nothing and an uncontrollably secrecy breach occurs, or they strike and make themself vulnerable.
