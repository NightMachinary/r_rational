So, I may or may not be doomed, and whilst the entity seems benign right now the existential threat it poses is clear. I must get the information out in a way that can't be revoked. Luckily the Internet is ideal for this.

First I buy some server space from a company with lots of locations. Probably Google. If you want to destroy the server you'd have to destroy a majority of Google's infrastructure, and subsequently everyone's memory of how big Google is. This requires the editing of billions of memories simultaneously (or a mass extinction).

So now I have safe server space. I write all of the information I know on it. I then create a worm(hah) as best as I'm able to spread the information. Let's ignore for now that this is an international crime. Worms are tricky to detect and this one doesn't have to be fast acting. It should probably spread via random emails and dodge Google addresses so they don't detect it.

Finally for good measure I encrypt the server with RSA and a random hash. Something that couldn't be guessed in the lifetime of the sun.

The end effect of all this is that there will be a worm out there that, even if neutralised, will likely be retained for study at the least. Plus hopefully the text would attain big enough viral status to propogate through other means.

It is likely people won't believe the text with the paucity of evidence I have, but at the least it will make overt actions by the entity very obvious. This will persuade it to either lie low or kill everyone.

I'm gambling that the entity doesn't want to kill everyone. I'd point out that doing nothing is the same gamble but it's not reassuring.

So that's my proposal, defeat the antimeme with a meme. It's convenient that the entity is so limited and can't grow exponentially like a virus can.

P. S Edit, I love your work!
