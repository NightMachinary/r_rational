Actually, I was just kidding. You won't like it. You definitely won't. There's nothing remotely interesting for you to see here. Just a bunch of boring, obscure and excessively complicated nerdy stuff, like literature, science, philosophy, rationality, customizable strategy gaming and anything else I feel like writing about. No, seriously, it's very dry and boring and only very dry and boring people read it. Don't click the link, you will regret it if you do.
