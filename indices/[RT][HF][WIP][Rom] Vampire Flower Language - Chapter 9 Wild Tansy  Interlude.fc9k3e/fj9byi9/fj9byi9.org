Chapter title is Wild Tansy, and the Wild Tansy is apparently Victorian flower language for /"I declare war against you"/. Apparently the Victorians had a flair for the dramatic, much like vampires do.

No real discussion questions beyond "bloody hell Elodia, can you calm down or what?" and "what should Red's priorities be now? What should William's be?"

Next chapter is called Nasturtium.

On a meta level, the next chapter also marks the place where I go from "very well prepped chapters" to "kinda prepped chapters". I don't think this will be noticeable in the text, but it's just a minor source of anxiety for me, I guess? :)
