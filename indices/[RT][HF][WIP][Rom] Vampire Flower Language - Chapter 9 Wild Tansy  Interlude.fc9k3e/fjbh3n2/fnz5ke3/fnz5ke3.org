Oh good, I'm glad I have that effect on you :)

Unfortunately the lightning bolt of inspiration was for the third "volume" of this story. We're about two thirds of the way through the first "volume" at the moment, to give you an idea.

That said, the lightning bolt you gave me was by making me think more about what Lucia's motivations are and what the logical conclusion of that is vis-a-vis her position in society.

Hope that helps, and sorry I took so long to respond to this message (I'd planned a mini-hiatus becuase my boyfriend was visiting from France and then covid made him getting back home to France a bit of a problem. Eeek).

BTW - just uploaded the new chapter: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744/chapters/57046285]] - I will make a post in the subreddit for my sweet, sweet karma, but hopefully you enjoy this one.
