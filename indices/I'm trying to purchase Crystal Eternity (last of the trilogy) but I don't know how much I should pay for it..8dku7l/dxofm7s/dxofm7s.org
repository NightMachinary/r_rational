Why not buy it at the lowest price offered? Assuming you'll still get the book no matter what price you pay, you wouldn't be 'giving your money for an experiment', you'd still be buying the book.

Unless you suspect this price experimentation is all Amazon's idea, and Max Harms didn't authorise it (or did so accidentally or reluctantly) and would rather you paid $12.39. In that case, you should pay $12.39.

It was a stable Â£6.99 for me on UK Amazon (which converts to about EUR7.97 and $9.81, so $7.95 seems like a good price and $12.39 seems like a bad deal). I tried downloading the sample to see if that changed the price, but it didn't make any difference.
