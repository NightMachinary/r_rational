So, I'm happy and all that the world didn't end, but I'm not sure this deserves much attention.

The system he was monitoring was new, and the reports looked anomalous. As anyone who has had to deal with the deployment of new systems knows, there are bound to be bugs. Suppose that Petrov had done the right thing and passed along the report along with his suspicions. The next person would probably have asked how likely it was to be a system glitch, and made the same choice.

The fact is that it wasn't his job to make the decision. I'm glad he was on the Soviet's side and not mine.
