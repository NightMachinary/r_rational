Well if you're looking for something that's probably the opposite of rational but nonetheless a valid deconstruction of a crazy lady in a magical bus, I'd recommend the Iris Wildthyme series(es) of books and audios. I think Big Finish Productions actually just released a new boxset of her adventures; if it's the same quality as their other Iris work, I'd recommend it.
