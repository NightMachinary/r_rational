  The reason people don't give this advice, and prefer the "copy a character from somewhere else" advice, is that even experienced authors often forget to give a character the little humanizing tics and foibles unique to each human being, instead focusing on the "big-picture" qualities they have that determine their plot arc.

Is the "copy a character" advice really common? I've read a lot of articles about fiction writing, and I've never seen anyone recommend this. More often, they recommend writing strategies to “get to know” your character.

  When you're writing something not intended to be portrayed by actors, you have to go through both parts of this process yourself. And it's slow going.

Acting is a very different process from fiction writing, though. It's true that some authors take a while to discover the right voice for their characters, but you can always go back and edit previous chapters. I certainly had to do that with my earlier fiction writing. Still, I wouldn't say the process is always slow going.

In fact, a lot of authors find character building to be one of the easiest, most enjoyable parts of the writing process. It's not about building a character using an objective, top-down process, but more like a very organic, subjective experience that invokes feelings, memories and all kinds of senses to discover who the character is. Experienced authors often know their characters inside and out before they put the pen to paper, which is why their writing voice is very strong and compelling.

(Not that you can't also do this with the top-down process, but that getting to know your character has to be meaningful to you, not just a...laundry list of traits, I guess.)

  (Note: I'm not suggesting you build a character as "X's portrayal of Y applied to Z." Rather, you invent your own Z---an original character that actually fits, in character-dynamic and setting senses---into your story. Do all the same top-down work you'd otherwise do---like you said, by choosing an MBTI type for them, or deciding what mental illnesses they're hinted to have at subclinical levels, or figuring out what fatal character flaw will doom them in your tragedy. You do all that, to come up with a character sketch for your original character. And then, having done that, you color it in by treating some portrayal of some character that you understand well as your muse for tics and foibles.)

Hmm. So, I think all authors do this, to a certain extent. You create your own character, then realize, “oh hey, my character reminds me of Sherlock Holmes” or “huh, this character has some similar traits to my best friend in college.” It might be tempting, at this point, to “color in” the character with copied mannerisms from these people. And I suppose you can do this, if it's justified, but typically I use these similarities as inspiration for how my character should "feel." I'll modify some aspects of personality based on patterns I notice, but it's minor tweaks, if anything. Their core remains the same.

As for copying a /random/ character's quirks, just because you feel like your character will be one dimensional if you don't? Well...I don't see how that would help. What makes a character interesting is their identity: motivation, interests, family history, fears and desires. All of these things color the person, make them real in the reader's mind. But what /really/ grounds them is how they interact with the other characters. If you can make /those/ scenes have an emotional impact, then you'll have readers eagerly turning the pages. Random character quirks, if they exist, are just bonus.

I am curious, though. Is character building a common problem in rational fiction? I know that a compelling plot seems to be the most important thing, so I could see this leading to plot driven stories, versus character driven. It would be interesting if rational fiction tends toward a detached view on characters and their relationships, since this is so different from what's common in other writing genres.
