  Rather than directly copying a character, I tend to prefer blending traits from multiple sources. Some people use common character archetypes, and others draw inspiration from psychology theory (Myers-Briggs, Enneagram, Zodiac, etc.) I've even had some friends use things like Hogwarts houses and favorite member of the Beatles to differentiate their characters.

The reason people don't give this advice, and prefer the "copy a character from somewhere else" advice, is that even experienced authors often forget to give a character the little humanizing tics and foibles unique to each human being, instead focusing on the "big-picture" qualities they have that determine their plot arc.

In other words, a character made from the "top down" more often than not ends up feeling like a collection of tropes, rather than a character.

When /not/ copying characters from others, characters usually start out as "cardboard cutouts" of themselves, and tend to only gain a "voice" as the story goes on for long enough that the author can recall things they did once on a whim, and decide to make those into parts of who the character is.

This is most easily observed in the production of long-running television series, as this process of adding tics and foibles is usually left to /the actor/ rather than being incorporated into the screenwriting. So this is, for example, the difference between /Star Trek: TNG/ seasons 1 and 2 (what people call the "growing the beard" moment): in season 1, the actors were just going off the character as the script represented them; whereas, by season 2, everyone understood their character well-enough to give them their own "flavour." It's when the actors begin to "ham it up" in their roles, changing the characters from things that exist in service to the plot, into memorable standalone people in their own right.

When you're writing something not intended to be portrayed by actors, you have to go through both parts of this process yourself. And it's slow going.

The easy way to /speed it up/ is to decide, "in the mind of the actor", that the flavour they've decided to inject into their character regardless of the wishes of the "director", is exactly that same /flavor/ that you've observed being portrayed somewhere else.

Note that this is not the same as copying the /character/. The advice usually ignores this part. The goal isn't to take Sherlock Holmes and put them in Lord of the Rings. The goal is to create an original character, with their own beliefs, strengths, weaknesses, and personality---their own top-down design---and then /flavor/ them with the /tics and foibles/ of a particular /portrayal/ of Sherlock Holmes that you enjoyed. To mentally /cast a particular actor/ to play your character's role, and then, rather than describing the character, to describe how that actor would /play/ your character if the director said to "play this role just like you played that previous role."

--------------

There's a visual equivalent of this, that might help to understand the distinction better. Picture a cartoon or anime series---where there's already a top-down visual character design and portrayal---being adapted to live-action. Now consider the difference between "the book of the anime" and "the book of the live-action series of the anime." How would each describe the same character, visually? "The book of the anime" would describe their /archetypal/ features, the ones the author and artist explicitly chose to put in. But "the book of the live-action adaptation" would likely describe the same character as /the way the actor looks when portraying the character/. (Do you think there were any /Harry Potter/ fanfics, after the movies came out, that tried to describe the characters visually as anything /other than/ the movies' actors' portrayals of those characters?)

Or: do you know what Dracula sounds like? Dracula probably sounds, to you, like Bela Lugosi playing Dracula in /Dracula (1931)/ sounds. The book never described the quality of the vampire's voice, AFAIK. That detail and hundreds of others---crucial to "enlivening" the character in every later portrayal---was filled into the character's "canon" by choices made by a casting director, and choices made by the actor themselves.

Now picture "Bela Lugosi's choices in playing Dracula", applied to a portrayal /of/ the character of Sherlock Holmes. That's the trick that's being suggested here. Nobody will realize that a Sherlock Holmes portrayal with a Hungarian interpretation of a Romanian accent and over-the-top eyebrow movements, has borrowed anything from Dracula, because Sherlock Holmes is /not a count in a castle/, and so will never need to do any of the /particular/ things that Dracula does; and because Sherlock Holmes doesn't have deathly-pale skin and slicked-back hair and huge eyebrows, so those tics and foibles will /read differently/ on your character than they would on Bela Lugosi's face when playing Dracula. The things a "Bela Lugosi's Dracula as Sherlock Holmes" would do, and would /be/, are entirely novel to that interpretation of the character---but at the same time, you probably can imagine exactly what they /are/, without even trying. Creating such a mental mapping gives you an /infinite font/ of tics and foibles to inject on a whim into your character's interactions, without any of them really being recognizable.

(Note: I'm not suggesting you build a character as "X's portrayal of Y applied to Z." Rather, you invent your own Z---an original character that actually fits, in character-dynamic and setting senses---into your story. Do all the same top-down work you'd otherwise do---like you said, by choosing an MBTI type for them, or deciding what mental illnesses they're hinted to have at subclinical levels, or figuring out what fatal character flaw will doom them in your tragedy. You do all that, to come up with a character /sketch/ for your original character. And then, having done that, you /color it in/ by treating some portrayal of some character that you understand well as your muse for tics and foibles.)
