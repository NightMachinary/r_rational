Oh hey, Strong Girl Do Bong-Soon! I never saw the whole series, but yeah...probably would have caught that one, if someone used it. The show was really popular overseas for a while, so I think international ratfic readers would also be familiar.

Rather than directly copying a character, I tend to prefer blending traits from multiple sources. Some people use common character archetypes, and others draw inspiration from psychology theory (Myers-Briggs, Enneagram, Zodiac, etc.) I've even had some friends use things like Hogwarts houses and favorite member of the Beatles to differentiate their characters.

So yeah, there's lots of strategies for building characters that are more creative and fun than just copying them. Besides, it avoids some problems if you ever decide to traditionally publish the work later.
