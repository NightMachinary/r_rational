  Figure out your characters. If you're having trouble with this, just steal from somewhere and strip off the serial numbers. No one is ever going to call you on your main character acting just like Monica from Friends so long as you fudge the life details.

Gotta say, every time I've tried this strategy, someone calls me out. Even when I'm only explaining my story idea. People are just way too perceptive. :P

Overall, some great advice. :) I'm doing Nanowrimo again this year, as usual. Here's hoping I don't fudge my numbers again like the last few years. (Unless 2000 words of character development, deleted scenes and grocery lists counts as "novel writing.")
