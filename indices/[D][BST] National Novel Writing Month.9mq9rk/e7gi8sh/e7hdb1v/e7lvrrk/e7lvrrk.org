(Given that "hammer-throw" is a real part of track-and-field, the heavier "sledgehammer-pick-up-and-throw" seemed like an intuitive kind of strongman-competition entry, similar to deadlifting cars; I was honestly surprised when I typed it into Google just now and it turned out to be something my mind made up just now.)
