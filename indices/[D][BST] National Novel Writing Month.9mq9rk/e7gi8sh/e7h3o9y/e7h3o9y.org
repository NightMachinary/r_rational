When starting out something new, people tend to stick to one method that works for them. They can try a few techniques, but there's usually going to be one thing that they focus on (like "If I say this I can manipulate this person and gain what I want" or "According to the first law of physics...") The technique will appeal to their personality, or their situation will force them to learn and apply that particular thing. As they gain experience, they learn how to apply new techniques. People rarely learn something unless they want to (like pushing yourself to learn a musical instrument because you really like the sound of it) or because they have to (survival/peer pressure).
