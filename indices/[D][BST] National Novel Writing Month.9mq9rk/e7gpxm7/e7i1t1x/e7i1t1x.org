I find it's totally possible to be rational about my emotions. In many ways they're a sense; we call them /feel_ings and e_motions/ after all; both of which are words directly referencing your sense of touch.

just because something's objective (and ever-changing) doesn't mean you can't Science! it. Observe, hypothesize, experiment, repeat. Always be ready to be wrong about why you feel what you feel, just like you would with any theory. But, at the same time, don't doubt your feelings (on a sensory level) any more than you would your eyes. It's just also really hard for us to talk about emotions without the words themselves enforcing an explanation; pick an emotion and describe the /literal/ sensations /in your body/ that go with it. One is theory, one is observation.
