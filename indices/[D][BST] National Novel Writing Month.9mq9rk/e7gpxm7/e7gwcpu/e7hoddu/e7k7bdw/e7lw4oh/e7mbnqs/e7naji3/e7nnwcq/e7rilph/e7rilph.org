I haven't seen character building as being a problem in ratfic in particular, no. The place where this advice is common, is in the specific context /of NaNoWriMo/.

The goal of NaNoWriMo is to write a novel within a month. In my experience, a lot of the participants take that to mean that you have to do /all/ of the work of writing the novel within that month---which includes character-building.

The advice is given because it's a hack to get a "character that feels like a real person" built quickly, without needing to rely on you already having a muse-of-the-moment, someone who you already have ideas for how they would fictionalize.

I think the advice is also common amongst writers of episodic serials with new side-characters in each entry; and amongst especially prolific writers like Stephen King who make a living by churning out more than one standalone novel per year. These people /need/ a greater number of interesting characters than they have built-up "potential energy" of good ideas to base them upon.

  But what /really/ grounds them is how they interact with the other characters.

I was using "tics and foibles" as a short-hand, since I wasn't sure quite how to describe what it is that people pull out of a portrayal and inject into a character. I didn't mean to imply, though, that the particular /character dynamics/ that a character's portrayal dredges up for you aren't an important part of that. That is, the tics and foibles /of/ a character dynamic: i.e. the things that separate a good romance story, or buddy-cop story, from a mediocre one. In film, those are often improvised by the actors, just as much as the standalone character tics are. And you can steal them!

I should say, though: you can copy the tics of a portrayal of a character dynamic, /or/ a the personal tics of a given portrayal of a character, but copying both from the /same/ portrayal will probably result in an expy. You can steal Hugh Laurie's Gregory House's grizzled squint and sudden penchant for walking out in the middle of a conversation; /or/ you can steal Hugh Laurie-and-Robert Lawrence Leonard's Gregory House-and-James Wilson's particular interaction style. But if you steal /both/, then your character is just Hugh Laurie's Gregory House.
