It only works if you don't consume the same media as your audience.

If I write a ratfic with a Miles Vorkosigan expy, everybody's gonna figure it out, because [[/r/rational]] readers and I share a common referent there.

Meanwhile, if I write a ratfic with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Girl_Bong-soon][Do Bong-soon]] expy, then, while /someone else/ might recognize what's going on, the average [[/r/rational]] reader probably won't. And since the genre of ratfic isn't likely to be read by anyone /other than/ "the archetypal [[/r/rational]] reader", I can rest easy.
