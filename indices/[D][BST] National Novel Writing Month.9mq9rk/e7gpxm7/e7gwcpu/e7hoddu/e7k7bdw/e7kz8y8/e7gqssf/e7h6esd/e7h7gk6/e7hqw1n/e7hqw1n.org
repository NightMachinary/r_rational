I was hoping to use November to finally write my /Doctor Who/ spinoff novel, but word on the street is that the publisher is dropping the series, so. I'll start my own spinoff series, goddammit! Of course, as November gets closer, I'm getting more and more afraid that I won't have enough time, but something good will come out of it, I'm certain.
