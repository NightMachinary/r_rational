People starting new things tend to go overboard, get really enthusiastic, and make mistakes as a result of that. If you pick up hammers as a hobby, everything starts to look like a nail.

So, for example, when you first learn about the backfire effect, you might see it in lots of different place, an ever-present specter on the sociocultural landscape or common in your friends and family ... when what you're actually doing is falling victim to the availability heuristic, attentional bias, and confirmation bias, and the thing you're seeking to explain has some better/deeper explanation that you're not even looking at because you don't know to and/or you're suffering from cognitive biases that you don't recognize.
