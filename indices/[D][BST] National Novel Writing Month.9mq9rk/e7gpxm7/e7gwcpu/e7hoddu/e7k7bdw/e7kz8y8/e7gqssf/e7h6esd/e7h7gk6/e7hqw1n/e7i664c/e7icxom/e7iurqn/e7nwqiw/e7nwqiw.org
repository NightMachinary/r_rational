Pretty much this. I haven't participated in NaNoWriMo before, but I have a number of friends who have. (I'm also thinking about putting my hand to it this year now that I'm out of school and November should be relatively available) My understanding is that the single largest obstacle to most people being able to write a novel is getting words down on paper. A lot of people tend to be perfectionists and want their first draft to be amazing, so they start and restart and restart, or they just theory-craft forever. With NaNoWriMo, you're committing to getting 50,000 words down on paper without worrying about their quality. That gets you started, and in the end you have a draft that you improve on instead of being stuck in blank page paralysis.
