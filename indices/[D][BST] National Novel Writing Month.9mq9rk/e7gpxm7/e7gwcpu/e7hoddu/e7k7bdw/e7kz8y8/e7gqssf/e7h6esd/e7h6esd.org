I'm both busy and at a low point in motivation right now, but I'll probably use the month to make sample chapters for the various stories I've got kicking around.

Unfortunately, I suspect that even this flimsy non-commitment will amount to nothing. I still haven't finished a short story I started last year, though I'm getting there.
