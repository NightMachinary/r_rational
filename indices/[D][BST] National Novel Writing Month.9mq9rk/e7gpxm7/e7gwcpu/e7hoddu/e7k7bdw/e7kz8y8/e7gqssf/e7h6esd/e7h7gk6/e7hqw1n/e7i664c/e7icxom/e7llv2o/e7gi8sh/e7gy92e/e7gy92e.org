heh, I wish. I have a paper deadline and a class project this november, which sucks because I really do want to spend some time writing >_>

I've never "properly" done nanowrimo, but in past years I have attempted to use the ambient writing energy on the internet to motivate myself to work on my longer-term projects. I can't get anywhere near the rate needed to make 50k words in one month; in my best year, I managed something like 25k words. But since my usual rate is like 10k words / month, I was pretty pleased with it.

Since I'm so busy this november, I'm pinning my hopes on december instead. Hopefully I'll get some quality writing time at my parent's house over christmas break.
