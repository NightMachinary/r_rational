This kryptonite seem to be more 'depleted uranium than granite', the whole green rock from his home world kryponite was very weak, with every mastermind on earth apparently possessing a piece. However this power source kryponite which was shielded from the infant /before/ he got his powers suggests it is a highly dangerous radiation which would destroy both human or kryptonian. This makes more sense.
