I believe I meant it more as "this is one of the things that Superman does". I might also have been thinking of [[http://i.imgur.com/jWz7kDh.jpg][one of my favorite pages from All-Star Superman]]. It's sort of unfair to criticize Superman based on your own value system, but in pretty much every incarnation stopping suicides is something he sees as important. The point I was trying to make is that Clark Kent values being Clark Kent above and beyond all of the things that Superman has declared he values.

Obviously if I were Superman, I would be doing bigger and better things than bothering with murder, rape, robbery, etc. I'd be somewhere between a god-tyrant and one-man megacorporation, and use my powers to affect change on a global scale rather than bothering with individuals. In [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_Grounded][Superman: Grounded]] he spends an hour talking a woman down from jumping to her death (after promising her that he wouldn't just grab her and fly her to the ground), and while it definitely gives me the warm fuzzies, I can only see it as a horrible waste of his time, given how many other things he could be doing at that moment.

As to how I personally feel about stopping people who are suicidal: I'm fine with it. I attempted suicide about seven or eight years ago, and spent a few weeks in a mental institution where I got to know other people who were there for the same reason. The thing is, 95% of the time, the people who are attempting suicide don't actually mean it, and it really is a cry for help. I'm fully on-board with a right to death, and a person's right to control their own life (or lack thereof), but the fact is that suicide isn't usually so clear cut as "I have made the rational choice that I want to die". Quite a bit of the time, the problem is something that can be worked past with counseling or drugs; there's a reason that there's a single successful suicide for every 26 suicide attempts, and it's not just that there's an animal instinct stopping you. Obviously if Superman is just stopping someone from committing suicide and setting them down on the ground with a pat on the back and a simple "Don't do that again" he hasn't actually done anything, but at least in the comics much of what he does is talk the suicidal people out of suicide. I can get on board with either talking it out, or getting them the help that they need through other means. (And I've already written too much, but I'm totally on board with euthanasia, since that's one of those situations where suicide actually makes sense - that people routinely beg for death as they lay dying and are denied it is obscene.)
