She cleaned her apartment /explicitly solely because/ she believes the best she can do now is to woo Superman. Do you seriously think she can do better right now by ladling out soup to a hundred-odd bums?

As the top reporter for one of the most popular sources of news on the planet, she has a massive direct impact, with flow-through effects that include /preventing Superman from going AWOL/ and /getting gender equality legislation passed 40 years earlier/.

Also consider that to Superman, everyone is psychologically-morally close: he can hear their cries, know their problems, and is in the unique position to help in a way that is extremely safe to him and everyone else involved. He can save a life every minute without trying, and people are hypocrites for not being willing to spend weeks of work on a far less certain bet?
