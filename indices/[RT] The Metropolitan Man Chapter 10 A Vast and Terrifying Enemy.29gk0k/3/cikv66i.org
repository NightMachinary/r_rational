"She would have run herself ragged trying to improve the world if she had Superman's powers."

You know this kind of thinking really annoys me, Lois is perfectly capable of making changes for herself but she actually spent time cleaning up her apartment (instead of working at a soup kitchen for example), and as far as we're aware she doesn't do anything more charitable than an every day person. Not only did Superman explicitly remind her of all the suffering going on around her, she apparently thinks of it, decides that of course she could never do anything about it (when she easily could) and then decides that Superman isn't doing enough, even the whole goddamn message Superman is sending is that everyone should try to be good. People are always like "Oh I would rescue that hobo if I won the lottery, or I would do X if Y happened, no one does it when they're in that position", there's probably some psychological phenomenon for the name of that.

So yeah, fucking hypocrites goddamn.

Yeah, don't know if that was deliberate the intention of that writing but that's my thoughts.
