  Your Lois argument if I summarise it: "My time isn't worth over $99,523 an hour, therefore it is not immoral for me to go to a movie. If my time was worth [supermans] amount of time, then it would be."

One minor correction here. It's not that Lois going to the movie is immoral, it's that it's far, far less immoral to the point of being negligible.

As an extreme hypothetical. There are two buttons. One of them, when pressed, steals a penny from the bank account of a random person and places it into your own. The other button, when pressed, kills ten thousand random people. We can agree that these are wildly different crimes, right? Well imagine the inverse. Lois has a button that gives a penny to some random charitable organization, while Superman has a button that saves ten thousand random people from some horrible fate. What Lois is saying (or at least what I think she's saying) is that to quote Uncle Ben, with great power comes great responsibility. She wouldn't feel too bad about ducking out on pressing the Button of Minor Charity, but she would be absolutely wrecked by not pressing the Button of Save Everyone.

I personally agree with that. It's more complicated in the story, and even more complicated in the real world, but to say that there's a moral difference between things of different magnitudes is hardly surprising.

You can harp on Lois all you want for not liking Superman, and for letting her biases overcome her sense, and for being blinded to Lex Luthor, and for whatever else, but I hardly think that you could call her a hypocrite for saying that she would push herself harder than she perceives Superman to be pushing himself - and she hasn't even connected the dots about Clark Kent.
