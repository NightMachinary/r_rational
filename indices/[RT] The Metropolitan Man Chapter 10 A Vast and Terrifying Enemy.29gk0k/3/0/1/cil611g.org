While I understand the point you raise I'm not sure I agree with Lois saying that if her time was X valuable she wouldn't do something.

While she does invest heavily into her work, that's hardly something that is immediately charitable and I would say that Lex is doing a way better job than her (how many trusts has she founded), and as far as we've seen from her it doesn't look like any other reporter would have engaged in less charity (excluding the Superman stuff). The feminist movement can be taken from an entirely selfish point of view, but let's not and assume that that is her contribution. She chooses to work over perhaps becoming a figurehead for the feminist movement, reporting on activities (and it's notable in her thoughts how unsympathetic she is towards the victims of the action, seeing them first and foremost as a story (like on the sinking boat)), or whatever.

The counterargument is pretty obvious but it's good to flesh it out. I think that pretty much overrules anything anyone could want Superman to do and I'm less concerned with the counterargument (though Lois in particular should realise that he is strained and mentally criticising him for not doing more could lead to some pretty problematic things if she revealed it), and more with the hypocrisy.

Your Lois argument if I summarise it:

"My time isn't worth over $99,523 an hour, therefore it is not immoral for me to go to a movie. If my time was worth [supermans] amount of time, then it would be."

I think not only is that an atrocious argument (at some level of cut off you should start being good but before that feel free to not care about others) it completely misses Superman message of being a being of good and perfection. He's trying to improve the human race by example, and instead of realising that we should all choose to do good she complains that he's not doing enough while spending her own time (while not completely ungood) carelessly. Also it's awfully specific and I wonder how much effort Superman has to do to allow himself some time, with the way I've phrased it it's obviously none which is true for Superman and Lex but she loves Lex to bits so Lex and her talking about Superman must be worth fucking millions)

Yeah but then you have to try and suggest that the value from Superman knowing she put effort by cleaning, which I can only imagine is a tiny marginal amount (considering she made him a meal, what's really the difference between "wow you made me a meal, and wow you made me a meal and cleaned up") is worth more than the value of say training to react to Superman better (like not BARELY avoiding flinching), or writing feminist literature or whatever.

Yeah it's not a huge deal, but it just annoys me because it's the whole damn problem with a lot of humanity in that instead of doing something themselves they're just like "Why the fuck don't the 1% donate all their money to charity" and then go back to playing DOTA or whatever.
