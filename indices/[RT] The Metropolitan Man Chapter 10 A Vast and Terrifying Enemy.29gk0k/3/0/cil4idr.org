It comes down to a question of opportunity costs. Let's say that Lois Lane and Superman both sit down in a movie theater together to watch /Anne of Green Gables/.

The opportunity cost for Lois is relatively low - let's say that she makes the equivalent of $60,000 a year. It's almost certainly more efficient for her to push her comparative advantage (writing/reporting) than it is for her to donate her time to a soup kitchen, since a well-written essay on women's rights is likely to do a whole lot more than a single hour of labor. She could also work at her job and donate the money to a soup kitchen, which would almost certainly give a better expected payout than donating labor to something she has no particular skill in. Let's be generous and say that her opportunity cost for going to the movie is about $30 plus whatever a ticket costs.

The opportunity cost for Superman is relatively high. Even if he prohibits himself from making money (except as Clark Kent), advancing technology, or doing manual labor, his opportunity cost is still much, much higher than Lois's. Lex figures this at about one life per hour, but it's probably a little lower than that (Superman is actually pretty crappy at preventing disease and infection, which are by far the two largest causes of death during the time period). It's much harder to put a value on something like a human life, but I don't think it would be absurd to put the opportunity cost of Superman going to the movies at at least $100,000 ([[http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1808049,00.html][a number that I didn't just pull out of my hat]]).

Here's the steel manned version of Lois's line of thinking; if the cost of going to a movie was that high, she wouldn't go to a movie, and she wouldn't expect any moral person to do the same. It's only because the cost is low that it's worth it.

Here's one of the potential counterarguments from Superman; if going to a movie with Lois allows him to be better able to handle the psychological stress of being Superman, then that is the correct thing for him to do, because otherwise he would risk breaking down in some unpleasant manner. If he's in the business of getting warm fuzzies instead of [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/][absolute efficiency]], that's still not all that bad, since a focus on efficiency could lead him to lose his motivation to do good (though in this fic it seems more like he's tortured about the use of his powers).

I would also agree with [[/u/Linmark]] that you're not being all that charitable towards Lois. She's been shown as active in the feminist movement and a hard worker who spends very little of her time on leisure, to the exclusion of friendships and romance. She also legitimately believes that investigation and reporting are good. And at the same time, I agree with you that she's not being entirely charitable to Superman, but there are reasons for that beyond pure hypocrisy - she resents that her primary comparative advantage now seems to be wooing Superman (which, incidentally, is the only reason she seems to have cleaned her apartment in the first place).
