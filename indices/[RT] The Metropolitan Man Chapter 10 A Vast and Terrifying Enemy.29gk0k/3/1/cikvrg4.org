I get your point, but Lois specifically thinks that her job is actually changing the world for the better. And maybe you disagree, but she did support progressive laws and has a hand in making them pass (with her books and her bargain with luthor). She's not more charitable than any other man but a) She's a woman in the thirties and can only have so much influence and b) it's because she is just like any other human. Superman is not... Also, working in a soup kitchen is overrated.
