There should be a section-break between Calhoun's introspective jail scene and the scene where Clarence is told to ignore the bribe money by Superman (about 2/3rds of the way through, transition after "His prayers were greeted only by silence"). I'm assuming based on other comments here that Calhoun's scene was a recent addition? Good addition. :)

Also, I'm still loving the hell out of this!
