Well, "thou shalt not kill" is typically Superman's most cherished principle. I personally don't think a policy like that fits every scenario, but the point is that it's Superman's moral center. If he's fine with killing now, who knows what other lines he might cross.

I suppose it's remotely possible he's just trying to do what's right. But then why kill Calhoun in such a public manner, that is sure to lose him much of his public support? If he was that dead set on enacting justice, he should've done it in a way that wouldn't compromise his ability to do good later down the line. As it happened, with him striking after being provoked, it just seems like he totally lost control.
