  It's cheaper, and signals your own virtue much more, simply to keep insisting on the standard model.

My issue is not that she is wrong for believing that people should invest ~100% into improved the world (or however amount that she is doing but superman is not), which sure she is, but rather than being wrong she's just being hypocritical. Why can you expect Superman to not take breaks and not run himself ragged (for a start he is running himself ragged as we've seen by his PoV), but she most certainly doesn't run herself ragged and invest 100% of her life in improved everyone.

The most obvious example is where she's whining about him spending dinner with her, but she literally spent X minutes cleaning her apartment, which is not helping anyone.
