You know, I very nearly wrote that scene from Calhoun's perspective. He's old enough that if he went to prison for a decade, he would almost surely die there, especially considering that his power base has crumbled away. He was really ready to die if the verdict came back guilty, mostly just to take his life back into his own hands. He gets handed this unexpected victory instead though, and had this feeling of elation, because he pulled out a win that he really didn't think he was going to get. So he does what he really wants to do, which is to rub Superman's nose in it, right in front of all the reporters, and so far as he knows, Superman's as stoic as they come and never responds to provocation, so this some safe, fun, gloating.

But yes, prior to the verdict coming back he's much more focused on getting revenge/vindication than actually living.
