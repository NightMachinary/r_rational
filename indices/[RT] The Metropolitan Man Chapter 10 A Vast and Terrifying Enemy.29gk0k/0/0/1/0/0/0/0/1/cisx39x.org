Superman is a sort of humanist savior, IMO. I really liked from the "Man of Steel" movie and trailer, Jor-El's speech to his son:

  You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun, Kal. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.

I think doing good and being an example by which to live is the maximal use of Superman's time, even if it's not at all an easy task.
