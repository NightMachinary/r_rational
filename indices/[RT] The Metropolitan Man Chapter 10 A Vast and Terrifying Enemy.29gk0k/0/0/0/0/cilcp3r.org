Mostly it's because ninety percent of the time when it's used, it's a cheesy plot device that's introduced only to add in some tension to a man that's got absurd powers. There are so few things that you can really do with kryptonite, and so much of the time it's either "Superman is still super even without the powers" or "Superman can still figure out a way to punch hard enough". As an obstacle to throw in front of a protagonist, much of the time its just ... lazy.

In my opinion, the very best Superman stories are character studies, where failure isn't a matter of not being strong enough or fast enough, but instead about what Superman's values are and how he goes about trying to satisfy them. There are some really great Superman comics, and the ones I love don't include kryptonite, because they don't need to - the conflict and tension are there without taking away Superman's powers.

(I also hate how every two-bit villain seems to have kryptonite for usually poorly explained reasons. The backstory for it is constantly shifting, but usually it doesn't satisfy me.)

So yes, I do dislike kryptonite, most of the time. I probably wouldn't include it in this story, except that Superman isn't the protagonist (which changes the narrative aspects some).
