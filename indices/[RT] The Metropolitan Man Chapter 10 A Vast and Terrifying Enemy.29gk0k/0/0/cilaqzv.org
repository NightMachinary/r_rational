You know, this comment had me puzzled for a few hours, since I couldn't figure out why someone would have paid attention to what I was saying and reddit isn't friendly about letting people search histories. It finally dawned on me that I must have made a blog post about it, and sure enough, I found five or six paragraphs about what I want out of Superman. It's weird but not all that surprising how closely much of what I wrote there parallels what I ended up writing in the fic. Out of curiosity, how on earth did anyone ever find that blog post? I feel like I must have linked to it at some point, but have no real recollection of it.
