Thanks for the feedback (as always - I find your advice insightful if sometimes hard to do anything about).

My conceptualization of Philip is sort of ... how I'd imagine a gay man in Syria to feel? You'd spend a lot of your time thinking about your sexual orientation, about the orientation of other people, about how you need to act in order to fool other people into thinking that you're straight, about what shibboleths you might be missing because you're not actually straight, about the consequences of being found out, about who might know or suspect ... I feel like your thoughts would circle back to it fairly frequently until it became a central pillar of your mental life.

I'll revisit this chapter once I'm feeling better to either tone it down or try to get that across more succinctly. It's one of those things that I played with quite a bit while I was writing.
