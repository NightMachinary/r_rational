We don't actually have an official description for Philip's, um, main characteristic. For all we know, he could be suffering from "Previously unknown genetic defect that only strikes one child in ten billions during a full moon if the baby is born at the same time a darkling dies".

And I still don't think he qualifies as a sociopath anyway. He's shown way to much planning ability and /some/ ethical thinking that would be impossible for a sociopath.
