One thing I really like about Philip and his chapters is how they keep bait-and-switching you with cynicism. Chapter 7 implied that lanterns failures kept happening and nobody ever reacted to them seriously.

This chapter tells us that reactions did happen, like designing an experimental lantern in the safety of the city center, conscripting the auxiliary (without which the outbreak might have lead to the lantern's destruction), and designing new weapons.

I see a lot of people saying that Glimwarden is a dark story, but I disagree. Limelight felt like a dark story, because things kept getting worse and the protagonist fought pointless bloody battles alongside delusional murderhobos. Glimwarden, even with its deaths and its dangerous world, is about people, trying to do better, and that's enough for this story to feel uplifting to me. The same (sort of) applies to The Metropolitan Man.
