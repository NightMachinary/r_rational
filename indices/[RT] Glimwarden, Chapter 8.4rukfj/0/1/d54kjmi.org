Just to add to the big picture of conspiracy theories-

#+begin_quote
  A young engineer by the name of Kelso Kelly had come before the council and told them ... mundane means existed to kill the darklings.... some kind of rotary gun, which the council had given him provisional funding to build, despite the protestations of the chief glimwarden.

Similarly, there's already one lantern with the ability to remove hava and each town presumably has at least one travelling lantern... Despite protestations, it seems like a perfectly obvious emergency measure to have prepared.

The former sounds like a faction is deliberately suppressing technology in order to keep the Glimwardens powerful. The latter could possibly be an oversight, but there have been so many of these mentioned that you have to wonder.
