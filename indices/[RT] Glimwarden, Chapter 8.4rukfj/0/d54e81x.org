The Schism was first sighted by Merry in chapter 4, within her normal hunting range. This was a few hours (at most) before the failure of the lantern, given that Philip intercepted Sander and Merry as they returned and the failure occurred while they were eating.

Assuming that the Schism and the sabotage aren't coincidences, I see a few possible explanations:

** 1. The saboteur lured the Schism within range of the town to coincide with the failure of the lantern.

   :END:
Problems:

- The failure timing seems to be unpredictable to the engineers, which means that either our saboteur is an expert on Light's Hollow's lanterns (able to estimate to within a few hours) or it was luck that it appeared when it did.

** 2. The Schism had foreknowledge of the failure of the lantern.

Problems:

- If Darklings are precogs, humanity is fucked.

  - It is conceivable that signs of failure in the lantern are detectable from its emission signature (especially to Darklings, which it affects materially), meaning that it's just prediction and not actual future knowledge.

- If Schisms always have this ability, why have they never before appeared in Light's Hollow? *Or have they? Melanie may have read of such a thing.

** 3. The Schism had been positioned near the town ahead of time, and attacked when the lantern failed.

   :END:
Problems:

- Merry found the Schism easily after very little search time due to the huge impact of its movement. How was it not found beforehand, except sheer bad luck?

** 4. The Schism was brought into range and the sabotage was set up to coincide with its arrival.

   :END:
Problems:

- If the sabotage was intended to take effect very swiftly (or at a specific time), how was this not apparent to the engineers?

** 5. The multiple-part sabotage is a red herring. Only one thing made the lantern fail, which may use a mechanism unknown to the engineers (perhaps something involving a specific bind).

Problems:

- The engineers should know of this failure mode, at least if they truly do understand how their lantern actually works.

Of these, I tend towards 4. It seems like it would take a long time to bring a Schism close, and the only way to be sure the lantern failed at a specific time would be to make it happen. That means either the plan was short-term (e.g. 5 things each intended to take 1-10 hours to fail, so failing early on average) or the actual failure was triggered by a separate action after the initial sabotage.

Two final observations:

- Healer's lantern (the one that failed) is noted as the closest to Sander way back in chapter one, presumably the closest to his house. That's pretty much the only significant mention in the story of that lantern before the failure. Healer's lantern could be the closest to Gossom and/or Langust, or Sander's initial excursion could have provoked it somehow, or some other reason.
- Philip observed that the Darklings seemed to rank him as an unimportant target due to his lack of bind. If somebody was able to conceal the bind (as hypothesised at the inquest), that may make them "invisible" to Darklings. Such a person could hunt the wilds and amass a truly absurd quantity of bind.
