Maybe they're attracted to emotions, but that seems like it would require quite a lot of complicated machinery (since it's a rational story, I assume Alexander Wales wouldn't have human emotions be a fundamental force - maybe they'd target via pheromones, which would be similar to looking for emotions?) and it's more likely that they do target those with the bind.
