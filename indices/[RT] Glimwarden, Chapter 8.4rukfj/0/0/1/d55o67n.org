I should probably have stressed the word "may" there.

My current hypothesis is that all humans have the bind to an extent, and that the Darklings (being made of the stuff) can sense it where normal Glimwardens can't. They naturally tend to attack the strongest source nearby. Perhaps the goal is to "free" the hearts from the humans/lanterns so they can reenter the environment and coalesce as Darklings. Who knows.

It seems a little convenient, otherwise, that humans are able to internalise the hearts by eating them, though the counterpoint there is that any world where they /couldn't/ would pretty quickly result in humanity being destroyed.

My guess is not without its own problems of course. For one, if suppressing the bind does limit the expression of its powers as Seaborn says, my hypothesis would imply that "cloaking" would have to stop some normal human functions as well.

As an unrelated point, somebody who was able to outright control the Darklings would be able to destroy settlements very easily. Instead of throwing powerful creatures at a failing lantern (which is a solid strategy, of course), starve the city of hearts. They can't simply stop the lanterns and restart them when necessary (there's a setup time at the very least), so they will have to either be incredibly vigilant with human scouting or waste their limited supply of hearts.

When they run out, you bring in your enormous Darkling army.

The fact that this hasn't happened could be considered evidence that the saboteur cannot directly control the Darklings but is just manipulating them (e.g. laying a "scent trail" of bind between Schism-land and the town, or just playing bait).
