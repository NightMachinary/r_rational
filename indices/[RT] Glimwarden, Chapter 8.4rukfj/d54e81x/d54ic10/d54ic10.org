  Philip observed that the Darklings seemed to rank him as an unimportant target due to his lack of bind. If somebody was able to conceal the bind (as hypothesised at the inquest), that may make them "invisible" to Darklings. Such a person could hunt the wilds and amass a truly absurd quantity of bind.

I think Philip was only invisible to the Darklings because there were many people with the bind around him. Sander went into the wilds without any bind, and was still attacked, at the very start. It would still be a slight advantage to be able to hide your bind in the wild, but while it's hidden you also can't use any of its advantages and are basically a vanilla human.
