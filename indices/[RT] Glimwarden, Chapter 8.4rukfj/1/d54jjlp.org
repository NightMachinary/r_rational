Time to ramble and theorycraft.

Let's assume that the outcome was intentional, and see who benefits. The engineers as a whole are slightly worse off. The glimwardens as a whole are much worse off. However, individuals within each group might have benefited. Probably not the glimwardens, since they risked death, but if one of the engineers at the lantern was the one who sabotaged it so that he could easily reactivate it at any time, he would stay quite safe. An engineer could easily have been a patsy or collaborator to someone else's scheme, if they were reimbursed well enough or the other guy had a strong hold over them.

Colsum probably benefits a bit. He wants to get a glimwarden under his control, and if there are more spots available as well as fewer auxiliaries who might enter, he's in a better spot. I don't know if he's cold enough to kill off some of the town's defense force just to slightly improve his own position, but if he really needs a glimwarden for an as-yet-unrevealed reason (e.g. he's dying and needs someone to get him hearts in order to live, or he's planning to take over the town and needs information from the glimwardens) he might be behind the lantern failure.

Colsum also has the means to intimidate, manipulate and blackmail an engineer if he needs to. He has a lot of economic might, and probably has at least one engineer indebted to him or otherwise reliant on him (maybe he's paying for food/medicine for a family member, or is holding a hostage).

We don't know enough about Colsum to assign even a 50% chance that it was him, but he's definitely a solid possibility (>10% I'd say). The various council members get <1% since there's no apparent motive. It's more likely that one of them was somehow involved, but against their will or without knowing the plan until after they'd done their part. Probably 70% to 80% that it was someone we haven't been introduced to yet, and >50% chance that it's connected to Langust.

There is also almost certainly more than one person involved. There was probably at least one person marshaling or otherwise guiding the Schism, and at least one person interfering with the lantern. It's also probably linked to the other recent lantern failure that led to a town's complete destruction.

  "The lantern went out,” said Legal. [...] “It happened at two in the morning and wasn't noticed right away. Their alarm system hadn't been tested in a long time and failed for some reason, but they never managed to investigate that because all their engineers were woken up and put to work getting the lantern shining again. The darklings had killed a few dozen people before the town started to wake up."

  "[...] the problem with the main lantern appeared to be intractable."

That sounds a lot like sabotage. I assume that this was a hostile test of the lantern system in Light's Hollow, and that more attacks are planned. It's harder to destroy a town with seven lanterns than one lantern so the next strike will probably aim to hit several lanterns at once (or maybe the sabotage that already happened was inflicted on several lanterns, and it's just luck that one went before the others did?)

There are too many possible motives for damaging a lantern to narrow down the saboteur, since it could be anything from intended destruction of Light's Hollow to a political move where someone tries to put pressure on the chief engineer only to have their plan go horribly wrong.

One other thing: the only person who's said there was sabotage is the chief engineer, who has incentive to lie about her group messing up and getting lots of people killed, and who's getting information from other people who have incentive to lie about their failures. While she's probably telling the truth, some details (e.g. number of parts that were damaged) might be wrong.
