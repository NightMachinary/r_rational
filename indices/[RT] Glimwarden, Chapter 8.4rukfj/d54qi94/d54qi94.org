Probaby wild theory, but could the Darklings themselves be responsible for the sabotage, perhaps specifically the Schism? Obviously they couldn't come into the tower to sabotage the lantern personally, but perhaps they could either control human agents or have some psychic/bind like powers of their own that could damage the structure of the lantern. It would explain why two towns were attacked, and why the Schism 'knew' to be there at the right time. And it would of course be to the darkling's advantage to stop getting their hearts cut out...
