So any predictions on how many chapters until Sander develops a strobing (I am assuming that continues light is like continues heat, thus less effective than the same quantity of energy in bursts) version of the lantern that weights about as much as a person and then turns himself into a long range airborne/shock trooper (teleport the lantern in, in the confusion kill a few, pick up the harts, teleport out, refuel the "lantern")?
