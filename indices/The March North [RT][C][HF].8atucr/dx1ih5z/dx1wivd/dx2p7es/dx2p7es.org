Wow. That post would completely turn me off reading any of his novels, had I seen it before I read the book. I have no interest in checking out a particular author's work after seeing what they posted to [[/r/fantasy][r/fantasy]], for similar reasons.

However, in this case, I feel it's more like Orson Scott Card, who is incredibly homophobic in real life, but that doesn't really show up in any of his works I've read.

I've only read The March North so far though, so I can't speak for the sequels.
