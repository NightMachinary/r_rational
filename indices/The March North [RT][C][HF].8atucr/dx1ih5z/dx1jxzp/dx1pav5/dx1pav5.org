I don't agree that it is meant to be a plot-twist, but if you think it is, better safe then sorry.

While the second book is less action packed, it involves the characters being students learning about magic which is a lot of fun for me. There's also a lot of infrastructure study and building involved which is reasonable when you have a society heavily dependent on magic and you're teaching the people who will be responsible for the infrastructure.
