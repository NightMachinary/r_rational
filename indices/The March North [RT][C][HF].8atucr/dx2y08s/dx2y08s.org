The first of the books in this series is a straightforward by-the-numbers March North (hence the title) turned completely and gloriously sideways by the setting and the writing style. The second and third books, more or less similarly have a relationship to Going To Magic School books.

It's a shitheap crapsack world made only dealable-with by having a fiercely idealistically egalitarian polity made of people for whom working together to solve problems larger than themselves is what they did all of their lives and will continue to do all of their lives, and that's glorious. The polity in question and the society is not all that similar to ours, and is influenced by the author's own hard-Left leanings. (Hence the "what about his blog" stuff; yeah, he's not writing Puppies-approved fiction, deal with it.)

It's a fairytale lost in a civil engineering manual. That's also glorious, at least to me.
