I have not read the prequel but I have read the latest two novels, based on a recommendation from this sub, and very much enjoyed them. I've been keeping tabs on the authors blog, eagerly awaiting the latest in the series.

It's worth noting that the authors writing style, while definitely unusual, is not amateurish. I personally can handle that a lot better than the latter but YMMV.
