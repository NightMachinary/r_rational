I love Graydons work. Firstly, just because he is a very competent writer, and secondly, because he is writing fantasy that does not just bolt magic onto a medieval setting, despite this making no sense from a world building perspective.

As a random example, I do not recall ever seeing another piece of literature that points out the fact that the number of people one farmer can feed is hugely important to the kind of society you can have. And yes, he is progressive, which, as far as his books are concerned mostly just means he writes books that are /not/ just cookie-cutter copies of the extremely reactionary political setups most fantasy novels have. Which makes them far more interesting than most fantasy
