I misspoke. That did sound like a condemnation of [[/r/fantasy]], which I didn't intend. There's nothing particularly wrong with the subreddit at the moment, and there are many quality authors who post there.

They did have a period sometime after the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Puppies][sad puppies]] (I'm not a fan of the extremes of either side. Both care too much about what other people are writing and reading.) campaign started where they became rather political, but that's died down.

There are enough authors that are semi-active there, that if you follow the subreddit long enough, you may get a better idea of their opinions.

I disagreed with one of them a fair amount, and got the feeling that their opinions would carry over to their novels, so I never picked them up.
