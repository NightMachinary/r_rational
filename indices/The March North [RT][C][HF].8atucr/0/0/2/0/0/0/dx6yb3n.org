I mean I feel like that's just part of how it works? Not being preached to is one thing, but realistically a writer, artist, etc, is going to have their political views bleed into their work in one way or another. I don't really think there's a way to be 'apolitical' when it comes to something you make, and asking an author to distance their own personal views from their work seems to be a bit pointless and/or hurtful to their process.
