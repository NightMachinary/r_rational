  I strongly suggest that people read the offered sample of the chapter before they buy it. The author writes in a very unusual way which is hard to describe,

I entirely agree. The writing is initially very hard to follow. There are references to things that aren't initially explained, and certain phrases almost seem intentionally opaque. It's best to try out the novel before buying it, though I personally feel it gets better.

However, I would prefer you spoiler the second part, after the quoted text. It ruins any sense of surprise of a certain plot twist if you give that up, and it isn't really the part of the writing that will make things hard to understand.

While I personally find it a noteworthy facet of the writing, I deliberately didn't mention it for that reason.

Edit: I'd also mention that the first book is more action oriented, while the second book, at least what I've read of it, has dramatically less conflict. I need to get around to finishing it one of these days.
