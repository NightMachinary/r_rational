  Are brain damage, diseases, mental trauma, addictions, motor skills, language skills etc. transmitted?
#+end_quote

I'd also be interested to check if my brain changes physically after the information transfer. In what manner does it change, to what extent, how is a child's brain being able to losslessly accept a grown-up person's consciousness, etc. Another question is how “positive” changes (e.g. the “natural” development of my consciousness through the iterations) are recognised and separated from negative ones (brain tumors, memory loss illness, brain's deterioration with age, etc), because such differentiation would likely imply the existence of some intelligence or “program” on a higher scale that's controlling the resets and my ripple effect-proof memory.

  What happens to the timeline I left? Is it conceivable that there are other time travellers, or that left-behind timelines may eventually discover a way to follow me?
#+end_quote

How would you go on about finding out answers to these questions? One test I can think of is brainwashing a small group of other people in one iteration, and then observing them in the next one. Outside of that --- without being able to navigate in the higher dimension (suppose research into sideways or vertical dimension travel each time returns nothing) --- I think it would be impossible for any of the theories regarding other iterations you've left to get enough supporting proofs.

  Acquire a reliable method of suicide.

Yeah, for some reason almost all stories that deal with [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][GroundhogPeggySue]] keep ignoring this important bit.

Also, what would a reliable suicide switch look like? Dangers to consider: getting drugged by something subtle, getting your body or brain compromised with nano-machines (gradual changes in personality and behaviour that would likely go unnoticed by the trigger), getting compromised in some way that would reveal itself only in long-term, etc.

Also, what would you do about dangers like depression, apathy, addiction (in case it /is/ being transferred), gradual --- but eventually radical --- change of moral values, principles, worldview, personality, etc?
