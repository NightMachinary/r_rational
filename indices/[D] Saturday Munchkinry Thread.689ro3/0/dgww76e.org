You discover that you have Super Strength! You can lift a car over your head.

Having read TV tropes, you realize that lifting the car implies some sorts of secondary powers.

What experiments do you try?

How would you use strength (and possible secondary powers) in a super hero fight? How can you exploit it outside of combat, if you just wanted money or political power?
