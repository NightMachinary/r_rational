I'd build a really heavy shield and see if it becomes stronger than the material would be alone. Same for a really heavy armor.

I'd also test to see if wearing really heavy armor would make me sink through the ground or not.

Next I would experiment with mechanical advantage - using leverage and gears to see if I can build something like a hand-cranked railgun or laser. Pull big lever with super-strength, use a mechanism reinforced by secondary power involving leverage and gear ratios to eventually spin a generator at tremendous speeds. Or mechanically launch a projectile somehow. Or spin a big saw blade... projectile.

A big enough lever could maybe allow me to hand-press carbon into diamonds.

For fights I would use heavy armor, shield, some kind of sword and a really big multipurpose gun (laser, railgun, regular guns) that can only be operated with super strength (hand-cranked and intentionally built with weak components that will fail (violently) if fired without secondary power).

A hand-cranked generator as per above is connected to electrodes on the outside of the armor, so I can electrocute grappling opponents and still be water safe.

My hands can obviously take a lot of abuse when gripping and lifting a car, so I would test if I can (finger) punch through stuff.
