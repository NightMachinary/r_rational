I test my personal toughness. I know that I can survive pressures of about 20 PSI on my hands that it takes to lift a car without injury. How do I fare against the 1200 PSI of a boxer's punch? The ~8000 PSI of a baseball bat? The even higher pressure of stopping a bullet? Does it apply to non-kinetic things like heat or chemicals?

I test if I have touch-telekinesis. I slap together an accelerometer out of a rubber band and a small weight, and test what happens when I pick it up (attached to an object or not) and when I quickly move it. Depending on the results of those tests, I buy a real accelerometer and repeat them. I also stand on a scale while lifting weights to check that aspect. If I have a trusted friend, I check if it is manton-limited as well. If I don't have a trusted friend, I test it on a mouse instead to do the same test, but worse.

I test my effect on mechanisms. Buy five 40:1 geared speed-increasers and test feed them into each other to eventually make a 102400000:1 gearbox, stick a flywheel on the end, and slowly crank the handle. (Test with one, then two, then three then four then five.) Avoid relativistic edge-velocities on the flywheel for now, but consider going to CERN or something later if the gearbox works.

Can I lift myself by the bootstraps and fly?

What happens if I oppose my body's strength with another part of my body? For example, grabbing a finger and then trying to make a fist.

The superhero and civilian applications really depend on the outcomes of the tests. The common threads for superhero work are boring and involve punching people, and the common civilian applications are related to space. I don't see any obvious applications in politics if you aren't going for a coup or using your money to fund yourself.
