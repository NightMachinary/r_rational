You're Percy Jackson Lite, in a world of superheroes.

You have short range (>50ft) water control, and can comfortably control 2 liters of water.

It takes roughly five seconds to form a glob of water into a shape, and you can move water around at about human walking speed.

As far as other powers (turning water into ice, condensing water from vapor in the air, purifying water) they are possible, but require practice. Any aspect of the power can be improved upon, be it total volume of water controlled, movement speed, range, etc.

As far as limitations go, you can only control what is thematically water. Ocean water is fine, lake water is fine, but something like orange juice would be impossible. Only if you could look at it and go "yeah, that's water" could you control it.

How do you grow your power into something that will allow you to survive in a world of super-powered maniacs?
