Sorry, my question was likely not formulated in the best way for what I had in mind. Perhaps I should've asked this in Monday rationality or Friday off-topic instead.

The question of my interest was “what types of scientific research and experimentation do you think would produce high benefit results if ethical and moral restrictions weren't an issue?” --- or something like that. I was trying to surround that with a setting that would allow the “players” to focus on the question.

Maybe another way of making it more accurate would be to introduce a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus][ceteris paribus]] condition. That is, in one AU points "a)", "b)", "c)" hold true, while in another there's also the "d)" --- and the question is how to capitalise on the difference that "d)" introduces when “competing” with universe A.

Regarding your solution to /this/ question: can you elaborate on what you meant by genetic food (GMOs?) and intelligence enhancements (e.g. embryo gene manipulation, eugenics, etc)?

And regarding the FAI plan, wouldn't taking that path from the start be rather dangerous? If it gets out of your control in a manner that you or your scientists can't comprehend yet, it would pretty much ruin your whole setting in several turns.
