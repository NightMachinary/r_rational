Did this humanity start out with that attitude, and has its leader always had this power? A hypothesis that someone might soon come up with is that God made us as a science generator, which is essentially true.

Annoyingly, the correct path is putting all the research into FAI, followed by the universe getting a surprisingly high science output. But let me steal from [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/][That Alien Message]]:

  (Oh, and every time someone in this world tries to build a really powerful AI, the computing hardware spontaneously melts. This isn't really important to the story, but I need to postulate this in order to have human people sticking around, in the flesh, for seventy years.)

World-wide coordination should make everything efficient enough to get most of the workforce available for the Science project. Initially, research into reduction of the workforce needed to sustain the rest takes priority - genetic food enhancement, say. Long-term, research into the ability of humans to carry out Science would be important - genetic intelligence enhancement, say. For the endgame, research whatever counts as the most science points, for example generating math theorems. (How is what I do scored?)
