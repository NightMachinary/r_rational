- a) This parallel Earth's humanity is technologically as advanced as we currently are, more or less.
- b) Your character has the means to use the resources of the whole human population of Earth.
- c) Your character has been told --- and is motivated --- to concentrate on producing as many new scientific discoveries as possible.
- *d)* For one reason or another, moral and ethical issues are not a hindrance in this setting whatsoever --- any type of experiment would be seen as acceptable to be designed and launched, in this regard. An outcome of a poorly thought-out dangerous experiment could still cause harm and damage, but there will not be any limitations or risks associated with public outcry, protests, and so on that were caused by the crossing of moral\ethical lines.

What experiments would your character carry out? In fields of biology, neurology, psychology, sociology, etc. (Inb4: “They would try to find out why are people here so apathetic about morality and ethics by doing X and Y.”)
