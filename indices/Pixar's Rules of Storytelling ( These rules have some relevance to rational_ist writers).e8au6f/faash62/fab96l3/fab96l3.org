Another common one is writing a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue][Mary Sue]]. Usually the extent to which audiences like this sort of thing is the extent to which the audience is similar to the author

For example, I and most people on this subreddit love Harry Potter Evans Verres because we see ourselves in that character. But a lot of people outside the rational circle who share little in common with him would perceive him as an annoying Mary Sue. (Yes yes /we/ know that he's actually deeply flawed and that hpmor is at least in part a book about just how flawed he is, but most people will not see that, they will only see that he's supposed to be soooo smart)

Also in general, when you look at things that are more common in fanfic than in professional fic, you see things that are more fun to write than read.
