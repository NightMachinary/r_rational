For rule #2, what sort of thing(s) would be fun to do as a writer that wouldn't be entertaining to an audience? I'm having trouble thinking of anything.

Ideally a writer trying something interesting/fun would also be trying to make that thing entertaining and make sense to an audience. I can imagine some things could fall flat, I just can't think of what would.
