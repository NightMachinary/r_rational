Now we're just arguing semantics though. How much fluff do you need for it to be pointless? In other media, like Television, there is WAY more fluff, and in previous decades with longer, more wandering seasons there was even more. Just watch a season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Xena: Warrior Princess (I pick these shows because they likely have had an outsized early impact on the net lit medium due to fanfic and demographics.) Fluff and subplots will be coming out of your ears.

Who's to say that a serial fiction published online should follow the model of a tight novel instead of a sprawling TV series? From what I've seen the online literature medium has made leaps and bounds in the past decade, and it's hard to believe that it skewing longer and longer over that period is some kind of weird mistake and not natural selection.
