/Pointless/ fluff pretty much by definition doesn't add anything to the story. If it did, it wouldn't be pointless. Or to put it another way, not all fluff is pointless and you want to have enough of that fluff for the story to not feel sterile but you don't want 10 pages of repetitive purple prose just because the author likes writing that. An example from traditional fiction is Wheel of Time where in some cases nothing plot relevant happens in entire books because it's all just fluff.
