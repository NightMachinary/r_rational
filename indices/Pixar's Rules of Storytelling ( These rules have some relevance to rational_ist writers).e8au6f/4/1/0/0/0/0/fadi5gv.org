An excellent point. But I think there's an important distinction to be drawn here.

Deus ex /can/ be good. But dues ex is never permitted to /solve the problem/. So, for example, if the problem is that the Princess has been kidnapped by dragons, then it is allowable for the hero to meet a unicorn and be healed of any physical ailments; this is undeniably a good thing for the hero, yet it does not rescue the Princess.
