Worldbuilding is fun when it's shown, not told. Exposition dumps are for author notes, not dialogue.

Legends shouldn't be the unredacted or objective truth. Every legend needs to be chronicled by a character with biases. The Elder Scrolls series does this admirably!

Prophecies may be a puzzle, but they should have a major takeaway for the character who'll only hear it once, /who then repeats the one or two things they'll remember./ If you refer back to it, have it misremembered unless someone wrote it down.

If you have a map in the frontispiece, don't only include plot-important places, and don't include all of them. But do include political boundaries. And don't make the reader keep flipping back to it.
