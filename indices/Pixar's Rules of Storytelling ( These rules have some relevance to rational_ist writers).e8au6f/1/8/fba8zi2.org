  For rule #2, what sort of thing(s) would be fun to do as a writer that wouldn't be entertaining to an audience? I'm having trouble thinking of anything.

90% of the "gymbro human interest" fluff in the Deathworlders serial for example. There's a LOT of largely repetitive fluff about muscles and cough hugging and such which is of no interest to most readers of a story about humanity being awesome in space with aliens and fancy tech.
