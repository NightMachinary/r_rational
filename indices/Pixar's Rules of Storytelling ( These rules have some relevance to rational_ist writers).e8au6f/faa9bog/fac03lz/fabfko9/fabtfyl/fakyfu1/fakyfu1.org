Pretty much all fanfic and web novels are probably very weak on #2, #3 and #5. #5 is the least offender because if you do a minimum of planning ahead it can still happen. However #3 is pretty much impossible for something of that length (which will be written while it's published, so it's subject to all the dangers of serials, like TV shows and long-running manga, rather than having the narrative unity of a novel or a movie), and #2 is also pretty hard because if you don't also have fun on such a long project you'll end up dropping it, and that's no good.
