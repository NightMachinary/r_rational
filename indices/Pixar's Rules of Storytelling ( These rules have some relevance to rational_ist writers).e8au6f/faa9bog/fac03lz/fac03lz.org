  how #3 and #5 manifest in online fiction in general

I think that more and more there's a huge gap in how stories are told in traditional media vs online. It's even funny that TV seasons (the traditional form of serial longform media) have been slowly shrinking over the decades and cutting fluff to match up with the tighter plotting you see in movies and novels.

On the other hand online media is mostly literary and the generally accepted length is going /up/, not down. This probably has its actual roots in sporadically updated serial fanfic but has manifested itself even in original stories now (which in some ways have inherited /more/ media DNA from serial fanfics than from print novels.) When I read a story (or see other media) without enough fluff these days it feels like something's missing, it's a distinct lack of breadth. 100k words online is a brisk jog through the park (in many ways the gargantuan megaprojects like Worm set the "serious" standards for the online genre now, and that includes fanfic too) but 100k in print would be a serious novel.

I kind of wonder if this divergence will last, but it's clearly widening now, not narrowing.
