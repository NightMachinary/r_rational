I'm really curious about how #3 and #5 manifest in online fiction in general and especially in rationalist fiction.

Personally, I love longform content: [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Wildbow's]] [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][gargantuan]] [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][meganovels]], [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][/Practical Guide to Evil/'s]] epic scope, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][/Worth the Candle/'s]] musings on roleplaying games, etc. But I also think that sometimes there's something missing in these works given how they're all, essentially, first drafts.

Pixar, of course, is an animated film studio. I think film probably rivals short fiction for the sheer /efficiency/ that is needed to tell a full story with such limited time. Where, say, PGtE can spend entire chapters just on really fascinating conversations, dialog in film has to be short and direct, ideally without /feeling/ too short or direct.

This leaves me curious about what sort of form rational fiction would take in other media. Has anyone tried making rationalist films? Rationalist games? There's been a [[https://soundcloud.com/raymond-arnold][bit of music]] written and produced around the [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wTeEpNMok2eiAsTd5/state-of-the-solstice-2014#What_makes_a_Secular_Solstice__][Secular Solstice]], which I find pretty interesting. What other avenues are there for storytelling that the community could explore?

EDIT: So I did, thanks for catching that. Also, links to things.
