Breaking conventions for the sake of breaking conventions is sometimes fun for the writer but rarely fun for the audience. Really complex plots or conceits are often interesting for the writer but just confusing for most of the audience; there are exceptions like House of Leaves, but most times you try to do something intricate like that it will be interesting to write but fall on its face when it comes to actual readers.

In general, being excessively clever just to see if you can manage it will be much less interesting to your readers than to you.
