I think definitely "talking about worldbuilding", for most audiences vs most writers. Audiences like exploring well built worlds as the characters move through them but they don't necessarily like just hearing about the world as an academic paper might describe it.

Meanwhile writers tend to like constructing worlds even apart from characters.

Tolkien is one archetype of this tendency who still somehow managed to be quite successful - Lord of the Rings reads like a history book at times. I think in some ways this was allowed because in some senses it was "the first" fantasy novel which really hit a wide audience (outside of maybe religious texts, e.g. the Mahabharata, dantes inferno, etc does actually involve a fair bit of world building if you think about it)

Some of these lines become blurred when you are writing for nerds, who are a bit more writer-ish than the average reader.
