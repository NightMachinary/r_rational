Number two is the one that I think I struggle with the most in my writing, but it's more a matter of what comes easier than pure interest.

I could /very easily/ write chapter after chapter of "the two main characters sit down and talk to each other every single day for an hour, going through many iterations of internal conflict". That's honestly half of what I imagine whenever I think of my story, and I'm afraid it shows. If I were to write the entire story with only these dialogues it might function as a quirky artistic piece that, sure, some people might like, but it could definitely benefit from better storytelling.

My plan is to weave together external and internal conflict for nice thematic tension. Is that not the standard approach?
