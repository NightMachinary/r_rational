12: Don't be predictable.

Okay, I can definitely see where you're coming from here. It's especially important in rationalist fiction that Magic A should /always/ be Magic A - the world needs to be susceptible to analysis. And part of that is that, occasionally, expected things should happen. There are things in the story that should be predictable.

Though I do think it's also important to have the story surprise the reader on occasion as well, because surprises can keep the reader interested.

19: Never, ever dues ex machina. The occasional diabolus ex machina is allowed, because it makes the protagonist need to work harder. I still don't see what's wrong with this, as long as it's not over-used.
