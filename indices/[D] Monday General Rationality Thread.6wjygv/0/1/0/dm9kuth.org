Why can't they seriously hurt any advanced country? They're capable of doing so even without missiles or nuclear weapons. Seoul is a city of 10 million, one of the most densely populated in the world, and it's about 35 miles away from the border. There are something like 10,000 artillery weapons on the border, and their range is /probably/ long enough to do serious damage to Seoul.

So about a fifth of the South Korean population is within range of artillery weapons which are, at this very moment, pointed directly at them. An all-out attack by North Korea would be devastating.

The question is whether the political will exists within North Korea, which no one but intelligence agencies really knows.
