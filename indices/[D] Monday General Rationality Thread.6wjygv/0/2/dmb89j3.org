My opinion is that, despite appearances, Kim Jong-Un is a rational actor. He's been ruthless about removing threats to his power and his pursuit of nuclear weapons is rational. No one has the political will to take the measures necessary to stop him beforehand, and as soon as he develops a credible nuclear deterrent his regime will be untouchable by foreign powers. He has implemented reforms so that limited free markets are legal, and the North Korean economy has been growing. Once nuclear weapons are developed, he will be able to downsize the military to the amount necessary to maintain internal stability. Right now North Korea is forced to spend a large percentage of its GDP on its military, and without that, he will be able to grow the economy more, preventing the famines that could otherwise threaten his rule and ensuring that he's able to keep the elite pacified with access to luxury goods. It's hard to say for sure without good information from North Korea, but I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up following this path.
