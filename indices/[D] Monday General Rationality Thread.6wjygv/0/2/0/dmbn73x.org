Very good point. The obvious goal for NK is to get at this point is to get at least several dozen lightweight high-yield nuclear warheads along with internationally-recognized precision intercontinental attack capability. Once they've got that, they're pretty close to immune to any external aggressors.

Of course, once they have that, they're not going to need 4% of their population in active military duty, and nearly 23% of their GDP going to military expenditures. They would also be able to stop the missile tests which would save money and likely ease their relations with the rest of the world.

It actually seems fairly likely that NK will try to take the same route that China took. Become a nuclear power first, then use cheap labor to attract foreign investors to develop and industrialize your country. After several decades, quality of life will improve, labor costs will go up, and companies will gradually transition to less developed countries.
