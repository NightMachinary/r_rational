One crazy doesn't contradict another crazy. I worked with a patient who belive he was son of God and can't die while suffering from terrible case of arachnophobia. His fear of spider didn't contradict the fact he is Jesus 2.0 at all in his mind. Same hear his fear of betrayal doesn't have to stop his belief in his invincibility
