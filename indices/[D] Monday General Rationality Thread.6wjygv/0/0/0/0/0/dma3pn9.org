This. I work as Support Worker in Mental hospital one lesson I have learnt is that you can't rationalise with crazy. I had a patient assult staff member because they wanted to have cigarette at 2:30 not at 3:00. As result they ended up not having any all day.

They knew full well that that wold be consequences of assult on staff member and they still did it. When you are in irrational state of mind it doesn't matter what rational approach dictates your emotions override the logic.

NK leader is litterly a God to his people he have lived and breathed this reality for almost his entire life. It's not unreasonable to assume he belives in his own propaganda by now and thinks of himself as invincible.
