So, [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/28/contra-askell-on-moral-offsets/][latest SSC post]] on moral offsets has me wondering what the real upper bound is for the cost of an "offset" for vegetarianism.

I actually signed up to make a comment because I thought Scott's figure ($500 per year) was way off. I think the order of magnitude for the upper bound is more like $6,000 per year; anyone interested in the thought experiment of "what is the most it would cost to offset a year's meat consumption"?

Relevant paragraph of his post:

#+begin_quote
  Or use offsets instead of becoming vegetarian. An typical person's meat consumption averages 0.3 cows and 40 chickens per year. Animal Charity Evaluators believes that donating to a top animal charity this many animals' lives for less than $5; others note this number is totally wrong and made up. But it's hard to believe charities could be less cost-effective than just literally buying the animals; this would fix a year's meat consumption offset price at around $500. Would I pay between $5 and $500 a year not to have to be a vegetarian? You bet.
#+end_quote

Below I argue that the true upper bound is likely an order of magnitude higher, and while if I could do better than being vegan for $5 a year it would be an attractive trade, I don't think "vegan for a year vs $5k USD" is nearly as attractive. I will boldly propose that for most people, if they were given that choice (go vegan or pay $5k per year), they would choose veganism.

I think the other thing is, in calculating an offset for meat consumption, we need to not only calculate the cost of buying the animals themselves but of keeping them. A cow lives 20 years, a chicken 10. You need to give them a place to sleep, veterinary care, etc. So you'll need to pay for a farm with a constant population of 6 cows and 400 chickens, and for someone to be taking good care of them. (This may be 400 chickens and 400 roosters depending on how/if egg production was counted, and never mind sheep, pigs, etc: but let's use Scott's figures). I am not a farmer, feel like keeping 6 cows and 400 chickens is going to cost more than $500 a year even assuming you don't give them medical treatment (in this “offset” situation I think it would be “right” to give them medical care if you an average family would give equivalent care to their pet dog -- so minor surgeries but maybe only palliative care for cancer rather than extensive chemo).

If you're trying to say that if a cow can be purchased for say, $300, then it must mean that keeping a cow for its entire life costs less than $300 or the farmer makes no profit, I think that's fallacious as the farmer selling the cow is probably keeping it in the factory-like conditions that make vegetarianism so desireable, and the farmer sells it at age 2 rather than age 20, which is how old you'd be keeping it.

So, suffice it to say, I think the $500 per year upper bound on the cost of a vegetarian offset is way off.

(I quickly googled the cost of boarding a horse, since that's a popular service and a horse probably has similar requirements to a cow, and that's $400-$500 a month; so I think the upper bound is more on the order of $6,000 per year, likely even higher than that!)
