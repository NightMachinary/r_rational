the offset should be going into vat grown meat research. This is a /solvable problem/. Once we have tasty, healthy, cost effective vat grown meat, domestic meat production goes into the crapper. Oh sure, it will still exist as a niche market, but as a mass produced product? not a chance.

It's just like the abortion issue, ignoring the moral complexity of yes or no on abortion entirely. Making an affordable artificial womb /so far shifts the debate it could swing some staunchly for it to the other side/. Why would those who feel strongly about this not donate and focus on this stuff if this is the 'evil they wish to change'?

Mostly I think it revolves around the inability of people to imagine a world different than the one they reside in, even as it changes swiftly around them.
