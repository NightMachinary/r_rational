I'm reminded of the South Park episode where Cartman buys an amusement park for his personal use and he has to keep selling more and more tickets to pay for the guards and ticket sales and so on. You're right that there are a lot of hidden costs that are tricky to calculate. I suppose you wouldn't have to treat the animals completely ethically, just well enough that the marginal cost of doing good via other charities is cheaper. I wouldn't know where to begin computing that.
