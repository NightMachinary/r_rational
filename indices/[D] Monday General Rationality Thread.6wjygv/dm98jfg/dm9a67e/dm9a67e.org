  "[W]hy don't wizards on their deathbeds charge money to bind Unbreakable Vows, and use that to leave an inheritance for their children -" [asked Harry.]

  "Because they are stupid," said Professor Quirrell. "There are hundreds of useful rituals which could be performed if men had so much sense; I could name twenty without stopping to draw breath." --- [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/74][HPMoR, Chapter 74]]

To be more serious, all of what you've said. The probability of a terminally ill patient (1) coming across the idea, /and/ (2) being physically able to carry an assassination out, /and/ (3) having the skills to carry an assassination out, /and/ (4) being willing to carry an assassination out, /and/ (5) finding someone to pay them is just too small. If you're thinking about an employer's side, the probability of finding someone terminally-ill-but-able must be considered.

It probably happens sometimes, but not often.
