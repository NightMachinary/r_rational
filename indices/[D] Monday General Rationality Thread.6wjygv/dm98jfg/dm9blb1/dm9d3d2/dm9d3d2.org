So, for the sake of storywriting, let's say there's some kind of illness that is guaranteed to kill you in a fixed period of time regardless of any attempts at treatment. It's still not going to be likely for several reasons.

*Logistical reasons:* Almost any government that has the resources to track such people down and recruit/equip them probably also has the resources to just use cruise missiles or drones. These have the advantage of being available at any time and are likely more reliable anyway. The situation might be more plausible in a historical setting where cruise missiles and drones aren't available.

For non-government organizations, like rebel, criminal or terrorist groups, there is significant difficulty in identifying functional people with terminal illnesses, and significant danger in trying to recruit them. You'd pretty much have to get doctors on your side who would refer such patients to you, and that seems exceedingly unlikely, not least because doctors are in the business of saving lives, not taking them.

Individuals who are diagnosed with such an illness seem to be the most likely ones to carry out such a plan, though the people who are most likely to get any kind of terminal illness in the first place are people who didn't have the resources and capability to prevent that from happening. As such, they're not likely to have the means to carry out a nefarious plan even if they wanted to.

For the sake of storywriting, let's assume we have a historical setting where cruise missiles aren't available and suicidal assassins are among the best options for taking out high-value targets. Even so, it's still unlikely because:

*Moral, ethical, and religious reasons:* Most people believe in some kind of afterlife and punishment for misdeeds. People who are faced with death are more likely than most to think carefully about what awaits them death. Even in the absence of religion, almost everyone can agree that murder is bad, as is asking people to commit murder, so it would not be easy to find people who would agree to be recruiters, and it would be even harder to find volunteers for such missions.
