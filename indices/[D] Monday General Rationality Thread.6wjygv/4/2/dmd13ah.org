  I have the alief that present-me will die and be replaced by one-second-in-the-future-me, who in turn will also be replaced.

I think you are jumping to conclusions here, but sure. It's possible. There's no possible way for anyone to disprove this hypothesis, anymore than it is possible to disprove the existence of god or an undetectable spaghetti monster.

The question then is... how are you not the most disgustingly happy person in the world? If you truly believed this, that would imply that your actions have no consequences for yourself whatsoever. You could do whatever the hell you feel like and any retribution from the people you hurt would only hurt future you, who you believe to be a different person and apparently don't really care about. You could go around murdering people you don't like and get away with it, since future you would be the one getting imprisoned/killed, not present you. Sure, other people would get hurt, but seeing as you don't even care about future you, why would you care about other people?

Thankfully for the rest of us, there's no way to prove your alief either. It is also entirely possible, that in the future, you will find out that you ARE future you. Or that present you will find yourself strapped to an electric chair in the future, without having been replaced by future you, after going on his happy murder spree. Or maybe you will be replaced for a while, but then suddenly find yourself back in place with a knife in your gut.

Are you truly willing to bet that you won't be these future yous?

(If yes, I beg you to provide all information about yourself to the police right now so that they can arrest future you more easily. You don't care if they arrest future you right? Since future you isn't you, according to your alief.)
