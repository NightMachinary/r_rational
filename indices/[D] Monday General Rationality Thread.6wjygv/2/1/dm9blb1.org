There's a lot of reasons. Let's start with medical reasons:

For starters, it's exceedingly rare that someone has a guaranteed terminal illness while still being physically fit and functional. Survival rates with the most deadly kinds of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, are quite low, but even 5% odds of survival for five years means you still potentially have something to lose if you get arrested. Of course, current five year survival rate data is also at least five years out of date with current treatments, so the realistic odds of survival are typically better than would be expected from current research.

Other kinds of terminal illness (like severe heart failure) in a patient who is not a candidate for transplant or surgery are almost always so problematic already that the patient cannot even perform the basic daily tasks they would need to survive at home.

About the only thing I can think of that would qualify as certainly fatal while still leaving you at least modestly functional for some short period of time would be sudden exposure to 8-30 sieverts of ionizing radiation. Of course, in this case, you'd start to feel nauseous and begin vomiting in under 10 minutes after exposure, and begin to have heavy diarrhea in under an hour. You'd have a severe headache in 1-2 hours and a severe fever in under an hour. You'd only be lucid for 'several' hours before becoming too cognitively impaired to function. This could conceivably happen in some kind of nuclear accident, but it's doubtful that you'd be able to confirm the dose, get out of the situation, and still have time to accomplish anything meaningful before becoming too crippled to function anymore.
