  Why aren't terminally ill but not bedridden patients *hired* as suicidal assassins more?
#+end_quote

You are an evil criminal mastermind who wants to assassinate someone. Do you go to a hospital looking for terminally ill commoners? Or do you hire an actually skilled assassin?

The number of problems with choosing the former is endless: since they are commoners, they are horrible incompetent. They will fail the assassination and put the target on guard. They won't have proper subtlety, leaving trails of evidence everywhere. They won't have work ethics or a professional reputation to maintain, so there's nothing stopping them from telling others who their employers are for more cash. And just as they have nothing to fear from the authorities, they have nothing to fear from you. Nothing to stop them from stabbing you in the back if they want to.

  Are most people just moral enough to consider essentially risk-free benefit to their family/friends
#+end_quote

How is becoming an assassin "risk-free" for your family and friends? The vast majority of the population still operates on "evil by association" fallacies. They see you are an assassin, and think your family and friends are assassin supporters. Self-proclaimed vigilantes then proceed to enact justice by harassing your friends and family en masse. This is a terrible risk.
