  Why aren't terminally ill but not bedridden patients hired as suicidal assassins more?
#+end_quote

Cold-blooded violence seems extremely rare. I suspect our brains are wired to not notice it as an option.

I encounter a lot of political debate. It's common to meet people who think [issue] is a matter of life-and-death. Often, they're right. To pick a minimally-distracting example, [[https://phys.org/news/2016-07-coal-year-eu.html][coal pollution kills about 23,000 people]] in the EU/year.

But, the idea of a terminally-ill patient going after coal-advocates seems far-fetched. That sort of thing doesn't happen. And, when you think about it, it's kind of odd that it doesn't. It would be interesting in that they'd be alien and terrifying, but understandable in a weird way.

I'd like to read a story about some kind of accident / disease that made people notice this sort of thing and lowered the inhibitions towards acting.
