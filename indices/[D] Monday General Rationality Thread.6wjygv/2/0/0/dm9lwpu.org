For (4), it's not just about them being willing. They'd have to /prefer/ the idea to all the alternatives (e.g. spending time with their family, traveling the world, going for a hail Mary cure, cryogenics, creating art or memoirs as a legacy).

Even a sociopath is likely to be able to come up with a better way to spend their final months of life. You're essentially limited to somebody who's been searching for an excuse to do it.

It maybe makes sense for a hitman to take on a suicide mission for one last payout (though even that seems too Hollywood to happen, since hitmen probably have other goals beyond murder), but I can't imagine somebody with no existing history of violence making this decision.

Now if they were personally motivated for the murder, sure. Not beyond the pale for somebody to take an enemy out with them, even without money in the picture. Still not going to be a remotely common choice, but revenge is a powerful motivator.
