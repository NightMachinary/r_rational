Why aren't terminally ill but not bedridden patients hired as suicidal assassins more? The extreme jump of the acceptable risk curve makes me think this should be more of a thing than it is. I would certainly consider doing something like that if I were in such a situation and an offer came along. Possibly even for free aside from the tools required for the kill (gun/bomb/poison) if I found the target's values to be aligned against mine to a sufficient degree.

Such an assassin would have no reason to cooperate with authorities if they were captured, and there exists no leverage to cause them to reveal whatever they might know about their employer (which should be nothing anyway) (i.e. sentence reduction is meaningless); they can employ otherwise insane tactics (e.g. poison themselves with slow acting but lethal contact poison and go shake hands with the target).

Is it just too cost inefficient to be viable considering the would assassin is just a regular person with no relevant skills who would likely just be taken down before they can succeed? Do people just stop caring about anything at that point? Are most people just moral enough to consider essentially risk-free benefit to their family/friends or general fulfillment of their values at the cost of their enemies/"bad people" to be reprehensible? Is it simply a logistical issue of finding a terminally ill person whose values misalign sufficiently with the target's?
