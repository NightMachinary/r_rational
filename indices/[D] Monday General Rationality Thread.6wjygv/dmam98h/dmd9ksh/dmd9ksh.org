It is kind of true trivially though, right? Like the present moment is different than the past because you perceive it as actually happening now. But there was a past you that experienced that past that now is a memory, and you remember what it was like but it was different when it was 'actually happening'. So the 'present you' is always changing, and there's an instance of you that lives in every instant.

So you don't really 'die', it's just that time keeps going forward, second to second. You just always have memories of previous points in time and because of causality they form a coherent existence.

So it all adds up to normality, as they say.

One really interesting (and pretty disturbing) thing is what happens when a person's present stream of consciousness still functions but is completely cut off from any memories of the past, as is the case for Clive Wearing ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c62C_yTUyVg]]).
