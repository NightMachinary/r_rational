  I slept through the Physics class,

Well /there's/ your big mistake.

#+begin_quote
  “I” is just a pattern that emerged from neurons firing off in my brain.
#+end_quote

Ehhh, it's closer to being the pattern that emerges from the feedback loops between your brain and body. But also the trajectory of that pattern through time.

But also ultimately a normative judgement on your part (which of course means how the pattern at any given point in time wants to move its embodiment towards encoding other patterns, insofar as it possesses a model of its own embodiment).

But it's /most/ proper to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81#M.C4.81dhyamaka][discard Platonism about the self]] and [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/of/dissolving_the_question/][dissolve the concept]].

  I know that it was always like that and it can't be changed, so my definitions are probably wrong and I'm looking at it from the wrong perspective.
#+end_quote

Yes indeed!

#+begin_quote
  Like, you know about people who count sleeping/temporary loss of consciousness as death? I'm like this, except turned to eleven. And even though I know it's stupid, I can't stop it.
#+end_quote

I mean, it's stupid because they're /wrong/. They're imagining something that's not there, and then mourning its loss, when actually it wasn't there to begin with.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, so that's it. I hope you'll help me someway with this.
#+end_quote

Not sure we can talk you into different aliefs. How did this one really get there?
