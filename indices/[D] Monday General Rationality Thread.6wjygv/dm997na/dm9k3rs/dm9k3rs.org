Why not. I'm certainly not an expert on the topic, so feel free to disregard the following at your leisure, but in my opinion this foolish or desperate policy is trying to rock the boat. They can't really seriously hurt any advanced country, but they're damn well going to try, or pretend to try. Attempts to stop them, or get revenge after they destroy something, or the /precedent/ of getting revenge, are going to inflict much more damage than their actions on their own.

This county just happens to be both stupid enough or in a precarious enough position so that such actions make sense to them, and have the technology and social order such that they could build the necessary tools and give out the necessary orders. C'est la vie.

Honestly, news like this don't at all help me get rid of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6g8z4s/d_friday_offtopic_thread/diop1y4/][my fatalistic mindset]].
