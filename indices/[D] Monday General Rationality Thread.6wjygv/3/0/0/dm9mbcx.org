Yeah, the good food institute is my favourite charity for vegan causes, though it's not tax deductible where I live >_>

I like that with vat meat we can go for e.g. tiger or panda meat, which would be great when the technology reaches something like $500/kg of tissue since until it reaches the crazy low prices I see for American chicken ($2/lb or something??????) nobody will be buying chicken with it.

More than that I think "artificial" meats like you can get from Quorn, Fry's, Gardein etc will come into play for a lot of applications. Joe Sixpack probably won't balk at buying Chicken ^{style} nuggets if they're 20% cheaper, and they will be when it gets to a high enough scale. Already subway is cutting their chicken with soy; they're not doing that because they want to protect us from cancer with those isoflavones, they're doing it because it's cheaper.

I don't think artificial wombs help the abortion debate at all; there's still a kid who needs to be raised and I'm sure artificial wombs aren't free. I ain't paying child support if I would otherwise have got an abortion (admittedly getting it adopted by a family in need would render the child support angle moot).

Plus a procedure for getting the zygote out of the womb sounds like a risky medical procedure moreso than abortion is. Better to take RU486 ASAP, suffer for a few hours/days, and then be done with it.

But if artificial wombs became cheap and safe moreso than birth control, you'd end up with a crazy oversupply of babies before too long (especially because couples in need could opt to have a baby that is their genetic progeny grown in an artificial womb in lieu of extremely expensive surrogacy).

Really the best solution is to advocate for all boys to be injected with something like vasalgel at a very young age, and find something similar (safe, non hormonal, permanent, reversible) that would work for girls (I don't think a copper IUD on a 10 year old girl is going to work!). This can then be deactivated when required. Would probably infringe on a lot of peoples' religious freedoms or something though.
