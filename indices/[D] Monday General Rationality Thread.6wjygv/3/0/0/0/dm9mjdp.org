It /shouldn't/ shift the debate for all the reasons you pointed out, anymore than the fact that homosexuality isn't a choice but innate shouldn't change the discussion either...but once people started to generally accept that, the debate changed.

The same would happen with abortion at the political level. Once you can say 'look, you can have the fetus removed and put in this device and then it has nothing to do with you' well, you will see some stances change /even though nothing has intrinsically changed/ about the moral/ethical conditions.

It's unfortunate, but true, that emotional responses will be a component in these kinds of discussions for people.

I agree though, a birth control drug like you described for both sexes provided free at an early age would do the trick pretty damn fast, it also would never work in most places in the world simply because of religious concerns. fuck that annoys me.
