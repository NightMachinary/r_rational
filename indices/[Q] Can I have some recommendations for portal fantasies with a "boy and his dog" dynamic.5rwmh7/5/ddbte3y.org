I might be misunderstanding what "portal fantasies" means, but [[http://www.minnasundberg.fi/comic/page00.php][A Redtail's Dream]] is a webcomic about a young man and his dog on a journey through a series of dream worlds based on Finnish mythology. (Not their own dream--the worlds are basically constructed realities provided by the titular redtail.) It definitely has the dynamic you're looking for between the two of them. One thing that makes it interesting is that the "boy" isn't a traditional heroic personality. You'll see what I mean if you read it.

The story is complete, about 550 pages. The author is not a native English speaker, so there's some awkward phrasing in the early pages, but that improves as the story goes on until it's barely noticeable. The artwork is lovely and emotionally expressive, and the story is original and well-crafted.

(Caveat: The "boy" isn't exactly a moron, but he does do some stupid things. However, those actions stem from consistent personality flaws he has, and he consistently has to suffer the consequences of the stupid things he does. So when he's stupid, it's just him being stupid, not the narrative.)
