Try "The Guardians of the Flame" by Joel Rosenberg. One of the protagonists rescues a dragon chained up in the sewers as a waste disposal system.

As I recall it's even pretty rational. There's one character, a slaver, who could be argued to be evil for the lulz, but I remember him as more of a bully than a mustache-twirler.
