I'm glad you're liking it better! There's definitely a wish fulfillment element (I mean, robots and aliens...) But I was trying to make it not bad and powertrippy. If you don't mind, can I ask what you think the beginning chapters need? I'm planning a rewrite of them soon, so I'd love some feedback.
