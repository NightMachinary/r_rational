The first few chapters seemed to be so quiet. Have you seen [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passengers_(2016_film][Passengers]])? It seems like you tried to do the same as that movie in the first part, to build a relationship with the character. To make him relatable, to make us want to sympathize... But then he's so smart. but then he had the girl. he's got the AI. He's doing all this engineering... And yet somehow can't bypass the paladin protection stuff. He's still going through with the training.

I can't sympathize. I didn't sympathize with him until after chapter 1.13 This guy is so damned smart. Creates all this technology. But hasn't overcome his shortcomings or played to his strengths. He's so... absorbed into the idea of the paladin suits.

Everything he is doing is related to these stupid paladins and seriously, fuck them, he shouldn't be using them. Not now. Maybe not ever.

He's got a manufacturing center, build a bloody drone army. He's got a very responsive voice command system that's capable of doing a heck of a lot of bug fixing. He's got working drones already. He needs to blitz everything that he encounters or his secrecy is lost. His obsession with the paladins doesn't make sense... except as a vehicle to make him 'fit and sexy' for someone.
