This is gold, thank you.

I haven't seen Passengers, but that's the idea I was trying to get at. Isolate him, make him sympathetic. I was very new at this (still am, been writing this for a month now), so it wasn't all that effective. The idea was this guy had a lot, then lost it. Looking back on it, I want him to be going crazy in the beginning and clinging to the idea of the Paladin as a lifeboat, something that he can escape to.

As far as the drone army goes. they'll show up later in the story but they aren't as much fun to read or write about at this point. I like seeing a character /doing/ something, and controlling drones doesn't seem that interesting, to me at least.

I think what it comes down to is something I really should've known before posting this here: it isn't rational fiction. It plays a lot more fast and loose and stretches suspension of disbelief to it's limits. It's kind of like Halo (surface level at least, I know the lore for Halo is way deeper than my story). Does it make sense to focus a whole shitload of resources into developing superhumans? Not really, in my opinion, make more scorpions. But is it fucking cool? Yes. I want my character in an ass kicking robot and by God I'll make it happen. Not necessarily to make him fit and sexy, but because I think robots are neat.

Honestly though, thank you for your feedback, it's really quite helpful. There's definitely some fixing to do.

Edit: oh, and I fucked up about the rank, he was supposed to be a Captain.
