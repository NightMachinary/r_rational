okay, this makes a lot of sense. People do that. But it hasn't come across. If you can get that coming across in those first few chapters a lot of my issues with this are going to go away.

maybe give him a todo list he reads in the morning. 'Get the Paladins ready' 'Get in a Paladin' 'Save the world' Something to indicate that he is so fixated on getting into one. Does he keep one his room? does he have them lined up? Seriously, those first dozen chapters show /far/ more emotional attachment to the autobuilders than the Paladins.

The drives and desires of characters don't have to be rational to belong here. The Actions they undertake don't have to be either. Just the world. -Edit- That's wrong. It could be anything that's rational. Maybe a Rational character in an irrational world. A Rational World with irrational characters, blah blah blah. If there's an element your audience sees and goes 'That's rational' then the juxtapositioning of the rational and irrational can be a story-point/interest in itself. -/Edit-

What is the reason why the suits are so good in comparison to drones. Why a Paladin instead of a drone army. What's he rational reason behind him not doing his engineering to drone optimize. You explained it to me here, now get it into the story!
