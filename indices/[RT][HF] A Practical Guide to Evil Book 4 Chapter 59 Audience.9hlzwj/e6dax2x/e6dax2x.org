Kinda funny, kinda terrifying seeing Archer so on her toes dealing with the dwarves. If Cat manages to swing an alliance or other arrangement that lets her make use of some of their military (the deed-seekers, perhaps?), I imagine it'll give everyone except the Dead King reason to pause and reassess.

I dunno how Akua managed to do it, but I can't imagine it's a coincidence that she's found herself speaking on behalf of Cat in what's probably a make-or-break negotiation for Callow. I hope this doesn't end with Cat and Vivi breaking ties when Cat refuses to kill Akua sometime soon-ish.

Cat's humanity continues to ebb, but it's nice that she's naturally referring to herself as the Queen of Callow without qualification or compromise.
