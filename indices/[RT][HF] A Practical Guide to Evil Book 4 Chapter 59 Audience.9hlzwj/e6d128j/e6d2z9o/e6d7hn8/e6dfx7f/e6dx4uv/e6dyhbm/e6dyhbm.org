  The Herald smiled, slow and mean.

  “I offer hospitality to you, Queen of Callow,” he said. “Let us eat, drink, and talk of murdering gods.”

#+end_quote

Maybe "double entendre" is the wrong term, as neither intended meaning is indecent, but I can't think of something better to mean "a phrase intended to have two different but equally valid meanings."
