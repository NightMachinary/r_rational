That takes me back.

I was in Grade 9 English, and my teacher, knowing my taste for bad jokes, invited me to help out, as we were going to be taking about wordplay.

There were twenty of us, so the teacher took half, and I took the other half. I asked each of the other students to write down a joke ending in a pun, and put it in a hat.

After everyone had finished, I told everyone the definition of a pun: as opposed to other kinds of wordplay, a pun almost always involves a single word with multiple definitions, or two words or phrases that sound similar.

I took each slip of paper out of the Harry and read it aloud, to see if any of them met that definition, and, wouldn't you know it, no pun in ten did.
