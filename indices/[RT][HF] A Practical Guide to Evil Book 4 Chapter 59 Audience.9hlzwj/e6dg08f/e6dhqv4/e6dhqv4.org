"Guess you had to be there" is a common phrase for when something doesn't seem funny to you, whereas it's funny for the person speaking. It suggests situational humour for which you (the person not finding it funny) don't have the necessary context, because they weren't there.

That is subverted by Cat actually 'having been there' (in this case, the dwarfs weren't actually there), and still not finding it funny.
