It was more a commentary on how angels in this universe are, from our perspective, evil deontologists. They have principles and rules they cannot break, but those rules don't align with human needs at all. They're just as willing to cause mass slaughter and misery as the Gods Below. So when a being called "The King of the Dead" rises, slaughtering his whole kingdom in a ritual to make him immortal and rend a permanent hole in the fabric of reality, what do the angels do? Brainwash thousands of people and have them march to their deaths at the hands of the monster. The angels are worse than useless because they only ever meddle in human affairs by destroying people and leading what remains to its doom. It's what happened to the seventh crusade, it's what happened to William, it's what's in the process of happening to the White Knight, and it's what would have happened to Liesse if our hero hadn't intervened.

Almost every death in every conflict since the beginning of this story can be placed squarely on the shoulders of Above. Malicia would have been perfectly content to reform Praes in peace, eliminating the most abominable elements and overall improving the conditions for everyone in the so-called evil empire. If she'd been left to her own devices, if Above had been content to just watch and see where she was going with all these ideas of hers, none of the conflicts on the surface of Calernia would be happening right now. But they didn't. So, instead, Malicia felt the need to quietly sponsor the creation of the ultimate superweapon. If Above hadn't pushed Procer into war or had convinced them to clean their own house for a few decades, Cat would have remained a competent and unoppressive sovereign rather than forcing her into the corner with no good options.

To put it another way, Above created the Wandering Bard before Below sponsored the Dead King. We know that the terms of the game that is creation allow each side to only use power in proportion to that which the other uses, so we know that Above knew their choice to create an immortal, unstoppable force with the power to manipulate an entire continent at once would have consequences. They did it anyway. Below responded in kind, as was their right, and obliterated a Kingdom. Above is and always has been ham-fisted and brash, acting without thinking of consequences and only coming out ahead by escalating every conflict they meddle in before Below reacts in kind. Below responds by gaining more institutional power, every time. Praes has been invaded countless times by armies led by the Scions of the Heavens themselves, and though they have caused regime change on occasion, they have never eliminated Praes or made any other substantive, long-term gain. They manage to win every battle and lose every war, in the long run. They always fail, and when they fail, they always proceed to make everything worse.

The angels are useless against the Dead King because he and his patrons are smarter and better at using power than all of them combined. That is something that you don't see outside the Guideverse.
