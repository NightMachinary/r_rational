Well, it's kind of hard to summarize. But basically it's written with a future audience in mind, like, showing people of the future what life was like back in this time. It doesn't really have a strict main plot because the story is determined by events in real life. It's kinda like a journal, except in novel form.

I call it 21st century historical nonfiction because it doesn't read like drama, but rather more like sci-fi/fantasy adventure. I suppose it's technically a drama but it doesn't fit with other works in that genre.
