Actually the precog did make sense at the time since they still didn't know how his powers worked, but everything else you said is accurate. The action was lazy, the plot was contrived, the characters made stupid mistakes, and the introduction of Velocity 9 ends up having very little impact on the overarching story. That basically sums up everything wrong with season two, though I assure you that the first one is good even if it's really cheesy.
