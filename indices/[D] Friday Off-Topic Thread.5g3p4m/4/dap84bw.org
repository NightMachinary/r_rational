Remember how I praised the Flash tv show not long ago? I hereby restrict my complements to season one and parts of season two. I'm nearly caught up on season three and it seems to be going down the drain like Arrow did at roughly the same rate, for pretty much the same reasons, and it won't be coming back up. The characters keep making stupid decisions, the plot is contrived and drawn out, and the themes the story explores don't make any sense. What happened to such a fun, if cheesy, superhero series?

The best I can figure is that the writers, for both Arrow and Flash, had a great season-long arc for the first year that also acted as a great framing device for episodic crimefighting. After that arc wrapped up, though, they didn't seem to know what to do with the story. The second season for both shows are padded out with bland one-off arcs and the Big Bad for the season fails to be as compelling. Then the third season comes around and the plot completely loses focus of what it's about yet still ends up being formulaic.

I also want to blame the executives at CW for seemingly boxing the writers in. Tons of new characters kept getting introduced for the sake of it and shoehorned into the plot. I'm convinced Legends of Tomorrow was made to compensate for this by taking all the excess side characters away to a different story, but they also ended up taking compelling villains and side characters too. If Flash is so desperate for plot, why deny the show access to Captain Cold and, by extension, the Rouges? They're Flash's signature villains!
