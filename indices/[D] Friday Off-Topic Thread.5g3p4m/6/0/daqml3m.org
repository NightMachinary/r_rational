Only crazy in that you seem to be focusing on the apex of Mazlows hierarchy. I'm not sure if your allready prepped or just focusing on what seems important at the moment. Lets leave the question of if your concerns are valid aside for a second. If we see significant disruption, logistics are going to go first, and most analysis I've read have grocery stores in urban areas empty in well under 7 days.

So how much food and water and electrical generating capacity do you have set aside?
