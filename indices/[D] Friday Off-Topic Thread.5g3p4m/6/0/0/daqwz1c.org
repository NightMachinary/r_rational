  So how much food and water and electrical generating capacity do you have set aside?

Without revealing any particular details that I might one day wish I'd never shared: my physical library still has a set of Y2K prepping books next to the ones on camping, and I've long had my sets of plans in place for both hunkering down or bugging out. There are a few pieces of gear that I could wish for, like a [[http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/coleman-100-watt-12-volt-crystalline-panel-0112099p.html][100 watt solar panel]] and relevant accessories, or a decent ham radio base station and antenna instead of my handheld portable transceiver (VA3BOS at your service), but given that I'm on a fixed income and that Life Happens, I've never quite been able to scrape together the couple hundred bucks needed at any given time for either of those items.

But hey, I've got a handheld computer with copies of Wikipedia and Wikivoyage and a few other things, a folding solar panel that just barely fits in an oversized coat pocket to power it, and a microfiber towel that fits in my other oversized coat pocket, so I Don't have to Panic, right? :)
