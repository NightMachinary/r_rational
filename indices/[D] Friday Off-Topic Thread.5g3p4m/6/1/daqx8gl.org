As a point of interest: as of when I woke up, the votes were: [[http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/o69/open_thread_nov_28_dec_04_2016/diqb][LessWrong]], two votes for paranoid; [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5g3p4m/d_friday_offtopic_thread/daqck7b/][/r/rational]], two votes for not particularly crazy.

Emotionally, I'm not feeling the particular "I'm going to hate myself in January 2018 if I haven't mailed copies of my archival Blu-Ray discs to certain members of my extended family stretching halfway across the continent by then, and the Net gets taken down" urgency that I did when I posted, but it still seems like a good idea to nudge my plans in the direction of being able to handle that particular scenario with minimal losses of what I find valuable.
