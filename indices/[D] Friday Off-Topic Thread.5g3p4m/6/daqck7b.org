I'm having an un-rational moment, and despite knowing that, it's still affecting my behaviour.

Earlier today, my newsfeed included the datum discussed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/5g7118/what_does_trumps_phone_conversation_with_the/][here]], of Trump having a phone call with the President of Taiwan; and the item discussed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5g2yc4/the_law_that_could_allow_trump_to_shut_down_the/][here]], about Trump talking about 'shutting down' the Internet. And later, while listening to my music playlist of the Merry Wives of Windsor, one of the tunes that popped up was "Green Fields of France", one version of which can be heard [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFunhlWJiok][here]]. And I started wondering whether I was prepared for politics to go in an even more negative direction than I'd thought it might back during the American elections, faster than I thought it might.

Specifically, I have the question stuck in my head: "Have I made the appropriate level of preparations, in case of significant military conflict within the year?". There are a variety of possibilities, from America's Congress passing laws that I find abhorrent, to China engaging in cyberwar against North American network infrastructure, to a minor US/Canadian dispute blowing up to the point Trump convinces some portion of the US military across the border to ensure the continued flow of "vital resources", to worse.

Put another way - I've just finished figuring out what I would want to have done this month if, some time next year, many websites I find valuable become permanently deleted and unrecoverable (in spite of the Internet Archive's efforts). (Part of the answer: the program [[https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html][wget]] and an [[https://store.mdisc.com/][archival Blu-Ray burner]].)

The thing is, from inside my own head, I can't tell whether my thoughts have been doing this particular set of planning because I'm currently in the middle of one of my bouts of depression, or if it's actually a perfectly reasonable response to modern life and current events. So I'm looking for some external auditing, here where the sanity waterline is reasonably high:

How crazy do I sound to you?
