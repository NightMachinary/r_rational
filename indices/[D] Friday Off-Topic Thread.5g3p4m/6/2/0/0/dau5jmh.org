  I no longer trust my sense of calibration for the odds of large-scale politics
#+end_quote

I'd like to point out that we update our beliefs based on our priors and likelihoods for difference scenarios. However, people were giving deliberately noisy data (or making other data noisy) which means that we couldn't get very accurate likelihoods on either candidate being president (too much contradicting evidence). This means that most people fell back onto their priors and supported whoever they would have supported before election or without any likelihoods to make a decision on, /or/ base their choice on one source of evidence aka whoever you got the 88% Hillary prediction from.

TL;DR - Just because you had trouble with calibration for this election doesn't mean you are bad at calibration in general. The election would have been difficult for anyone.
