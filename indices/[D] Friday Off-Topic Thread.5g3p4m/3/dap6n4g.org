[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/][The Generic Universal RolePlaying System]] is having a GIGANTIC sale! [[http://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?t=147160][Get 40% off the price of /DRM-free/ GURPS PDFs until 2016-12-15.]] Take this chance to become acquainted with an exhaustively-researched and simulationist system that's /far/ more interesting than the wild abstraction of d20.

Even if you never actually play a game of GURPS, the books are quite fascinating to read (e.g., [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/low-tech/][the Low-Tech series]]), and include [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/biblios.html][thorough bibliographies]] if you want to learn more about the topics covered.

Some examples...\\

*Note: These two were written for GURPS Third Edition, while the current version of GURPS is Fourth Edition. However, they're still mostly compatible with Fourth Edition's mechanics.

Please be aware that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_New_Safe_Confinement][the structure recently erected over the Chernobyl power plant]] should be called, not an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch][/arch/]] (and /definitely/ not a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome][/dome/]]), but a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_(architecture)][/vault/]]. The meanings of =arch= and =vault=, though they must inevitably overlap ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox][how far must an arch be extruded before it should be called a vault?]]), should be kept as separate as possible (presumably, based on the ratio of the volume enclosed by the 3D structure to the area enclosed by the 2D arc), in order to avoid ambiguity--and, in my opinion, the Chernobyl structure falls /firmly/ on the =vault= side of this blurry line. (See, e.g., [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/New_Safe_Confinement.jpg][this photograph]], which clearly shows how half of the structure comprises four linked /arches/--any one of which could stand on its own--that combine to form a /vault/.)
