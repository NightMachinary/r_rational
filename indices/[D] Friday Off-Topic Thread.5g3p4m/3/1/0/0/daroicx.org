How do you figure that? Isn't GURPS's core mechanic still pretty much just "Take the character's skill-level, check for whatever modifiers apply in the situation and add them to the skill, roll 3d6, and compare"? Granted, you may want a few splatbooks' ref-tables to list the relevant modifiers for trying to use voodoo to protect against a psychic while in zero-g and being distracted by rabid weasels, but is there any other system that covers such a scenario in any simpler fashion?
