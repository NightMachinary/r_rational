I've watched one episode of Flash, and it was the one in season 2 where velocity 9 was introduced.

What a shitshow. Why is Flash jumping across the broken bridge at the end when he knew he couldn't do that at the beginning a mere day earlier? Why was the V9 user able to break the bridge with resonance when she had no strength boosts? Why had they never bothered to use the precog guy on the hat before that moment? Why was V9 even /able/ to close and lock the power suppression chamber? Haven't they ever heard of operational security?

It was just completely terrible!
