Yeah, but Supernatural's main advantage is that it started off as a monster of the week series that gradually introduced an overarching plot. It still kept going after it should've ended, but the basic premise of brothers cruising the country hunting monsters is something you can keep going. The weekly villains in Flash and Arrow started off being tied into the season villain's plan, but then the next season's villain does the exact same thing for a completely different reason /and/ one-off villains show up anyway for no reason.

There are plenty of big franchises that built themselves off of sticking to a formula, but that was because the formula itself was compelling and elegant in its simplicity. I actually think the shows would've benefited from switching to a villain of the week structure since it would give the writers more freedom. Superhero stories have always succeeded for the same reasons as sci-fi, they keep doing creative and interesting things with the characters and setting. Flash and Arrow, on the other hand, have been stuck in a rut that they won't get out of.
