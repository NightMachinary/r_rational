Geography minor here - the problem is less about any particular map projection than the twin fact that many mapmakers these days don't know how to choose a projection, and most readers don't even know what a map projection is!

For instance, the Mercator is great if you want to preserve angles, useful for navigation, but so bad for general use or political maps that many geographic societies have recommended that it's use be banned.

Personally, I tend to use the Plate Caree if it must be rectangular, [[https://xkcd.com/977][a globe]] if at all possible - and the geostationary and orthographic projections make this surprisingly practical even without interactive stuff, or simply whatever projection the data comes in. But I tend to deal more in remote sensing and earth observation than political chloropleths, so take that with a grain of salt :)
