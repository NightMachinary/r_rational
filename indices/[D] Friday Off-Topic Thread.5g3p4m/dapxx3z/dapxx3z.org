I've been doing some rereading of stories I read a long time ago, and I have to recommend [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VIWNSU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Skulduggery Pleasant]] for those who are craving something about Harry Dresden. It's like a Dresden-lite, but while it's similar in feel and tone, it's not a knock-off copy. The magic system's well-explained (at least the parts that our protagonist uses) and there are a lot of interesting characterization going on.

I don't know if it's really worth recommending by itself because it's a story written about a Dresden-like character, but through the eyes of a sidekick. I had fun reading it, but I'm not sure if it was more because of how much it soothed my Dresden-itch or because of the book on it's own merits. I've only read the first book so far and for some reason only the first 3 books in a 9 book series have a Kindle edition for me to read.

The [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/284440.Skulduggery_Pleasant][Goodreads reviews]] should help decide if you want to read it.
