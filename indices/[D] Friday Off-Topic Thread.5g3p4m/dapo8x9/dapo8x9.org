For those of you who haven't played Dishonored 2 yet (and have the specs to run it), I heavily recommend it. While the game isn't really rational, more on that later, it features great story-telling in a way that will probably appeal to people who like rational fiction.

Everything in the world of Dishonored 2 feels alive, makes sense, and reinforces the narratives of the game. Reading / watching / listening to its stories feels like playing a video game while reading a dozen very clever fanfictions deconstructing its universe.

You have big picture stuff, people discussing recent events and backstory elements, and newspapers dropping hints about your next missions. But you also have little details that make everything alive, connected and consistent: an overseer in deep cover who booby-trapped his front door; in the middle of a bloodfly-infested building, a journal about a club of occultists who thought tripping on bloodfly venom was a great idea; a black market vendor who sells you weapons, whose shop you can break into to take all his stuff and his money (that one blew my mind); or guards who worry they're going to be replaced by the deadly killer robots the duke is buying.

All these things make the world seem incredibly rich, and consistent. I'd still say it's not rational, because the protagonist basically deals with every single problem through either violence or creative violence; and while the villains are mostly compelling, they're all varying degrees of pure evil: the Crown Killer is a sadistic murderer, Jindosh is an arrogant scientist, Ashworth is a cruel witch, etc.

Also, my only complaint about this game: the heart kind of sucks. In the first game, it was that mysterious, omniscient commentator who gave you another angle on the people who you met and killed; in this one, it spends most of its lines complaining or telling you about how every single person you meet is a sociopath who gave their uncle fake medicine or something (although I do like what it has to say about named characters).
