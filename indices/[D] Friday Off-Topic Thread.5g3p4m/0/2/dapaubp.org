As the other side of the HP debate, I have a bit of extra clarification on the HP system.

Specifically, HP/Pain no longer represents /damage/. Mechanically, each body part will have a stat tracking HP/Pain, and will also have a list of injuries. Previously, injuries were considered semi-permanent damage, such as a broken bone or a severe burn, up to and including an amputation. In effect, they were damage that persisted no matter how long you rested afterwards, and needed specific treatment to fix. Now, on top of that, regular damage like bruises and cuts will be listed as injuries too, except these ones will be able to heal over hours or days like normal.

In battle, taking a hit with, say, your leg, will raise pain in the leg and use the RNG to figure out how much of a bruise or equivalent injury to add. The pain will mean that if you use a kicking move, the amount of force you can put behind it is decreased, and the injuries make it so that abusing the leg by doing things like kicking with it or taking another hit cause more pain because of the preexisting injuries. At the same time, the more in pain a body part is, the more likely it is to sustain injuries from attacks, because the body part's already being stressed. The pain will recede over the course of a few turns, but the injuries you have will cap it at a minimum amount, something like a constant ache or, if it's bad, a persistent agony. If you don't get those few turns of breather, though, the pain becomes a vicious cycle that can easily render a body part useless.

Terminology-wise, I tend to think pain works more smoothly conceptually, but mechanically it's all the same and ketura likes the familiarity of HP. So your body part's HP will drop when you get hit, regen to their cap over the course of a few turns, and injuries will limit the cap for that body part. Having low HP on a body part amplifies the HP loss and injury gain from new attacks, and the lower your HP is the less useful the body part is.
