...I wouldn't put it quite like that.

My current project is to set up some integration tests for the memory-hacking utility, so they can get out of alpha updates and their downstream stuff can be updated and then I can assemble it all again.

Why does this need tests? Lua or Ruby scripts make calls against a C++ API generated by lisp and debuggers to modify the runtime memory of a game without an API at all. This has to be updated for every new version, and sometimes it's not quite right, and then the game crashes and people who don't save often are sad.
