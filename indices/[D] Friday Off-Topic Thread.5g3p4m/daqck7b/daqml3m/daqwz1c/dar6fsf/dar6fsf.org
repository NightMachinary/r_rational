I recommend investing some of your fun/hobby money in 50lb bags of rice or something similar and a lifestraw, which is rather expensive, but from what I've read pretty good as far as covering the basics. I keep these in my own hurricane supplies, but securing a supply of food and water are the starting points us pasty pale thinky types need if bad things happen.
