Let's go with "I have the basics down", and further plans are more to either increase the length of time I can survive without external support, or to improve my quality-of-life for the duration and for afterwards, or are backup plans in case my basic plans come crashing down around my ears. (An example of the latter - I live in a townhouse complex, and if any of three other households manage to burn their place down, mine will go with it, taking away nearly all of my planned resources. Which is just one reason for me to make one or more extra copies of any M-Discs I burn, to ask family members to tuck into a cupboard for me and forget about.)
