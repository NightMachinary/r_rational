Eh, I wouldn't call it paranoid, but I don't think your fears are really founded. The Internet is mostly centralized around American infrastructures, but it still exists in the rest of the world, and back ups are a thing. The government has strong incentives to take down sites like The Pirate Bay or MEGA and haven't managed to do so definitively yet; Wikipedia is probably going to be fine.
