  The government has strong incentives to take down sites like The Pirate Bay or MEGA and haven't managed to do so definitively yet

I find this arguable. In this case, what you refer to as 'The government', I would reduce to 'That portion of the government under the influence of the lobbyists of the Movie And Film Industry Associations of America', which, while willing to throw its not-completely-insignificant weight around, can't leverage the weight of the whole American government. I'm thinking of scenarios such as 'It turns out China put secret backdoors into all sorts of hardware chips, and in a fit of self-righteous pique (which they think will play well to their red-state base), the war-monger side of the American Congress doesn't see any downsides to making a demand that everyone in the world shut down their supposedly Chinese-controlled hardware under threat that if they don't, they'll send the American military to shut it down'. As far as I can tell, several versions of just this one particular scenario don't obviously break the sociological law of every political actor having to act in what they perceive to be their own self-interest.

However, I no longer trust my sense of calibration for the odds of large-scale politics, given that I was willing to go along with the predicted odds of 88% for Hillary winning the election, and didn't update nearly as much as I should have by the time of the election itself. And said lack of calibration puts a sharp limit on how rationally I can act as I decide how much effort to put into preparing for the more unpleasant scenarios.
