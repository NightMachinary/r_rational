Are cheap [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQLDwY-LT_o][Orbital Ring Systems]] possible? I was reading [[http://orionsarm.com/fm_store/Paul%20Birch's%20Page.htm][Paul Birch's]] papers on the topic, and noticed he only bothered to consider really huge versions of the project. This seems to have spawned a myth that it would cost at least trillions of dollars for even a small one.

Part of this is based on misinterpreting his paper (for example, the 31 trillion dollar figure mentioned in paper II is based on an inflated mass number since he quickly changes to a 1/1000th sized project for the next section, which would be launchable for 31 billion by the same math), but another issue is that he doesn't even consider smaller ones in the mass range of the ISS and other comparable space projects. The two scales he considers are 180 thousand ton and 180 million ton. Why not a 180 ton version?

This strikes me as a big omission because ORS's have really fast minimal bootstrapping rates. Any business or government seriously trying to do it in real life would start with the smallest possible and work their way up to the desired scale by using it to launch the mass for successively larger versions.
