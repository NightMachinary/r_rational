I am considering a plotline for a writing project at least two books in the future. Superhero genre, detective fiction, where the detective is a postcog, able to see the past in the area they are currently located in.

There are clearly highly successful, but eventually run into a big problem. One of the crimes they are called on to investigate was performed by a precog.

Precog vs postcog. Cat and mouse between people who can see each other across time. One critical aspect is that tie passes as a constant between them, meaning they can see and hear each other in real time. The crime was committed three days before the postcog first discovered the guilt of the precog, so the precog has three days in their time to silence the postcog, before the knowledge of their guilt leads to their becoming a fugitive.

The precog knows that the postcog will be able to testify against them, and tries to kill the postcog before the trial date using traps of various types, from explosives to poisons.

The postcog just has to stay alive long enough that the precog is taken into police custody.

I already have lots of ideas, but this seems like something that might be of interest to [[/r/rational][r/rational]], so if you want to point out interesting scenarios, I'd love to hear them.
