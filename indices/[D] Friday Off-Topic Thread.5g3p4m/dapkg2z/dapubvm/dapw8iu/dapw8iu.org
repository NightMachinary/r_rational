The postcog can follow the precog in realtime, and see what they were doing three days prior, and react to it.

So, if the precog wants to set up an ambush for the postcog, they have to do it in a way that the postcog doesn't realize is a ambush.

One critical part of this is that the two powers become entwined with one another after their first interaction at the crime scene. Neither of them can break free of the timeframe. The entwining limits both parties.
