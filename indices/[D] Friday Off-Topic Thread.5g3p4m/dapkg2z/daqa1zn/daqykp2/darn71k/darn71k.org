I don't see what you're talking about, I've read all the comments in your thread and i'm not seeing it.\\
The closest thing to a solution I see is the comment about the postcog sharing consciousness with their past self. Because if you think about it you could alter the precogs powers to work the same way just over a different chunk of time.\\
Basically both the cog's would have minds that extend across three days, with the only difference being which time period they are occupying. Damn I have no idea if that's what you intended but that's actually a brilliant solution. Their consciousness would view things as a point in which things become fixed, followed by a constantly shifting probability space.

There was a short story like that I read where there's this humanoid creature that has precognition like that, it's not even sapient but by viewing time the way it does it's still extremely powerful.
