Good stuff in here, but I don't trust myself to be logically consistent with some of the more interesting possibilities you present. At this point, I'm pretty much fixed on the two opponents mingling powers, and both of them operating in both the past and the present.

It also occurred to me that this would never happen to an unfettered precog if they could properly account for a postcog's interference in the future. They would simply avoid the scenario entirely if they wanted to avoid discovery and conflict, unless it became absolutely critical for some reason or another to make an adjustment.

One of the plot ideas I had for motive is that the precog is actively seeking out highly successful people with impractical success ratios in whatever business they are involved in, and killing them, because they fear the existence of other precogs, who might interfere with their life. This might touch on your idea of intermittent powers.
