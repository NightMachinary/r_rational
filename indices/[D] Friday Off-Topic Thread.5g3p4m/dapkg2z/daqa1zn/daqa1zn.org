I think you've also missed the important point that /the precog can't have any actual limit on how far they can theoretically see into the future/.\\
If you've read "...And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes" then it's immediately obvious that the precog can see their future actions /which are influenced by things they can see in the future that they currently can't/. Just write what you see in the future (in code so the postcog can't read it) then look at what you've written 3 days in the future. There's no real way to get around this without postulating that they are actually seeing a alternate reality where they lost their powers in the next second, however if you go that route then the precog is pretty impotent because the future where he lost his powers has very little resemblance to the /actual/ future.
