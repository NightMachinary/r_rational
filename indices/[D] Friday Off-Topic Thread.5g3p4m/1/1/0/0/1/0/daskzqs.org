Yeah a you mentioned the characters would /basically/ have the same power. However because the three days their power covers only overlap in the "present" they would have an important asymmetry. Of course their would be no "present" they both agreed on; the postcog would see three days ago as the present and everything after that as shifting potentiality, whereas the precog would see the "present" as the present but also gets to see the future as probability space.

Honestly the postcogs powers are significantly more powerful, because his fixed present is three days before the precog so he can change events the precog sees as fixed from his perspective (and when they're changed he'll think they were always the way the postcog made them).\\
You might have to remedy this imbalance by giving some advantage to the precog, like being a crime lord with lots of resources who's also maybe slightly more clever and starts out with a better understanding of his power. This way you can start out with the precog winning because the postcog doesn't yet realize he can change the past not just observe it.\\
Though actually the whole premise of being able to observe what's happening in a location in three days or what already happened would require a extra power the way things are set up. After all the way the powers are now you would only be able to see events that you were or will be present for potentially.

Hmm thinking about it having the two people have a timeframe asymmetry is kind of difficult. After all from the perspective of the postcog the precog doesn't even have powers, since his consciousness only stretches over a period of time that will /always/ begin three days in the future. So yeah I guess it might not make sense unless their powers have a time period that overlaps somewhat.

Also I think their are some interesting things to explore here. For one it would be weird (and fascinating) for people who had 'cog abilities, but would never get to use them from their perspective, since they only worked over a time period that was always going to start a few days (or maybe even a few seconds) in the future. Maybe 'cog abilities are actually super common, but they are usually locked away from most people by a unbridgeable time gap, this would be interesting because as a 'cog looked forwards from their present they might see a bunch of people suddenly getting powers that never would in the "real" future, Bonus Points if people do randomly get their cog powers and if at other times people lost theirs for no clear reason.\\
A interesting background detail would be the fact that even for people without powers the present is still stretched over a 6 day period (assuming people with powers generally only stretch 3 days away from this timelines "present"). So as a result post cogs would see a world where because of overlap with precogs (though postcogs are precogs from their own perspective) the future is always known nearly a week in advance, though if the number of cog's is low then people might only know really significant future events, or whatever the information the precogs decided to bring back. Of course all of this would be constantly shifting as well from the postcogs perspective as it's not yet fixed from their perspective.
