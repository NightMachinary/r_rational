To be sure it will work, I'm going to have to think about it for an extended period of time, which is fine as I have a book to edit and another to write before this book is considered.

The shared consciousness across time is where I am at this time, but the exact implementation is still up in the air.

I'm considering merging their powers and giving each of them the same power set, but I have to make sure that works too. This would mean that the present enemy would be aware of the past actions as well, so there would be two people occupying the past AND the present, with the same powers, but each unfamiliar with the specific powers because their powers are an amalgam of the two different power sets.

In order to force action and prevent too much thought and deliberation in the story, I'm thinking about introducing some sort of event horizon for time changes like you referenced. Something like Langoleirs (sp?), but I don't think you were referencing them.

This train of thought has been sneaking up on me. I'll say, not entirely untruthfully, that I think that is what caused me to create some logical weirdness in my most recent prior post, where I differentiated present and past selves. Identical powers for each of them is probably the most elegant solution.

More than thinking about it, I'm probably going to have to write a substantial synopsis and logic test it before I start writing the story.

Since this is happening in the Reject Hero universe, both of their powers will require metabolic expense far beyond normal human to power the abilities, so today, while driving, I imagined scenarios where the two try to keep themselves fed while on the run, chasing each other around in the past as they each attempt to disable/kill/figure out the identity of the enemy in the present.

I'm definitely writing this, now that I've spent time thinking about some of the fun I can have with it, beyond the time shenanigans, but at my current writing pace, that might take a very long time.
