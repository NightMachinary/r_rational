In the short story in question the entity looks like a man with a lion mane or something like that, it was in a thread about powerful non-sentient creatures or something. I tried a shit ton of keywords related to everything I could come up with about it on this subreddit as well as google generally.\\
If it helps (it probably doesn't) the story felt kind of aesthetically old, like it might have been written in the 70's or earlier.
