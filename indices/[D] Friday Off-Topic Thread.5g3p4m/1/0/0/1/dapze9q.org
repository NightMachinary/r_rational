Precog sits in an ambush spot with a gun. Postcog wanders in their respective powers' range. They notice each other.

Precog knows exactly how postcog is going to try to dodge / flee / counterattack, and aims accordingly. Worst case scenario, if it turns out postcog brought a surprise ace-in-the-hole, precog just flees (while dodging unerringly) and tries again later.

Meanwhile, postcog's power is doing jack shit. All it's showing is precog sitting on their ass for a few hours, which is no help at all to actually survive the ambush.

e: at best postcog might stumble onto precog's trail before hitting the ambush point, IF they luck out on which direction they enter the ambush zone form. But that's easily countered (if nothing else, just by staying in the ambush spot for three days).
