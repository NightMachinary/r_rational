Here's the confusing part, if the precog can set up an ambush for the postcog and see that it's a failure, what stops them from changing the set up or undoing the ambush to take account for how the postcog survived?

For example, precog walks to a room where he left his explosive devices hidden, secretly sets up the bomb for it to explode three days in the future while postcog is watching, and the postcog avoids it by noticing a clue and getting out of the room before it explodes. Precog notices that the postcog was in the room for five minutes before ducking out within ten seconds of the bomb exploding. So he resets the timer (in full view of the postcog) to make it explode about three minutes earlier. How can the postcog survive then?

Basically, while you are giving the illusion that the postcog and precog are interacting directly, the precog can change his actions in advance once he learns of how the postcog acted during a certain timeframe. Or are you going with something like the future is set in stone once observed? Meaning if the precog sees something happen, it has to occur?
