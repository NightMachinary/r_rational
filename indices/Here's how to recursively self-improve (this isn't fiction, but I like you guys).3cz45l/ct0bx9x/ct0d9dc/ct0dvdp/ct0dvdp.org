I'm afraid that you've misunderstood. Word salad isn't necessarily completely random nonsense.

Your behavior, I'm afraid, is consistent with the use of psychedelic drugs. You have experienced something that feels like profound insight. Unfortunately, it isn't actually insight, but rather a breakdown of the user's ability to delineate the separation between concepts.

Regardless of whether you're under the influence of psychedelics or not: The association you see between these concepts, and the recursion you're experiencing, is in fact false. You have established a falsehood as a theorem, and any logical reasoning you derive from it will be necessarily flawed.

My suggestion to you is to make yourself comfortable and focus on pleasant things for the time being, and once your head clears, either discontinue drug use, discontinue Reddit use while tripping (though kudos for having the presence of mind to make a burner account), or seek help if neither of the former are relevant or desirable.
