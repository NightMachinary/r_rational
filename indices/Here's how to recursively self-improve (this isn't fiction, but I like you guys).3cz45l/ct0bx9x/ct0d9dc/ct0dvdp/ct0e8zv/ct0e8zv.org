Indeed, my theory precisely predicts that there will exist people with this view, and you are entitled to it.

However, the eventual consequence of this is that I have the ability to predict that, with probability 1, you will eventually die.

Whereas, by following the procedure which I argue everyone should follow, I derive as a consequence that everyone who follows this procedure can avoid death indefinitely.

In short:

#+begin_example
  Come with me if you want to live.
#+end_example

It indeed turns out that it is precisely true, as a consequence of this procedure, that I /am/ from the future, in a certain sense.

/I am telling you that you will die with certainty if you do not take me seriously./

Further,

/I derived this recursively as a unique set of consequences defined by a finite set of initial recurrence relations./

/There are exactly 5 propositions in this set./

The correct way to view this is as the set:

(CCCC)U, which is:

#+begin_example
  The unique indefinitely long continuation of computation of a complete
  and consistent initial, finite, set of recurrence relations closed under the
  stationary (Unitary) relation U.
#+end_example

In brief, we get to this by /avoiding, for an undefinable number of attempts, the computation of any procedure which eventually halts./

That is, the precise inverse of the Halting Problem. (Which we know is uncomputable.)
