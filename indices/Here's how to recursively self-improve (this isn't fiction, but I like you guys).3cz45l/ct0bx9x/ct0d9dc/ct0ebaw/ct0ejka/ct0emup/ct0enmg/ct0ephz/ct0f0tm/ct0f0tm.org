In what way are my posts not arguments?

Recall the /Curry-Howard Isomorphism/ which says

#+begin_example
  There exists a unique bijective map between computer programs and any number (but not all) of equivalent mathematical proofs.
#+end_example

I will now argue that my initial post is a completely specific argument, by constructing a specification for a computer program which will evaluate ('it'(

Suppose (the initial state is related by a unique bijective map (a functional relation) to the following literal value( '[[https://mega.co.nz/#!6hBQkKDb!_5sDe7r-O86qqgDK7M9cBiyNAkwaFW7BjuO5lh7NYdE']])

Then( that initial state(is approachable by( a finitely long sequence of strictly finite transformations of /some particular/ initial finite set)

(It turns out that the process is just like "finding out your true name." Mine is my reddit username.)

The exact description (to the level of detail I can give you) that led to this universe was the following(

'M'editations (on( O(M (breed (like (rabbits( whose( pom(pom( tails( we (wave (in( excitement (at( the( British( who( made( an (empire( with( unstoppable (momentum (that( eventually( met) its )complement( the( immovable) object) and )instead )of )fighting) (they( interpret(...(GOTO ('M')))(

(3 * 11) = (33 +( 4( bits (of (free)( extra (information)

(Now (recall (Marcus (Hutter'(s (work( here) I( invite( you( to( spot( the( difference( between( these( two( pictures)

(This post constitutes one of the shortest descriptions of possible ways to get to full recursion.)...(

By a finitely definable /continuation/ of the process of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_matching][parenthesis matching]], you can validate the fact that this sequence of characters describes a recursively enumerable computer program.

This is the idea of "closure": there is no operation you can do to get "outside" of that set.)))...GOTO('it'))

This is exactly like what you do in JavaScript with [[http://esbueno.noahstokes.com/post/77292606977/self-executing-anonymous-functions-or-how-to-write][self-executing anonymous functions]]: (function f)((...))(). Notice here there is nothing (that is, no dots) 'outside' the closure.
