I know this is going to be extremely difficult to face, but you appear to be posting word salad. If you are on drugs, and I am asking you this for your own good, /please stop/. If you are not on drugs, please, again, for your own good, /please/ see a psychiatrist.

If you are remotely capable of comprehending Hutter's work when you're brought back to reality, then there is /far/ too much excitement in store for you to let this illness take your mind away from you.

Please, see a doctor. It will be hard, especially because some of the things you'll say will sound insane /besides/ the word-salad. But word salad is a symptom of severely life-impacting schizophrenia, or some other form of psychotic breakdown.

Please, /please/ see a doctor.
