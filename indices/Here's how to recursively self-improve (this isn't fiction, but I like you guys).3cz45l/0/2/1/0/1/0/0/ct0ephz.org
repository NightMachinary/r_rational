You are not making "arguments" to evaluate. Look, I have very clear ideas of how recursive self-improvement works. Your word salad isn't it. It's not /anything like/ it. It's what we get when we filter the works of Marcus Hutter and possibly Vadim Kosoy through a diseased brain that, apparently, cannot tell it's diseased.

I'm so, so sorry this happened to you.
