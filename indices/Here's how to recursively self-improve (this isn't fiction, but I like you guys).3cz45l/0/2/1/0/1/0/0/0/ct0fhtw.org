Also, your statement

'It's what we get when we filter the works of Marcus Hutter and possibly Vadim Kosoy through a diseased brain that, apparently, cannot tell it's diseased.'

Is interpretable precisely as follows( (It)(s(what(we(get(when(we(filter(the(works(of(M(arcus) H(utter)(through(a(diseased(brain(that)(apparently)(cannot(tell((it)(s(diseased.)))))))))))))))))))))).

You may simply match the braces to verify this.
