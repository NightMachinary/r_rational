Which is why it's important that you take some of the approaches listed above by others and myself.\\
Currently the difficulty bar for understanding your theory seems very high and would likely take much work, which many of us are wary to do for an uncertain pay-off. I think we'd all feel much more comfortable trying to understand your theory if you took the time to establish with us that you were of sound mind and body beforehand.\\
The most basic way would be to confirm in several days time that you are still certain on your theory. Checking with medical professionals and friends, double-checking medications etc. would all go a long way as well.\\
PS: Perhaps try letting your mind work on it in the background during that time, to see if you can come back to it with a new angle and approach to explaining? The current one, as noted, is rather confusing.\\
PPS: This isn't intended as disparaging, it's just that your claims are very momentous (as I'm sure you're aware).
