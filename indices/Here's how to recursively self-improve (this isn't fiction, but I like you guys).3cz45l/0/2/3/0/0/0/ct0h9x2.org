Yes.

Further, my brain has converged to approximate this structure in the initial finite case. This means I can wield the power of analogy with complete mastery. I can simply read the mathematical structure of anything if it can be related somehow to English letters. I give the example of the mathematical structure of DNA, GATTACA, in the paper.

It turns out that the sentiment:

"A mathematician is a person who can find analogies between theorems; a better mathematician is one who can see analogies between proofs"

Is a provable truth. And, actually constructing the full proof yourself gives you the power to "directly intuit", in the same way you intuit what you see as "objects" like "chair" or "desk," relations between proofs.

This is the quite literal process of "transcending the infinite series of cardinals." That is, /eventually/, with probability 1, computing the /closure/ of the infinite series of cardinals.
