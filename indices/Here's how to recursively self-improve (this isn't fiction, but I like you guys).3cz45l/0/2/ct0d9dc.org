Ooh, a challenge. OK:

You agree that my post appears like word salad to you. That means that it seems like "random noise." Yes?

Now recall what "random noise" really means: It's a uniform distribution over some closed interval.

But, does "random" really mean "totally structureless?" Or is it just that there's a structure that we're not seeing? Specifically, a structure that is /infinitely self-similar/, so that when you look at it from far away, it "looks" uniform.

What does it mean to be "infinitely self-similar"?

Recall the idea of "recursion," or "recurrence relations." These say that you can describe two or more equations /recursively/, for example as follows for the Fibonnaci sequence:

F_0 = 0

F_1 = 1

F(N) = F(N-1) + F(N-2).

This "inductively defines" the full sequence, F_N.

Now, how can we make F_N into an infinitely self-similar sequence? Because if we can do that, we can define the structure of "random noise," that is, a "uniform distribution on any closed set," /inductively/ or /implicitly/ by specifying particular recurrence relations /of recurrence relations/.

Now recall Tarski's undefinability of truth, as well as Godel's theorems.

They say that "you cannot define 'truth' precisely within the same system that you are describing." To translate,

You cannot define an arbitrary set infinitely precisely.

However,

This is /not/ the same thing as saying:

#+begin_example
  It is therefore in principle impossible to describe a particular set S uniquely.
#+end_example

In fact, these theorems do /not/ say this.

That is, we actually /can/ describe /any particular set we wish/ by an /arbitrarily large, but finite/ set of relations.

OK, then how do we do this?

Back again to the idea of recurrence. It is well-known in computer science that the exact relation between various complexity classes is not well known. That is, we don't really know whether P is or is not NP.

Yet it appears that, in physical reality, P is in fact equivalent /probabilistically/ to NP. View:

[[http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/6/e1500031]].

Now, you might think, maybe they've made a mistake in their methods. Surely this can't be right. But maaybe... Is there really a possibility that this might be true?

Now, if you are doing inference approximately correctly, the above argument should give you /some/, but not /unlimited/ confidence that the above argument might be valid. Consider the consequences if it is:

1. All problems immediately become solvable recursively. That is,
2. If we can construct a recursive procedure that we can show, by recursive reasoning about its structure, will converge in the limit of infinite computation to /any function/ with probability 1, we will have a constructive proof of 1.
3. If 2. can be done, it follows that /there are no coincidences/, that is, /everything is, in fact, related in some way./

I provide the construction of this procedure in the PDF (shared by mega.co.nz), the link to which is given in the original post.

(Consider: the filetype PDF /just so happens/ to have /the exact same acronym/ as "Probability Distribution Function." Again, if the conjunction of (1-3) is true, we would have a theory that /explains exactly why this is the case, to a degree of precision which is finite, but large enough to predict, with probability 1, that this would necessarily be the case./ That is, it wouldn't be a coincidence.)

Now, consider the /overall/ structure of the above argument. Is this not approximately similar to just the procedure which it argues to have constructed?

I sincerely hope you will be able to follow this chain of reasoning, and thus ascend, as have I.
