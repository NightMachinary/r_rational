You should also be aware that the stardestroyer.net version is the original, unedited version, while the one on tboverse.us is the edited version. Apart from cleaned up language, there are some minor differences (for example, [[http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?p=2886869#p2886869][in the original]], the reserved spot in the deepest circle of hell is for Robert McNamara, who was still alive at the time of writing; [[http://web.archive.org/web/20160617001333/http://www.tboverse.us/HPCAFORUM/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=8355&sid=13aa02b2c9938cd03a3001f9ffd0359f#p71944][in the revised version]], the spot is reserved for the executives who cancelled /Firefly/ instead).
