If "why is there no comflict [sic]" actually makes it into the FAQ for your story, you did something wrong.

It's been a very long time since I read the story. I'm pretty sure I slogged through the entire first book, because I remember being bored and annoyed but not wanting to give up. It was a fascinating premise, even if I didn't like the execution. Regardless, perhaps I'm misremembering or forgetting something and the story was far more creative and nuanced than I recall. Still, I couldn't tell you the name of a single character, or describe any of them in more detail than "special forces guy who broke free in Hell because reasons."

The Salvation War was basically the same premise as the Posleen War that John Ringo did as part of his "Legacy of the Aldenata" series: "Alien species shows up and starts trying to kill all the humans. They are physically superior to humans and have superhuman weapons, but no military skill. How do humans survive?" It's been a long time since I read those books, but I can write paragraphs about Cally, Mike, and the other characters.

Say what you will about the intent of The Salvation War, it didn't work. It sounds like the author (you? It's not completely clear to me), had some interesting concepts in mind when they sat down to write, but those concepts didn't make it onto the page. Like I said, I don't remember the books enough to comment...did the viewpoint jump around so that the reader didn't have a chance to bond with any particular character? Was there simply too much focus on the shooty bits and not enough on the off-field stuff? Did everything exist to propel the story, or were there casual bits of relationship-building onscreen as well? Was significant time spent on the social impact of knowing that Hell was real and your family really were being tortured forever?

Whatever it might be, I have yet to meet a person other than yourself who says "Oh, The Salvation War was a brilliant analysis of the human condition, with a supernatural war story as the framing device."
