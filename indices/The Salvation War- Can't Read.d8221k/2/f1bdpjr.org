Is this the story where demons show up on Earth to conquer us and humanity puts them down with trivial ease? If so, I'd recommend skipping it. The premise is fun and the first couple chapters are satisfying in a HFY way, but after that it becomes pure wankery. There's no real challenge anywhere, the demons are never smart, it's just a curbstomp from first to last and therefore pretty dull.
