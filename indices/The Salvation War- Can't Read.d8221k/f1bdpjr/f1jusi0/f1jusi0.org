The second installment is a bit less curbstomp, as Heaven has some actual threats and plotters, but overall they're still on the "stopped paying attention half a millennium ago and isn't bothering to adapt" level of stupidity as the demons were. It's easier to miss, because the focus is on Michael and Uriel. The former is basically a villain protagonist, and the latter is a person of mass destruction who would not be out of place in some comicbooks or action anime.

It also addresses the questions of how the UN (but mostly the US) more or less running the afterlife affects everyday life, and to a lesser extent geopolitics (Rogue nations start rethinking that whole rogue bit). The legal implications are touched upon (how does inheritance work when you empirically /can/ bring whatever's not anchored to the ground with you?).

But, yeah, I wouldn't say bringing up these things is the same as writing Rational Fiction. It's mostly Military Porn and Fanservice (a Samurai and one of the 300 teaming up to kick demon ass? Hellish Legions and flocks of angels cut down like so much chaff? Jabs at the Westborough Baptist Church and Rush Limbaugh? That Mythbusters sketch?).
