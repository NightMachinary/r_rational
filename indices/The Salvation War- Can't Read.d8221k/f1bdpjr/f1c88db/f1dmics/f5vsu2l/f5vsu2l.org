There's some 'fun' where Memnon slaughters groups of humans wholesale, earlier on. Before the Tinfoil Hats are spread to the soldiers, the demons can still become invisible, make the soldiers see their comrades as demons, or just turn their world into blankness with bits of illusion.Most don't bother, because they're used to being invincible, but they learn fast. If it wasn't for the children (demon kids 'cyberbully' people into insanity), the demons might have won the war. The people in tanks and planes were fine, but soldiers would have died in droves.

Also, they do have powers beyond mortal imagination... as given in the Bible. They shoot ball lightning from tridents... but it doesn't work on tanks with hardening ('iron chariots' made God Himself flee in the Bible). Tinfoil hats protect from complete possession, portal-homing on nephilim, and disguises. An angel survives a tank-killing canister blast, and is finished by machine guns... but the angel had demonstrated telekinetic abilities. If he hadn't been taken by surprise, he might have killed that group. This was early in the first book, and is an example of why, when Heaven was finally open, humans immediately launched the nuclear bombs.

Overall, the demons/angels are much much stronger than humans, even with guns. It's artillery and tanks that they don't have answers to, and they might have won in a massive guerilla war if they hadn't used the basic strategy of 'attack,' with heralds and a massive portal. Because they remained true to the source material, however, they ended up with a united, aware foe. With the really religious people obeying the order to kill themselves, they faced humanity as a whole, with technological adaptability they couldn't match.

"Why is there no dramatic tension. There is a complete lack of comflict. From the beginning, it was readily apparent that the demons were going to be smashed to a pulp. It's sort of akin to writing a story about a man clubbing a seal pup to death.?

This whole "no conflict" complaint doesn't hold water on close examination. The conflict's there, it just isn't the obvious one. I think the objection to "lack of conflict" is based on people's expectation that the daemons are super-beings when any reasonable examination of the circumstances shows they are not. Simple question, how does a bronze-age army beat a modern mechanized army? Simple answer, they can't. In a straight firefight, its all over as soon as it starts. There is also a presumption that "superpowers = invincibility", that is that the possession of abnormal powers renders the bearer all-powerful compared with regular humans. In the Salvation War, its shown the the */military/* significance of powers like throwing lightning bolts, being able to breath fire or fly is inconsequential.

The real conflict is between the ways people think; those who take things at face value and those who do not. Those who accept that something is and those who ask why? The book is full of conflict on many, many levels other than the obvious one. The investigation of the daemon's abilities is another version of conflict, it demonstrates that the humans don't throw up their arms and cry "magic" the way the daemons do when faced with something they don't understand, they watch, study and investigate, find clues and form theories that get progressively more accurate until the problem is solved. The whole story is about much more important things that who wins a battle.

The Salvation War is predictable only in the sense that the end is reasonably obvious as it is in most fiction. We know Sherlock Holmes will solve the mystery, we know that the cops in a TV show will catch the bad guy eventually. In fact in a good half of TV cop shows, the villain is revealed in the first five minutes; it's how he gets caught that's the real story. We know humans will win in Armageddon; given the circumstances they can hardly help but do so. The story is actually about the people who take part, just as it is in every story. Why invest in such a story? Why make Tora Tora Tora, the film about the attack on Pearl Harbor - do you seriously believe that people go to see that film not knowing that the US Fleet is about to get sunk? Or go to see "Midway" and not know the Japanese carriers are going to get sunk? Of course not, people got to see a story that is centered around the people who take part, just as The Salvation War is centered around the people who take part. The story is centered on the people who deal with that, how they cope with the knowledge that (on one side) there's a whole new field of science opening up and (on the other) that everything they believed about what and how they worked is false.

"how did this story get started"

The question came up on SDN, what would happen if irrefutable proof came up that the whole human race was condemned to hell and always had been. That hope of salvation was a myth? The general consensus was tha humanity would fight, if for no other reason than its better to go down fighting than just lay down and die. Also, if they can interact with us, we must be able to interact with them - all we need to do is find out how. At that point, reading the thread, I got interested and started to think on how we would fight back (I'm a professional military analyst). Reading up on how daemons were supposed to fight and what they had to fight with, it resolved into "we can do that" , "we can do that", "they can't do that", "they wouldn't even understand how we did that". It quickly became apparent that daemons as described in the appropriate mythology don't stand a hope in hell against us. The phrase "hope in hell" set a light off in my head and so The Salvation War started. It caught on.

The thing to think about here is this. Virtually all our military advances have taken placed in the last few years. Taking a human lifetime as the traditional three score years and ten, one human lifetime takes us back to 1939. At that time battleships still ruled the sea, the best fighters were 300mph aircraft armed with machine guns. Armies were still virtually all infantry that walked around armed with bolt-action rifles. Armored warfare and so on were untried concepts. At best, they could fight the daemon hordes on roughly even terms. Go back another human lifetime and we're in 1870. No aircraft, wooden warships powered by sails (if the crew are lucky, with steam assistance) and armed with smoothbore muzzle-loading cannon form the bulk of the world's navies. Most armies have muzzle-loading muskets and smooth-bore direct line-of-sight artillery. The Daemons will walk all over them. Back when the mythologies were written, those authoring them gave the daemons the most frightful weapons they could imagine. To us, now, those weapons are jokes, pathetic and feeble things that we can virtually ignore while we slaughter those who carry them with almost impunity. And we've gone from there to here in two human lifetimes. What will humanity's weaponry look like in another two lifetimes? The very thought should be terrifying.

Nearly all of Armageddon??? is about the people involved and how they adapt to what is happening around/to them. Even the scenes set in battle are focussed on the people and the weapons are described only in terms of what they do to people. The daemons are the most affected, primarily because they are the ones faced with the unimaginable. As humans, we don't need to imagine what salvo rocket launchers, nerve gas, high explosives, landmines, rifle bullets etc do to their victims because we know. We do it to each other all the time. To somebody with a bronze age mindset, its horrible and unimaginable. Something completely unknown and beyond any form of understanding. Most of Armageddon is about the Daemons coming to grips with that and what it means. The humans end the story much as they started, just sickened by the slaughter they're inflicting yet grimly determined to keep on inflicting it until their enemy (no longer Daemons) gives up. The daemons change incredibly, read how Memnon enters the story and how he leaves it. He's gone through an epiphany and he's done a heelfaceturn. Once a creature of horrific evil, he's seen where that leads and is seeking a different path - as is the whole of Hell itself.

The fighting sections of the book (actually about a third of the total) do two things, one is to provide the impetus for the character development, the other is to tell people what weapons do to their victims. Amateurs are all too free with their recommendations to use weapons (eg "Stop illegal immigration by setting minefields along the border") without understanding what those weapons do. So, I tried to make it clear that weapon effects aren't nice neat little clean departures but a hideously brutal and cataclysmic way to die. There is a very good reason why most people on a battlefield die screaming. People say 'war is hell", Armageddon makes it clear its far worse than that. The way humans kill their enemies fills daemons with terror, that's worth thinking about as well.
