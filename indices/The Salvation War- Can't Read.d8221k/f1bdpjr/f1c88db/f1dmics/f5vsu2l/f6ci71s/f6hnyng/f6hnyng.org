Not what I said, and no, I'm not the author.

I've been a bit bored, and then I went and actually reread the Salvation War. I thought I'd provide a few examples of what I was talking about.

Overall, TSW is like Sword Art Online. The 'heroes' are overpowered, the plot can be simplistic. But there's something there that's worth seeing. In SAO, it's the basic idea that's explored (not much beyond that, sadly.)

In TSW, Michael is genuinely interesting to watch, and it was nice to see the author work to accurately describe weapon effects to people who want to see them because they're 'cool.' Honestly, though, I'll admit that the human perspective is boring. It's why I keep rooting for the demons, honestly.

Anyway. Sorry for dragging this out. I'm trying to get myself to continue a story I started writing, and I keep poking at things in the hope I'll get my muse back. So far, nada, so...

Yeah.
