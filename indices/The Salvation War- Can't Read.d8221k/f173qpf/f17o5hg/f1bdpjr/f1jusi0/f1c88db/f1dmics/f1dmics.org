Well, it's been a long time since I read it and maybe it wasn't complete when I was reading. I'll take your word for it that there's more to it than I recall, but personally I remember the demons being thick as bricks and going down like straw dummies when hit with human weapons, instead of having the sort of durability that one would expect of supernatural creatures. Then there's the part about the (I think I have this right) American special forces soldier who escapes his imprisonment because reasons, defeats the demons in the immediate area, frees all the other soldiers in the area, and organizes a resistance in Hell. Am I remembering that right? If so, it really felt like the author saying "Let the awesome commence!" without worrying to much about whether or not it made a smidgen of sense. (For the record, underequipped special forces resistance fighters in Hell /is/ awesome, and I would have really enjoyed it if it hadn't shattered my SOD so thoroughly right at the beginning.)
