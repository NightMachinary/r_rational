Part of the fun of the story is actually rooting for the underdogs... which means the demons and angels. The legions of hell have 40 million demons (compared to the one or two million in WW1&2 armies), all of whom are immune to small arms fire (while redefining "small arms"). But they're using medieval tactics against humans using artillery and missiles. Watching them drop "kill the messenger" habits like a hot skillet and reaching for "spread out, find cover, and close when possible with the squishy humans" is actually awesome to see. Michael's plans are also interesting.

Yes, the antagonists are the 'rational' ones, in that we watch them work through the problems and find the intelligent solutions. Humans have the advantage of having /already done so-/ which is why Belial getting away constantly is so terrifying. Having the answers and rallying these superhuman beings - just after the economy is pushed to collapse- is a terrifying premise for book 3 humanity to deal with. A shame it will never be written.

​

And so, an example of adaptation:

Abigor thought the information over. He had to change plans, his original was an open invitation to a massacre by the human mages. His mind mulled the information over. His original front was over a mile long with the ranks extending almost two miles backwards. If he lined his legions up in single row, they would form a front almost five miles long. His mind chewed away, the human magic slaughtered by area, why stop at lining up his legions side by side. There was no need for the legions to maintain their block, 81 ranks deep. Suppose each Legion formed three blocks 27 ranks deep? And those blocks were lines side by side? Why, that meant a front approaching 15 miles wide! Abigor stared at his map, with a front like that, he could extend beyond the range of the human mages and their magic, envelop their flanks and roll them up. It was brilliant. It was also, of course against every concept of demonic warfare. Battles were decided by massive blows aimed at the center of the enemy force, the two masses colliding and slugging it out. This idea of thinning his lines and enveloping the enemy was, wrong somehow. Yet the humans were wrong, they didn't fight like warriors, they lacked the spirit to close in to hand-to-hand combat range. That hadn't always been the case, there had been examples in the past when humans fought demons hand-to hand. They'd always lost of course.

He wrote the new orders down on parchment and then added another thought. The enemy mages had to be on that ridgeline. If they could be prevented from casting their spells, that would be a major part of the enemy's defense gone. So he added another line, ordering all the infantry to keep firing their tridents as rapidly as they could recharge them. It didn't matter if they hit anything, just to keep that ridge crest under continuous fire. Then, he turned his attention back to the flier still cowering in a corner.

Abigor stared at the frozen image of the burning city. For a while he was completely certain that the humans would defeat Satan, but now he was not so sure. Old traditions were being discarded, the once unthinkable was being considered. The humans had given hell an object lesson in how efficiently war could be conducted when one made decisions purely on the basis of effectiveness, not honor, politics, auspiciousness or tradition. How fast could hell learn?
