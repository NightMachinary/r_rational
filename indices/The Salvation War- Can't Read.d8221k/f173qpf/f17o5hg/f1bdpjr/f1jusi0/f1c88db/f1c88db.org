I disagree and agree- it's not the /best/ story out there.

​

But the demons make smart decisions, and B2 has Michael showing us how a relatively amoral being saves his people from an unstoppable horde in another dimension- appeal to their morality. It also ends with the top brass grimly accepting a simple problem: Human society is so geared towards the War that, now that it's over, it's about to collapse. And the demon lord who escaped, Belial, has learned how to fight humans. He's /waiting/ for them to collapse, and building up his forces in the meantime.

​

And there's more pantheons out there. And Uriel kills millions, /permanently./ And I'm /still/ missing things. Humanity was simply handed a huge stick, and the author explored this premise- working off of it to the last detail, including the /effects/ of our favorite weapons. We aren't portrayed as full-on Mary Sues. We make mistakes, commit atrocities, and are still set-up to fail. It's certainly not a complete masterpiece, but the story is worth reading - especially if you're recovering from a Wildbow work, like /Worm./

Quote: Humans lose two major cities with virtually everybody in them. Forced to fight under circumstances where they can't use artillery, they get chewed up. The Russian defenses at the Phlegethon are breached despite the fact that they used everything short of a nuke and were only saved by a mass tank counterattack. In the second book, humans are taking a hammering and are unable to do much about it other than fend off the blows, since the angels watched the demons get curbstomped and take precautions to prevent Heaven's breaching, attacking indirectly through HURRICANES. Also, Uriel killing millions.
