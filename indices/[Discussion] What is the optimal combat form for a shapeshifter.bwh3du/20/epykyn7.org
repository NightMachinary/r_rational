Inspired by [[/u/veedrac][u/veedrac]] my default form would be a worldspanning underground fungus network. I would create vira which would be dormant until I activated it (pheromonea or radiosignal or whatnot) and when activated would cause someone to pass out for some time. By having the vira be asymptotic I would easily be able to spread it to the entire world without ressistance.

I would somehow navigate myself into being in charge of waste removal such that I have the biomass I need. I would create bodies that were remotely controlled for doing stuff above ground. And I don't think that either of those are outside the bounds of known physics and possible biology.

Sidegoals include making organisms to gather plastic in oceans, extracting gasses from the atmosphere, as well as generating money to fond all scientific research projects.

Now for your situation I would probably need to have a default all purpose form. Here's a few things that would definitely be in that form.

1.  A set of redundant organs. It's a huge vulnerability that if you die if someone gets a good shot into your face or your heart. I think that three redundant vital organs would take up too much space so let's go with two of all short term vital organs.
2.  Have non-human senses. Snakes can see infrared. Dogs can smell gunpowder. Bats have echolocation. Hearing is debatable since gunfire is really loud and might be overwhelming. Have eyes that faces in all directions. All of those takes relatively little mass and there's no good reason for you to include those.
3.  Make sure that even a touch on your opponent will incapacitate them. Have nails on your appendages that can deliver poison.
4.  Muscles would be made out of an [[https://phys.org/news/2018-04-strong-carbon-fiber-artificial-muscles.html][artificial and very strong carbon structure]].
5.  The default unit would have scales similar to a pangolin however the scales would be made by another artificial carbon alloy which I have misplaced somewhere.
6.  I imagine that most relevant fighting would happen inside cities and for that reason the default unit would prioritize speed and melee combat over ranged options.
7.  It's difficult to know what combat forms are the most effective since we can't really test it. However I imagine that something that have multiple strong tentacles that 1) can excrete poison 2) are strong/hard enough to penetrate regular building 3) have manually controlled hooks such they can be used to climb and throw people. Effortlessly crawling on buildings and x18 strong muscles for jumping is basically flight for most practical purposes.
8.  Skunks can spray chemicals into the air. Change that into some kind of black visible dust that blocked vision and the extra senses really pay off. Other chemical mixes might knock unconcious. Sure, the latter can be easily countered by having an external air supply but at that point you are putting more effort onto your enemies for relatively little cost.
9.  A few kinds of animals create there own light. You can basically replicate a flashbang if you roar loud enough and create a bright enough light.
10. Cheetah can run up to 61 miles/hour and by having that form as a base you could basically outrun cars in streets using tentacles to navigate corners.
11. You want a symbiotic lifeform inside of you that fixes wounds and restores organs. Or just a strong boost to whatever the body is already doing. Ideally severed appendages can be picked up and reattached to preserve biomass.
12. They would have to appear non-threatning or at least non-gross in order to maintain public relationships. If you're a giant omnipotent underground fungus you really want to be able to negotiate with people and having nightmarish creatures running around makes that really difficult. Default personality unless controlled would probably be close to that of [[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/truth-about-dogs/][some social parasite]].
