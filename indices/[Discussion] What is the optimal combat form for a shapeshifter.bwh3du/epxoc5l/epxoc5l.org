You specified that the shapeshifting would be limited to "known biology", so I'm guessing that T-1000 style tactics are unavailable. How fast and how often can the subject change shapes? You mentioned being able to go without certain organ systems for a few minutes, so at least that often. Can the subject shapeshift into an un-injured version of itself for a source of rapid regeneration? Obviously, lost biomass wouldn't be reclaimed, but it'd be nice to be able to shapeshift any open wounds closed again.

"Known biology" suggests that starting your own colony of xenomorphs is out of the question. Does the subject need to keep a vaguely-human brain somewhere in its body for making the thinky-thinks? Is it limited to a single contiguous body, or can it become a cloud of ebola? If the shifter suddenly decides it needs a 50kg bioluminescent appendage, will it be limited by the amount of phosphorous currently in its body, or does it always have the right types of material available for the form it wants to assume?

--------------

I suppose I should actually address the question asked. It depends on the circumstances of the combat. The first scene that comes to mind is that the shifter is being hunted by the FBI and whatever occult monster hunters are aware of it. In that case, the best option would seem to be to not fight at all. If it's fast enough, can traverse any terrain or even fly above it, it can dictate when and where a fight occurs, or even whether a fight occurs in the first place. Bonus points if it has a hand to flip them the middle finger as it goes.

(Making some assumptions about the questions I asked above...)

If lethal combat seems to be inevitable, or the shifter has to defend a target or something, then the brain needs to be protected first and foremost. There are a lot of "truisms" about biology, like "the whole body is just a life support system for the brain", or "the whole body (brain included) is just a life support system for the genitals". Hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys... destroying any of those will lead to death, but mainly because of their effect on the brain. So long as the shifter is conscious and can think, replacement organs can be shifted into being. So the brain needs the best armor biology can buy, and a bladder or reservoir of oxygenated blood that can keep the brain going for long enough to regenerate the rest of the body in the event it all goes south. Backup brains, if possible. That goes for EVERY combat form.

As for the rest... if you're looking for an all-purpose form to be used when the shifter is about to kick in a door and has no idea what's on the other side... well. The best thing to do is /find out what's on the other side/. If, as your post suggests, the shifter takes "a few minutes" to slide from one form to another, then maxing out defense and speed seems the way to go. Once the shifter knows what it's up against, it can shift to match the challenge. If it's not a situation that can be handled, retreat. And survive long enough to make that determination.

EDIT: The reason why I hesitate to give a single answer for a combat form is that you specifically list humans as possible opponents. Humans learn. Whatever form you used last time will be countered next time. If I were facing a shapeshifter and had evidence that it was restricted to biology, I'd reach for the napalm and the liquid CO2. Extreme temperatures kinda trump everything biological.
