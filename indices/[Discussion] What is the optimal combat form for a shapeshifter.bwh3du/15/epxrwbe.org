This reminds me a lot of a certain character in Ward. Without any big spoilers, his power is very similar to what the OP described where he can change into a form before a fight but not during.

The situation OP described, however, pretty much never happens since you almost always have at least some idea of what you're facing down. If you're ambushing someone, you might want something that can act fast and get the job done quickly like a pouncing animal. If you're looking out for an attack, you might want to have something with enhanced senses that can either hold its ground or retreat easily. If you anticipate several enemies, you might want a form that can rain down biological artillery. If you have allies, you might want to adopt a form that can facilitate quick transportation.

I'd wager that a scenario where you literally have zero knowledge of your circumstances and whoever you'll be facing down warrants a form that can get the hell out of there asap. Maybe something like a cheetah that can glide or an insect size flyer so you can gather information and then run to a safer spot to change to a more appropriate form.
