I actually tried tackling a similar problem in my story recently ("The Optimised Wish Project", mild spoilers ahead), and I came up with similar ideas. Mind you that in that case there were the additional limits of cognitive abilities (the user needed to be able to visualise to some degree of precision the form they were turning into) and total power output (the user could not turn into a form /physically stronger/ than his base). My solution involved different forms, but mostly stuff with tentacles, nanometre-sharp blades, and the deadliest assortment of neurotoxins that biological cells could synthesise.
