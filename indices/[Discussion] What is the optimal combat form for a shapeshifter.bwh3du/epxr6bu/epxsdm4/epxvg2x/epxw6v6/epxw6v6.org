I don't quite get your logic.

​

Near the end of your post, you say that humanity got smart because we largely suck at fighting unless we bring our creativity to bear.

​

So, if you're expecting a brawl, why wouldn't you choose the form of something that /is/ suited to fighting, /plus/ superhuman intelligence?

​

Human bodies are best at using tools. Since the scenario doesn't put any tools at hand, why would you keep the form of a human for the battle to come, as opposed to one with built-in weapons?
