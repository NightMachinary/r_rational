Because I didn't read closely enough to see that tools weren't available (in fact what I did read [Oxygen Tanks, etcetera] implied they were).

Also, if you can adopt a form that has biologically produced weapons & armor, there is really no reason those weapons & armor can't be formed to take advantage of technological know-how.

E.G.: Electric Eel cells could be used to power a railgun/coilgun (sorry, I can't remember the generic name, 'cos I'm pretty sure "Gauss" is just for coil based weapons, & "Tesla" while evocative is also just plain wrong), whilst the metallic components could be produced by cells/organs crafted for the job.

Alternately, smokeless gunpowders (or even black powder) are all largely organic in nature to start with, & a dense bone structure could be used to form both the barrel(s) & the projectiles.

Further down the list are muscle-powered weapons (bow, crossbows, atlatls, etc...) all of which could also be constructed of bone (not to mention that *wood* is also completely organic, & wouldn't even require cells/organs to convert surrounding materials).

Now, I will admit that shapeshifting into a form that could produce nuclear or even plain radiological weapons would be difficult (at least if you were limited to what could be achieved by an organic form, since the materials you would need tend to be highly toxic even aside from their radioactivity), but there are still many, many, options I'm not smart enough to have thought of (not being super-intelligent myself).

Honestly I believe that the smarter you are, the further away from your vulnerabilities you would want to keep any conflict you were involved with.

N.B.: Other reasons to adopt a human form are camouflage & deception, as a humanoid you can more readily hide amongst humans, & if your foe thinks you're a human they will attack with methods they expect to work against a human.
