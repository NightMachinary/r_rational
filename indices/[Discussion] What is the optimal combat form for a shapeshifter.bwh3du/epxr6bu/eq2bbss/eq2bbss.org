No, I don't see this working. Humans may currently be the optimum but that's:

- as a function of their social structure, not in 1 vs 1 combat, though we DO have some strengths there too, and

- as a function of evolutionary constraints, which only allow continuous mutations from previous forms.

We still have jelly-like eyes because these evolved from fish, for example. They're not the ideal form for cameras to use in air. But we couldn't go from "water eyes" to "air eyes" without going through some stage with eyes that are non-functional or significantly worse, and that closed that road, because any such mutations would be immediately curbed. A shapeshifter does not have those limitations. It does not have the limitations imposed by the need to /grow/ into its final shape either - everything you are has to be possible to make from a single blastula reproducing and growing, the shapeshifter doesn't have that problem. There's a bunch of constraints the shapeshifter can just handwave away, producing forms that make zero evolutionary sense but are ideal as bioweapons.
