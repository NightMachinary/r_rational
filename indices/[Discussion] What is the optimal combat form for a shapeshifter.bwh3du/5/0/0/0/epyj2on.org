You don't have to be passive. If your 'brain' is a giant subterranean fungi net you could sproud giant tentacle appendages from the ground or whatnot.

Also flying is really inefficient for a big and heavy creature. For just a regular 200 lps human you'd need a 800 square feet wingspan to have anything going for you.
