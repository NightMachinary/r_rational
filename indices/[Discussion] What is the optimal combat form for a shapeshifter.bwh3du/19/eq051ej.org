I would go for a form that is close or has partially developed features of other forms to allow for faster transformations between a few different forms. From here, I would probably start with the tankiest form which can quickly be shed for progressively more mobile and less offensive form. For the tank form, I think I'd go for something with as many limbs that can be used concurrently as possible, and dedicate those limbs to projectiles. If the enemy gets close I'd shed that layer, maybe using the remains of its biomass for some sort of bombardier-beetle-like explosion. The next form would probably just be something highly mobile, like an armored jumping spider with webbing between its legs for gliding, throw some poisoned, launchable quills on there too. Depending on how the fights looking at this point, I'd either finish off the enemy or retreat.

I'd also experiment with making sub-intelligences, those either being literal clones in other forms, or weapons with enough neurons to do things. Assuming the latter since the former requires more biomass than I think is allowed for this challenge, on the simplest end I was thinking smart-arrows with eyes and the ability to shift the orientation of it's "tail feathers" or wings to create a homing effect. If these little smart weapons can use the shapeshifter ability as well, projectile quills that suck the victim's blood to use as biomass for growth into their body. Alternatively, something like a drone or drones that transmits information back to you.
