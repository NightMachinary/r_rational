  Seems like everyone here thinks combat form means “escape form”. This question was intended for offensive ability, and defense as a means to the end of more effective offense. What possible creature could have the broadest possible engagement profile?

To be fair, you really didn't make that clear. In most cases, unless you have a really good reason not to do so, a shapeshifter is going to want to run from an unknown threat the first time they face it, so that they can assess it and come back with a more tailored form. And, shapeshifter or not, you'd certainly never want to attack something/someone on their own turf without reconnoitering first.
