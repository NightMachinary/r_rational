Here's some desirable traits, we can derive the form from there.

1) Siege capability - We want to be able to act as some combination of battering ram (nearby targets, destroying walls to chase enemy) and trebuchet/ballista (for distance, flying dragons, anti-aircraft), and harpoon (for killing very large animals)

2) Ballistics - As good as a crossbow, or at least sling. Harpooning ability would also be good, if we're expecting to fight dragons, sea monsters, or the like.

3) Hand-to-hand - We must kill any quick and agile foe that comes too near before it can harm us.

4) Grappling and crushing - We want to be able to grab and irresistibly crunch down on any heavily armored foe. (can possibly re-purpose the muscles involved in the battering ram)

5) Fast and agile - it's important to be able to chase down fleeing foes that can't be hit by ranged weapons.

6) Armored - not being easily wounded would be good.

7) Energetic - You need to get oxygen extremely efficiently, and store lots of fuel to power all this movement.

8) anti-fragile, decentralized, redundant, modular - You don't want there to be anywhere you can be hit that actually kills you. Ideally if you get cut in two, not only do you not due, but both halves continue fighting. (But if this possible it introduces a lot of other options)

9) amphibious / flying - you want to be able to function in as many terrains as possible. If you can't fly, it helps to be able to jump very high. . You might be able to double any long-spear-like parts with vaulting or stilt walking, which would be good (and would also up your speed).

What might this body look like? well, to start...If we could get really /strong and dexterous/ octopus arms, then we could probably just do that and add a few extra gigantic muscles to the central body to handle siege and crushing.

However, I'm not entirely sure that prehensile limbs don't have some sort of engineering limitations that prevent us from creating a creature of cartwheeling bladed tentacles. In nature we have snakes, octopus limbs, prehensile tails, etc. Snakes are very fast and strong, while prehensile tails are sort of load bearing. A tail of a kangaroo can support it's own weight. A dinosaur's tail can be used as a weapon but it's not very dexterous. Can all these properties be combined into a single limb? I suspect they might already have been, in nature, if that was possible - there's certainly enough limbs to go about evolving it from.

What I'm saying is, we might ultimately want real legs of some sort specialized for running, though that doesn't mean there shouldn't be /at least/ one long, bladed or harpoon tipped sort of thing which can do snake-like strikes on anything that gets close, and that might involve a tentacle or two.
