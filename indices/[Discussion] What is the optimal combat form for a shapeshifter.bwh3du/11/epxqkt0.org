If the range of threats spans "swat team" through "dragon" in diversity, and there's no restriction on forms other than it has to be within physics (not sure what the bounds of "known biology" are supposed to be), and the goal is to kill all opponents while keeping some form of mind alive, I'd say the optimal form is "nuclear explosion", perhaps with a side of biological and chemical agents for good measure.

(plus components where you house the rest of yourself, that survive it)

It might be possible to take on even more exotic forms, such as a small black hole (although you might end up evaporating instantly, so you might want to house your mind outside it and its range)
