Well obviously I hadn't considered the various Trans- & Post-Human forms others suggested, but assuming they weren't viable options my proposal remains largely the same.

You'd still go for an athletic (for muscle mass, reflexes, general fitness, & general health, thus offsetting many of the basic weaknesses) human form, but with some effort made to improve intellectual capabilities (insofar as you understand the physical mechanics of them) such as speed of thought, general creativity, intuition, mathematical talent, & logical thought.

By making yourself "smarter" (though the "speed of thought" element is arguably even more important, since it allows you to simulate greater capabilities in other areas just by having, effectively, "more time to think") you enable yourself to make better use of the other assets available to you, to identify & address (or use) weaknesses (address your own, use your opponent's).

The next biggest advantage would be any improvements you could manage to "creativity", since it doesn't matter how much you think if you only think the same things (or within the same contraints [aka "box"]), but this is also where "logic" & "intuition" come into play, "logic" would be the primary tool for ensuring that your creative ideas were plausible or at least practical, whilst "intuition" is an adjunct to "speed of thought" *and* "creativity" in that it allows you to make connections & reach conclusions your logical mind wouldn't have sufficient information for (every "intuitive leap" is a period of thought you've skipped).

Now I'm not going to say that Intelligence always wins, but to paraphrase Karl Schroeder in /Permanence/, Mankind evolved for greater Intelligence because we weren't sufficiently capable of surviving with any of the other tools biology had given us (e.g. Lions aren't smarter than us [yet] because they were strong enough & fast enough that their species was able to reproduce faster than it died off, & thus didn't need to develop the smarts to use their strengths better).
