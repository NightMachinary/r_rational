The optimum form would be "Athletic Human", assuming that the one couldn't improve one's intelligence with alterations to the brain.

The reason I say this is because of Humanity's weaknesses in combat/survival, not in spite of them.

Think about it, in our current (RL) world *we* are */the/* /Apex Predators/, because we've learned to build tools to compensate for almost all our weaknesses, tools which work best when used by something shaped anthropomorphically.

On top of that, we're actually disturbingly resilient, anything which doesn't kill us straight away has a fairly good chance of not managing it all, & if it does manage to kill us later, it's usually by weakening us to the things we're already weakest against (disease/infection, & toxins/poison).
