Assuming you won't use weapons, don't have access to super biology, and cap out around 1000lbs. I am thinking a quadruped with horns, fangs and extra eyes. Basically a horned tiger with better armor. If you can make it work, a redundant brain and the ability to hold its breath for minutes at a time like a hippo.

​

Tigers can hit 40mph in short bursts. Humans aren't going to do shit against a tiger that is armored against small arms fire. No earth biology can compare with an RPG in attack power. Horns, claws and jaws are time tested weapons.
