Okay, so presumably a better option should be able to eat your octopus wheel alive. Ideally, it should be a no-contest type of scenario, while also being far more effective against each of the threats you listed.

Let's start with flying. An airborne assailant with hummingbird-like wings is immediately immune to any melee attacks by your critter or by a giant. It'll use /a lot/ of energy to fly, but that's fine, combat shouldn't last longer than a few minutes anyway. The real challenges would be heat dissipation and cardiopulmonary capacity. For heat dissipation, it could use large, featherless, highly vascular wings. For cardiopulmonary capacity, it could use a modified avian respiratory tract with a blow-through system, so air gets pulled in at the front and goes out through a back exhaust point shaped somewhat like a de Laval nozzle. With a sphincter at the exhaust point, we could constrict the outflow and get higher pressures within the respiratory tract for improved gas exchange, but releasing the sphincter would also be an easy way to shoot out a decent volume of high-pressure air to get a quick burst of speed. For the heart, we could use a paired-heart configuration which beats alternately to maintain continuous (almost non-pulsatile) flow. It would also be reasonable to also have elevated levels of 2,3-BPG to improve usage of the supplied oxygen.

To keep mass low, it would be better to ignore hips, legs and a digestive tract. A head and torso will obviously still be needed, and arms and hands are probably good to keep as well.

One advantage of keeping arms and hands is that if you're carrying a decent weapon like a gun or magical sword, you don't need to drop it. Further, with a gun, your octopus and the giant are both screwed, while the SWAT team and dragon would have their work cut out for them. Hands would also be useful for simple tasks that your octopus would struggle to do, like turn a doorknob. They could also be used for simply picking up rocks and dropping them on targets from high altitude.

For attacks, the best option is probably poison. You could conceivably form about a dozen sacs on your arms, similar to the fruits of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hura_crepitans][dynamite tree]], except high pressure hardened sacs that will burst on impact and fling about two dozen small 4 mL spiked high-pressure capsules outward at speeds of up to 160 mph out to ranges of up to 150 ft. The capsules create a secondary detonation on impact, releasing a spray of aerosolized botulinum toxin. Yank a sac off of your arm, throw it at the target, and then jet away. That should handle giants, SWAT teams, and octopus wheels with terrifying effectiveness. Against dragons, you'd have to just wait until they open their mouth and then fling it in and hope you can dart out of the way fast enough. You'd at least have better odds than the poor octopus wheel.
