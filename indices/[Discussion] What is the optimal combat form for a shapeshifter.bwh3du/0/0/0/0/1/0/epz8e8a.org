Spoiler alert, because the gentleman I'm responding to is incorrect and I'm going to provide evidence.

  Jf you expect to be fighting a bug master in advance, hard-countering that entire stichk is not difficult, and it happened to her, what once? People showing up in bug-proof armor with "All insects die" weapons should have been a constant problem from about a third of the way through.

Please keep in mind that in-universe Tinker Tech required Tinker maintenance, and was therefore limited. So capes relied on their own unique counters instead. But hard-countering bugs? It happened plenty, and every mid-to-late story Tinker fight I remember had a bug counter.

1. Gestation 1.4, (Ch. 4 / 313) 1%, Lung uses fire. This was an available, not a pre-planned counter.

2. Agitation 3.11, (Ch. 28 / 313) 9%, Amy Dallon aka Panacea inhibits Taylor's control of her bugs. Available, but not pre-planned.

3. Tangle 6.6, (Ch. 60 / 313) 19%, Armsmaster's spear, Skitter has to block its electrical effect with her body to prevent it from nuking her hornets. Pre-planned.

And then later in the story (no particular order) we have Coil's Bug Agitating Machine which usurps Taylor's control, Kid Win's Bug Zapping Drones, Dragon's Anti-Bug Steam during the Warden HQ invasion where Bitch ditches Taylor, Bonesaw's insecticides, Mannequin's explosive gas during his second(?) attack this time against Grue after Taylor painted him during the first round, other Armsmaster / Dragon altercations, and Contessa's fire extinguisher deserves an honorable mention.

That's not getting into incidental counters where bug powers just suck, like the Leviathan or Behemoth fights.

That said...

Of course Taylor could have munchkin'ed more, of course she should have lost a lot of those fights, of course there were a lot of villains that were just idiotic and should have at least carried a can of RAID with them but didn't.

But it's a story, and the author put in a solid effort in this regard.
