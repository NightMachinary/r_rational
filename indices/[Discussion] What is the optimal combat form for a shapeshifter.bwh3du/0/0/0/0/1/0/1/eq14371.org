From what I understand about insecticides, they are not instant kills. The spray initially deters insects, and then the chemicals slowly shut down the insects nervous system. Using bug spray against Taylor would reduce her strength after the fight (although she will probably be able to muster up as many bugs as she needs), but do little in the middle of combat.
