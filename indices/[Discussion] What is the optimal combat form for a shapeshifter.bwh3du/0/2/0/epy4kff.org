So are large objects? There's no real defense against heat besides "ditch mass". Like 40% of the reason why large combat forms won't work at all is because they'll be prone to overheating if they exert themselves (the other 60% is the inverse square law).

That being said I'd argue that a swarm is going to have a much easier time dealing with heat attacks than anything besides a purpose-built fire-fighting form, and the goal of this question was to come up with the most generally applicable shape for the shapeshifter.
