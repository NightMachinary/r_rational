Green goo. Explode into microscopic spores designed to be incredibly durable and attach to / float everywhere. The spores in turn grow into copies of you, given sufficient local resources.

Drown the planet. Whatever you were trying to fight in the first place is either dead or expending significant resources holding out against you with no supply lines or backup, and you now have an intelligent shapeshifting biomass the size of continents, wriggled into every crevice of the planet and able to survive a total surface nuking.
