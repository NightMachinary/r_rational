  It feels that you are confusing biology and evolution. All of the proposals in this post have been using 'agentful' mixing and matching.

â€˜Mix n' match' isn't biology, it's shapeshifter magic. I'm fine with your combinations being unbiological, they just need to be constituted from biological parts.

  I'm failing to see the problem. The idea is to have multiple tentacles that can do quick jerky movements and are strong enough to pull.

The problem is that it's suboptimal. A jointed, bony structure is going to be many times more powerful, and correspondingly faster.

  In terms of practicality you have to be a piss poor shapechanger if you can't think of a way to get rid of fungi. You can literally change part of yourself into fungi eating bacteria.
#+end_quote

You're skipping steps again. Fungi eating bacteria already exist, but fungi aren't all dead. Though, again, you're assuming liberal things about the prompt that are better left as hypotheses. There's a reason my own response to this prompt was an amalgam of questions.
