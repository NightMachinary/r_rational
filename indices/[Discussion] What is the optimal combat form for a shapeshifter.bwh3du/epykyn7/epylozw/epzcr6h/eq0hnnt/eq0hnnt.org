  I don't know what definition of biology you are working under. I see no reasons to why our biological creature would use suboptimal muscle structures when better exists.
#+end_quote

Biology isn't agentful, it uses what it has, invariably, because it's dumb like that. A major limitation is that biological processes are limited in temperatures, energy production, and energy density, and all seem to need to be incremental with local structured growth. It's hard to reason about what is possible â€˜in principle', but sticking to materials actually produced by existing biological systems seems sane.

  My post adresses how to increase tentacle strength. Though I suppose that basing the tentacles of the muscle structure of snakes might be more optimal.
#+end_quote

Even if we agreed on this first claim, inefficient shapes remain inefficient. Snakes are slow relative to other mammals, even the faster ones, and even then they can only get as fast as they do because they're weight optimized, just a single structure, not carrying a mass. A horse manages to haul a load and still outruns them. So do smaller mammals.

  The fact that something isn't seen in nature as it is hardly is an argument for that it isn't energy efficient. We have much easier access to high energy food sources.
#+end_quote

We know how to make flashbangs, we know how much light we need. The brightest living organism produces 45 mililampberts, from what I could find, so a square meter would produce 143 candela, a tenth the light hanging in my room, and a factor 100,000 less than an M84 stun grenade.

  Your suggestion of the fungal network is comparable to grey goo
#+end_quote

Fungal nets aren't comparable to grey goo, they exist and they're hardly exotic. You are right that there are issues with where the brain goes, but there are multiple possibilities and the prompt didn't specify, so it's an open question.

  You start at one point and grow outwards until you cover most of earth underground stuff.
#+end_quote

This is a liberal interpretation of the prompt. It doesn't say that you get to grow like this. It's not obvious why you'd even succeed to outcompete other fungi like this. Even if you did, why would you expect the result to be a useful system with centralized agreement? Neurons are slow, and using the fungal equivalent would be even slower. Nature might not be a particularly smart optimizer, but it's persistent; you're not going to solve these problems without properly addressing them.
