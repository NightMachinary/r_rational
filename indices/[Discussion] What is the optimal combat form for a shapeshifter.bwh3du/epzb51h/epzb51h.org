Sergeant Schlock (from Schlock Mercenary) already solved this. Remain amorphous and fluid, be entirely composed of non-flammable, heat-resistant and chemically inert nanocarbon-fiber reinforced « muscle » that doubles as your whole-body-distributed brain.

Projectiles and blades are pretty much useless, blasts need to be large merely to incapacitate him for a short time. He can change shape according to circumstances (i.e. turning into a glider, an octopus, a fish or a spherical shapes). He can resist and counter any toxin or acid or base as well as secrete his own impressive array of chemicals, and envelops enemies to digest them directly (when he does not first vaporize them to ash with heavy plasma weaponry). He can grow as many limbs as he needs to hold his many weapons, which he carries inside his body-mass. He even has spare eyes now to mitigate the loss of a few.
