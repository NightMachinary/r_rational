Those are still taking a very liberal view of things. A lens is a viable strategy to a degree, but it's not going to do major damage until you get much larger, and, again, any decent hazard suit plus sunglasses and certainly dragon-tier threats are going to be unaffected. Explosions are also incredibly inefficient uses of energy, and biology is somewhat limited there.

Generally speaking, the best bang for your buck is almost always accelerating a small, hard projectile as fast as possible, so if you're to go the explosion route I'd suggest using it to create shrapnel, though even that's of limited danger unless you can think of a proper high-velocity explosive.
