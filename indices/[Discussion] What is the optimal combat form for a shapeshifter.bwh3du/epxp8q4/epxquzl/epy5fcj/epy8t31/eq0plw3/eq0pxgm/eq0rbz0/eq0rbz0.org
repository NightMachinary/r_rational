Oh, fair. I was only thinking of current weight, not about the fact that you'd need to drop weight in order to get airborne in the first place. In terms of aiming, I was more thinking of damage via shockwave upon landing. Not sure if there would be any form of organic materiel that could withstand generating that shockwave, though. And your point about transformation time seems like it'd prevent any sort of aerial bombardment strategies short of maybe having a folding form, which would likely have the same durability issues.
