There's a reason why so much effort is going into building robots with legs. Wheels work extremely well on hard, flat terrain, and are absolutely terrible anywhere else. If you're fighting in a parking lot, absolutely go for wheels. On packed dirt? Yes. But on uneven ground or anywhere you cant move in straight lines (building with furniture, forest, mountains, places with tall grass or vegetation) wheels would be a bad choice. That goes double if you are carrying a precise weapon. Pin-point Accuracy is a big problem for large things on wheels. You can ram a torso no problem, but hitting a torso with stinger in close quarters while maneuvering around a shield and trying to evade bullets is a job for legs.
