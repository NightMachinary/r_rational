It depends on what features you want to focus on.

Let's start with a winged cat. Flight/gliding is superior to rolling. Not much rolls in nature for a reason.

Maybe some kangaroo like aspects to the hind legs. Powerful leap and efficiency over long distances. Not full kangaroo shaped, but the internal components for sure. The large elastic tendons are powerful and they may as well be bouncing on springs.

Claws of course, and since we have not gone with hands for tool use or versatility we need some flexibility with the body for closer combat.

I'm thinking snake like. No flexibility restrictions, can contort and dodge in unpredictable ways and weave past the guard of a human opponent.

This is sounding too much like a dragon... wings, claws, long flexible body... this is very close to being a dragon. Fuck it, make it spit acid.

Skin next, cover it in Echidna like spines. or octopus skin for the incredible camouflage ability that can instantly mimic colour and texture. Octopus skin won't protect from damage but who cares, we can have layers. Add something a bit more defensible underneath that layer of skin.

Secrete a strong poison or paralytic like some frogs do all over their skin. Add in some electric eel components.

There are frogs that have a type of mucus that allows them to fully recover from practically being dissected.

You're a shapeshifter. Take the worst things nature has to offer and put them in one package.

If you have enough sharp parts make sure to club the end of your tail for extra versatility. Some times a mace is better suited than a sword.

Then poison the fuck out of all your weapons because there is no Geneva convention if you're a shapeshifter.

Edit: mantis shrimp eyes. Now you can see all the colours of the wind.
