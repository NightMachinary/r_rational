This question was definitively answered in /The Sword and the Stone/, where the victory was achieved by shapeshifting into *malagolintomontorosis*, a rare, disease-causing germ which incapacitates the opponent.

​

That said, your form would have to depend on the result you wanted to achieve. What is your victory condition? Is remaining undetected sufficient? Do you need to escape? Can you force your opponent to flee or incapacitate them? Or must you kill your opponents? Is there anything else that needs defending? And so on.

​

I'm going to answer based on what I /think/ you're asking, which is: if I'm a shapeshifter and must kill an incoming, unknown threat, what would I choose?

​

Well, my first thought on /that/ scenario is that I wouldn't accept combat on those terms because what is "incoming" might be a nuke (or armed with them). I'd fall back, assess what I was up against, and choose a form based on that assessment.

​

So, let's refine the scenario further. I'm a shapeshifter, guarding an item of some value which cannot be easily moved, but can be easily destroyed, and I'm guarding it against an unknown threat that wants to capture it intact. That limits the amount of force that the opponent can bring to bear enough that choosing to engage instead of retreating is worth attempting.

Priorities are:

1. survival
2. escape
3. item remains intact
4. item remains in friendly hands

​

/Now/ I can start optimizing.

​

As my first two goals are survival/escape, my first task is to impregnate myself with multiple copies of myself adapted to the current terrain, including shapeshifter abilities, and have all of my memories encoded into my DNA; the copies would be otherwise indistinguishable from a life-form that thrives in the current environment, preferably without additional sustenance (i.e., most places on Earth, I'd be reincarnated as seeds which would grow into a grove of sentient, shapeshifting trees; if more than one of me survives, that's /their/ problem to deal with).

Having more-or-less ensured the survival of my consciousness, I would still find the destruction of my current body inconvenient, so I'd armour it. I'd protect myself with layers of limpet tooth bone plates and spider-silk skin. Rather than eyes, I'd distribute photoreceptors (and every other damned kind of receptors I can think of) throughout every layer of my skin, and similarly distribute my neural tissue and other vital functions so that any surviving 10% could reconstitute my consciousness, using the backup encoded into my DNA if necessary. Digestive system can go away for now, as can everything except for a way to take in and filter air, multiple redundant blood pumps and filters, and lots of sugars to use as fuel. Pain receptors would not be disabled, but the part of the neural system receiving the signal would pass along a distinctive sensation (neither pleasant nor unpleasant) that could be silenced to prevent distraction.

​

Okay, so now I'm armoured and maximally redundantly configured. As for the form itself, I would probably configure myself with limbs in the form of as many copies of the Jaws of Life as possible, using hydraulic pressure to tear open or squeeze closed as many opponents as possible at the same time, and then arrange those limbs for maximum speed and agility.

​

That probably wouldn't deal with anything /seriously/ armoured, but I don't think anything organic the size of a horse could do so in the first place.
