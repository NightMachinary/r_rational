Yes - this is the answer. For a full on "slow" shape shifter the rational tactic is "survive first contact, learn about opponent, come back with perfect response to problem."

So optimal combat shape to an unknown opponent is something that will survive and hopefully deceive / confuse / spread misinformation.
