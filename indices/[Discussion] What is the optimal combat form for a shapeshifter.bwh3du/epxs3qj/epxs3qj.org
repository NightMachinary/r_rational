I mean probably the optimal "shape" is a utility fog with multi-modal communication between nodes - everything from infra- through ultra-sound plus chromatophores and biological radio.

In other words, a chittering swarm of bugs.

Even if there's some sort of requirement that all of the shifted mass be attached to a central node, that's /still/ an optimal approach - use your shifted mass to create incubation chambers that'll produce a genetically engineered swarm out of unshifted mass, then use the swarm to wreak havoc from a distance.

Carriers win versus battleships, and everyone else is a battleship.
