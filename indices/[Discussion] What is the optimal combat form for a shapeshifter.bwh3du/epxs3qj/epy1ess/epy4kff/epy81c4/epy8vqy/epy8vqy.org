But the thing about a swarm is that you'll use /entire creatures/ as defense against attacks - if you need to tank some sort of heat ray or flamethrower or something, you only need to sacrifice a thin shell of insects on the outermost part of the swarm.

And that's only if you absolutely must take the hit; insects are maneuverable enough that direct hits should be rare.
