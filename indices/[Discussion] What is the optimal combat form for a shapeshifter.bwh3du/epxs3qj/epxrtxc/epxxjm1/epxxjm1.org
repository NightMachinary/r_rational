What are the main advantages of being a shapeshifter? You're a one-man guerrilla, hiding in plain sight and ambushes should be your main method of attack. Either fast-acting incapacitating poisons, lacerating talons coated in anti-blood clotting substances that result in massive blood loss, or traps you can leave around should be your weapons of choice. Like a saboteur's or an assassin's toolkit.

Scent is also something a shapeshifter might want to experiment with, for creatures that don't see with eyes alone.

As in nature, mimicry takes the shape of your surroundings (for predators) or poisonous/things best avoided (for prey). Your shape-shifting would then be split between hunting forms and escaping forms.

You could also have a preferred form similar to the creatures you hunt at a glance, like a human as [[/u/JAFANZ]] said so you can sneak into towns/cities undetected and can pick off the weakest and most vulnerable targets. Maybe hide your weapons inside your body like an organic transformer and have redundant organs to protect yourself, as well.

Being a giant golden wheel spider-thing rolling around might sound cool, but it's rather conspicuous and not playing to your strengths.
