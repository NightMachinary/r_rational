A lot of this seems very dismissive of biological limits and the ideas behind this prompt, eg. 4. is not biology; 7. ignores that tentacles are not strong limbs, there's a reason you don't see above-sea hunting animals with them with any frequency; 7.2 especially seems unjustified; 9. ignores the immense energy costs and biological limits as shown by the absolute lack of large mammals that do this; 10. ignores that Cheetah are fast through global optimization, which you lose when you make these unconstrained changes; 11. seems to have no precedent.

In addition, your jump from my fungal network to your worldspanning fungal network is pretty starkly in violation of what the prompt is about, and seems to be entirely without explanation of how you'd do so.
