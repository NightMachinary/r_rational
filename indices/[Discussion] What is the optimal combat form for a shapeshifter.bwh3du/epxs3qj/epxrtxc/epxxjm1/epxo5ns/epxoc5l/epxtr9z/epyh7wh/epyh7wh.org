Eyes. Lots of eyes.

With enough eyes, you can get sniper-like levels of accuracy. That lets you shoot poison spines, or stab with poisoned spikes, right in the gaps in anything's armor. Or just hit /their/ eyes, which are less disposable than yours.

A longbow has a range of several hundred feet, and doesn't require any non-biological materials, so duplicating that spring-strength for launching your spines should be easy. Add in a good neurotoxin on your spines, and you've got lethal long-range weapons against any living enemy with exposed eyes or skin. (Better yet, trap an area with poison slime in advance. But you were interested in "sudden combat" rather than "prepared combat".)

Spider-silk kevlar skin plates, to armor yourself with. Color-change skin like a cuttlefish, for camouflage.

Smoke pods. If you have to attack openly, you might as well make it impossible for anyone besides you to see. Smoke grenades aren't chemically much more complicated than poisons, so that should be doable. (Like octopus ink, but as shiny dust particles. Not efficient for actual land animals in natural environments, but makes sense for a melee inside a room. Use a selective-spectrum reflective particle so your eyes are fine.)

Give yourself some long eyestalks. See around corners when you're clearing a building. With luck you can slide a spine-tentacle around the corner and kill the enemies before they see you.

Octopoid upper body for grappling and dodging. Tiger legs for dash acceleration. A pair of wheeled "skateboard legs" for wheeled travel and rapid changes of direction. Use your skateboard legs to dash along walls: combat parkour.

Use skin camouflage and eyestalks to sneak up on opponents, or to see them coming and hide in ambush. Use poison spines or poison spikes to kill them in the gaps in their armor. Use tiger legs for dash and skateboard legs for direction changes and sustained speed.

But why settle for just poison, when you can also have impact? Pump yourself full of air. Spider silk will take plenty of pressure. Now, create some tubes. Load your tubes with your own spines, or any metal in the environment. What do you have now? A walking battery of air guns.

Air guns aren't as strong as explosive-cartridge rifles, but they're not wimpy. You can give yourself tubes with enough launching power to match a handgun or a light rifle. That won't get you through heavy armor - but it would easily get through the lighter armor over enemies' joints, sensors, and faceplates.

Facing multiple enemies with better guns than you? Dodge and leap, flickering your skin colors to make it look like you're going left when you're jumping right. Dash in among them, using your octopus-fold to launch yourself through small gaps. Now they have to worry about shooting each other, and you can shoot or spike all of them freely.

Against a tank, or other heavy armor? You're a hydraulic jack with a brain. Grapple close to dodge weapons, drive your spikes into any exposed sensors or joints, then dig in your tiger-legs and try to wrench the enemy's body out of its maximum range. Hard to use a tank if its barrel's bent. Most giants won't like their knees bent backward. Dragons probably can't handle their wings being twisted a full 360 degrees.

Keep an extra kevlar "cape-shield" of plates coiled up for extra defense. If you have to close on a single heavy-weapon enemy, charge with it held as a shield in front of you. If you suspect an incoming explosion, curl into the smallest ball you can and stuff yourself inside your kevlar cape. A compact ball gives the best armor-per-surface defense against an attack you can't dodge. But given the lethality of modern grenades, let alone bombs, your best bet is to kill the enemies faster than they expect so you can get away (or at least get burrowed under something heavy) before their friends with anti-tank rockets or napalm bombs show up. The best defense is a decisive offense.

Give your body a few heavily armored "cores" to hold basic brains and regeneration and a memory dump, so that you can recover from any bad combat. You can excrete and hide your core in the environment if you think you're losing the battle - bury it in the earth or rubble under your "corpse" or whatever. Lizard's tail stunt. Photosynthesis will let you restore yourself from sunlight, or certain fungal systems will let you restore yourself from dead plant matter underground, given long enough.

Gas pods. If your chemistry is good enough, you might be able to find a poison in your library that works inhaled, not just injected. In that case you could shoot dizzying or toxic gas into a room ahead of you.

The flexibility/protection tradeoff on your kevlar plates would depend on the engineering details. If your shapechange is magical enough, you might be able to have your limbs both armored and fully flexible. If not, you might have to have some more flexible limbs and some more survivable ones.

All this assumes you're clearing a building or lair in a hurry. If you've got time, stealth investigation followed by tailored ambush is always the better answer.

(Why skateboard legs instead of a whole-body wheel? A whole-body wheel would put a minimum size on how big a gap in combat you can slip through. If the room was crowded, you could be blocked. But if your biggest body part is just one leg, you can octopus-fold through small gaps between your enemy and the doorway/desk/window. The skateboard legs let you keep the sustained speeds and the rapid direction shifts of the wheel.

In the wilderness, the whole-body wheel would be more convenient for distance travel. But at that point you'd probably just give yourself wings.)
