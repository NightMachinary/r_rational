Tentical monster, with a rifle.

Then take a shape like a beanbag chair, with the rifle sitting right on top of your center of mass.

Humans snipers lie down when they want to make long shots. This is because, when we're standing, the leverage of our arms works against us, and makes it really hard to hold a gun perfectly steady.

A sentient beanbag wouldn't have any of those problems. Add in some convenient eye stalks, and you'd be shooting a nicely stable gun all the time.
