Well, in that case, the main problem with the bladed octo-armed orb is that you can't easily fly or burrow, there's no projectiles, and the opponent more or less knows where to aim their gun to kill it (at the center, unless you're doing something tricksy).

Also I think offensive and defensive forms would be /really/ different in practice, and the best defense is not fighting at all but hiding and fleeing, so in practice we're talking offensive forms. In that case it's really important to be able to pursue fleeing enemies, take down buildings, etc.

On the other hand, if the main use case is "I'm cornered and in a cave", the bladed octo-armed orb might be your best shot.

Depending on what "reasonable" means, it also makes a big difference as to 1) whether you are allowed to wield tools. Even a spear would make a huge difference. 2) how much brain you are allowed to have. (Because a lot will depend on how well you can coordinate those arms. If it's not sufficiently dexterous it's gonna get beaten by a single net gun. If it's an /extreme/ amount of brain devoted to movement, it might out-ninja things even if the form isn't great.)
