Seems like everyone here thinks combat form means “escape form”. This question was intended for offensive ability, and defense as a means to the end of more effective offense. What possible creature could have the broadest possible engagement profile?

I feel like flight is overrated when you're trying engage in life-or-death battle because you can't carry enough weapons or other offense to make up for the fragility. Maybe you could get box jellyfish venom into an aerosol and do flyby attacks with that, but that's still too close for a something that even a glancing hit will down.

As for 1. tools and 2. brain, we'll dismiss complex tools (the original post called them out-of-scope), so spear yes, oxygen tank no. As for the brain, you can optimize your battle brain to pilot the chosen form, without any shreds of fear or personality and as much tactical processing and non-humanoid kung-fu as you want.
