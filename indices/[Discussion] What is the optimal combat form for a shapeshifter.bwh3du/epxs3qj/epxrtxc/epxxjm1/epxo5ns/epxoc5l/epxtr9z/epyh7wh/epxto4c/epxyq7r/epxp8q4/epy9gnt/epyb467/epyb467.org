Huh. I must admit I was thinking on movie physics there, since I certainly haven't taken any aerodynamics or geology or any kind of related class that could help me math out the feasibility of those plans.

And since I can't math, I can only go for /more/ crazy.

Plan 1: Shapeshift -> Bird with giant thin transparent film dangling behind you. (Not sure how transparent your shapeshifting lets you become.) Then fly high and bend that film, effectively creating a massive microscope for setting things on the ground on fire without losing any of your mass. Would that have any chance in hell of working?

Plan 2: Shapeshift -> Earthworm with lots of methane production (like cows). Store up lots of methane and air, release them underground far away from your main body and explode it. You sacrifice some mass for a large explosion that should hopefully do more damage than just regular digging.

Plan 3: Actually now that I think of explosions, it's probably easier to just shapeshift -> tons of flowers spraying pollen everywhere and then cause a pollen dust explosion. The problem is, how would you survive that? So I guess, shapeshift -> earthworm with tons of flowers -> fill the air with pollen -> dig underground to hide from explosion -> explode pollen.
