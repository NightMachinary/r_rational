Well, how fast do we need to deal with things? That's not a huge issue if we can slowly build ourselves tentacles (and more computational matter!) out of biomass we accumulate from the usual sources (plants, photosynthesis, etc). Even if that's our maximum biomass, the best solution if we have any significant amount of time is to use as much of it as possible for computational matter which we use to come up with ways to make our biology more efficient.

Really, whatever the problem is, your power is probably going to become mostly irrelevant after the ensuing intelligence explosion and using your power to bootstrap your way to nanotech. After that point it'll only be useful insofar as it can break the normal rules of physics.
