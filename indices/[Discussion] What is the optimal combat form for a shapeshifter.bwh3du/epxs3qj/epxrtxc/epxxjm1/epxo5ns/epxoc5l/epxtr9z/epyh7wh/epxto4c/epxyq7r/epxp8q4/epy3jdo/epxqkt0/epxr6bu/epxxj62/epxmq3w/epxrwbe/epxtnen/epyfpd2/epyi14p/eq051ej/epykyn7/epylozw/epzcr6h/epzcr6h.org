1. I don't know what definition of biology you are working under. I see no reasons to why our biological creature would use suboptimal muscle structures when better exists.

2. My post adresses how to increase tentacle strength. Though I suppose that basing the tentacles of the muscle structure of snakes might be more optimal.

3. The fact that something isn't seen in nature as it is hardly is an argument for that it isn't energy efficient. We have much easier access to high energy food sources.

4. I would expect the decrease from global optimization to be comparable to the increase by more efficient muscle structure.

5. True. That wasn't a requirement in the OP.

Your suggestion of the fungal network is comparable to grey goo so that is already outside of the prompt. There's no obvious way that you would retain a humanlike mental structure when you don't have a humanish brain structure. That said it does seem like the obvious thing to do if it can be done safe. I'm not sure about what explanation you would need - you start at one point and grow outwards until you cover most of earth underground stuff. Depending on where you start you can get north+south America or Africa+Europe+Asia before you have to start considering how to pass large bodies of water.
