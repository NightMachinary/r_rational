If I were a shapeshifter my emergency form would be designed for one primary goal: survivablility, with a secondary goal of information gathering.

If dividing into multiple bodies is possible my go-to form would be a swarm of locusts equipped with a paralytic agent. First move is to spread out, get enough bugs to safety to form a new body and then observe. Maybe even swarm and paralyze I think I can take them.

Assuming multiple bodies is impossible, I assume a innocuous form of something nearby. A Bush if outdoors. A piece of furniture if not. As a shapeshifter, my advantages are in striking suddenly and from anywhere. If my enemies would have the advantage, I stay hidden (a bunch of armed humans in the daytime? No thanks.) If I think my chances of winning are high, I take my prey down quietly and unexpectedly, silently shooting out a poison dart (from cone snail biology) to quietly take down my prey. If things go south, I have part of my biomass ready to take a flying form and escape, abandoning my disguise and that part of my body.
