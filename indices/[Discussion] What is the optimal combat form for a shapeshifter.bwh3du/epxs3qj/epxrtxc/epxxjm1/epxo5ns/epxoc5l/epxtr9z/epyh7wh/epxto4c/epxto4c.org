This seems rather unspecified. Why, for instance, couldn't one transform into something fast-growing and shapeshift after becoming tree- or even forest-sized? What would limit transforming into a large brain-in-a-vat creature, with bird-esque brain density, (so 5000x a human brain in sum) and quickly skipping to AGI? How does one resolve questions about where the self lives, given different creatures vary wildly; what if you turned into a creature that can be diced, with all the pieces surviving? What's the aim of ‘general combat' anyhow? Can one take an entirely unsustainable form that burns rapidly through energy reserves, and only recover them later by reverting to a more reasonable form? This should allow vastly faster and more powerful movement. What counts as ‘biology' and what's correspondingly plausible? Could you have thick armor made of the same material as limpet teeth, joined with equally tough flexible materials? Could you have what is otherwise the same material, but with fibers orders of magnitude longer with orders of magnitude fewer flaws? Could you make a mechanical contraption from this material, and run it off oils that are poured into it? Can one harvest such material, transform back, quickly recover, and repeat until one has a stockpile of perfectly crafted, extremely strong parts with submicrometer precision? Could you make seeds with custom DNA and rapidly cover huge areas with beings of your devising?

So many questions.
