You're thinking way too small with that wheel idea. The limits of possible biology are not especially low. Biologically produced binary weapons (both explosive and chemical) open up the possibility of suicide drones and biological firearms. The latter could also be a possible vector for use of toxins; if facing something for which a bullet would wound but not itself kill, which is also protected from gaseous poison, toxins could easily finish the job as long as they're not completely bulletproof (in which case, say hello to insects loaded with binary explosives). And you can get a lot of mileage out of your biomass with materials that are extremely hard for their weight; nature already has a lot of these like spider silk, but your perfect shapeshifting should allow for engineering of novel, intelligently designed proteins to make even better materials.

Like others have said, the best strategy is definitely a differentiated swarm. The question from there is "how small do you go"? This doesn't need to be a single answer; you can use some of your mass for larger units and some for smaller ones. And thus my current answer is to have a spectrum of sized for easily working with things on a variety of scales. The means by which your shapeshifting works becomes really important when it comes to the specifics; do you need to have something doing your computation in order to keep existing, or do you think using something separate from whatever physical form you take? EITHER answer opens up a rather large world of munchkinry; if it's the latter you can have drones working on far smaller scales than would normally be possible while allowing for fine, conscious control. Possibly "molecular tweezers" level, allowing you to basically do whatever nanotechnology shit you want. But if the former is true you're even MORE broken; in the case just mentioned you're still limited to whatever level of computational capacity you started with, but if you're thinking using normal matter but have the innate ability to make functional changes to your biology without wrecking everything and dying, you're about to PERSONALLY experience the intelligence explosion... meaning it's pointless to speculate on exactly what you'd do, but if your goal really is to be as capable at killing things as possible, I certainly wouldn't want to go up against you.

It's also worth noting that even though you say it's too slow to use in combat, it'd have to be pretty damn slow to have NO combat use. You could design your form to have natural (by which I mean physically working, not dependent on continued use of your power) mechanisms by which small changes made with your power can domino out.
