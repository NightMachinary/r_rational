  Biology isn't agentful, it uses what it has, invariably, because it's dumb like that. A major limitation is that biological processes are limited in temperatures, energy production, and energy density, and all seem to need to be incremental with local structured growth. It's hard to reason about what is possible â€˜in principle', but sticking to materials actually produced by existing biological systems seems sane.

It feels that you are confusing biology and evolution. All of the proposals in this post have been using 'agentful' mixing and matching.

  Even if we agreed on this first claim, inefficient shapes remain inefficient. Snakes are slow relative to other mammals, even the faster ones, and even then they can only get as fast as they do because they're weight optimized, just a single structure, not carrying a mass. A horse manages to haul a load and still outruns them. So do smaller mammals.

I'm failing to see the problem. The idea is to have multiple tentacles that can do quick jerky movements and are strong enough to pull.

  We know how to make flashbangs, we know how much light we need. The brightest living organism produces 45 mililampberts, from what I could find, so a square meter would produce 143 candela, a tenth the light hanging in my room, and a factor 100,000 less than an M84 stun grenade.

That's a good point. I hadn't looked up the math on this one.

  This is a liberal interpretation of the prompt. It doesn't say that you get to grow like this. It's not obvious why you'd even succeed to outcompete other fungi like this. Even if you did, why would you expect the result to be a useful system with centralized agreement? Neurons are slow, and using the fungal equivalent would be even slower. Nature might not be a particularly smart optimizer, but it's persistent; you're not going to solve these problems without properly addressing them.

My addressing of the prompt itself is in the talk about the unit. I felt that other posts hadn't addressed what you would actually do as a shapeshifter. In terms of practicality you have to be a piss poor shapechanger if you can't think of a way to get rid of fungi. You can literally change part of yourself into fungi eating bacteria. It's useful because it's decentralized. Assuming we can get around the brain as fungi problem you have massive ammount of brainpower. Solutions for specific problems can be allocated to specific clusters.
