A fair point. I have a bunch more questions, of course, about their recovery process (which the shapeshifter can sidestep, so long as it survives), and whether "insular enough for a plant to survive" would also mean "insular enough for an animal brain to survive". At the very least, it'd require the shifter to have a thick, all-encompassing layer of bark covering it /before/ the fireworks start.
