A couple points to consider:

About the rolling tank idea, the problem I see with it is that this kind of movement would require quite a lot of energy to perform and restricts you to the ground. You would be tired in seconds.

You mentioned upper mass limits to the shift, but what about the lower limits? If you can reduce your size while keeping the same mobility and weight by increasing density, you lower your center of gravity and reduce your profile making both striking and destabilizing you harder.

If I had to pick an emergency form, so far would be a cross between a spider and an armadillo with the size of a wolf. Decent protection, good mobility, good reflexes, some jumping power, multiple limbs, poison, decent weight, possibility of weaving a quick trap if I can spare the time. If I can add a bladed bone on the limbs like you mentioned, even being overpowered is not that much of a concern.
