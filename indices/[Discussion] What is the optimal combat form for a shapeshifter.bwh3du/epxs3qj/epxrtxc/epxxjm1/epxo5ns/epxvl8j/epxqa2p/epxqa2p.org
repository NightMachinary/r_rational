I don't follow your objection to a wheel mode. Think about how much more efficient a human on a skateboard or bicycle is compared to just running. When your muscles and brain are optimized for this kind of travel, it makes perfect sense to be not only practical but also quite fast. Energy efficiency isn't a concern because we're only talking about /combat/, just a couple of minutes, and boring ‘ol lactic-acid fermentation is good enough for that. Rolling also makes it even harder to seriously injure you while moving, since enemies can can't aim at the “leg” or “head” while your whole body is tumbling around.

I guess you could reduce your mass by just leaving it behind but you'd have to come back for it later, or regrow a digestive tract to process some of your kills.
