Each “arm” is a thick tube of essentially pure muscle, but only one of the six arms is touching the ground at any given time. The other five move to shift the creatures center of mass forward and cause to roll while the sixth arm launches off the ground like a strong kick. As it rolls forward, the next arm curves to catch and balance the creature while it rolls forward, and when the center of mass passes more than halfway over it, kicks as well. Since your motor cortex or whatever brain structure you use to control is purpose built for this as well as crawling, jumping, and climbing, your skill and control are perfect and you should be able to reach much higher speeds than a hexapus normally could.
