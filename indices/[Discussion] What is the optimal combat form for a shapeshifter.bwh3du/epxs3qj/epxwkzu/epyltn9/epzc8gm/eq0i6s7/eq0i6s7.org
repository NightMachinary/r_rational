This isn't an incidental problem you can optimize away, it's a feature of the domain. Sure, a super bee might be able to cut a bee suit, but a corresponding super bear would cut through plate steel. Explosives continue to be weak ways to transfer force; consider the danger from a gun relative to the danger from a single bullet's gunpowder. It's also biologically expensive.
