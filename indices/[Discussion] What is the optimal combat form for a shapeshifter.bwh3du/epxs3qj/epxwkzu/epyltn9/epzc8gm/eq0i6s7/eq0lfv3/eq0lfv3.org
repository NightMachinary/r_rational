Explosives may not be strictly speaking the most efficient way to deal damage, but they're also widely used in human warfare for a reason. I don't know the damage a single bullet's gunpowder would do if detonated directly on my body with some construct to focus the explosion on me (like a bowl or something), but I imagine it would be rather significant. The advantage a bullet has is mostly in being a ranged weapon. Besides, the strength of gunpowder is limited by various factors; the gun and bullet need to be able to survive the explosion, it can't be too easily detonated but has to be able to be detonated by physical force alone, and it needs to be cheap to manufacture.

For kamikaze wasps, these aren't issues. Nothing needs to survive the explosion, so there's no need to either have a weaker explosion or stronger (more expensive) gun and bullet. It doesn't need to be able to be detonated via physical force, as there are many ways to design the biological drone to detonate it thermally, electrically, chemically, etc, but there's no need to make it particularly hard to detonate that way either as long as it's not so unstable that it will explode without clear reason. And as for resources, simple chemical compounds become a LOT easier to manufacture when you combine (super)human understanding and planning with the ability to build novel enzymes... even just the ability to have enzymes that don't normally exist together or in as large quantities produced on demand in situ makes it much more possible, but with novel engineered enzymes, you could make almost any small molecule you wanted, including high explosives.
