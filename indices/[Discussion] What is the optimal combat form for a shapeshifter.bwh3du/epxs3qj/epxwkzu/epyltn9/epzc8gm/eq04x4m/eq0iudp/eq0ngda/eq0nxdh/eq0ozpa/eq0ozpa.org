I think ultimately, something like "coordinately fly the mask off" was ultimately what I was thinking of with my initial comment; basically the idea that beekeeping suits are only meant to protect against uncoordinated bees, so the fact that they can't bypass it while uncoordinated isn't as meaningful if you're talking about a theoretical entity that can coordinate them.

What I don't know is how difficult it would be to engineer a new beekeeping suit that is not vulnerable to coordination after being exposed to a coordinated swarm, which is how I interpreted your original point as arguing. Is that a fair assessment of what you're claiming?
