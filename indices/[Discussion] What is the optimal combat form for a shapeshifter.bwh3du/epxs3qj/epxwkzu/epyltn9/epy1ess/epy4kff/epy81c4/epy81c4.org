Large things overheating is a completely different problem to heat attacks.

The key details is that small things have a greater surface area to volume ratio (making it susceptible to forces). They have a smaller distance between surface and vital organs (weak against anything that needs to penetrate, such as heat). This means the ratio of armor-to-content has to be much higher to have the same protection against external threats. A lower mass also makes them more susceptible to poisons/toxins.

I still think that this is the superior form though, due to its flexibility (much like Naruto's shadow clones).
