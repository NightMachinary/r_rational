The real problem with Taylor is that she let herself become famous, and that should have bitten her in the ass so very hard.

Jf you expect to be fighting a bug master in advance, hard-countering that entire stichk is not difficult, and it happened to her, what once? People showing up in bug-proof armor with "All insects die" weapons should have been a constant problem from about a third of the way through.
