The logistics of having specialized armor and weapons for a single small-time villain seem like too costly for this. She didn't murder or maim, except through occasional recklessness, nor did she rob or do much of anything beyond aiding and abbetting.

Heck, most of her success came from being too unimportant to spend thinker time on, and being attached to stronger teams.
