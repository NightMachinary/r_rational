Man-made bombs have the advantage of size and shrapnel; it doesn't matter if they're less efficient if they're powerful enough. I think you are overestimating the power of lone gunpowder here, especially given that a small insect is not going to have the weight needed to properly focus an explosion.

However, one option that probably will work is a small tubular grenade made of some strong biological material, such that the explosion shoots shards out each end, directionally. This won't be as effective as a proper gun, lacking the acceleration the barrel provides and the penetrating power the bullet's heft provides, but it should still be deadly. So +1 for changing my mind there.

As to manufacturing novel materials... depends on the prompt, really. I wouldn't write a story where that was allowed, but someone else might.
