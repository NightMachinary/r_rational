Bear in mind these aren't bees we're dealing with though. "Within the limits of possible biology" is a pretty minor limitation. Even ignoring that with superhard (and ultralight, meaning you can have a lot of them) materials in intelligently designed shapes something the size of a bee might be able to just cut through it, there's nothing stopping you from making the notbees naturally be binary explosives, producing two compounds that they can mix to detonate. There are no real species that use this strategy, but it's within the limits of theoretical biology. And as far as I know there's nothing stopping your swarm from being differentiated; some explosive notbees for hard targets, some specialized cutters, etc.
