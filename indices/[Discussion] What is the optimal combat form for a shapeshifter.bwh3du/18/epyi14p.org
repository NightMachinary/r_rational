I was doodling on a species of *very slow* shapeshifters - That is, any body they like, but the alterations happen at the rate of a biologically plausible growth-spurt. And with that limitation, the standard combat form - the shape taken by professional practitioners of violence, was usually referred to as "Ogre". Big humanoid, that still (just) fit into normal furniture, but with everything made as tough and redundant as possible. Because giving up weapons is a daft idea. Nomad tribes sometimes vent for a centauriod body plan, but even for them, that was not popular, too unreasonable a caloric burn for what you get.
