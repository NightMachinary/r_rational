  /Naruto Kai/ is basically a bunch of 90-120 minute arcs, with the filler and opening and ending sequences removed. It is amazing. Has completely changed my viewing experience of Naruto Shippuden.

I really, really want someone to do this for /Pokemon/ - the show has some great nostagia value at least, but also /so much filler/. I think there are multiple levels of stuff to cut:

1. Openings, endings, previews, etc. Obviously redundant.
2. Stock footage - attack scenes, duplicate shots, team introductions, etc. At this point each "30 min" episode is probably closer to five or ten minutes.
3. Edit for density - don't bother with explanations of the obvious, and so on. This is getting more subjective.
4. Remove side-plots.
