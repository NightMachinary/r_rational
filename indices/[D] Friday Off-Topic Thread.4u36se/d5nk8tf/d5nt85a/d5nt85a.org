The ending of Avatar was completely idiotic. The entire movie was an ill-conceived metaphor for colonialism, complete with "noble savages" and magical space-Native Americans. That'd be aggravating enough, since it perpetuates the same stupid whitewashing of every culture the Europeans ever wiped out that's so pervasive in our literature; replacing diverse and complex societies with a vague bland hippy-ish free loving /thing/ that favours fairy stories that appeal to our modern Western sensibilities over anything resembling a real pre-industrial civilization.

But then the natives /won/. That doesn't just ruin the parallel, it sets it on fire, runs over it with a train, and throws the crushed remains in a garbage disposal. In the moment that happened, it went from shitty, hamhanded metaphor to bad Mary-Sueish historical fix-fic. The humans utterly fail to exercise even the most basic level of strategy, entering hand-to-hand combat when they clearly have air superiority and enough firepower to burn down the entire planet, just so we can watch glorified rhinos somehow destroy tanks with their space magic and hunter-gatherers defeat space marines with sticks and stones.
