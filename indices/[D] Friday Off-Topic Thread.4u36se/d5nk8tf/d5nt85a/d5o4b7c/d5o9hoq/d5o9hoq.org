I mean, they live in the garden of Eden. "Science/civilization ruins everything" might be an unpopular trope 'round these parts, but when your life is damn near perfect, regression to the mean is a serious concern.

What criticism there is to be made, is to be laid at the feet of the scriptwriter who built the world. In-universe, the pic's attempt to redefine victory as "building the pyramids" or spreading ourselves across the galaxy ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_and_total_utilitarianism][we total utilitarians now?]]) rather than having your entire species live pleasant, satisfying lives sounds very sour-grapes.

(Humans do have a much higher upper bound for longevity. Though an informed Na'vi would argue back that the Na'vi's odds of surviving the next few centuries are much higher - or would have been had they not have the cosmically unlikely misfortune of crossing our path.)
