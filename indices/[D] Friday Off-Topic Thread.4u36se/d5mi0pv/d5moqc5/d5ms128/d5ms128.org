Political beliefs are a proxy for other things too, and that's probably what's going on with dating. From a Scott Alexander article [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/06/guns-and-states/][(link)]]:

  The Red Tribe is most classically typified by conservative political beliefs, strong evangelical religious beliefs, creationism, opposing gay marriage, owning guns, eating steak, drinking Coca-Cola, driving SUVs, watching lots of TV, enjoying American football, getting conspicuously upset about terrorists and commies, marrying early, divorcing early, shouting “USA IS NUMBER ONE!!!”, and listening to country music.

  The Blue Tribe is most classically typified by liberal political beliefs, vague agnosticism, supporting gay rights, thinking guns are barbaric, eating arugula, drinking fancy bottled water, driving Priuses, reading lots of books, being highly educated, mocking American football, feeling vaguely like they should like soccer but never really being able to get into it, getting conspicuously upset about sexists and bigots, marrying later, constantly pointing out how much more civilized European countries are than America, and listening to “everything except country”.

He's painting with a wide brush here, but you can see how a lot of these things, which /sound/ strongly correlated with politics, might affect a choice of who you want to build a life with. I personally don't care a huge amount about, say, whether someone thinks marginal taxes should be slightly higher or lower, or whether the TPP is good or not. But if I'm going to make a life with someone, a lot of these other listed things /do/ matter. Even if there's not an actual correlation, there's a /perception/ of a correlation, which is enough for most people. Were I a Red, I wouldn't dismiss someone for, hypothetically, voting democrat; I would dismiss them for being someone who likes soccer or eats arugula or that whole package, etc.
