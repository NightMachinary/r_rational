  I'd really say so.

How do you see this affecting things, specifically? For example, at gatherings/parties do you see people refuse to associate with each other due to political differences? Because again, in most situations I see the opposite- debates ensue (which can turn into arguments if the people involved aren't careful), but in general these are handled in an adult fashion and other factors such as how vitriolic, uncompromising, or loose with facts they are plays a bigger role in determining how the two sides feel about each other.

  Or maybe you don't feel that strongly about politics?

I care about politics a lot, but I'm also of the opinion that given how complicated the system is and given the vastly different backgrounds of most other interested people, it's a mistake to judge people too harshly based on their specific beliefs. For example, I have friends who are very opposed to transexual rights, which I disagree with, but as long as they are able to give solid reasons why they feel that way, it doesn't shift my opinion of their character much. Ultimately, being able to accept new evidence and correct your beliefs seems like a more important character trait.
