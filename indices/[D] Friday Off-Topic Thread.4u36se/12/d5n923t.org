I just finished a rewatch of Naruto Shippuden from about the half-way point, starting with Jiraiya v. Pain, ending with the most recent episode, and I gotta say, it is /much/ better watched all at once, with filler removed.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/48p81o/naruto_kai_all_episodes_megathread_2/][Naruto Kai]] is basically a bunch of 90-120 minute arcs, with the filler and opening and ending sequences removed. It is amazing. Has completely changed my viewing experience of Naruto Shippuden.

It has given me a new appreciation for Kishimoto as well. The problems I had with Naruto are still there but watching everything at once makes a lot (not all, though) of apparent plot holes disappear, makes the epic symbolism and incredibly thought out foreshadowing more impressive, and really hammers in the philosophy of Naruto.

I now realize that the oft-maligned feature of Naruto, the pervasive flashbacks, are a really important part of Naruto's philosophy.

(incoming rant on Naruto ahead) (Also I don't know how to do giant spoiler tags so I spoiler tagged each individual paragraph...)

Anyways, I recommend y'all check out Naruto Kai, it's a great way to view the series.
