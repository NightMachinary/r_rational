Does anyone else wonder if having such easily accessible information via the Internet is lowering our overall capacity to try and solve things ourselves or come up with our own conclusions?

Specifically I'm thinking about search engines. Any answer is just a Google search away. If you don't want to, you have no need to come to try and think on your own; to form deductions and conclusions based on limited knowledge is something that takes effort and leaves you better off, I feel.

Sorry for this obscenely vaguely worded question. I'm both unsure of what I want to say and on mobile.
