Some thoughts:

I developed my skill in programming enough that I almost never ask for 'help' in debugging something. I used google to mainly look up API references, and sometime to google the context of errors.

Additionally, the last time I helped a programming noob, I immediately noticed several errors that needed correcting that has nothing to do what he was asking.

Writing is a creative process that almost never happen with google search unless I am trying to research something.

When I am learning something new, googling definitely spike.
