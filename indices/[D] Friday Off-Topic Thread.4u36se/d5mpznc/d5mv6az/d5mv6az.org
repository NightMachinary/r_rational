Probably the first step would be to analyze the community and find what issues plague it the most to focus effort on them.

That's too little money in my country (we're talking about a third world one) so I'd probably investigate and teach myself some production technique to then teach others. That way they don't become dependent on the influx of resources I provide.

Another option is to start saving and preparing for a start up so that I can provide income to others, teach them something they can do with their time (which will help lower crime too) and ensure I increase my income and can thus use the resulting money to fund other enterprises/donate to charity.

I think the rational goal of such a character would be to win on the long term, spending it all on charity and helping people is good but won't have such a lasting impact on his community if he does so alone. Plus, more than money, time is a more valuable asset and he can do more stuff if he no longer has to worry about running out of money.
