I was trawling through the archives the other day to compile a history of rational fiction, and there are many, many more of "I am starting on X" than there are "I wrote X" or even "I wrote the first chapter of X". If you include brainstorming, it's even worse.

But no, it's not here that's the worst. I suffered through four years of an English major with so many people who were more interested in the idea of being a writer than actually writing. Same happens on pretty much every writing forum, in part because the people who want to talk about writing are going to be disproportionately represented in those places. (And I love National Novel Writing Month, but there are always a huge number of people more enamored with the idea of having written a novel than with the actual writing of said novel.)
