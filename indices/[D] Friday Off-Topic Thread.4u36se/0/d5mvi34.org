After a serious storm, I'm on my second day without power. There was apparently some serious infrastructure damage which means that power won't be back on in my neighborhood until tomorrow at the earliest.

I tend to do a lot of thinking about the mostly invisible physical systems that make up modern society like running water, electricity, internet, credit cards, and the complex supply chains that allow me to pick from a wide variety of products at any store. I think there are some people who look at things like that and get frightened by it, because it can seem so fragile; if the power goes out in your house, you lose both refrigeration, which doesn't just set you back to pre-refrigeration technology but /further/ because you can't cook without your electric stove or your microwave. And you can't go to the store, because the stores are either closed (due to loss of power) or not taking credit cards (due to loss of power). Things weren't quite that bad for me, because I have a propane grill, a stock of non-perishable staples, and emergency cash, but in the abstract it's sobering.

Then I start thinking about what life is like in places where there are routine rolling blackouts or a lack of services to begin with. There was a documentary I watched a while back about what life was like in Soviet Russia, which I think is more intruiging than the third world, because it's not that they didn't have the technology, it was instead a system failure.
