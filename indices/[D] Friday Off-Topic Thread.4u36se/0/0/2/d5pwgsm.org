  I once went through a short phase where I saw society as insanely fragile and was utterly terrified by what would happen when the house of cards inevitably comes crashing down. However, I then realized that humans have been constructing civilizations for thousands of years and collapses like the one I was imagining are rare historically.

Case study: Zimbabwe, over about the last decade or so.

This raises an interesting point about collapses - a /local/ collapse, over a single country, is not world-ending. Sure, it's really nasty for the people /in/ that country (at least, those unable to sneak across a border); but countries are usually independent enough that what takes one country down may have little to no effect outside that country; and once the confounding factors are removed, the /knowledge/ on how to get things up and running again is either remembered or at worst can be hired in from places that have not experienced the collapse.
