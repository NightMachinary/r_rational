I once went through a short phase where I saw society as insanely fragile and was utterly terrified by what would happen when the house of cards inevitably comes crashing down. However, I then realized that humans have been constructing civilizations for thousands of years and collapses like the one I was imagining are rare historically. So what was keeping such a complex system going?

The answer is a combination of three major factors with a lot of other minors ones which I'm not going to go into:

- It's difficult for any single person to do meaningful damage to society as a whole. Therefore, no lone madman can destroy a nation a la Joker-style.

- Virtually every aspect of civilization requires infrastructure to function. This means that it's in everyone's long term best interest to cooperate (or at least follow laws) to maintain an advanced lifestyle.

- It's /self-reinforcing/. Societies undergo a particular form of mimetic evolution where the weaker societies either collapse or get taken over by others. As a result, the better surviving societies pass on their systems of governance and cultural mores. More advanced civilizations are built from the bones and foundations of earlier civilizations. I could spend a good hour talking about how the Renaissance contributed to the make-up of all cultures descended from Europe of the 1300-1500s.

I know that you weren't asking how civilization can function, but I wanted to share a few points I found fascinating and comforting to know.
