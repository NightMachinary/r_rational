Yeah I gave up on the belief that any one single society can last forever and I try to stay optimistic about the reasons why I think humanity can actually survive the long run to become an intergalactic civilization. Despite what I just said before, I don't actually think any society can last forever yet, but rather each civilization can learn from the mistakes of earlier ones and survive longer and longer. So therefore, civilizations become more robust and flexible with each iteration.

It's quite frankly horrifying knowing that collapses can happen, but what matters is the continuation of sapient life (with a strong personal preference for humankind over other intelligences).

TL;DR - I don't actually have a long-term perspective, I just have selfish reasons to convince myself that we have absolutely nothing to fear about humanity disappearing into oblivion without becoming something /great/. FOR THE GOD-EMPEROR!!!
