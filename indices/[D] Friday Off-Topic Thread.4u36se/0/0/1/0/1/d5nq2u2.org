  Yeah I gave up on the belief that any one single society can last forever and I try to stay optimistic about the reasons why I think humanity can actually survive the long run to become an intergalactic civilization.

Oh joy. A veritable Imperium of... oh wait you already used that joke.

  So therefore, civilizations become more robust and flexible with each iteration.

Well, I certainly hope so. They're what keep actual people alive and well, after all.

  It's quite frankly horrifying knowing that collapses can happen, but what matters is the continuation of sapient life (with a strong personal preference for humankind over other intelligences).
#+end_quote

Nah. Whole civilizations and species are just the sum of their members and the relations between those members.

  I just have selfish reasons to convince myself that we have absolutely nothing to fear about humanity disappearing into oblivion without becoming something great.

Oh, ok, that's just /coping/.

I have told that sadistic son of a bitch time and time again to just stop digging himself deeper into his stupid little hole, but alas, I think he'll actually have to be stuck on a Golden Throne for 10,000 years to learn that he did literally anything wrong. Getting /people are actually important and valuable as individuals/, followed by /fear, shock, and awe feed the worst in humanity/, followed by /you can only advance humanity by advancing humans, not by dominating them/ and /inequality feeds the worst in humanity and Chaos itself/, followed by /the Warp is treacherous when you don't reduce it to its substrates in the Materium/ all through his thick overpsychic skull is just going to take too damn long, even if I start with /try giving a shit about your own children and peers/.

Oh well. The demonstration will have to suffice.
