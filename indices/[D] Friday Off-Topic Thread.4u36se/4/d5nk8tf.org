(Paraphrased from a reddit comment I didn't think to save.)

The reason Avatar (the movie) ended in tragedy was that the Na'vi were made too perfect.

Humans are willing to spend a /stupendous/ amount of money and effort to find a peaceful solution. They've been at it for years. The Avatar Program alone likely dwarfs the costs of the entire military base. We don't treat /humans/ nearly this well IRL, when they're third-world and live on top of a valuable resource.

And the Na'vi, while not fully rational economic partners, are open to trade.

But because they were made so perfect, there is nothing they want from Earth. No-one is hungry, or sick, or doing unpleasant labour, or interested in material comforts, or in conflict with another tribe. Despite being like 7 tech levels ahead, Earth has nothing to offer them.

And so trade is at an impasse, and Earth eventually resorts to violence.
