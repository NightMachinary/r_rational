If your (your character's) goal was to improve lives for as many people as possible using all the money you managed to save from your monthly income, what path of actions would you choose as the most efficient one? Please assume that you start with monthly income equal to Ã—1.5 the minimal wage for your country (if you're ok with it, specify how much it is in your comment for context) and with average intellectual capabilities.

Same question, but also assume that you can not donate to charities or start them yourself, donate or collect money in general.
