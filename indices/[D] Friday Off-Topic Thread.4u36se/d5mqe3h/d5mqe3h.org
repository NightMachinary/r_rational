Yesterday I watched My Neighbor Totoro for the first time and it put me in a good mood for the first time in a while. I like Kiki's Delivery Service more, but Totoro is just so simple and sweet that it couldn't help but brighten my day. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4o7qu0/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d4aawjt][A month ago]] I shared an idea I had for a story that [[/u/scruiser]] is now writing, and since the Happy Stories contest is in need of more entries I thought I'd share another premise that Totoro inspired in me.

I started with the idea of telling the same story in an urban setting, where the protagonists encounter weirdness due to social isolation instead of geographic isolation. Then I thought about making the Totoro analogue an alien who's "roughing it" on Earth. It sees humans as wildlife that can't be clearly communicated with and our society as an ecosystem that shouldn't be disturbed, maybe Earth is like a Yellowstone National Park for them.

The best idea for why the aliens haven't been discovered is that their camping gear includes human disguises and cloaking devices. The protagonists probably decide to follow "that weird hobo everyone else ignores", but they're lonely and curious enough to follow them back to their campsite and see what they really are. The alien doesn't mind, it thinks these humans are cute, and Friendship Ensues!

Well, that's pretty much it. Totoro is very simple movie that doesn't even really tell a story, it's just about two sisters going through mundane events in their lives and occasionally running into a friendly forest spirit who looks like a giant chipmunk. If that can warm my heart, why not tell a story about some socially ostracized kids that hang out with a weird alien? Am I the only one who fantasized about that when I was a kid?
