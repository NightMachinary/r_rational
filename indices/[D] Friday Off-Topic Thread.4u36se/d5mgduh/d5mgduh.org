I'm working on keeping my productivity up.

Keeping things to a minimum of one rough comic page or strip per day (mostly layout/composition and pre color sketch pass)

I'm expecting to have enough full quality comic pages ready to begin serial updates to a website in a month or so. If you are one of the like dozen and a half people who liked the first monster girl project (or the by my estimate two to three who wanted to like it but had some solid critique/problems) that's the loose deadline. You should be able to start reading an improved version in mid august.

In other news I've been really enjoying the game stellaris although I'm seriously contemplating a major mod to give it STL tech as a default and improved wormhole tech and alcubbiere drives for later.

It has a lot of fun to be had already and the devs have a history of improving on a core game and expanding the mechanics for years after initial release.

And when I need to get myself woken up from a slow day I really have been enjoying evolve second stage for a highly entertaining asymmetrical multiplayer experience.
