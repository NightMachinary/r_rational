  Does anyone else wonder if having such easily accessible information via the Internet is lowering our overall capacity to try and solve things ourselves or come up with our own conclusions?

As people lose faith in the established methods of being informed about the world ([[http://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction][1]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/wikiinaction][2]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/socialjusticeinaction][3]]), they'll be more inclined to investigate the primary sources for themselves.

  Specifically I'm thinking about search engines. Any answer is just a Google search away.[...]

Well, it depends on how complacent people are with what Google can provide. Years ago, I ran several Google searches for dungeon-generation algorithms--but they turned up only methods that amounted merely to the automatic laying-out of pregenerated tiles. I /could/ have settled for those, sure--but, as it turned out, I was dissatisfied with such methods, and I not only kept searching until I found [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_neighborhood_graph][better methods]] but also came up with my own original algorithms for generating dungeons.

Likewise, some people will read [[http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-california-guns-idUSKCN0YV2B1][a Reuters article about how a panel of judges refused to overturn a state's restrictions on the concealed carrying of firearms]] and leave it at that, while other people won't be satisfied with that brief overview and will actually look at [[https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/06/09/10-56971.pdf][the judges' majority and dissenting opinions]], and still other people will look at the historical cases from which those judges took precedent.

What would people have done a few decades ago? The less-inquisitive people would have settled for what their favorite newspapers and television stations told them, while the more-inquisitive people would have checked libraries and other newspapers and stations. I'm not knowledgeable enough to be able to say whether the overall change has been for the better or for the worse.
