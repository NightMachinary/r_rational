In my experience, search engines (and knowledge databases in general) allow you to formulate more complex questions, though obviously that's not the only way they're used.

Back when you needed to go to a library and check out a book you hoped was relevant (and read that book to find the pertinent page), it took an enormous amount of time to find any information outside your field of expertise. Sometimes you simply couldn't, if you didn't have access to the right library.

That meant that you couldn't easily synthesise the various data points needed for more substantial issues unless somebody else had already done the legwork, or you were getting paid for it.

Now it's changed. I can find the answer to almost any question very quickly (including whether or not that answer is contested). That could mean that I simply stop there, satisfied with my answer, or I could use that information as a basis for future inquiries.

Essentially, by removing the difficulty of actually finding the information search engines enable you to pull from hundreds of sources in a way that would have taken weeks or months before. The difficulty of your deductions is now limited by voluntary complexity, rather than by an absence of information.
