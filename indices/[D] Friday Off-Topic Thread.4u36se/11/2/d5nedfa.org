One way in which the search-engine learning model can be useful is helping with the old "unknown unknowns" problem. If I'm trying to figure something out by Googling it, I typically get some results that are too simplistic for what I want, and some results that are more technical than I am really looking for, whereas a result pitched at the perfect level for my needs is unlikely. So in the course of trying to find the answer to the question I actually asked, I wind up learning more background and context than I would have if I had used a more directed way of learning the information, including information I would have never even known to look for about issues I wasn't aware of. That's, for the most part, information I might never have learned at all, or even known as a thing I was ignorant of, if it weren't cluttering up some article containing the fact I was actually searching for at the time.
