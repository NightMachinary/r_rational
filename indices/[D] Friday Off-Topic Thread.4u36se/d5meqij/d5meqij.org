[[http://www.dafont.com/04b-03.font][04b03]] is a pretty cool font, in my opinion. You can see it used to great effect in, e.g., [[http://rvbomally.deviantart.com][RvBOmally]]'s alternate-history maps ([[http://orig12.deviantart.net/a91b/f/2016/184/3/3/gurps__dixie_2_by_rvbomally-da8ltbl.png][example]]).

I finally got around to looking at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/movie/Star-Wars/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10][/Star Wars/ stories]] again, and found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9535587][this very nice one]] (111k words, last updated in February). After hearing about Darth Plagueis from Palpatine, Anakin tries to do some independent research in the Jedi Archives...

It's nice when [[https://www.youtube.com/feed/recommended][YouTube's recommendations]] actually manage to provide something interesting.

When I saw that [[https://www.gog.com/game/simcity_3000][GOG had gotten /SimCity 3000/]] (which I used to play quite a lot, around a decade ago), it occurred to me that a city-building game (whether Maxis-style or [[https://www.gog.com/game/pharaoh_cleopatra][Impressions-style]]) with /[[http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves][Dwarf Fortress]]/'s interface would be absolutely /awesome/ to play. I mean, really--other than the management of dwarves' allowed labors (for which the external utility [[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=122968][Dwarf Therapist]] is more or less /necessary/), I find /Dwarf Fortress/'s interface to be absolutely /exquisite/.

Or does an ASCII city-building game already exist? ([[https://thetagames.itch.io/dienworlds][DienWorlds]] is an ASCII electricity-distribution simulator, but it's /extremely/ barebones and /rather/ difficult.)

The author of [[http://forgotten.faithweb.com/MaxLandis/legit00.htm][the very fun Marvel fanfiction story /Legit/]] wrote [[http://www.maxlandiswrites.com/the-force-awakens][a nice snippet of fanfiction for /The Force Awakens/]].

(Ha ha! After years of subscribing to this random RSS feed in hopes of being notified of another /Legit/, I've finally been vindicated--in some small part, at least...)

The three compilation movies of [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam][the original /Mobile Suit Gundam/ series]] are temporarily available for free viewing [[https://youtu.be/r9o7hgHLm7c][on the official Gundam YouTube channel]]! [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Gundam][This is the anime equivalent to /Star +Trek+ Wars/.]] (Warning: The story may seem somewhat disjointed and poorly-explained if you don't already have some knowledge of the Gundam universe. Also, YouTube's compression has added some rather serious artifacting to parts of the video.)

It's pretty weird, I must say, to see mobile suits animated at this /Scooby Doo, Where Are You?/ level of quality after watching /Build Fighters/, /SEED/, and even /G/. Also, the non-standardized transliterations (=Dozul= for =Dozle=, =Jabrow= for =Jaburo=, etc.) are rather funny. (More recently--who thought that =Ple= was a better transliteration than simply =Puru=? Sigh...)
