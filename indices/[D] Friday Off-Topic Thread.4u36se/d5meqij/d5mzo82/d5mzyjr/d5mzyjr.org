  And can I suggest hanging around in [[/r/dwarffortress]]? The sidebar and community is very helpful for new players :)

I'm not a new player of /Dwarf Fortress/ by any means, and stick to a consistent layout for each fortress. However, I haven't bothered to play the game very often, since my previous computer (which I replaced a few days ago) dropped to irksomely-low framerates after I exceeded about fifty dwarves. I probably will check out the new 64-bit version of /Dwarf Fortress/ after Dwarf Therapist is updated to be compatible with it.
