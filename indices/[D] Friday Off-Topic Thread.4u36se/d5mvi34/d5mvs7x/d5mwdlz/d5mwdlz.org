Yeah, a lot of people just go nuts and get into this loop of doing things that are more about power fantasy than actually preparing for the end of the world (in other words, prepping isn't about prepping). There are many times that preppers just start stockpiling guns, which ... isn't really going to help you that much, since after a certain point guns are just cool toys.

Knowledge, physical health, and self-sufficiency are what you should really start working on, but there are tons of preppers who are overweight and focused entirely on the warfare aspect. They're like "runners" who kit themselves out with the best running shoes, running shorts, water bottle, etc., talk all the time about running, but then don't actually /go running/. This is a common failure mode for lots and lots of things people do (writing is the one I see the most often, but that's because I put myself around a lot of people who are supposedly writers).
