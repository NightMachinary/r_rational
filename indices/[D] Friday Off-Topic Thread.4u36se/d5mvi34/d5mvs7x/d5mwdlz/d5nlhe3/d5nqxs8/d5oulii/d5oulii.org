I have a tendency to build big projects and then go, "Oh god, oh god, there's /this one small thing/ that makes it all unworkable."

(I probably also have overly-high expectations of myself, especially when it comes to ratfic. "It must be as good as The Reckoning, or am I just filling this subreddit with filthy /trash/.")

I'm trying to figure out a smaller ratfic project, as a consequence.
