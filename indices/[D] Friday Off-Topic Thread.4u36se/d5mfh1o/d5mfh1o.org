*On modding*: I shipped a mod for factorio: [[https://mods.factorio.com/mods/hackerkiba/MagneticFloor][MagneticFloor]]

I feel good for fixing the bugs and making it usable to the public at large. On the other hand...there's a lack of a tutorial on how to use it. I am rectifying that slowly, however.

It's mod that's initially about floors that provide better movement bonus, but the real gem of the mod is the ability to automate movement of the player from one place to another though you'll need a factory setup to produce more of copper floors and directives that control movements, exemplifying the factorio spirit of automation and logistics.

*On writing*: The end is near for a terrible fanfic I am writing, but I slowed down considerably. I got this weird feeling against working directly on writing new chapters and finishing it versus working on filler tasks, which I am happy to do but I know won't progress to the final chapter.

Despite the badness of the fic, I feel good about writing what I want to write and see in a fic.

I am working on an original fic project that I kept mentioning on worldbuilding threads for the past few weeks, but I am nt prepared to fire on all cylinder to the project. I am still worldbuilding and there should be considerable amount of research. Naming places as always, difficult, and so is inventing new nations and a historical timeline.

*On productivity*:

I am using timeboxing to great effect, setting my effort at twenty minutes each. In my experience, it's short enough to not feel too long yet long enough to make substantial progress. Sometime, however, you only get very little done, but that may be due to reasons other than not being able to focus on a task. Usually that means I am learning something or googling or researching something.

Is there any research on productivity of timeboxing? (I am supposed to be using the podomoro technique, but I can't be bother to take a specified five minutes break)
