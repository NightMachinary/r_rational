If you particularly liked the MC then you may want to give [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/13161/Hagure_Yuusha_no_Aesthetica][Hagure Yuusha]] a try, do note that it is way more service-y and explicit.

Another similar MC from a pretty good series is [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/8086/Densetsu_no_Yuusha_no_Densetsu][The legend of legendary heroes]], you'll have to forgive it's name, but in most other aspects it is actually the direction I am hoping for in Alderamin, just with replacing OP superpower with OP planning\leadership.

Last on the list of similar MCs is [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo][Mondaiji]], I would say it has quite a few similarities, though less than Hagure, as its aiming more at the shounen demographic than at the seinen demographic. On the plus(though you may consider this minus) it is far less focused on service.

Anyhow, glad you enjoyed it, Ep3 confirmed for me that this seems to be keeping up the quality(though it was more akin to Ep1 than to Ep2) so will probably move this into the "solid recommendation" category.
