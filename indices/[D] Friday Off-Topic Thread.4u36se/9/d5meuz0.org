Anyone here following the [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/31764/Nejimaki_Seirei_Senki__Tenkyou_no_Alderamin][Alderamin]] anime?

I have been finding it surprisingly good, it started with the pattern of a know-it-all womanizing MC, but the quality of the production have been surprising, and the female MC has shown some promise. Moreover episode 2 I think had some of the most nuanced and neutral representations of warfare.

So hopefully it will keep to these aspects instead of focusing on the typical approaches such animes take..
