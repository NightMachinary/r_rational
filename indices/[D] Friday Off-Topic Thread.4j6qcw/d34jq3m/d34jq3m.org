I have a /qualified/ anime recommendation.

Maoyuu Maou Yuusha. It's about a destined hero who ventures forth alone to vanquish the evil demon lord and bring peace to the world. When he reaches her (After about two minutes), she tells him how the war against her demons is the only thing keeping the human nations from constantly warring among themselves, and here are the economics of it, and the politics, and the history, and it's similar on the demons' side of things. So instead of trying to get one side to win and enslave the other species, why don't we use our powers to secretly cooperate and try to set up long term conditions for peace with these interesting new crops I found? And this 'vaccine' against small pox, and these inventions that will make life easier on farmers and-

It's basically a cookie cutter [[/r/rational]] Fantasy premise, and the hero soon agrees.

Unfortunately, while the premise is great, it's only one season, and they still manage to squeeze in 50% filler and big boob fan service everywhere, and some things still happen just because the plot demands it, like the demon lord taking several months off from plotting for no apparent reason other than that it would have been too easy otherwise.

So it's a qualified recommendation. If you don't mind/can stand excessive fan service and a hero who panics whenever a woman shows interest, and you are alright with 50% filler, then it's pretty neat to see a secret hero/demon lord alliance manipulating the economy and working behind the scenes to take the world out of the dark ages.

Spice and Wolf does economics better, but is not otherwise rationalist. Good romance though.
