On a similar note, I was once working on world building for a multiverse in which all fiction actually results from psychic inspiration leaking from adjacent worlds, thus justifying all those stories where some guy jumps between universes and by some bizarre coincidence finds himself in a book universe.

Then I realized the... implications. There would have to be a LOT of reaaaaly smutty universes around.
