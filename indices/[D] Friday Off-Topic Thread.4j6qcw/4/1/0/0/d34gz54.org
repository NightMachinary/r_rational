On the other hand, you can write fanfiction without being a fan of the thing you're writing fanfiction of. I think most people write when they're writing about something that they enjoy, but I've definitely sat down to write fanfic because I detested the original and wanted to fix all of the things it did wrong (though I never did finish my Terminator: Genisys fixfic).
