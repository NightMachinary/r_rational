Usually it's because I disliked something that was core to the work to such an extent that I wanted to write a critique of it in the form of fanfiction. Or I thought the themes were dumb and wanted to change those themes into something else entirely. I think it's the impetus that makes people leave ten page reviews for things that they didn't like; it's not so much that they love to hate it (though they might), it's that they came away with a bad taste in their mouth. Sometimes that's just because of execution, but it's often because of deliberate choices on the part of the original author.
