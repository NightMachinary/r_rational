Hmm, true, I guess fixfic, hatefic, revengefic, etc. could all be considered subcategories of fanfiction, and the fanfic author needn't be a fan. Though would it be fair to say that in the fixfic you wrote you were a fan of the premise of the original work, just not its execution? Or was it a "love to hate" sort of thing?
