It's a seventy-year-old series, any given episode is guaranteed to be flatly contradicted by /something/ in its history. Comic-book series work under the same constraint: single episodes/issues/stories are always consistent, metaplot arcs are fairly consistent, but there's no coherent canon that ties the entire thing together.
