I was gonna say, I think the continuity problems started with Innes Lloyd.

I've loved both RTD and Moffat's runs -- I think 12's run has been far better than 11's so far -- but I'm supremely interested in seeing how Chibnail's reign will be. Especially if he really does decide to use a writer's room, we might be seeing the most consistent / consistently good series of Doctor Who to date.
