Moffat is the George Lucas of Doctor Who. He made some of the best content out there but his writing suffers terribly when he doesn't have anyone to say no to him. The main problem is that he's trying to play it both ways, to have a whimsical over the top adventure that also has serious moments and real consequences and death. I love Axe Cop but if it took itself seriously that would be awful. Doctor Who needs to either go back to the level of moderate seriousness or completely commit to being whimsical and be as over the top as Axe Cop or Kung Fury.
