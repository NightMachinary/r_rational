[[http://i.imgur.com/CBbClJl.png][Mr. Yudkowsky on the point past which "canon" pieces of fiction become "fanfic-tier"]] ([[http://archive.is/gO8u9][source]])\\
It's kind of interesting to consider how the different pieces of a fictional universe might overlap in weird ways, depending on their levels of mutual consistency and interrelation. If all works purporting to represent /Avatar: The Last Airbender/ are all just distorted reflections of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms][the same "One True Canon"]] that's perfectly rational and internally-consistent, can that "true canon" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem][be extracted]] by somehow averaging the reflections so that their distortions are canceled out?

I get the feeling that it's a piece of anti-isolationism propaganda:

  “Now, Congressman, the only way for an inferior army to accomplish anything is to refuse battle until the chances are as favorable as they can be made. The inferior force must retire before a superior. It must force the invader to follow till he is weakened by steadily lengthening lines of communications. His difficulties of food-and ammunition-transport grow. He becomes involved in strange terrain. Last but not least, he gets more and more deeply into a land filled with a hostile population. But if we must defend a specific place at all hazards, then we must stand and give battle---well, it will be only one battle.”

  “You mean---?”

  “I mean that such a battle is decided already. It was decided years ago---when the country refused to prepare.”

  “Good God, man!” The Congressman wiped his forehead with a trembling, fat hand. “I can't go back and tell my people that.”

  “You'd better not,” said the General, grimly.

From the same source, [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52053][a 1920 advertisement brochure for a gyroscopic compass]] ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrocompass][more information]]):

#+begin_quote
  If you were to conceive of a compass which would be free from all the troubles and errors found in most compasses, which would relieve you of all the worry and care the present compass requires, a compass which would be accurate and reliable, a compass which would be the Ideal Compass under all conditions, you would undoubtedly conceive of a compass that had the following characteristics:

  1. It must point True North.\\
  2. It must free you from the necessity of making calculations and corrections.\\
  3. It must free you from compensating the compass for errors.\\
  4. It must free you from the burden of swinging the ship, or otherwise taking the deviation of your compass.\\
  5. It must not be influenced by inherent magnetism of the ship.\\
  6. It must not be influenced by any change in the character or disposition of the cargo.\\
  7. It must not be influenced directly or indirectly by any temperature changes.\\
  8. It must not be influenced by the roll or pitch of the ship.\\
  9. It must not be influenced by any weather conditions.\\
  10. In the event of failure, or error, it should give instant warning.

  The Magnetic Compass does not point to True North, it points to Magnetic North, which is about 800 miles from the True North Pole. The Sperry Gyro-Compass, which is not a Magnetic Compass, and is not affected by a magnetism of any sort, and derives its directive force from the earth's rotation, points True North. It does not point to the Magnetic North Pole.
