Yeah, the next weekly challenge is "Plane of Garbage", which is an attempt to try something different for the challenges; I think in the future we'll probably just some prompts that posit a scenario for authors to play around with, similar to the sorts of stuff you see in Brainstorming threads.

And to be clear, I'm not against discussion or brianstorming, I just want authors to be aware that sometimes talking about the things that you want to write about makes you less likely to write about them, which is presumably not what they want. I sometimes hit a wall in my writing and /need/ to talk to people about it, or I want wider input so that I can properly simulate the diversity of reactions or schools of thought within an organization. And sometimes I just want to talk about a thing that I have no intention of ever writing.
