One of the risks of brainstorming like that, which I hope people will keep in mind, is that /sometimes/ talking about those things saps the creative will to actually write them. I know I have a few ideas in draft that I would never get back to if I let them out of their box; it would just be a thread of "there are robots and wizards and vampires and they're all fighting each other and Bill Gates is there too" ... and that would be it, because I would have mined the idea out and all that would be left is the sometimes-tedious part of painting by numbers.

(I don't think I'm unique in this, but your mileage might definitely vary.)
