I'm glad that we were able to get a Wednesday World-building thread. I find many of the stories on the subreddit to be confusing or lacking context (summary, like "since last time" for quick catch-ups, or a "Harry thought he was a normal boy until... something something wizards and witches are real!" to give me a teaser of the stories) so I wasn't finding any creative outlet in people's threads of their online novels.

--------------

It's just nice to be able to let loose some creative thoughts and discuss various worldbuilding concepts with other people. We needed a place to discuss things like "What if people could double jump in reality?" or "What if we could fly but that would still be a form of exercise?", and judging by the 90 comments in the thread, it seems like people have responded positively to the thread idea.

I hope from it we get some more stories based on personal headcanon and concepts.
