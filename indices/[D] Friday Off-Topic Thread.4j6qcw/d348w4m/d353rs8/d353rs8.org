  If all works purporting to represent /Avatar: The Last Airbender/ are all just distorted reflections of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms][the same "One True Canon"]] that's perfectly rational and internally-consistent, can that "true canon" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem][be extracted]] by somehow averaging the reflections so that their distortions are canceled out?

Check out the /[[http://raggedjackscarlet.tumblr.com/post/135533951313/a-remake-without-an-original][Undertale Prime]]/ theory.

Undertale makes use of a lot of fanfic tropes despite not actually being fanfic of anything. The author of that post - which I won't summarize here - imagines what the "canon" to Undertale's "fanon" would be like, and reinterprets some perceived plot-holes in that light.

It should go without saying that that is just one of the many many bizarre edge cases that you can encounter when trying to create a formal definition of the "is fanfic of" and "shares a canon with" relationships. Such a formalisation can never exist in a coherent way.
