I think if you follow Eliezer's logic, then you have to /also/ posit that there are works of fiction written by fans as sequels to existing works which are /not/ fanfiction, either because they don't attempt to reinterpret or remix the original (that is, they attempt to stay as true to the author's original as possible) or because they don't use any of what we might call "fanfic tropes", whatever those would be.
