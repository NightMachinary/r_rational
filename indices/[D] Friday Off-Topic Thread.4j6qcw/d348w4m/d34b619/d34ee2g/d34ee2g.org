Agreed, there are consistent biases in fanfiction, with certain tropes appearing more often than others. If all fanfictions were random, symmetric deviations from canon, you could perhaps somehow average them together and estimate the original work with some degree of precision, but fanfics are far from symmetric and random.

As for Zach's question in the OP, I'd say that what is canon is defined by the author, who in turn has the ability to retcon the original, existing canon in favor of a new one, or otherwise create an "alternate canon". I also suppose the creator of a work can be a /fan/ of their own work (as google defines /fan/ as "a person who has a strong interest in or admiration for a particular person or thing", with synonyms: enthusiast, devotee, admirer, lover; supporter, follower, disciple, adherent, zealot; expert, connoisseur, aficionado), but to me "fan" connotes admiration /of another/, so unless the original author has amnesia or dissociative identity disorder or something they wouldn't really be a fan, which'd be a necessary condition of producing fanfiction.
