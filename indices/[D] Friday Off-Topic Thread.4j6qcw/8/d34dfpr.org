So I'm reading about relationships and marriage for this biweekly challenge and I wondered what's the best method to raise rational children. One thing I asked for example is about horror stuff.

Would it be better to talk logic with a child and teach it to not fear the darkness and the unknown and rather look at it with curiosity while avoiding exposure to supernatural/horror topics? Or would it be better to expose it to a bunch of horror topics so that they become desensitized with them in the same way butchers and surgeons become desensitized to seeing blood?

I wondered this due to the idea that organisms that don't interact with certain aspects of the environment tend to fare poorly due to lack of experience. Thoughts? Are there any known books or methods for raising children according to rational values?
