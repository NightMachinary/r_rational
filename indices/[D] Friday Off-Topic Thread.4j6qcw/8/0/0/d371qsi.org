Biggest take-away for me was: Find the point at which attempting to understand no longer frustrates the child, but rather leaves them confused yet intrigued - smiles and excited giggling are good indicators of the latter. Talk the child through their confusion and into understanding, while patiently and gradually reducing how reliant on you they are to reach that understanding. Once they're no longer reliant on you to reach understanding, the child has mastered that development.

If you're going to take that approach, though, you'd need to fairly heavily emphasize social aspects of development or else your child will grow frustrated with their relatively underdeveloped peers. Also, you'd preclude traditional education holding your child's interest if enrolled with their age bracket. Plus the incredible time investment necessary to pull it off. And godly levels of patience. Might want to become really proficient at mindfulness meditation, first.
