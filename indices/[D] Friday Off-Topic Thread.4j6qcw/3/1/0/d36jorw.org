“Aww, come on. You're no fun today, Shinji," says Shirou. He coughs. “What's with all this smoke?”

“No fun? What are you talking about? Today we had a great spar, we saved a kid from bullies, ran through a street market to escape them, learned about each other's magical spirit powers, and went to the Tohsaka manor. How am I no fun today? Also, I would guess something was cooking and it started to burn.”

“That's probably your fault. Also, your next line is: ‘How was that my fault?'”

“How-- er, I mean, that wasn't my fault.” You smirk. You're not falling for that this time.

Shirou comes back out and grins at you. “You're really no fun today, Shinji.”
