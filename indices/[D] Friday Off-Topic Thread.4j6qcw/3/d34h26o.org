For those of you who are into such things: I've started a quest on Spacebattles, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shinji-quest-bleach-fate-stay-night-crossover.389478/][Shinji Quest]]. It's basically what it says on the tin. It's a quest for Shinji! Will you be like Shinji Ikari? How about Shinji Matou? Maybe Shinji Haruki? I left out, sadly, Shinji Okazaki. Things start off reasonably dark and get darker from there, but don't worry, there will be JJBA references.
