GMing a Pathfinder campaign where all of the PCs are different kinds of magical engineer turns out to be a good way to force yourself to internalize scope. For instance, the scope of how much of various metals exist within a given mountain, when your players have invented mining-snake automatons that can burrow through solid stone faster than a man can sprint and hunt metal by magical scent. Or the scope of the shaped-charge explosion that results from filling a shipping-container-sized extradimensional pit with gunpowder and flying it into a dragon's lair.

I'm simultaneously proud of and horrified by my players. I tossed a buffed 12-headed cryohydra at them and they wrecked it in basically a single turn. The five CR 14 Furnace Golems they fought right after didn't fair much better. Golarion is doomed.
