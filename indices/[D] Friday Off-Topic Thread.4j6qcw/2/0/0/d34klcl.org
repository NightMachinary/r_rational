I suppose that's one way of looking at the situation, being from an author's perspective. I'll admit that the way the sub is set up, I'm mostly a consumer here, looking for a place to interact with others more and because of that, I invite you to look at this in a different way.

There are some like you who like to write, where discussion of their ideas can be demotivating to writing their stories, those who will write their stories regardless of discussing their ideas, and another category of people who just like discussing worlds with different rules and laws.

I think this thread will be beneficial because you'd be providing the third group of people a place where they can discuss their ideas and hopefully take them into the authoring stage. At the very least, it's one more avenue for people to bounce their ideas off and gives people like me a place to contribute more often.

Perhaps you could draw some of the concepts into the weekly competition threads, so that people could be encouraged to write based on the worlds/concepts discussed?

Edit: Anyway, thank you for not shutting the idea for the thread down. I appreciate it. :)
