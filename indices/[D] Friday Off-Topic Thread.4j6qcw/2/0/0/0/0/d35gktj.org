I've experienced something similar at times. I get a certain good feeling when I write and share something, but I also get like 80% of that just by discussing my plan to write something with someone and talking about how great the plot will be, etc. This is also true for stuff like dieting. I've had more success losing weight by only telling people about my diet after the fact (say, letting my sister know i've lost 10 lbs) than by telling people about my diet before the fact. By having the rewarding conversation, I kinda use my motivation. Or maybe, it's better put as, part of my motivation is to feel good, and a lot of that comes from just talking about it.
