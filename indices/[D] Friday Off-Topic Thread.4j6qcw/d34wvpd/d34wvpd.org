Just finished watching Erased. Spoilers follow, read at your own digression.

The ending sucked. Some people complained about episode 10, but that was pretty much fine. 11 & 12 though... They sucked. To have the main character go into a coma as a means of time skip is bad. Yeah, time skips are very hard to pull off correctly, but it was still a cop-out. The whole ending felt rushed and anti-rational. He never took what's-his-name on, except for that very last scene. It was like, "reveal!" And I was like, "since when did he become an unreliable narrator."

Also, it violates Yudkowsky's rule, "If you give Frodo a lightsaber, give Sauron the death star." The MC (I'm bad at names) doesn't use his power to its full potential; he doesn't come close. And, his enemy is some serial murderer? And you missed a ton of important clues that could have easily led you to the murderer? Plus, he didn't tell anyone about his power. I thought that he would've almost immediately after going back. Or tell his other smart friend. He only kinda reveals it at the end.

This story has such potential for a rational fiction. Whether you start from the beginning or after the murderer reveal, it doesn't matter. The story, although filled with tension, felt wrong in ways because the characters were dumb. Yeah, a moral of the story is to put trust in your friends, but still. Even after he goes back the second time, he didn't tell anyone.

UGH! I'm sorry, I'm just frustrated. The story feels like a draft for a better story. The ending at least. Although I hear it's better in the manga, he still does the coma thing. That's bad in my book. Oh yeah, especially at the end, he implies that if he dies, he'll come back because of his power. Then why didn't the author have him just and come back at the murderer reveal? Because it would ruin the story by having him being rational? Well, he would still have to figure it out, especially without evidence.

I feel like many authors don't want to ponder out what would actually happen sometimes, and want to leave it closer to what they know. Reliving out your life is hard to imagine, so boom, cop-out to the coma. [[#s][Worm Spoiler]]

It's just awful. Tell your mom about your power, test out of shit, and get a headstart on your life. And, if you want to be a true rationalist, take advantage of your rewind and invent/invest in new technologies. You know stuff from the future. Use that jump to make your life and everyone else's better. Even if you're that young prodigy who was great at drawing. You have a freaking jumpstart in life. The problem is how that fits with the story: it doesn't. So everything's awful.

I know I will be thinking about what a rational fic will be like. There's a tiny chance I might write some (I took a writing class last semester, but I'm busy, so it's hard). If anybody knows of any good erased fanfiction, that'd be great. Thanks for reading my rant. :D
