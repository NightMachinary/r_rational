I'm with you, best way to win is to team up with Claim, get him to promise you the prize money in front of everyone, then sludge as many people as you can together (preferably holding hands when you sludge people so even you don't know which of you did it).

Claim will agree to this if his incentive is really getting out asap, you do this as soon as you get sludge.

Also I don't know why By didn't think of lying to ZB about promising the prize money, so I wonder if Claim is able to lie about that?
