Immediate thoughts: rules 10 and 25 (and 26), multiple perpetrators before the Sludge Announcement--trials just handled chronologically, I imagine, but--what about when two perpetrators team up to simultaneously sludge two people each (in slightly-separated rooms, so that no three people see a body before all victims are down) then pile up the bodies? Four people, clearly two victims, but how to guess which victims were which perpetrator's evenif you narrow down the two culprits?

Similarly with if one victim each, and hoping to be thought to be just one perpetrator, and even if both identified then how to vote which perpetrator for which victim? Even with a split vote, each true perpetrator wins.

Permission for simultaneous perpetrators... just preventing such perpetrator-collaboration through insisting on microsecond-level prioritisation of Trials (with a later one bumped to after the first one's hour) might work. I wonder how it will be handled...

The magic-/nanotech-like Sludge is fairly intriguing, regarding no partial effects and no body weight effect. Assuming that the bracelets deliver Trial and rule-breaking and similar Sludge, I'm tempted to consider that most 'Sludge' is just a bloodstream(?) marker for the bracelets to gauge (calculated according to each participant's information), with By's sludge a deliberate false-demonstration of inherent effectiveness.

(Incidentally, I'm somewhat familiar with Danganronpa (through the anime) and after starting this story am enjoying it and feeling greatly intrigued!) ((As well as about the mysterious 'God' and 'Reformation' elements of the title...))

Edit: I forgot to mention my appreciation (of the relevant mechanic in this story) in the context of my (others' too?) Danganronpa reaction: "Huh? Why aren't any of the deducers talking about that neon pink paint on the corpse? --Wait, was that supposed to represent blood?"
