It's great to finally have the rules. Now, given those rules, what would a person do in order to maximize their utility? Hiding a body seems to be a pro strategy, as does moving a body, both in order to ensure that there's as limited an amount of evidence as possible during the trial. I'm also kind of thinking about the idea of a buddy system, which would clearly implicate one person in the event of a murder.

(A while back I watched like five hours of sped up Town of Salem play in a row, and one of the dominant town strategies seemed to be putting everyone in a position such that town would have the best chance of winning, and anyone who was lying would be at a severe disadvantage. Of course, in this game, people need to be eliminated for anyone to win. The cooperation/defection aspects are interesting.)

  I carefully read through it three separate times, not quite sure how to process everything all at once. It was a lot, and I had a million different questions, although some rose above others. The presence of some rules surprised me, and the absence of others I might have been expecting surprised me even more, but past that there was plenty to analysis to be had.

Which rules do people feel are notably absent?
