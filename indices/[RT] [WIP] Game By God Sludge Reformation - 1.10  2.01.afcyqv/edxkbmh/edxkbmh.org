Some thoughts:

- Dogsi and Vedsi are hilarious.

- The game could be over on day 1, theoretically. I wonder if this will incentivize Claim to actually play. He might have been assuming that to win, he would need to wait out all 91 days. But now, he could theoretically kill someone, win the game, and walk away with $10 million dollars and almost no time commitment.

- By says it doesn't sound original, and apparently this is all inspired by a game called /Danganronpa/. I'd never heard of it until recently, though, and it still sounds exciting to me.

- Knowing the rules, there are some plausible reasons you might want to keep By around, like if you think she would be easy to kill. Some of the players who voted to keep her around may have anticipated something like this.

- I guess the reason Corn is so confused is that the properties of the Sludge sound totally impossible, and anesthesia is his area of expertise.

- I'm excited to see the rest of the facility!

But most importantly, we learned that two players can win. And you know what means... it's time to start shipping!

I've taken the initiative to come up with some pairing names.

- By & ZB - Bipolar
- By & Caroline - Rationally Writing
- By & Hold - Twin Towers
- By & Claim - Wertifloke

I figure there /must/ be a clever name for By & Strait, but I can't figure out exactly what.
