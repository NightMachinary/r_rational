There is the strategy of getting stupid people to take out the high powered people, and then eliminating them. Taking two birds with one stone, though it's hard to say how that would actually work out in practice. At best you can only provide the gun, and what they do with it is entirely out of your hands, so you'd have to rely on other effects to manipulate them so that they don't know that you know what they'll do.

Something that will drastically affect how the game is played is how common the sludge is. If only one or two people have it, then carefully tracking who has it would be a good strategy. If it's as trivial to find as By made it seem, then the balance of power swings heavily in the killer's favor, as literally everyone will both the means and motive, and the only thing you can rely on is opportunity and evidence.

While the rules eliminate sharing /the prize,/ what's defined as the prize is more vague. Is stuff purchased with the prize unable to be shared? Of course, that quickly devolves into trading stocks or gold or whatever, which can all easily be converted into money and which the prize was probably going to get converted into anyways. Even more complicated is the fact that a modest 3% interest on 10 mil is 300,000 per year, which would be almost impossible to argue is part of the prize. Obviously the hosts are only interested in closing the most obvious loopholes, but know where they stopped is tricky. What's worse is that it is literally undefined. Sure, they probably thought of the 100% case beforehand, simply because of the drama, but it's likely they'll go with the rule of drama in the future as well. Which means you can't simply go up to them and ask, cuz they'll probably just say no.
