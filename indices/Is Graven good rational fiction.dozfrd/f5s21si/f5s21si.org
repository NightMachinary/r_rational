It really isn't.

Sure, the powers are interesting and creative, and we see a lot of them (although some of the most interesting are barely seen at all), but the entire plot hinges on coincidence at every turn. The team stumbles it's way to success, significant battles are not planned for but are a rock-scissors-paper powerset line-up that just happens to favor the heroes in most instances, and major plot points that most ratfics would spend whole scenes and even chapters with the characters planning out are brushed aside by there always happening to be a new character with just the right powers on hand to instant-fix a problem. The author even attempts to lampshade that he has no actual good reason for that specific team to form, other than "some random guy's power told me to find you all" and somehow that magically makes everything fall into place.

It's a creative story with some emotional punch at parts, and I thought the reveals of the lore were quite clever. Rational, though? Not by a long shot.
