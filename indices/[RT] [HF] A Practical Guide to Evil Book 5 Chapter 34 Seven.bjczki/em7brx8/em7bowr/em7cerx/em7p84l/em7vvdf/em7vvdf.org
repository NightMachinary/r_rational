I think it's the last thing Cat would want, given what she's trying to achieve with the Liesse Accords.

Also, that Creation isn't so easily fooled: some of the crowns laid at Cat's feet were swords. It's the absolute authority you're surrendering, not just the physical object. I'm sure an Uncrowned Queen's rule would be just as disastrous, after having surrendered her crown to Larat, as a crowned one's.
