Yeah, but when Aisha was talking about "the Prince's Graveyard", I was imagining, like, tens of princes coming to fight Cat, and running away in terror after she killed twelve of them, so that the common people would exaggerate and say "there were enough dead princes to fill a whole graveyard!", until "Prince's Graveyard" would become the de-facto accepted term to designate the battle.

Having a prince name the event, while it's taking place, to bitch about the fact that a single prince died (not even killed by Catherine herself) is kind of a step down from that. Same thing about the "Uncivil Wars", really.
