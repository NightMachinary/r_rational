I know he was desperate to get out of the story changes the Winter King and Summer Queen were about to lay on Arcadia, but I don't think Larat would offer a bargain that only freed him when he died. It's possible Cat intends to twist things that way, but I'd have felt it more if it had happened while she was still merged with Winter. Without that Fae tinge to her thoughts, I feel like it'll go down a little more like this:

Larat- "You fool! Don't you see that all along the final crown was to be yours? I have tricked you, once Queen of the Fae, and now I shall take the crown that would be mine again!"

Cat- "Okay. Here." * Proceeds to let Pilgrim, Saint, and Rogue Sorcerer beat the everliving tar out of Larat before he even finishes his victory ascension dance *
