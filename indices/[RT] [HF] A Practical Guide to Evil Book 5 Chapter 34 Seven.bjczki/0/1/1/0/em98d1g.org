My bet is against Cat since 1) her being the "special One" doesn't click for me and 2) there are several other candidates. Malicia is technically allied with the Dead King and was previously tracking ZeZe. Hasenbach can get involved through the Augur or Tyrant's scheming. The Dead King may still be a candidate depending on the particulars of his "apotheosis", etc. Also, the possibility for Hakram being the "One" according to Tyrant's scheme meant that we shouldn't dismiss non rulers/royals either.

I guess from Callow's story, it makes sense for Cat to abdicate for the Accord and Vivi's rise. But looking at the ritual to create their Fae court, I don't quite see the Crown of Callow being the One needed to "make a god so we can kill it".
