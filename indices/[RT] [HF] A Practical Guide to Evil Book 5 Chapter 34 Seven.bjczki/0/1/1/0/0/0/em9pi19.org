And Kairos, although I'm having trouble seeing him giving up his crown for the greater good.

Re: the poster you replied to not seeing Cat's crown as the special one, though, I'd like to point out that the "and one" was laid out as part of a fae bargain she entered into. It makes intuitive narrative sense to me for that one crown to be separated and special because it's hers, since fae bargains always seem to have that kind of 'gotcha'. I could totally see Larat doing his dramatic treacherous lieutenant reveal that the other crown had to be Cat's all along before she wheels out the plan they prepared for that exact eventuality, mostly involving her just handing it over without a fight and letting SoS beat the snot out of him mid-ascension.
