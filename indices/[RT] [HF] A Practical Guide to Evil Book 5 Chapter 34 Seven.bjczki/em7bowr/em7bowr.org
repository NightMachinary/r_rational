So Arnaud wasn't /the/ Assassin, just /an/ assassin. Was really hoping Tariq was gonna open a merciful can of whoopass on the princes there for a minute.

Anyone with a better memory than me know what the exact nature of Cat's promise to Larat was? 7 crowns and one, IIRC. She's got the 7 from the Proceran princes, and considering she apparently had an extra in her back pocket, I'm wondering what the one is supposed to be. The dramatic implication is that it's her own, but frankly, for all that we're holding the princes in contempt for not wanting to give up their crowns, I'm gonna be sorely disappointed in Cat if she essentially spared Rozala's crown for her own.
