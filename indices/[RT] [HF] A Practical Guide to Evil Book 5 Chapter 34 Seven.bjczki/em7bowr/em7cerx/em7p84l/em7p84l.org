I wonder if the act of giving up a crown could transition a Name, How great a Name for Cat would /The Uncrowned Queen/ be? It's seems likely that the name exists, there has to have been a ruler in the past who ruled their country despite lacking a Crown, even if there wasn't then there has to have been /stories/ about such a figure, and that is what really matters.
