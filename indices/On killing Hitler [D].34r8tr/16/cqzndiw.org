The thing is, while the world could change for the worst from the unintended consequences of preventing WWII and the Holocaust, those unintended consequences could make the world better as well, and the direct, intended consequences definitely would. It's not certain, but you could make an argument that you're more likely to make the world better than worse.

Whether killing Hitler would prevent those things is a different story, as is if risking your life and that of everyone you know in time paradoxes to make the world a better place is the right thing to do.
