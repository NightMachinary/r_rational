Well, that depends on what you consider changing history to /be/, ethically.

In most fiction, changing the future literally /changes/ individual people into their alternate-timeline versions; if it's a film, you can often physically see them transform into another person. Of course, they don't remember being another person; indeed, you kind of get the impression that there's no causal connection between them. It's arguable that turning a person into a different person and wiping their memory is the same as killing them.

And then there's the risk of butterflying away entire people so they're never born. It'd probably be the most realistic for every change to the past to completely erase /everyone/, but in fiction this is usually not the case. But there /will/ be some people, and fiction generally agrees that this should be treated as murder. (But the protagonists pretty much never notice this possibility unless it happens in front of them.)

Of course, it's difficult to have a consistent system where you can erase /yourself/ from history without creating some sort of crazy paradox shenanigans. But still, all your friends and family would be gone, at least for a certain value of "gone". They *certainly* would not remember you as you are.

In short: yes, you should absolutely figure out which enormous number of people you'd be murdering before changing history *at all*. But, at least in fiction (where timelines are "sticky" and tend to look the same unless forced otherwise) it might potentially win out in the utilitarian calculus.

(Oh, and if you want to preserve your home for whatever reason, visit the future and find out where Space Hitler will be born or the Space Zombie Plague will be unleashed.)
