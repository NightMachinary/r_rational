The biggest reason not to kill hitler is the risk of global thermonuclear war.

If it's a "reality get's overwritten, whatever change you make stays put" situation, then I'd avoid most such large-scale changes, regardless of my own self's existence, even if I knew the expected net benefit was a solid positive.

The reason is I'm risk-adverse. If I could flip a coin where heads would prevent 8 billion deaths (and safely and comfortably allow the world to support the population), and tails would kill all humans on earth, I wouldn't do it.

If I made such a big change, even if everything would /probably/ be better, there's still a small chance they'd get MUCH worse. If europe wasn't ravaged by WWII, then who knows how the cold war would have played out? We'd have LOTS of world powers with the resources to pursue a nuclear weapons project, not just 2 parties, and it's much harder to cooperate with 5 parties than just 2. It might have been just fine, but ANY large scale change could shake up the powderkeg of the cold war, which I'm disinclined to do.
