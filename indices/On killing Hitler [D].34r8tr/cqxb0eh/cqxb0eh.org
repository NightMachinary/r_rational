I would have to say that, insofar as I consider "allowing someone to die" to be the same as "killing someone" as the end result in the same: someone is dead because of a decision that you made-- insofar as this is true, if you had a time machine and did not prevent the Holocaust then you would be responsible for those millions of deaths.

Now, there are reasons to consider this to be a necessary price to be paid. You don't want to meddle with time willy-nilly after all, and if you aren't darned sure that your actions will result in an overall future then you're having to weigh these millions against those billions.

But in my moral system, at least, I couldn't justify leaving the Holocaust (or the plague, or the Spanish Flu, or the wars of the Mongols) alone /just/ for the sake of preserving my own life.
