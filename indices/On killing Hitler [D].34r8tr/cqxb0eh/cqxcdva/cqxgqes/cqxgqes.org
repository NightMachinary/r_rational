But they do not necessarily die as a result of my decisions. I apologize for not making that clearer.

What I was meaning was that, to me, "Decision to not act, which results in someone dying" is the same as "Decision to act, which results in someone dying." Pulling the lever to direct the trolley to kill someone is the same as not pulling it, /when I could/, and someone dying for that reason.
