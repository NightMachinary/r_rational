Leaving aside the intricacies of initiating a stable time loop wherein you not only exist, but have reason to travel back in time in the new timeline to kill a man, who, from your new self's perspective, has been dead the whole time, and to answer the question asked as directly as possible...

A) Anyone old enough to have already existed at the point when they plan to kill Hitler obviously wouldn't negate their own /birth/ directly, though altered events could still lead to their death before they time traveled. Unfortunately, this option gets less feasible every minute forwards they'd be traveling from, /and/ every minute backwards they'd be traveling.

B) Closing an existing loop /could/ be accomplished by pretty much anyone killing him when he died, as illustrated in the obligatory [[http://xkcd.com/1063/][xkcd]]
