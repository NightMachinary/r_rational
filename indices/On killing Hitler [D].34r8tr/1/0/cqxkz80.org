It depends on when you do it, of course. I will say this, though. Having recently read a lot of history about the Weimar republic, there are a few main points:

1. The treaty of Versailles had everyone from the communists to the conservatives frothing at the mouth with hatred against the injustice of the treaty. In retrospect... Yeah. Just about no one even tries to defend the treaty these days. It was incredibly unfair, and did a lot of damage to Weimar Germany. Which... was probably the point. France wanted Germany to never be a strong power again.

2. Germany's economical disasters during the 20s, from the French occupation of the Ruhr to the hyperinflation that followed the German passive resistance (Germany paid workers not to work in French-occupied areas, and paid by printing money -> exponentially accelerating inflation) and the accompanying wiping out of all life long savings and pensions to the world wide effects of the Great Depression (Which hit especially hard in Germany because they were dependent on US loans which were cancelled when the depression hit) to the never ending war reparations... The German economy was fucked, leading to incredible political turmoil, and a total of 40 political parties being represented in parliament over the course of only 13 years. None of them ever really having enough power to push strongly for the reforms they were arguing for, since everything required broad alliances. Leading to:

3. Rising discontent-voting on both the right and the left led to a very polarized parliament that couldn't agree on even fundamentals, leading to Rule By Emergency Decree, first rarely, then increasingly as a substitute for the parliamentary process. Between 1923-5 the social democrats invoked Emergency Decree on /136/ different occasions.

Was then dictatorship inevitable? Maybe. But the way it played out, it took a long series of perfectly aligned circumstances for the NSDAP to take over. Hitler never 'really' got a majority in the parliament. The November election 1932 gave the Nazis 33% of the vote. They formed a coalition government with the German National People's Party (Conservative/Nationalist), which still failed to achieve a majority. Hitler immediately called for new elections, but this time with one crucial difference. He gave many seats in the government to the Conservatives, but he kept for the Nazis the Minister of the Interior (Law enforcement) and GÃ¶ring as Chief of Police for Prussia (60% of Germany). The Nazis used these positions to harass communists and social democrats and sabotage their campaigns, arrest people in the middle of the street and then release them the same day, failing to investigate violence against the left. Etc, etc.

And then came the Reichstag Fire. The Nazis blamed the communists. The communists blamed the Nazis. The truth is probably that one insane communist with a documented history of mental illness set the fire alone. The coalition managed to push through an Emergency Decree to ban the communists, and worded it in such a way that, since the Nazis controlled the police, they not only shut down the communists completely, but also managed to justify shutting down large parts of the middle ranks of the social democrats, who weren't even accused of having any part in the fire.

Having banned the communists and knee capped the social democrats, they proceeded to cheat in the election (By forcing people to choose between voting anonymously for the sitting government or to proclaim their intention to vote for someone else, and other nice tricks). Thus they managed to get a majority in the parliament.

They didn't want that, however. They wanted /absolute/ power. And for that, they needed a two thirds majority to bypass the constitution. They achieved this, known as the Reichstag Fire Decree or the Enabling Act, by allying with the Vatican and the Catholic Centre Party. So yes, the democracy in Weimar Germany was looking pretty frail by the tie the Nazis emerged on the stage, but they also had to work pretty hard to wipe out the left and bypass the constitution.

The final speech exchange between Hitler and Otto Wels (Leader of the Social Democrats) before the death of German democracy is available with subtitles on youtube. I find it horrifying, depressing and extremely interesting to listen to. The catcalling and jeering as Wels holds his last speech, and then the incredibly well spoken Hitler and the thunderous applause. (Can't find it both with subtitles and without the background music, but [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SimPsL7LYHs][here is part one with subtitles.]])
