Honestly, I'd say killing hitler is a waste, for a number of reasons:

- Its debatable whether it would avert the holocaust, or even WWII
- If a time machine can transport you physically through time, you can do so much more. Like preventing the fall of rome, preventing plagues, or even pulling [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ow4hy/you_are_now_the_monarch_of_a_small_european/][something like this]] off.
