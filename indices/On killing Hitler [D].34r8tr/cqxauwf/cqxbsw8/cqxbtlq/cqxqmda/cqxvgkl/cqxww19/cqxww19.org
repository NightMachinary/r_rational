On the one hand, the population of Europe back then was much smaller and the death of feudalism meant that many, many more people were born into much better lives than actually died. From a utilitarian POV it was probably a good exchange.

There may well have been better ways to achieve it -- the Mongols might have done. They killed a lot of people in the sense that they wiped out entire cities, but they did that so that other cities would surrender peacefully instead of fighting and getting lots of people killed. At the height of their power (under Ghengis) the Mongol Empire was a very safe place, with something that looked a lot like an appellate court system and at least some tech development. I don't know how much room for advancement there was for non-Mongols, which might have been difficult. The only problem is that it was mostly a cult of personality and when Ghengis died the place went downhill fast. Four generations later the Empire was gone, although the Ottoman Empire (one of its successor states) lasted for a goodly while.

Alternatively, if one lord had decided there was advantage to himself in developing industry that might have worked, maybe. It would have been very much a company town setup, so I don't know how much it would really have let the serfs advance.

I'm sure there's other ways, but that's what springs to mind.
