My understanding is that the Black Death was mostly responsible for the end of feudalism.

Before the Death went through, there was such an oversupply of labor that it had basically no value -- you couldn't run from your lord because there was nowhere to run /to/ that was really different, and another lord had no incentive to accept you and piss off your current lord. There was also no incentive to come up with labor-saving devices, and not enough leisure time to do it anyway.

When the Death went through it killed off something like 30-50% of the population of Europe. In its wake there weren't enough people to get everything done, so technology started advancing in order to make people more efficient. People moved into cities to put together the population density necessary to get work done, and the resulting creation of a middle class meant that serfs suddenly had a place to run to, as well as having value to their lords.

Despite all that, I don't advocate releasing a plague.
