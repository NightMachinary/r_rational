  note that any major backwards time travel is a moral travesty for erasing an entire timeline

Note that any choice is an equivalent travesty (see [[http://dresdencodak.com/2009/04/19/onald-creely/][related Dresden Codak]]).

It is unclear to what extent the past "will not have happened" if you time travel to before that point, and less clear still what kinds of "will not have happened" we should be morally offended by.

If timelines with time travel are retroactively erased, then if you flip a coin and only time travel if it lands heads, you will always see it lands tails, because heads-timelines are erased. By extension, you will never be in the position of choosing that your timeline disappears. Either you go because this doesn't cause a paradox because the time travel is already part of your universe, or you don't go. (This would be the mechanism of GR wormholes through time, probably).

If futures from the moment of time traveler are erased, non-time travellers will always see would-be time travellers fail, in a way which is exactly homologous to quantum immortality. And like with quantum immortality it's ambiguous whether we should care (especially since there will be no-one to mourn us): it's physically identical to zero subjective probability of time travel succeeding according to people who don't time travel.

If time travel does not erase the past or the future, then it is not so much changing the past as traveling to an alternate one. There will be a universe where you leave, never to be seen again, and a world where you arrive and are never born. Both universes are mechanically identical to ours and thus contain qualia as much as ours. We can therefore create universes, and have a moral duty to create every possible universe which has positive utility. (A subset: sending fAI with every possible to every GR::event in the universe).
