The /optimal/ solution for a would-be Hero of Time is to be patient and don't lose humanity until we get our stuff figured out (as in, we won't accidentally go extinct and we can't be killed by biological disease and aging processes).

Time travel should be reserved for reversing humanity-ending crises - note that any major backwards time travel is a moral travesty for erasing an entire timeline, so it should only be used in extreme cases.

When our species is ready for the End of Times, we put the entire population into a gigantic time machine. Then we go back in time, second by second, and save each soul right before they are lost.

Once you've gone sufficiently far back and there's no beings you want to save left, you and every other person that ever lived has been saved forever.
