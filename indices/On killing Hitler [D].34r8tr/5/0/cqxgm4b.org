- Step 1: Own a time machine; acquire or decide upon an ethical obligation to save every life that can possibly be saved with this new technology.

- Step 2: Convince the society of which you are a part to commit all resources to the plan (some details omitted in this stage of the plan). Your extraordinary effort starts at the beginning - however far into history you care to still call our ancestors human, you now need to be there to save every life that can be saved.

- Step 3: Channel all resources of the present into providing food, shelter, medicine, defence against violence, and "Hey don't do that, you'll get into an accident and die" tips to every human who ever lived. After each intervention consult the modified version of history to see if any unintended consequences have added new deaths to the record that now need to be prevented.

- Step 4: People of the present start to suffer and die through poverty caused by lack of resources, all of them having been funnelled into the past. Don't worry though, people from the future will soon begin showing up to help /you/ out, using the theoretically infinite resources of the indefinitely distant future.

- Step 5: Modifications to the past will, by making changes, be erasing people from the timestream. Consult your personal morality to see whether you also need to save /them/, and if there's any logically coherent way to do so.

- Step 6: Abandon the project for fear of universe-consuming paradox, and instead start working on a device that will generate and 3D-print all logically possible persons in sequence, so that even if they died, everyone eventually gets a second chance.
