Causality is....odd. The butterfly effect is potent, and there are so many things we can't predict. It's quite possible that every step you take changes who lives and who dies over the next twenty four hours. That doesn't make you any more or less responsible for those deaths. Does being aware of which step does what really change this? Of course, all we can do is use what knowledge we have to be the best people we can be, so I suppose it does. But what do we say to uncertainty then? You have this machine, and going back may change things. Or maybe Germany, without the bad PR generated by some of Hitler's more radical movements, is made stronger by allies that don't turn on it, leading to a larger, more devestating war? Who can say? And if this time machine thing is a one time only option, then it becomes very dangerous. You'll feel guilty for the rest of your life, if you go back and cause the deaths of even more millions of people, but you may also usher in a utopia? Who can say? Personally, from a practical viewpoint, I don't believe it's sensible to go back and change things. As of right now, the world isn't perfect, but I think we're trending upwards, overall, and we are much improved from even just the last few years. Who's to say what changes you will enact? And while the Holocaust did suck (understatement of the century), the billions you erase from existence by changing the course of human history would make you, ironically, much worse than Hitler, depending on how you choose to view human life and what it means.
