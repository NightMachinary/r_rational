I wrote a short story a while back about a travel agency responsible for sending people back to kill Hitler (branching model). They could help you out by getting you the right sorts of clothing to fit in, information and materials to rapidly advance technology, historical research to let you stop WWI or WWII, etc. It unfortunately doesn't seem like it's up to snuff.

But I don't think that going back in time to kill Hitler, or to stop any single atrocity. /Hitler/ probably isn't the target if you want to find the single biggest points of intervention, but maybe you have emotional reasons for doing so, or maybe your utility functions are arranged differently from mine such that stopping someone else is what's important.

Edit: A slightly cleaned up version of that story [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vzvZk4bzqN3LJEaxc48mqF8hPLdbT0zeAfjSG2aki6s/edit?usp=sharing][can be read here.]]
