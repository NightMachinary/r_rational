I am American, but over the past two years or so I've been steadily moving in the direction of "violence looks an awful lot like a black swan that only makes more trouble for the next generation." Possibly because I /am/ American, so I got to look at our history and think, "Hey, wait, was this problem caused the short-sighted violent 'solution' that we employed in another problem we encountered before it?" over and over and /over/ again until a pattern started to emerge.

No Bulgarian Jews were sent to concentration camps, but it was not because the Bulgarians employed armed resistance.
