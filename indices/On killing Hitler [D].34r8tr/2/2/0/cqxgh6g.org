This is the primary barrier for writing "time travel to a historical era"-type fiction. Or even just historical fiction generally. It's really, really easy to let anachronisms slip in that will either break immersion for your more knowledgeable readers, or make the piece "feel" inauthentic. That goes triple for if you're writing about a historical figure.
