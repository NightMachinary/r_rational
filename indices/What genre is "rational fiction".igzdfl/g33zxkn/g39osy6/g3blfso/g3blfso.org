Story driven - think of a story where the plot is aiming to hit certain high points or events. It's common in action or thriller type stories where there's no point to is if we don't see the MC show off their final form at the end.

Character driven - slice-of-life is probably the prototypical example genre. Everything happens because character interactions or the characters' personalities make it so. If the planned plot has to take a back seat for the characters to shine then so be it.

A character driven focus with a story driven plot is kind of a contradiction on the surface so I understand the confusion. The story is either story driven or character driven. But in reality all stories are a bit of both and Ratfic doesn't allow that excuse. These stories are the kind where certain beats need to happen (thus story driven), but since everything must be character driven, the plot needs to happen organically without idiot balls, or the other nonsense some thriller writers resort to.
