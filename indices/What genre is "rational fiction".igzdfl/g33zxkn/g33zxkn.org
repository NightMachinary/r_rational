It's none of them. Or a subset of each and every one of them is also a subset of rational fiction. Except things like technical manuals. Those might not be rational since they tend to lack characters.

If you wanted to only use literary terms, ratfic could be described as stories with an extreme character driven focus, with particular attention to how the character(s) perceive[s] the world and what kind of thought process lies behind their decision making. Yet the stories tend to have a story-driven plot without ever handwaving the characterization for the sake of the story.
