I'd say heist fiction very often relies on weird framing devices and lying to the audience, neither of which seem compatible with rational fiction to me. Really, I've heard rational fiction is a /flavor/ rather than a genre and I think that's more fitting. You can have a rational romance novel just like a rational heist one.
