Rational fiction isn't a genre, it's a genre modifier. You have rational heist stories, just like you have rational fantasy stories, rational sci-fi stories or rational westerns or whatever.

Also, I'm confused by what you are proposing, are you saying that (for instance) HPMoR, Mother of Learning and Pokemon: Origin of Species are heist stories? If so, I think you're operating on a different definition of that genre than I do.
