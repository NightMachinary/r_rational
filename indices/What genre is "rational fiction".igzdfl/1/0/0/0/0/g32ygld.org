Inception definitely is a heist movie though. Planting something vs taking something are at that point details to the overall genre.

But in HPMoR it's the antagonist doing the heist, and they definitely aren't doing it as their on screen focus. If Inception was the story of that Asian guy going after his futuristic business and then towards the end he gets ambushed, something gets planted in his mind and he has to live with the consequences for the latter chapters then that wouldn't be a heist movie.

And government infiltration or coup stories can be heists, but they aren't automatically by their nature. A heist movie is primarily about the how and has some form of plan execution as its structural center (wether successful or not and wether the plan is known to the viewer/reader or not varies). If the movie is a biopic/drama about the life of a guy that really needs money and then towards the end he witnesses a bank robbery and uses the opportunity to steal from the bank robbers with some quick thinking that is not a heist movie, despite something like a heist happening within it.
