Of those you mentioned I've read HPMoR:

Quirrel's goal is to break into the chamber of secrets, so his story is that of a heist. One could argue about what Harry ultimately wants to do post HPMoR.

I remember him analyzing the galleon and silver exchange rates, about how he could buy silver cheaply and then smelt it into more expensive galleons. Harry basically acts like a stock broker here, the Wolf of Diagon Alley. Imo brokers are just robbers in suits but I get that not everyone agrees with this definition.

Looking to achieve world domination (a common end goal in rational fic) and planning to do a a coup are also similar in structure to a heist: You steal the leadership of a country. This usually requires careful planning and a rational look at how the government of your story works. Most rational stories I've read employ building of political alliances; basically selecting your heist team.

I could probably draw up the parallels better if I gave it some more thought. I've been enjoying everyone's input here so far.
