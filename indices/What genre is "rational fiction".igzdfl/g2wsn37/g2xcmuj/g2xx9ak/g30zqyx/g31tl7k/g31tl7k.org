I admit I'm reaching quite far with this comparison. I'm basing my generalizations on this video essay I watched last year: [[https://youtu.be/z__DyGEvhM0][What Heist Movies Taught Me About Film Making]]

The video brings up Inception as an example of a heist movie.. and they don't actually steal something in the movie! They want to plant a fake memory instead.

So is the act of stealing physical coins critical to a heist movie? How much of the plot can you change until the characters and power dynamics become unrecognizable?

Idk I just find it interesting to compare genres as a fanfiction writer. Like it's easier to adapt a canon story into a Highschool AU fanfiction, if the original power dynamics already resemble that of a Highschool. If you have a rational protagonist who loves planning, you're gonna have a much easier time adapting them into a heist AU, instead of a flowershop AU, that doesn't seem OOC or crackish.

I'd love to hear your thoughts in turn! You probably have a different view on this than me.
