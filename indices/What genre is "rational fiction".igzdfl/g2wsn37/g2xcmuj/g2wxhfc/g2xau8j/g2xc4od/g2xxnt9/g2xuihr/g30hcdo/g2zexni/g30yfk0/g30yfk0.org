Now, a 90% discount seems excessive. 50% or even 70% I've seen, under really special conditions such as products way past the expiry date or defects, bought in bulk... But if you say so... I guess it also depends on the product. If it's the kind of product that has a lot of markup from the get-go, and there's a reason for it, I guess one could reach such an high discount. I'm still kinda skeptical, but I won't outright say it's not possible anymore.
