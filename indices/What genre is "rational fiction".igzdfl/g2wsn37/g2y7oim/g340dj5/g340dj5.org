That's because typical/stereotypical romance writers and readers are too turned on to pay attention to detail. It wouldn't take much to turn most romance into something rational: just draw out the growing attraction phase and include lots of details of the characters noticing things about each other while they try to focus on other things. But you know, mention and move on, not 3 paragraphs about the shape of his navel as he bends over to pick up a cat.
