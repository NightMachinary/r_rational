ractional fiction, or rational literature in its entirety, is simply making the premise of the story and stick with it in a way other books fail to do. So, in case of a world with different rules from our own, make the rules once and stick with them.

Take the Harry Potter books. There were so many inconsistencies.

Like the Potters being their own secret keepers instead of allowing Peter Pettigrew to betray them.

Or wands from Ollivander cost 7 galleons and a single unicorn hair costs 10 (which makes no sense in economics, why would you make wands with a loss, not even breaking even?!?)

Or how the Marauders Map was in F&G Weasley from the very first book, meaning they would have friggin' KNOWN that there was something wrong with Quirrel having two names (Tom. M. Riddle, and hiw own), and even if they didn't know who the hell Riddle was, which might as well be possible given that most didn't know, they would have at least asked someone about it, and probably the name would have reached Dumbledore's hears and the entire first year would have been completely different. Or the second, given that they'd see their sister Ginny make some strange things, like going to the friggin' chamber of secrets of friggin' Slytherin, and slaughtering Hagrid's chickens and other stuff. Or the third, where they would have seen that their brother's rat pet had a name tag, which other animals didn't, which would have again brought them to raise some question and Dumbedore would have heard of it and yada yada yada.

Speaking of the first year, why would Dumbledore not simply Apparate from school to ministry of magic and back instead of flying and giving Quirrelmort his chance at doing damage? Plot holes, plot holes everywhere.

Why not use the Veritaserum in court against death eaters and ask them who the hell where all the others? Damn, there's a bunch of ways to end the war between Voldemort and the magical Britain at least a thousand times, in both directions.

There's other dozens of those in HP, which is why I'm taking HP as an example, because it's so blatant that one cannot not see it.

So, to answer the question.

A rational approach to literature is

1) To make the rules of the world inside the story, /all the rules/, right off the bat (even if the characters don't know them all, and the public reading the book also not knowing them, the author does). And everything will happen within those rules.

2) All the characters will make decisions that make /sense,/ given the contest, the information they have and the objective or objectives they have. Characters don't even need to be intelligent or even slightly smart for that. They need to make sense.

3) Not really a requirement, but it adds so much. Some characters know about biases, cognitive science and science in it's entirety even, and explain how something is a good idea even if is counter intuitive at first, or some characters are really intelligent and are able to take really really good decisions or to understand things from few pieces of informations in a way that is entirely possible and believable from that character with that information. Detective Holmes sometimes is borderline because he manages to do that with really, really too few pieces of information. Something like that, but less extreme.

4) The story makes sense. Mysteries in it could potentially be solved by the reader himself if he's paying attention enough, and later the character solves that mistery with the same amount of information. No events of characters solving seemingly unsolvable problems in impossible ways. Characters try to use the rules of the world in every possible way, trying to exploit those rules to their advantage as much as possible, like people do in real life with the law. No stereotypes for the sake of it if it doesn't make sense for a character to be that way. The world in the book looks exactly like the real world would be if the rules where the ones in the book.
