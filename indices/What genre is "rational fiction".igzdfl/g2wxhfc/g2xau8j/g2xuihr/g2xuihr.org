1) The Ollivander buying in bulk could hold, but even considering this true, the whole economy of the wizards sometimes is simply inconsistent. There's more than this example, trust me. And buying in bulk doesn't net you a 30% discount, it doens't work that way in economy. Trust me, I studied this shit. And you're not counting the cost of the wood and the work to actually make the wand. Whatever you need to do to make a wand, it's secret, so you'd expect a serious markup. Like, the Unicorn's hair would need to be sold to him at less than 2 galleons, TOP.

2) Potters as secret keepers, in the seventh book bill says he's his own secret keeper for his house, and some other weasley made the same in his house, don't remember which. It indicated that it's indeed possible to be your own secret keeper.

3) Might be right, but given that the rat was first Percy's and then Ron's, they had plenty of time to find out who the hell this unknown Peter Pettigrew was, with or without help from others. Wouldn't be even too strange to ask someone if they knew who this apparently random name was, and once they new, the ball would have begun to roll. In a really really bad direction for Pettigrew, I might add.

4) Dumbledore could go outside the schools grounds, just outside, apparate near the ministerium, find out that he wasn't required at all, then do the reverse. minutes at most, instead of the hours required by flying. No excuse in this one.

5) Definitely impossible for them to have a 5th magical Amendment. They used the veritaserum on Barty Crouch Junior, without process, and no consequences there. The mark didn't do shit too. You could Obliviate yourself if you knew you were going to take the potion, but if you were captured, the wand was taken from you and you'd have no way to prepare for Veritaserum. Same for Confundus. I don't know if Occlumancy blocks Veritaserum in canon, but even if it does, not all Death Eaters were Occlumens. Even if some were, administer the potion to all those you capture, and confront their stories, and find which of them told a lie, and you can trust the rest. Veritaserum was one example of what the government could have done. If you've read HPMOR you know the shit that everyone could have done better. HP is a book I loved, and love, but it's as far from rationality as the other side of the universe is to us. I know there are no sides, but you get it :P
