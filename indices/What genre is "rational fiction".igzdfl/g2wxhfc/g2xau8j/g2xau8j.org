I agree that HP was full of holes, but I can come up with fixes for the ones you propose.

- 7-galleon wands, 10-galleon unicorn hairs: Ollivander gets a discount for buying in bulk.
- Potters as secret keepers: The spell doesn't allow the protected people to be their own secret keepers.
- Map: F&G didn't mention it to anyone because then they would have had to explain where they got the information.
- Dumbledore not Apparating: The school is warded to prevent Apparition in.
- Veritaserum and Death Eaters: Magical-world 5th Amendment? A high-level spell or ritual to defeat Veritaserum. (Occlumancy?) Self-targeted Confundus charm to delete that memory, used when captured? Maybe that's a feature of the Dark Mark?

Still, even if I can patch over these specific ones there are still a gazillion more, so you're right in general.
