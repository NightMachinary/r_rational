I think what you're describing is competence-porn, which both heist fiction and rational fiction are guilty of. To quote [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetencePorn][TvTropes]],

#+begin_quote
  It's the thrill of watching talented people plan, banter, and work together to solve problems. It's not just "characters being good at a thing," particularly if that thing is fighting---otherwise the term would apply to virtually all fiction---but specifically about using cleverness and hard work.

Which seems to apply to a great number of both rationalist fiction and heist fiction.

I wouldn't say this describes rationalist fiction as it includes some stories--such as Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Stone, Star Trek, and The West Wing--which are certainly not rational, and misses a few stories--such as Three Worlds Collide, Shadows of the Limelight, Legacy of the Goddess, R!Animorphs, etc.--which certainly are (although, as I think of it, a few of those may actually be competence porn if seen in the right light... huh... at the very least the trope is still too inclusive to serve as a genera-identifier).

Edit: ok I'm pretty much convinced that all rational fiction is some flavor of competence porn. I guess you could write a rational[ist] fiction without the banter or hard work aspects, but it wouldn't be very good.
