I didn't mean that's a bad thing. Just about all of my favorite books, stories, movies, and television shows can be categorized as competence-porn.

Maybe when I said both genres were guilty of it I was indicating the wrong connotation. I meant only that it's a prevalent trope in most of those kinds of stories.

Also, competence-porn has a negative connotation in some circumstances. But there's no better, and more widely used name for it, and it's fairly descriptive of a whole class of stories. Usually the term is used only when the trope execution is done badly, and that's a shame. But in this instance I'm using it as a neutral trope identifier where it only serves as a substitute for it's definition.

Edit: I usually dislike questions like “what genera is [X]” type questions and discussions. But this one has turned out to be an exception to the rule, since before I was unaware that competence-porn was such a prevalent trope in all my favorite fiction. I can now use this to find more things I will likely enjoy.
