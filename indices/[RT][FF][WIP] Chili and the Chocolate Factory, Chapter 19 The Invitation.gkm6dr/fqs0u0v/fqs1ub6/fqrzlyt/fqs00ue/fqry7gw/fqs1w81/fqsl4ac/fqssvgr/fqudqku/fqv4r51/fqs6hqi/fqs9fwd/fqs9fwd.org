I just binged through this fanfic yesterday.... and today I watched Snowpiercer followed by a YouTube video explaining how Snowpiercer is a sequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, then I saw this fanfic updated. Oh and last week I read a roleplay of Matilda getting Isekai'd into Years of the Trees Valinor and meeting Feanor as a child. It's an interesting juxtaposition going on inside my head...

So yeah this chapter was great, except I want more. Is that ungrateful? Sorry not sorry, because this story is so good I would always want more. Please don't kick me off the tour into the rationalized Roald Dahl universe.
