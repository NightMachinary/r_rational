An extremely minor quibble on the naming of the islands of New Zealand - You would never say "took the ferry to South Island". You would say "took the ferry to the South Island". In speach they really are treated like descriptions rather than names. It's super weird.\\
Other than that very minor point, absolutely everything in this chapter about the naming scheme for New Zealand is completely 100% true and had me laughing harder than I ought to admit.
