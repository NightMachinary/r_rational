  Mr. Fantasticer Fox's true identity was a secret, even from Marama's family, and whenever he came over to see Marama they met in Mahuika's room. It was the most secure room in the house, since no one aside from Mahuika ever went there, with a one Marama margin of error.

Does this mean that Mr. Fantasticer Fox is either Marama or Mahuika?
