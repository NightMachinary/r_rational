  The Auckland Islands are a tiny archipelago in New Zealand. The largest island in the Auckland Islands is Auckland Island. Auckland, the most populous city in New Zealand, is not located on Auckland Island, which is in the Auckland Islands. No one lives on the Auckland Islands.

I was very surprised to find with a quick Google that this is actually true.

What's more, one of the Auckland Islands is called Disappointment Island. If that detail had been included I might not have googled at all, as it would have assumed it was all 100% made up.

What even is reality.
