I actually wrote a rational transhumanist version of MUSE's "Map of the Problematique", as well as several other rational/rationalist songs, but after extensive research and what felt like traversing multiple footnote labyrinths, I have no idea where or how to get them performed without getting them stolen or never getting heard. It seems like my best bet is to start a band, but I don't know how to do that.
