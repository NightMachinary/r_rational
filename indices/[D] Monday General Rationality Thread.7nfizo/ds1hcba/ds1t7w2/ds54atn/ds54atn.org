  Reading handwriting is hard for AI still, although I've seen demos. Reading print is definitely available but I haven't really seen it outside of Google Translate. This could probably be achieved in the next couple of years though, especially if it's only print, not handwriting.

Try Microsoft's SeeingAI, which reads print better than the KNFB reader, and is experimenting with handwriting.
