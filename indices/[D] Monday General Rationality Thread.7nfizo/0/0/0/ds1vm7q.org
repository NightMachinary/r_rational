Much of your not-acheived category is fairly borderline.

  The watches are here, so this wasn't entirely wrong. The real issue is that all of those things would cost too much and give too little benefit
#+end_quote

Closer than you might expect! [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01y6bR6ETpA][PragmatIC has some cool tech.]]

#+begin_quote
  Same issue with cost/benefit. Body LANS seems to basically be Bluetooth though.
#+end_quote

Not rings and pins, but watches, smartphones, earphones, etc.. LAN is mostly replaced by global networks, so although optimistic in some respects, this is too conservative in others.

  Stuff is stored on the cloud instead. Also virtual reality is only at early stages now. Also virtual reality environments (so far) don't really exist.
#+end_quote

Most people have local document stores, and VR was said to be early stage so I'd give this a pass. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1330&v=IlADpD1fvuA][Google are also talking about 10x improvements in VR in only a few years.]]

  Speech recognition isn't up to scratch.
#+end_quote

True, but it's also looking ~5 years away from near perfection. I doubt we'll ever see it replace text input, but that's more because text is actually damn convenient.

#+begin_quote
  We have the technology, although it's not great, and it mainly hasn't caught on because of privacy concerns.
#+end_quote

We have the technology though!

#+begin_quote

  - Three dimensional chips are commonly used

  Not the case afaik, but I'm not sure why.
#+end_quote

This depends on the original claim, but 3D stacking is used in places (especially memories) and it's getting more common. The main issue is thermal regulation, but there are places where it works.

#+begin_quote
  Students from all ages do have a very thin and light portable computer (smartphones, chromebooks, laptops), but the rest is inaccurate, probably due in large part to speech recognition. The Wii shows us that the pencil device could possibly work, but it just isn't that efficient.
#+end_quote

People interact with smartphones primarily through speech and touch input. This is too conservative, but otherwise spot on.

#+begin_quote

  - Intelligent courseware has emerged as a common means of learning, recent controversial studies have shown that students can learn basic skills such as reading and math just as readily with interactive learning software as with human teachers.

  Studies haven't shown this.
#+end_quote

OK, but the first part is right.

#+begin_quote
  [disabilities]
#+end_quote

Yes, though much of this is simply down to the disabled population not being a large economic market, unfortunately.

#+begin_quote
  This theoretically could happen now, but I haven't seen it deployed yet. Main issue is that people hardly ever talk on the telephone nowadays.
#+end_quote

It's used with textual mediums over browsers. Speech to speech is still mostly offline and low quality (eg. YouTube), but auto-translate is common for online messages.
