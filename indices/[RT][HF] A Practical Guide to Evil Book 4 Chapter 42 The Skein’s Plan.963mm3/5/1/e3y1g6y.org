The situations are quite different.

The ratlings might be powerful but they're a known quantity. A soldier fighting against them will know exactly what to expect because there's a history of doing it going back to before the Principate.

Meanwhile, the Legions are exactly the opposite. In the assault on the Vales they: redirected a mountain lake and peppered the crusade with goblinfire and munitions, dropped a mountain on the northern pass and used a dragon twice.

It's a different type of war as they're fighting against an intelligent opponent, they're not defending from a wall and their army is primarily composed of levies and mercenaries - not professionals.
