But they do use named, fortifications, mages and defend from walls... A sentence in which these aren't mentioned doesn't mean these things don't happen.

The Saint of Swords is known as the Smiling Iron among the Chain of Hunger so Named definitely do come up there on occasion. She also went "up north" to perfect her craft - three guesses as to where that is.

The Ancient Ones are specifically referred to as siege weapons and in the quote you've referred to, the rattlings are trying to breach a wall, so they definitely do defend from walls...

  She'd followed him unflinchingly when he'd charged two hundred cataphracts into the meat of a ratling army of thousands, backwhen the Longtooth Lord had tried to breach the walls of Hannoven.

Like, this sentence doesn't sum up the entire war doctrine of the Lycaonese - it's just a vivid memory. For all you know, they charged and the next moment Saint killed all of the ratlings with a single swing.
