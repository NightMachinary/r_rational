  Ah yes, all those military mages that they definitively have in procer, and totally take part in cavalry charges...

From [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/04/11/interlude-stairway/][Interlude: Stairway]]:

  Though in Lycaonese lands spellcasters were prized, for their sorcery was a mighty thing wielded from walls against the ratling hordes, the southerners had a more complicated relationship with spellslingers.
#+end_quote

You'll note I've said the Lycaonese use mages, not how they are used.

As for Named, again, I've simply stated they do fight against the Chain of Hunger. The quote you've used shows this happens rarely, which is fine as it doesn't contradict my point that it does indeed happen.

  Procer doesn't really use seige weaponry. Seriously, look at their engagements shown in warden.
#+end_quote

I've not said anything about their use of siege weaponry but ok, this is mostly true inasmuch as you can lump Procer into a single entity.

  That's not to say they don't make heavy use of the walls (they do), but even before the civil war (fought, as is standard for procer, far away from any city walls) they had plenty of experience fighting without fixed fortifications.
#+end_quote

/You/ have actually said they don't use walls two posts above:

#+begin_quote
  They don't defend from behind a wall against ratlings, as little as one would actually do against an ancient one.
#+end_quote

Which is the point I was replying to. I'm glad I've managed to change your mind. The fact the Lycaonese fight against ratlings from their walls is mentioned several times, particularly in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/prologue-2/][Prologue 2]]. I haven't said anything about how they fight other principalities, though you're right in that these battles are mostly thought on open fields on account of the princes not really fighting for keeps.

  Seriously, what is it with people and trying to correct me without actually reading the text.
#+end_quote

I know, right?
