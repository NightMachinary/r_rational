Did you not read the chapter I literally godsamn quoted at you? They didn't hide behind the wall, he charged into the army of ratlings, and the horned lord, with his own army. Names were not involved; we know Klaus disdains them, and if he had to rely on them for crises he's practical enough that he'd be singing a different tune.

I'm talking about Black vs Klaus in the mountains. Not black's sack prover plan, although that has other issues.

Part 2: cat has demonstrated a level of power that makes armies laughable as a threat to her. She was literally only stopped from soloing the proceran invasion force by opposing named; the guide tries to say that soldiers are super able to kill them, but much like the claim “heroes are OP” it only happens offscreen.

If callow can be said to fight off invasions alll the time ( and it has in story) despite often spending far longer than that between attempts, then it's entirely fair to refer to the lords attacking the principate the same way.

E: adding on to part 1, names and mages are super rare in the principate, and in addition to klaus' statements about not relying on named, we know that he didn't need any to take on the horned lord. His force was 200 heavy cavalry when he fought horned lord + ratling army.
