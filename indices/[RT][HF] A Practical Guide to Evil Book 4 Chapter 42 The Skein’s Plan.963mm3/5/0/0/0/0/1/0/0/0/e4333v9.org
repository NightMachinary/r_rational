“Wolofite records agree with the Lord Warlock,” she said. “There are scrolls dating back to Triumphant's campaign in the region that speak of a time in the life of their kind called the ‘metamorphosis', where ratlings will transition from bipedal beings of observed sapience into the animalistic large creatures called the Ancient Ones. The few of those beings that manage to consume enough quickly enough while in that state are speculated to undergo a second metamorphosis into the elusive Horned Lords of lore.”

“Those Horned Lords,” Vivienne said. “Back on two feet, about sixty feet high, antler-like pairs spouting from the head, capable of human speech?”

Unless it named itself as a ratling, and they remembered that when it hit ancient one, /and/ called it that? That seems like a huge stretch to me, especially since she's callign it that in a monologue years later, but doesn't have any name for the ancient ratling in the narration.
