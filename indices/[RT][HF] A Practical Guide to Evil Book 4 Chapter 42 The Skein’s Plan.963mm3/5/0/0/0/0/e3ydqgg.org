The principate does:

“The Lycaonese woman crept softly to Klaus Papenheim's tent, where a single candle still burned. Twenty years, she'd fought for the prince. She'd followed him unflinchingly when he'd charged two hundred cataphracts into the meat of a ratling army of thousands, backwhen the Longtooth Lord had tried to breach the walls of Hannoven.”

They're able to fight off these ratling lords with soldiers, when two of the strongest named coming out praes in recent times have difficulty even handling a shadow of one? Like, they should be looking at all the armies of orcs, and saying “thank heavens its not the ratlings.”
