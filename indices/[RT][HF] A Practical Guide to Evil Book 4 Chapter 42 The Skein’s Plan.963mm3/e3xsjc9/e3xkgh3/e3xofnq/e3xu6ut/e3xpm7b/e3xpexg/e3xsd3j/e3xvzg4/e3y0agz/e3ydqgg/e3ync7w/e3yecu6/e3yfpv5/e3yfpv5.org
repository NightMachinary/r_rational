  two of the strongest named coming out praes in recent times have difficulty even handling a shadow of one

The Skein is anything but weak though. It is a shadow of what it once was, but "what it once was" is a demigod. Save for Edward VII (who's likely there because the Dead King was feeling pissy), every revenant we've known by Name or backstory was an A-lister. I strongly doubt that the average Horned Lord is able to casually /eat/ a magical dimension created by a Fae Queen.
