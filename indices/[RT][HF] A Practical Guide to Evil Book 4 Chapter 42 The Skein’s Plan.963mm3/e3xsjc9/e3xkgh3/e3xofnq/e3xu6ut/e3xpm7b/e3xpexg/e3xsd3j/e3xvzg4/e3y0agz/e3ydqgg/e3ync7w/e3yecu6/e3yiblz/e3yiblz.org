“She'd followed him unflinchingly when he'd charged two hundred cataphracts into the meat of a ratling army of thousands, backwhen the Longtooth Lord had tried to breach the walls of Hannoven. She'd pulled him out of the mouth of an Ancient One when the tower-sized monstrous rat had been about to bite clean through his plate, the year after.”
