That seems like baseless supposition. They certainly don't call this one out as being any stronger than normal, and beyond that I'm extremely skeptical that A listers like the ones the dead king has are above average as revenants.

Even if this is stronger than average, though, and is still stronger than average afterwords, that still shouldn't matter. Klaus Papenheim is able to take on and an entire army of ratlings and a Horned Lord with 200 horsemen (no named, no mages worth the named, and priests who can't kill even if they're evil). The fact that his forces are struggling with black after a showing like that is a joke; if you're able to go toe to toe with godzilla, the fact that your lines break when facing the legions is ridiculous.
