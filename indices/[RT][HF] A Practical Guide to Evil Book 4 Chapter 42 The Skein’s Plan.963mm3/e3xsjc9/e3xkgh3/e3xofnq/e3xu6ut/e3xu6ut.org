How do you stop a Seer from weaving plots that interfere with your assassination scheme? By getting into an extended brawl with it.

I'll note that the Skein said the options were sending Malicia to +Cat's party (Cat, Masego,+ Vivienne, +Akua)+ or to Hakram. Indrani is unaccounted for. She probably has no orders or plan at all (not that she would follow them anyway) but she'll happen onto Malicia and go "don't mind if I do". The undefeated Fuck-The-Augur style of the East, designed by the Dread Empress and now used against her.

On a completely unrelated note, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seKaU-qQuts][Akua as a helpful fairy makes too much sense]].

EDIT: re-reading this, the Skein never mentions leading Malicia to Catherine. He says "The Empress escapes, yet dies to a blade of stolen moonlight." The only person with such a blade is Vivienne, who just acquired it from Spellblade. So Thief is actually gone to do her things, not just hiding. And the Skein doesn't seem to consider Catherine escaping his trap to be a serious proposition.
