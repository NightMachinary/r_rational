Yeah, the trick here is most likely that while the Skien is fighting them he isn't actively manipulating the labyrinth.

Thief is inside the threefold reflection and unaccounted for. Archer is somewhere, probably geting let in via the staff entrance by Thief right now.

The many complex plans with a convergent end point was a trap to get the Skien to notice the convergent end point and stop trying to channel surf all the complex plans so he wouldn't notice that one plan started late and DIDN'T converge on confronting him in a boss battle.
