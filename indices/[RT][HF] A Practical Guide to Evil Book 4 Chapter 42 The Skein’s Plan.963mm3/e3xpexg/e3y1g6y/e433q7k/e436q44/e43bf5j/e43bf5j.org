Ah yes, all those military mages that they definitively have in procer, and totally take part in cavalry charges...

As for named, well,

"Heroes were rare in Procer, at best a once in a generation appearance, and they were treated with distant awe. By most, at least. Soldiers tended to be sceptical of them, given that the Principate had face both heroes and a handful of villains in battle and come off the better without any Named of its own. There was an institutional contempt for nations like Callow who relied on heroes to fight the enemy." - Warden 1

Procer doesn't really use seige weaponry. Seriously, look at their engagements shown in warden. Them going after the walls is not the usual, and fighting away from walls and artillery is their standard tactic. That's not to say they don't make heavy use of the walls (they do), but even before the civil war (fought, as is standard for procer, far away from any city walls) they had plenty of experience fighting without fixed fortifications. "[Klaus Papenheim had] fought ratlings by the shores of Lake Netzach many a time to prevent them from putting enough warbands together to threaten Hannoven." - Warden 2

Seriously, what is it with people and trying to correct me without actually reading the text.
