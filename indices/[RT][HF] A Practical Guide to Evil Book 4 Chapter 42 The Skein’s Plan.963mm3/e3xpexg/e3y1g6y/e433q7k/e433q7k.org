They don't defend from behind a wall against ratlings, as little as one would actually do against an ancient one. We have in text descriptions of fights against ratlings, and it involves the procerans taking on armies of ratlings that outnumber them without fixed fortifications /or/ named /or/ mages, with a horned lord to boot.
