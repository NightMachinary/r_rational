First correction:

Soldiers, siege engines, a wall, and heroes. Not just soldiers.

They Lycaonese have a fortified position which they defend (rather than wandering into their lair and tryign to stab them), and a strategy of containment that combined with the chain of hunger's willingness to eat each other likely serves to reduce the frequency of large powerful ratings like Horned lords. Also dealing with big single threats like a Horned Lord is something heroes are particularly good at where villains tend not to be.

Similarly Black is attacking the parts that aren't defended by the huge array of static defenses that keep the chain of hunger at bey so of coarse he isn't having as hard a time as the Longtooth Lord did.

Second correction:

Soldiers fight in armies to exploit force multipliers. Fighting an army is an entirely different game than fighting a band of Named. If Cat had the 15th with her the Skien would be facing very different tactics. (I mean Cat could have just tossed goblin fire into the room than held the doorway Spartan style for example)

Third Correction:

"happened once in living memory" is not even close to "all the time", Hailie's Comet has a period of 70-ish years so the last time it was visible was within living memory but it's still considered a "once in a lifetime" sight, not something that happens "all the time". The last time a Horned Lord showed up being say 20 years ago doesn't mean it wasn't a hundred years after the one before that, or that there haven't been spans of more than a century between some and only a couple decades between others.
