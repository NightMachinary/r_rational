I'm still going back to a passage from Chapter 37:

#+begin_quote
  I exerted my will and tugged at Akua's leash, gently. There was resistance. I tugged a second time, and when I did not feel her moving towards me I rolled my eyes and simply dragged her here. The shade poured out of the wall about thirty heartbeats later and only then did I loosen my grip. Diabolist was grimacing.

  “That,” she said, “was exceedingly unpleasant. And I barely had time to bid my farewells.”

We know that Akua was off chatting with some unspecified person. This makes me think she has an as-of-yet unresolved scheme.

And now, we've learned that the Woe's "Murder & Arson" plan started after Akua was off doing whatever she's doing. And the Woe are almost certain to leave Keter once they've finished their murders and arsons.

I'm looking forward to seeing how that turns into a twist
