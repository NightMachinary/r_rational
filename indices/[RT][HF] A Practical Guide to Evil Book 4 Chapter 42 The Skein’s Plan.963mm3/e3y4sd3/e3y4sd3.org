Random thoughts:

Curious about the bones. Undead don't (need to) eat, right? So the Skein either retained his hunger after death/Revanancy, or he does it by habit, or all those bones were already there. Considering Edward VII said that the Skein replaced the Bloody Sword, and only Ed and Thief of Stars have been in place for more than 100 years, the Skein must eat a LOT of things to get bones 70 feet deep through his boss chamber.

Also, pretty irrelevant, but I now am nicknaming Edward VII as "Ed the Undying" in my mind. As he's, y'know, undead. And an Ed. Anyone else play Kingdom of Loathing?

Finally, gosh darn it, I'm really liking Ubua lately. Her sass was on point in this chapter, enough so that it even caught Cat flat-footed. Or maybe it didn't, and Cat's purposely playing the straight man and holding herself back from bantering, as she knows leaning into it will bring them closer? Either way, Ubua the banter fairy is a lot of fun to read.
