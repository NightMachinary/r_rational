If you don't have a clear and axiomatic understanding of the logic of a world, how can you claim it to have different mechanics and yet be able to predict it sufficiently to write a story within it?

Also, your deleted comment from before was kind of childish but I still think you need to put more thought into this before you continue writing. Because as I see it, it's going to be a story where the macroscopic world does it indeed follow regular integer math rules to any observer, while you claim that it doesn't.

Also, your language argument is factually true but misguided because Japanese is not the piraha language, and I'd wager knowing how many ninja the enemy has is a useful survival skill. And that IS an application of integer math and thus counting. Thus I'd argue that they would have developed the concepts for that.

The more you think about it, the more problems crop up.
