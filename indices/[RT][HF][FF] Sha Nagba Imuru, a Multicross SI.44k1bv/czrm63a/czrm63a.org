Delightful thus far (that's chapter 5 at the moment of writing), although I'm liking the Naruto bits way more than all the higher-level stuff.

Any special significance to the ç„¡ on the avatar? Aside from the usual koan/unasking the question, I mean. (yes, I know the obvious signalling is unsightly, still couldn't resist showing off)

EDIT:\\
Just hit the telation bit and I've got to admit: I can't really imagine a universe in which there are recognisable human-like agents and at the same time integer arithmetic is different from the familiar one. I mean, what does it mean for integer arithmetic to be different? Does this mean that ZFC /doesn't work/? First-order logic /doesn't work/? How can a formal system /not work/ anyway, isn't it just a bunch of symbols and their relationships?

Any universe sufficiently different from ours that familiar formal systems stop working surely would not behave in a superficially familiar way, would it? Perhaps there is some metamathematical insight that'll allow me to break through this confusion? I'd very much like you to share it, if you have it.

I've got to say though, it's been a while since something sent me on such a wiki spree. I think you've inspired me to finally start learning math again, just so I can express my confusion coherently.
