Well, I'm three chapters in and I'm finding your writing style delightfully refreshing.

Edit: Now I'm up to date, and I should amend that to... eldritch. Your character's[yours as well?] mindset is the most alien I have ever read. It's like reading of a person who first reduced all of creation and understanding to simple maths and then re-made their mind from those pieces, imperfectly. I'm fairly sure it counts as rational fiction.

Some (hopefully) constructive criticism: you might want to do more showing and less telling. Strange reasoning and soul searching can be interesting, but is less so when done every second chapter and eventually become a slog. Especially when I get the feeling that I will never understand the mindset of the main character to the point that I would be able to predict their actions or thoughts, so the effort spent trying feels wasted. It feels like the same mistake made by the writer of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-walk-in-the-planes-m-tg-multicross-si.314705/][A Walk in the Plains]]: Nightfall's magic system is incomprehensible except in generalities, but he spends many long paragraphs describing their intricacies in detail. Presumably such is interesting to him, but since no-one else understands his magic system and doing so would take a hideous quantity of work, it eventually becomes word salad to be skipped in favour of the actually interesting bits.
