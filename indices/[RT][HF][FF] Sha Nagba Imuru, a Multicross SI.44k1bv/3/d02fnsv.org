The truth is, integer math is basically counting. If it does not exist, you cannot have any distinguishable concepts in your story. As soon as counting becomes possible, like saying "there are two people, or three people, or twice as many people", then you already have the basic foundation of math in your universe.

If didn't exist, as in truly exist, then you end with its results being violated. What that means is bringing two people together, counting again, and seeing 3. Or bringing 3 together and having one disappear for no reason. I think it's the most likely that he is subject to a genjutsu or delusion, possibly brought upon him by the other breaker or a ninja in the village. The concepts of integer math are even fundamentally present in human language. You will not escape them while writing your story using the same.

This is basically a justification for saying " magic!" But it's not a rational one, despite your attempt to present it as such.

And thus, I choose to believe that something is still screwing with his head. Who knows, maybe that's just the result of having the residual brain damage from having your memories ripped out and your self fused with another person's whose mind's fundamental structures will not be compatible without some time for adjustment.

I already started reading this story a while ago, but dropped because it was quite frankly, retarded. Your editing has made it better, but it's still obvious that you intend to use this "foreign" "logic" as a tool to make the story bend to your whims. Because ultimately, if the statements by narrator were true and reliable, nothing in that world is conventionally predictable, and thus not rational because it's claimed to be so Alien as to be non-understandable.

Here's a comparison: 4-dimensional math is hard to imagine with 3D mindset too, but 3D math is easily imaginable with a 4D one, since it is a subset of the 4D space. Go watch/read flatland if you want to think about that concept more.

So if you're going to pull the "it was all a dream" card later on, I can only say that I called it.
