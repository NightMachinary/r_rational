So all you're saying is that we're dealing with an unreliable narrator? I'm inferring this from your statement that normal math is a subset of bullshit math. That is however not something that you've made very clear before, and something that the other girl's inability to understand the concepts contradicts. If it's a subset, you've already understood it if you've understood the set that it's a part of.

About the black box argument: That can work, but you still need to have an understanding of what the box does at a macro scale, even if you don't need to concern yourself with minor details of how the cause and the effect relate to each other.
