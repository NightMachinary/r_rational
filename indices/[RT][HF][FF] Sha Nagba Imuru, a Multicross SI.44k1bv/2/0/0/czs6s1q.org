This correspondence is even more enjoyable than the story itself. Thanks for replying.

  Well, right now, I'll explicitly state that first-order logic is functional, because for axioms to instantiate any universe with human-like intelligences, it seems to be a hard requirement that rules of inference and decision-making be preserved, and the possibility of first-order logic seems to me to be a hard requirement for that to hold.

Right, I've been thinking along the same lines myself. I think I can infer that inhabitants of this world are capable of using familiar formal systems. They have a natural language with an alphabet and grammar after all, so the concept of arranging symbols according to rules still works fine. This leads me to believe that ZFC should still behave properly from a purely formal standpoint. And once you define ordinals within ZFC you can extend them to integers and go from there.

Now, this itself doesn't mean that the familiar "natural numbers" thus derived actually correspond to the way things behave in this particular natural universe: perhaps there is some magic op, which allows one to divide five apples into three equal groups without splitting any of individual apples into parts at all and at the same time conforms to enough conservation laws that universe doesn't become some eldritch mess incomprehensible to human mind (personally, I wouldn't consider it likely, but what the hell, it's fun to think about anyway). But from a formal standpoint there should still be a familiar theory of numbers in a sense of sentences in a formal language, right?

I'm really struggling to imagine a world in which formal systems themselves behave differently though. All you have to do is take a bunch of symbols (which don't have to carry any particular meaning at the onset, the important part is the concept of multiple distinguishable things existing) and a bunch of rules about how one can and can't put the symbols together into sentences. That's it, isn't it? The semantic part is more tricky, but I can't imagine formal systems themselves not behaving in a familiar way, at least not in a world where human-like agents exist and use a natural language with comprehensible grammar.

I'm going to go on reading the story now and see how things develop. Regardless of how it turns out, I respect the attempt to actually make a substantially /different/ universe, instead of just putting a new coat of paint over the familiar rules. This has been a pretty unique experience thus far, and the narrative is enjoyable too. Keep up the good work.
