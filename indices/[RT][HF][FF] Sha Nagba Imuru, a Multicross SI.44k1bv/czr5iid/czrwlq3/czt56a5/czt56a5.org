So I've finished reading what you have up so far. Some additional thoughts:

We use the property of "Area" as square unit of length because Area correlates with many useful equations and measurements. If a universe had radically different enough physics that some other more useful analogous property we might use that instead... however you seem to be trying to describe something even more abstract and bizarre... Also, the nonexistence of our integers seems a little bit too weird and out there, basically any event in the story with numerical values is now questionable and likely the result of an unreliable narrator failing to accurately communicate his world. Also, if causality exists, then succession exists and thus our numbers would at least make sense as ordinals I think even if they have no other relation to universe...

Some of the weaknesses of TGoK are even more pronounced here for a few reasons... TGoK matches the immensity of its prose with the immensity of the events they describe, even when the sheer complexity of the description of everything gets long and wordy, the epicness of the events going on balances it out and makes it fit. Here, many events are entirely mundane, if exceedingly eldritch, and as a result the story seems to lose itself at time to the weight of the protagonist's introspection. I imagine if things pick up in scale this problem will go away...

Btw, do you know any other stories/fandoms/settings that are similar to your work in their sheer level of introspective and philosphohical depth that borders on purple prose at times... The closest I can think of is some of Dullahan's stuff on nrvsnqr (Maybe I'm a Lion, a KnK fic) and Fallacies' stuff (Sword Vector FSN and Angel Notes crossover). You've got me started on rereading these things and I am hoping I can find more similar stuff before I finish my reread.

Also, if you don't mind me asking and you don't mind answering, how is TGoK progressing? Not dead, I hope? Need any brainstorming help or such? I've never beta'd but I'd be willing to try if it would help your progress...
