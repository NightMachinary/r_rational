Nah, you just need to get a certain number of mini games completed to go up a trophy level. There's a little bit of randomness but not enough.

I was quite shocked too, they had "discobux" you could buy with real money and spend to speed up construction or get more turns on the minigame, but I ended up with a pretty large supply of them just from normal gameplay.
