I don't read nearly enough so for me reading a book would be more productive than whiling away hours and hours playing /disco zoo/ on my phone. (Thankfully I got diamond trophies for all the animals so the game is complete and I'm free of that ball and chain... and then I started playing an RTS game called Anikaps which is really, really good)

no i'm not bitter that i spent two months playing Disco Zoo at all hours why do you ask?
