One option to go for is a game where there is a simple optimal strategy, and the player can force a win from the starting position - but the AI will force a win if the player gets it wrong.

Example; there are three piles of objects (numbering 20, 32, and 17 objects per pile at the start of the game). Each round, each player can take between one and three objects from any single pile, and no pile is permitted to contain less than zero objects. The player who takes the last object from the last pile wins the game, the human plays first.
