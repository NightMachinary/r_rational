I'm surprised that the diamond trophies are actually obtainable. Were I an evil game designer (and what other sort is there, that makes these kinds of super addictive games), I would work very hard to make the final tier of trophies look possible to obtain, but actually just beyond the reach of an above average player, and so keep people at it forever.
