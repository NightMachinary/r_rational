If you're anything like me, you get distracted by Things. Two productivity apps that I find useful are Cold Turkey and Freedom.to. Neither can do everything that the other does (CT blocks apps, Freedom.to syncs across all devices and even works on your phone), but CT is far less expensive, if you want just one and you don't need anything on your phone.
