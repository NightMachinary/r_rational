I'm making a small video game, and I'm looking to include game theory minigames in them where the player competes against an AI. I've already included Prisoner's Dilemma with unknown and known amounts of rounds, and Rock Paper Scissors.

Are there any other games that aren't immediately obvious for the player to get the optimal strategies, aren't too difficult, and are fairly straightforward to implement?
