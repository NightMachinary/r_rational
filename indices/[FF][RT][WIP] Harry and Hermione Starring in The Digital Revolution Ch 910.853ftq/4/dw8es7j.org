It's an interesting start, but,

1. The whole borderline-bashing meme that Harry is oh-so-talented, but that the much-less-talented Ron is holding him back is profoundly annoying. /Why not/ bring Ron into their little study group? Canon Ron is almost as talented as Harry in almost all areas of magic (at least to the extent that their classroom performance and OWL results reflect that).
2. I am also seeing some of the common theme of genius!Hermione existing mainly to make Harry a better wizard. (/Coach Granger/, /Knowledge is Good but Power is Power/, and /Growing and Standing/ immediately come to mind.) I am worried that any chapter now, it'll turn out that while Hermione is smarter, Harry has a bigger "magical core" or is just more "powerful", or whatever arbitrary magical power level mechanic the author might use, and so when time comes to cast powerful magic (e.g., Fidelius), it's Hermione researching the spell but Harry casting it.
3. On the other hand, Harry goes along with everything too easily. He doesn't feel like a distinct character from Hermione at this point, in anything that matters.
4. Along similar lines, Hermione lacks certain rough edges she has in canon, which defined her character. For example, she strikes me far too easygoing: I just don't see a canon-consistent Hermione at that age getting drawn into a prank war with Harry.

Am I misreading something?
