Thanks! I read only chapter 1 yet, but I dig it. Perhaps Hermione sounds a bit more /adult/ than I'd imagine her to be. Especially emotionally, even as a smart kid some things just come with experience, and she shouldn't have too much of that. I'm also not sure about her calling Voldemort "mentally handicapped" - stupid, perhaps, but handicapped? May be a bit too much, comes off like she's really being arrogant and underestimating him a bit. He may not have killed Harry for any number of reasons that aren't simply that he did not think of it, and she should obviously realise that.

But her main point, that Harry was crazy to just slack off at a school where classes aren't just about learning dusty notions, but basically actual superpowers, especially considering he's got a dark wizard coming after him for his life, is spot on. I'm curious to see where the "digital revolution" fits in all of this too :D.
