  I'm also imagining a somehow mentally ill Visser creating a cloned copy of himself, forcing it to take on Andalite morph, then infesting it, to recreate a twisted version of their original dynamic, with himself in the roles of both victim and master. He couldn't do so in his current form, of course.

Now this...this is pretty twisted. I like it. Since Visser v2 now has a hybrid brain with no separate Yeerk [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/eujxwq/rt_ff_ranimorphs_the_reckoning_chapter_39_jake/ffr5tdz/][(source)]], it's possible that he could be infested by a shard of any of the existing coalescions now too. Hopefully they don't catch on to that. That would be coming full-circle in a strange way.
