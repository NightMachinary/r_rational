  And why didn't Elfangor remember her?

When they morphed Elfangor one of the times they noticed part of his memory blocked off, I wonder if that was it?

What's really interesting to me is that Elfangor and Elena seem to be treated differently than the other pawns in the E/C game. Before the field trip, the avatar said that both gods were constrained in their ability to intervene, as though they were both bound by something other than just not wanting debts to each other. Elfangor says he can't tell the kids more or else "Crayak will have leave to.--"; that's the only time I can think of that a mortal has a "move" he can make in the game, with the same kind of consequences/trade off as the players. (I was thinking maybe the rest of that sentence was "--give Visser Three a bunch of information about the other timeline".)

In canon, the Ellimist and Crayak are genuinely concerned (afraid?) of a human having the Time Matrix, I wonder if the Time Lattice has real power to do things the gods can't undo, and Elfangor and Elena were able to use it as a bargaining chip? /"[Time travel] is [impossible]. In this universe, anyway."/ Maybe the Time Lattice came from a universe where time travel is possible, and the gods here never thought to plan a contingency for that, because there's nothing about the physics of their universe that even hints it could be possible in any other universe?
