Since the kandrona is a holdover from canon, maybe all of the changes between canon and this story are because of iterative usage of the Time +Matrix+ Lattice? I keep coming back to the feeling that it's a monkey's paw thing, and some of the other changes like the new Yeerk biology or the Path might have come from Yeerks and Andalites in previous iterations trying to use the Time Lattice to make their respective races stronger. Using manipulation to get mortals to ask for wishes that will make races more unified seems like Crayak's bag.

That could also explain why Earth wasn't reset: Elena was there too, she would have wanted to return to her own planet and family and not a weird AU version.
