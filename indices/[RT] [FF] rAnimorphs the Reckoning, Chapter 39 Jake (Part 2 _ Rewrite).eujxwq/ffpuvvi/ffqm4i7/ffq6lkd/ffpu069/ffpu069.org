As noted in the Authors Notes at the start of the chapter, this is both a rewrite and an incorporation of Jake Part Dos:

  Author's Notes:

  1. This is a REPLACEMENT for Chapter 39, while also being Chapter 39, Part II. Sorry for forcing you to reread, but I ended up going back and making a lot of changes (hopefully improvements) to the earlier parts, and then just smoothly carried on into the second half. You could technically just ctrl+f "I lay awake on the narrow cot," but you'll have false memories about what happened with Jake and the Visser if you do.

     1. Speaking of which, specific kudos to readers [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]] and [[/u/hyphenomicon][u/hyphenomicon]] for feedback that was both highly critical AND highly constructive. This chapter is better because of them. (There are other readers who proposed a bunch of stuff that'll help with future chapters that I'll hopefully remember to shout-out later.)
     2. I've opened up an admonymous account as a side project, with the goal of collecting anonymous questions that are too personal, too embarrassing, too confrontational, too dangerous, too weird, or otherwise too costly to be seen to ask. It's been fun so far; if you want to drop a question it's just admonymous dot co slash duncan. Note that answers go up on Facebook and pretty much nowhere else, so you'll need to either friend me, follow me, or search for me there to see them (my posts are always public).
     3. Next update is planned for two weeks out; we're still On A Roll. May lose steam at some point and slow down, but at the moment I'm still hoping to not go on another long hiatus (and at most, /one/ more long hiatus).
