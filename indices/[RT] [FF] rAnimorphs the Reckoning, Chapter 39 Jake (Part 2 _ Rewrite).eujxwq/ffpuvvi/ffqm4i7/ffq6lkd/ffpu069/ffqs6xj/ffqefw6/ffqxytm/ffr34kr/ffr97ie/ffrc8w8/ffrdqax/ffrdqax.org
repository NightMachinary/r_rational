The problem is more fundamental than that though, because causality violations place the universe /as a whole/ into an inconsistent state. If you want to, from your own perspective, arrive back on Earth after you left it rather than before, then sure. All you have to do is pick some reference frame where A precedes B and all appears to be well. But there are still all those other pesky reference frames where the opposite holds true. And this wouldn't apply to just the Arn trip, but to every other instance and method of FTL signalling or transport.

Chances are that the Animorphs universe (and Star Trek universe and others like it) either aren't relativistic at all, or maybe they have some crazy form of hyper-relativity that keeps it all consistent somehow despite FTL existing.
