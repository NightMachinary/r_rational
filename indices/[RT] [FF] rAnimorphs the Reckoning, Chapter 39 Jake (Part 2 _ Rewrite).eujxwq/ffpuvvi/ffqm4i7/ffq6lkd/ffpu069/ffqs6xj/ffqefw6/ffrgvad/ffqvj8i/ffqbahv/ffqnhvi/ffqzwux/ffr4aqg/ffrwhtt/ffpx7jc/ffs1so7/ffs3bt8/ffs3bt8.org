It's meant to be clear that it happened before, but that he didn't fully become aware of it until the shock of death and resurrection. IMO, the Leeran signing off on the clone is strong evidence that he really is "the same as" what he was before dying, at least from a personality standpoint.

We haven't ever seen any other Visser viewpoint, and yeah, probably we won't, either. Maaaybe in an interlude? But if so it will be unambiguously clear which is which.

  Elena was left on the spaceship

They anticipated this, although I can't remember if I dropped a sentence about it in previous chapters. The Ellimist promised to bring them back, not Elena (they guessed that Edriss would probably come along with them, though note they haven't actually seen proof that this occurred). Elena knows how to pilot a Bug fighter, though, for sure.

  How does being Visser One even work if Edriss goes back to the pool to feed? Is she a single Yeerk, or representing a coalescion? Seems bizarre to imagine imprisoning a single Yeerk from a coalescion, yet she seemed to still take part in the sharing with her home pool.

She goes back into her pool every three days, but that pool reconstitutes her essentially unchanged each time; the Edriss shard is clearly "fit" for its position and so doesn't need to be overwritten.

Her trial before the Council would have included indictment of both the shard and the whole pool; we don't know much as readers about the current geopolitical situation and it's possible the Council can't effectively /reach/ the coalescion, to mete out punishment. Coalescions have been torn apart and distributed among other pools, in the past. It's possible they would have starved or otherwise punished the Edriss shard sort of symbolically before later bringing the Sulp Niar pool to account.
