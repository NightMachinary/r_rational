I'd be very much interested in hearing more about Yeerk... culture? Politics? Belief systems? How individual shards are given name and rank, despite the fact that they also form a mere part of an individual coalescion.

How common is it that "individual" shards are continuously re-formed as-is with shared knowledge like Visser One (presumably other Vissers, perhaps a lot more?) rather than becoming new individuals like Perd√£o (I know his situation was different, given Terra, etc).
