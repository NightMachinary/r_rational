One thing I've been wondering for a long time is how you can get a universe that prohibits time travel while also permitting FTL travel/messaging. A causality violation is a causality violation regardless of whether you do it through warp fields or wormholes or z-space or what, so unless relativity isn't a thing in this universe i have no idea how it all works out.

The same objections hold true for universes like star trek, so this is less about me calling the author out on the matter and more wondering how to make the concept consistent.
