The previous version was 12,000 words and didn't have a final Jake section at all.

The new version is 24,000 words with an 8,500 word section that wasn't there at all before. I'd say there are, grand total, about 2,500 words of rewrite and 4,000 words of addition/extension, in that first 12,000? Like, remove 2.5k and replace them with 6k, plus the final section.

... kudos to me for making it feel smooth, I guess?
