  Seven billion hosts.
#+end_quote

I didn't notice before, but this number is surprisingly low. Wikipedia says we reached 7.7 billion in April 2019, so if we're in 2023 or later, I'd expect 8 billion to be a more natural estimate. Did something happen before the story began, to reduce the population? (Or am I forgetting something in-story? Ventura county isn't populous enough to make a difference here.)

  Helmacrons

Oh, I see how this is going to end. They'll be so irritating that the Visser teams up with the Animorphs to get rid of them. Not because he has to, just to make a point of how annoying they are. To achieve this alliance, he'll commit to peaceful coexistence.

For the Animorphs, it will almost be worth it. But, well, they'll still have been exposed to the Helmacrons.
