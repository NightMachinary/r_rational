So I was super into this fic in the beginning and then the hiatodes turned me off and now I'm back and loving it and just caught up. Really liking the new update schedule (and really liked the summary chapter, that was SUPER USEFUL) and very very happy I'm back on board because otherwise I'd be missing out like woah. Like, you know, like damn.

Also I'm very uncomfortable leaving comments like this when I don't feel I have anything in particular to contribute but I've somehow gotten the impression that [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]] quite likes comments and this is amazing free entertainment so I'm trying.

  it seemed like Elfangor might have known something

But the Elfangor-part of Helium doesn't recognize her - because he split from Elfangor!Elfangor before the time lattice. Yeah makes sense. Huh being Helium must be pretty weird

Jake trying to force Marco to be real friends with him again was so tense. I've had some friendships that for various reasons lost their warmth and it always seemed so irreversible. And ugh just imagine going up to someone who used to be your best friend and be like "hey man this isn't working I need us to open up again" and them just stonewalling you

Making V3 the evil rationalist bioengineered 007

Also, in a previous comment section TK hinted very unsubtly that Donna Marina's name was a hint about her character but I can't figure it out and it's annoying me. I assume it was supposed to be a hint that she was double-crossing humanity but I don't see the connection. Donna Marina means, like, Lady Ocean, which reminds me of Galadriel's line when she Goes Evil for a second but that doesn't seem right; Julia Roberts never double-crossed the rest of Ocean's /n/; it's sort of a Spoonerism of Dan Marino who's a Dolphin, so... no that's nothing either. Hang on, he's in Ace Ventura; Ventura, CA; dolphin sex... is it a hint this book is about to turn unnecessarily transphobic at the last second? Or just a nod to the Animorphs being magic pet detectives?
