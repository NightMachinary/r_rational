/We're in the endgame now./

Awesome chapter. V3's got a new tricked-out body, the gang is back on earth, and stuff's goin' down.

Great character moments between Jake and Marco. Also V3 seems to be less frozen and indecisive after the rewrite, but I'm not sure because the integration of the edits was very smooth.

  ‹---page.  /Fuck!›/

  There had been no warning, no sensation.  We were simply back.

Literally laughed out loud. The gods were waiting for that exact conversation to take place, apparently.

Okay, so, the time travel and multiverse shenanigans are very confusing. If I was reading that right, the beginning of the Yeerk-Andalite war is just /shifted/ in the new timeline, so that it occurs later. In the original timeline, Visser 1 was given a body /after/ the war began, and then found Earth after a while of looking around the galaxy. In the new timeline, the war doesn't start until after she (or a version of her) left Earth with the Skrit Na - so how could Edriss have already come to Earth in the new timeline, if the war hadn't started yet?

Nevertheless, I have a prediction about what's happening. I think there is no time travel or alternate universe, at least in the conventional sense. I think the gods put Edriss and Elfangor through an immersive, extended simulation of the future, seasoning their chosen heroes with experience before instantiating them back into their "present" at the right place and time. The simulation still got some things right early on, like the Skrit Na taking Marco's mother, but then the real world quickly diverged from the simulation. The Time Lattice was a MacGuffin made up by the gods to give Edriss and Elfangor a fake explanation for why they had seemingly teleported through time and space. (Also, this might imply that the much-hated Helmacrons aren't actually real - they were a little joke invented by the gods to get their heroes to the time matrix, thus allowing TK17 to reference them while having them not actually exist in this universe...) That being said, I /still/ can't figure out the timeline here, assuming this hypothesis is true. Why does the entire earth appear to have shifted in time relative to the rest of the galaxy? Does this have something to do with the Z-space rift?

Regardless, if we're just going by what we've seen so far, this is the best explanation I can come up with that doesn't imply an awkward last-minute reveal of some random time-travel tech that was somehow there the whole time, and which we've repeatedly been told is impossible. Also, it explains Rachel's visions - if she can see memories of past versions of herself, why not memories of alternate simulated versions? Same god-hardware, right?

Anyway, very excited for the finale.
