  There was a memory in Elfangor's mind which I couldn't access, which I hadn't been able to penetrate any of the dozen times I'd dug through his past. I could see that it was there---feel the shape of it, trace the way that it had influenced his thoughts and actions after the fact---but the actual content of it was hidden from me by a blank wall that Elfangor himself didn't even know was there.

  The day after that hidden memory, he'd left Alloran. Had resigned his commission, surrendered his rank, and dropped out of the Andalite military, throwing away a future as the most promising protégé of the most brilliant strategist of the past thousand years---

  ---just hours before the message from Seerow's expedition had summoned Alloran away to the Yeerk homeworld.
