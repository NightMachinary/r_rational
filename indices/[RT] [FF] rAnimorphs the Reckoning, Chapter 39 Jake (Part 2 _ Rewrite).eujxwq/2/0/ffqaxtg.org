Yeah, I was a little confused about the dates and the logistics of it all.

Like, I think it's a Peggy Sue thing? Like, Elfangor, Elena and V1 were transferred to their respective bodies in the new universe? But then why was Elena still with the yeerks? And why didn't Elfangor remember her? You'd think Marco would have found out about her reading his memories. Unless he never learned her name?

Also, it seems that the Yeerks and Andalites were sent back in time, but Earth wasn't for some reason?
