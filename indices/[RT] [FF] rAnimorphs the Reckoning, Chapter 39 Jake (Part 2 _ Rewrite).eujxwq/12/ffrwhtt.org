This has to be an Asimov reference. Melpomenia is one of the Spacer worlds in the Robot/Foundation series.

I knew the Arn's giant, empty cave-mansion and vast tracts of parceled land reminded me of something: Solaria from /The Naked Sun/ and /Foundation and Earth/. The Solarians are human but have strange norms and taboos: among other things, their population size is fixed, they never engage in face to face contact unless absolutely necessary, and they rely extensively on robot servants. By the time of /Foundation and Earth/, they use "transducer-lobes" to channel energy from the heat output of their vast tracts of land and have made themselves hermaphroditic, dispensing with the need for face to face contact even to sire heirs/replacements.

Coincidentally, a major theme of /Foundation and Earth/ is the need for mankind to unite against a potential extragalactic alien enemy (there is otherwise no intelligent alien life in the Robot/Foundation series^{1} ). But it's strongly hinted at that the seed of mankind's downfall, an unknowable alien enemy, may already be in their midst: the Solarian child Fallom is descended from humans but is, in many ways, unknowable and alien. Maybe this is foreshadowing the Visser's own downfall by similar means, e.g., the division and untrustworthiness of his own thought processes.

^{1} If /The Stars, Like Dust/ is canonically considered part of this universe, I guess the Tyranni might qualify. I was ten years old when I read the book and don't remember if they're actual aliens or just humans with a weird name and culture.
