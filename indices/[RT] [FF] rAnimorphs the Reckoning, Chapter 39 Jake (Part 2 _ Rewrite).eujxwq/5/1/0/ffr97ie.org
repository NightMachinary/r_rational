The problem boils down to the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity][relativity of simultaneity]]

The tl;dr is that FTL travel /is/ time travel.

The longer explanation is that events in spacetime can only have causal relationships, and there's an upper limit to how quickly information from one event can propagate to another event (and thereby potentially exhert an influence it). That limit is the speed of light, which is really the /speed of causality/.

What this means is that there's technically no such thing as events happening "at the same time". If some event A has causal influence over some other event B, then all observers in all possible reference frames will agree that A happened before B. But if there is no causal relationship between a pair of events (such as 2 events happening light-years apart from each other), then there exists some reference frame where A happens before B, some reference frame where B happens before A, and some reference frame where A coincides with B.

This doesn't come up much in our daily lives because most events we ever deal with happen rather close by each other in cosmological terms. But if you try to form a timelike ordering between, say, event A happening right now on Earth and event B happening "right now" on the Arn homeworld several light-years away from us, then you run right into this ambiguity. And so if you FTL teleport from Earth to Arn, go on a monster-slaying adventure, then teleport back to Earth, you very well could arrive home before you'd even left it. Same goes with jumping to the Andalite home world through Z-Space or similar.

If there's some way to tweak causality to allow this stuff while also leaving the universe in a recognizable state, then i dont know about it and I don't really fault the fic for not having an explanation either. It's not an easy problem to solve.
