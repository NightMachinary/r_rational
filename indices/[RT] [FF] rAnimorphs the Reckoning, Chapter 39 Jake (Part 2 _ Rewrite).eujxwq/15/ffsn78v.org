Thanks for the rewrite. Beforehand I was a bit confused about the Visser's motivations (that's his adopted name now, right? No longer Visser 3 - or any number. No longer Esplin. Just "the Visser"?) and maybe it was because we'd discussed it already, but I feel like it's much clearer in this rewrite. Also, I don't remember all those biological "hardware upgrades" in his new form, were they missing in the original, or did I just miss them?

There were some discussions in the other thread about the nature of consciousness, and the idea that being "at war with oneself" is a perfectly natural state of being. Rereading this with that in mind I really started developing my own head-canon that this is correct but Yeerks themselves never really experience that on their own, Esplin included. But an unintended side effect of having a physical brain of his own that isn't explicitly yeerk-based is that he now experiences that for himself.

As I was thinking that, I thought that it lessened the potential impact I originally thought Alloran had on the first read.

But then I got to the bit where he's questioning if he really needs the Earth, and specifically, this passage:

#+begin_quote
  He was on edge, and he did not know why.

  /Without the Earth, completing the conquest of the rest of the galaxy will take five times as long, and be twice as likely---or more---to fail./

  He was suspicious of the thought---for being too reassuring, too convenient, for making him /feel better/ when he still did not understand the cause of his disquiet.  But even in his suspicion, he /could not stop himself from believing it/. It simply seemed /true./
#+end_quote

I feel like this was Alloran's influence right here. Like he somehow has worked out that the Visser's greatest chance for failure would be right there at Earth, and if he could just subconsciously convince the Visser to stay there, it increased the chances of his plans coming undone entirely. The Visser retroactively noticed that Alloran's been quiet since "the bridge" - i.e. since they came to the conclusion that "the Gods" were a thing that impacted the plan. Perhaps Alloran was trusting that "the Gods" would think the Earth is important (which is a sound logical conclusion, given everything he has witnessed)?

Either way, despite my coming to the conclusion that self-conflict may be a biological inevitability, my faith in Alloran was restored regardless. And I now see the shape of the Visser's goal a lot more clearly than I did.
