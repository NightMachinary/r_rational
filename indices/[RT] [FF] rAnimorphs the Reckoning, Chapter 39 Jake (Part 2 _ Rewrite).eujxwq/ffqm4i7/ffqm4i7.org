This kicks ass. I'm honored that something I said got to be echoed by Jake's mental model of Marco.

  In that moment, there was joy, and the Visser did not suppress it. He exulted in his victory, reveled in the fact of his own survival, bathed in the exhilaration of pure sensation. It was good to be alive, and for a moment he let himself feel it fully, laughing with uninhibited abandon in that chamber where no other could see.

I don't remember if this or the 1984 reference were in the previous version of the chapter, but I liked both a lot.

In retrospect, that none of Visser's tests were designed to investigate his relationship/control over Alloran is a bad oversight. He could use some more weaknesses, so that seems fine. I've been thinking about the degree to which values inform and partially constitute cognition for a while now, it'd be interesting to see that angle investigated at some point. (Most epistemological questions terminate in adopting pragmatic assumptions, and those are partly informed by values. Although there's lots of convergence for instrumental reasons, thinkers in very different environments might not experience so much of that. Human minds also all run on similar hardware with broadly similar values, so maybe convergence for instrumental reasons is rarer than we'd typically assume.)

If I'm lucky enough that I might get to see Visser becoming a pool, it occurs to me that his unease with Alloran's mental merging might be a path toward it. I'm also imagining a somehow mentally ill Visser creating a cloned copy of himself, forcing it to take on Andalite morph, then infesting it, to recreate a twisted version of their original dynamic, with himself in the roles of both victim and master. He couldn't do so in his current form, of course.
