  And so if you teleport from Earth to Arn, go on a monster-slaying adventure, then teleport back to Earth, you very well could arrive home before you'd even left it.

Is it possible that a super intelligence could compensate for that using the same "smart adjustment" they used to put the kids back in the same cities they left from, even though the earth has moved? I.e., is there some perfect timing for the disappearing and reappearing that has you return at t=[moment you remember leaving] + [time you experienced while away], that's possible to calculate?
