  One thing I've been wondering for a long time is how you can get a universe that prohibits time travel while also permitting FTL travel/messaging. A causality violation is a causality violation regardless of whether you do it through warp fields or wormholes or z-space or what, so unless relativity isn't a thing in this universe i have no idea how it all works out.

ELI5?

Like, is there a fundamental reason causality couldn't just work slightly differently to allow that stuff?
