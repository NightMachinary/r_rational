After reading the previous chapter / first draft of this chapter (and reading some comments about it) I thought I needed to go back at some point and read the original canon (especially now as old canon /might/ be alt universe canon in /this/ canon?).

I found that exact thing you have the screenshot of, and separately started listening to a podcast which also referenced that.

I've been reading your fic with the impression that it's almost a "dark and gritty" version of the Animorphs (which almost sounds like an insult, but I only mean it as one facet of the larger whole), but holy hell there was a lot of dark in the original I couldn't see through my rose-tinted glasses.

At times I'm starting to think the main difference between this and original canon is that V3 is actually competent (and not an over-the-top James Bond villain like he was in original canon) and that's forcing everyone else into positions where they need to work harder.
