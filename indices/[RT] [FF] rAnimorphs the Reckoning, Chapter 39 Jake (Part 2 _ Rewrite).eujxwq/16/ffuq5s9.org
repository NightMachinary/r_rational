I can't tell if the overall drop in theorizing from past days

is due to things being crazier/harder to predict

or people not wanting me to be able to steal their brilliant ideas anymore

but anyway I welcome guesses as to what's going to happen next/what's going on with the rest of the world now that the Visser has killed the internet and done his level best to kill the 500,000,000 most-likely-to-cause-humanity-to-ascend people.
