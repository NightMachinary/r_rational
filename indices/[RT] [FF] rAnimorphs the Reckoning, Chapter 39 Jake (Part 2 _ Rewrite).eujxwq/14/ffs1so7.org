I really enjoyed this rewrite! The Visser Three section especially felt much smoother, and I really liked the details about how he'd upgraded his body. Is the intended interpretation that the Visser-Alloran "merge" happened only after moving from two brains to one? Or that it happened before, and was only noticed now after the disruption.

Am I right in thinking that the Visser we have a viewpoint from is the only Visser in the Earth system, and the other 6 are only relevant to the wider conflict?

And it seems implied that Elena was left on the spaceship, I was surprised to not see Marco say anything about that in the final section.

The alternate universe section seemed super bizarre, and I noticed myself doing exactly what Elena did of mentally shrugging and ignoring it shortly after reading it, so great writing! It seems crazy to think that there are two different universes that look so similar, yet have fundamental underlying differences eg Kandrona working differently, which suggests something like the simulated universe hypothesis, though that wouldn't explain all of Edriss' memories believing that Kandrona worked differently (and why even include that detail in a simulated universe?! It seems still possible to send people out solo in a cradle in this one)

How does being Visser One even work if Edriss goes back to the pool to feed? Is she a single Yeerk, or representing a coalescion? Seems bizarre to imagine imprisoning a single Yeerk from a coalescion, yet she seemed to still take part in the sharing with her home pool.
