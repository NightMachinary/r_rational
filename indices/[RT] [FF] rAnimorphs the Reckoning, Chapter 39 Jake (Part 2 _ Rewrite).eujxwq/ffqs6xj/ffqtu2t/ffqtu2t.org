Every since we heard the words "alternate timelines" I've been trying to figure out how to model them as simulations on the hypercomputer.

I kind of hope not, though. Because the Time Matrix was real in canon, and powerful enough that the gods were at least a little afraid of it, and it would just be cooler if TK17 has found a way to work a rational upgrade of it into this story.
