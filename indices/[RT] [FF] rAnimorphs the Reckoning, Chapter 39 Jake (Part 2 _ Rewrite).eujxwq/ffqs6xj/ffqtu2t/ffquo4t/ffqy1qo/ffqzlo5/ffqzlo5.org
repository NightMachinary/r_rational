Not sure exactly what you mean by that meme, but... in news that may or may not be related, it occurs to me on rereading my comments to say that I don't want to imply "I won't like the fic unless X happens," because that would be very unfair, and also I will love this fic no matter what, and I trust you as an author, so yeah anyway
