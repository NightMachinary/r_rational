I'd be down for it being real, /if/ it could be explained well in the last few chapters, but I don't see where it would fit in. On the other hand, I think that having the explanation turn out to be hypercomputer simulations would be really cool, and would fit the evidence so far. I think there are cool story dynamics there.
