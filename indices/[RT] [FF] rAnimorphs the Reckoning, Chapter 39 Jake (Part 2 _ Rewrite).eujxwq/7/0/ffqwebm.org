Your comment was gold to me, "nothing in particular to contribute" notwithstanding; <3 <3 <3 for taking the time.

Shortening him to "Q" just happened naturally, but after I typed it I laughed out loud.

  Jake trying to force Marco to be real friends with him again was so tense

It lets me work out some issues from my own past, in a kind of "if only I'd been smarter, or more committed because the stakes were higher," or something. I'm glad the tension came through; when I've been in these situations it felt irreversible for me, too, and I wanted that sense of teetering on a cliff at /least./

Including this little nod/Easter egg is part of my attempt to make the story feel like it's really truly cosmopolitan---it's America-centric because canon and because I'm American, but early reader feedback made me want to think really carefully and try stuff like a Frenchman's AMA and a long chapter in Finland and bilingual announcements in Brazil. I like the idea of this being an Easter egg that lands for Latin American readers even if no one else gets it without being hinted at.

  is it a hint this book is about to turn unnecessarily transphobic at the last second?
#+end_quote

Hopefully not! There's always a chance I screw up on accident, but I'm not /aware/ of being transphobic inside my own soul, so fingers crossed.
