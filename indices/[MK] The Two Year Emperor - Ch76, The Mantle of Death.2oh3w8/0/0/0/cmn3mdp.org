I generally enjoy anachronistic writing, but usually I prefer to read it when finished so I can piece together the chronology in my head. Likely when this arc is done I'll go back and read it through again to get it perfectly straight.

I think it's good. Based on her actions you can actually intuit what some of the causes were. I'd argue that it isn't necessarily required to, for example, go into detail on her childhood, or the abuse she has suffered at the hands of nobility, because her actions immediately upon receiving (literal) god-like power were to go searching for revenge on those who wronged her and those like her. From this we can understand what she has gone through, and likely our own minds can conjure up a sufficiently horrible scene that it's isn't necessary to go into detail on it.

We also learn of her inherent lawfulness through her actions in this chapter and the last in particular - She isn't just in this to get revenge for her own perceived injustices, though those will come, she is objecting to the general state of society and trying to solve any injustices she can find.

When she finally gets her head together and starts realizing she can effect things on a grand scale, she might start doing some truly great (and perhaps terrible, in the words of Ollivander) things.

I feel like her ascension has had some serious alignment-based effects on her as this is going by. I would have her pegged as clear Lawful Good previous to ascension, closer to Lawful Neutral now.

I'm curious as to exactly how much leeway she has. I mean, realistically speaking she has the power to effect grand change, but judging by Herrun's statements last chapter, anything too far outside the portfolio of Death could get her smacked down.

That still leaves the door open for her to become a sort of DeathNote!Light-esque anti-hero, engineering social change by killing off violators of her own perceived moral code. Death is her portfolio, after all. It'd be interesting to see how that relates to 'natural' or 'fated' death - she has the power to kill any mortal without trying, no save even, if she has the 'Life and Death' salient divine ability, and similarly the ability to true resurrect any mortal at will. With Mass Life And Death, she can kill or resurrect whole cities as a standard action, again, no save, though she can only resurrect willing dead people. If anything death related, even deaths she causes is her portfolio, she has a lot of leeway for a god.

She should also probably talk to Jake. If they want her to remain on their side, and keep the rest of the gods from being shitheads, they should probably arrange for her worship in the new nation they will be assembling from Flobovia/Anundja. This could also help with her alignment issues - through worship they should be able to alter the divine aspect of Death attached to her. They have a fairly large population too, and they can start reclaiming and resurrecting their undead former colleagues at will now. I can see the natural result of that, and I suspect the other Gods will too (Herrun likely already has). Suze (and likely Herrun, and peripherally Loki) will get a huge influx of worshipers from the newly recovered nation, and with Death on their side and effectively infinite levels for everyone, they will very very rarely lose any.

This is an end-state for the rest of the gods, they won't be able to recover from that without serious and direct collusion with mortals, which seems to be a nono.

So, I can see a Godswar in the near future, one way or another, with the founding of the new Union or whatever they call it at the flashpoint.

Either way, I'm looking forward to it.
