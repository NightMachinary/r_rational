Actually, she started off as [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/description.htm][Neutral Good]] (her experiences with the nobles pushed her away from being Lawful) but you're right that her alignment is in some serious jeopardy right now.

This would be a really good thing to do, but it's tricky in practice. Getting someone to switch patron deities in D&D is no different than getting someone to change religions in real life. The only reason that the Landguard were able to switch so straightforwardly is that their fanatic devotion to their mission allowed them to petition Shailos to literally remake their minds.

Although, in fairness, this book is devoted to reconstruction and rebuilding of Anundj√• and Flobovia, not to a real Godswar.
