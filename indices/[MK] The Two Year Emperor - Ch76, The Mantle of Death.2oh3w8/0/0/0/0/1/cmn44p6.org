Hey, I did say I liked anachronistic storytelling :P

  Actually, she started off as Neutral Good (her experiences with the nobles pushed her away from being Lawful) but you're right that her alignment is in some serious jeopardy right now.

Now that I think about it, that does make sense. I have a feeling Neklos was Lawful or Neutral Evil, and that the Spark of Death still has that personality shard on it.

  This would be a really good thing to do, but it's tricky in practice. Getting someone to switch patron deities in D&D is no different than getting someone to change religions in real life. The only reason that the Landguard were able to switch so straightforwardly is that their fanatic devotion to their mission allowed them to petition Shailos to literally remake their minds.

Yes, but from what I understand in D&D, Gods can get powers without specifically the one patron of a person - several sets of gods were worshiped specifically as whole pantheons. Likely you get more 'ambrosia' to use the Exalted term from direct worship, but there are obviously ancillary benefits from incidental worship. Otherwise, some of the lesser gods would probably not get enough worship to exist.
