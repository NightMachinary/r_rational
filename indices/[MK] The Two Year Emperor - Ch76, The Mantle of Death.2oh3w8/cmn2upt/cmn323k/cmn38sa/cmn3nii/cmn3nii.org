  I really think there's a story behind suze gaining control of her powers,

Yep. That's what this chapter pretty much was about. She's managed to gain control of the super-senses thing and has been using Alter Reality somewhat unconsciously, but it's a package deal...if she wants the cool reality warping power, super senses, and invulnerability then she needs to have all the bad stuff too. If she pushes the divine part aside to be just herself she still has enormous power as a spellcaster, but then she's vulnerable to mortal magics.
