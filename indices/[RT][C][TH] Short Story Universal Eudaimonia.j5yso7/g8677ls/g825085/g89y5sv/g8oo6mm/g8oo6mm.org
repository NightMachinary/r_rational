I don't want it to make an o'neill cylinder for me i just want the mining drones and 3d printers to bootstrap asteroid mining and second checks on engineering.

Personally I don't like games of chance, I lived 5 miles from a casino for three years and never put money on a table, and blackjack is solved enough that you can show the house edge for the dealer playing by the book, so there I can skim whatever resource allocations from people who don't understand statistics as I imagine any compensated escort would also be doing. I'd probably end up making somewhere like Golden rule (from the cat who walks through walls) , but less skeezy political.

I imagine I would want out because an AI planned vs an AI assisted world seems too much like facilitated wireheading to me.
