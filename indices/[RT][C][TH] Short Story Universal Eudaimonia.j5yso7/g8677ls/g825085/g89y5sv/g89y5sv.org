Even if that characteristic isn't culturally learned, it can probably be culturally suppressed.

The "immersive virtual environments" may be wireheading, but the difference between the other experiences and wireheading is that there's no direct input into the brain. The AI isn't making you happy; /you're/ doing things that make you happy, with the opportunity to do so simply being made available to you by the AI.

My reading of it is that your own Eudaimonia is certainly possible (if a floating city on Venus isn't off the table), but may be constrained by resources. There's plenty of mass with which to build the O'Neill cylinders in the solar system, but building enough for everyone who wants one might take a while.

(Yes, I know the following is a Futurama reference, not a serious demand)

The blackjack and hookers... Blackjack as a game of skill, sure. In a post-scarcity economy, though, gambling doesn't make much sense. What are you risking? What could you possibly win, if there's an entity willing to make an O'Neill cylinder to make you happy? Similarly, what do you have to offer the hookers as payment that they can't get directly from the AI?
