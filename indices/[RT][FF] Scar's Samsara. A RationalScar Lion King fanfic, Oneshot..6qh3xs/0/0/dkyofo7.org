Ok, this story actually seems to be getting pretty popular, and reading these comments I'm getting more ideas for where it could go next. I thought I had it mostly wrapped up, but really there is a lot of room to explore the world and make it a suitably epic story worthy of the Lion King saga (well, 5 fast-paced chapters or so, let's not go crazy). The only thing I need to figure out is where the main conflict is going to come from now that Mufasa is gone, but I think I have some pretty sweet ideas...

What do you guys think? Shall I give it a go?
