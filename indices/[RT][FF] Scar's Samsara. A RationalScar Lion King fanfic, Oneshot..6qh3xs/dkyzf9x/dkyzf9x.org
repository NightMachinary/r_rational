In my previous comment I only really talked about my impressions of the broader themes of the story, but I also wanted to say how much I enjoyed the emphasis on emotion. I think it's a common weakness of rationalist works that the author (understandably) gets so enthusiastic about the experimentation and munchkinry that they give less attention to fleshing out complex, relatable, emotionally compelling characters. This story didn't have that problem. I thought the part where Scar is taken by surprise by how much the "family" comment hurt him, and the part where he feels guilt (or empathy?) at the sight of Simba's grief, were among the strongest moments.
