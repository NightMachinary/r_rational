Thanks! This is definitely something I've done on purpose, as I believe emotion is what makes people care about the stories they're reading - ideas by themselves are not engaging.

Regarding your other comment: I wouldn't use the word privilege unironically (Socks are a privilege, not a right!) but those were certainly the themes I wanted to explore. It's interesting to see how older children cartoons are so steeped in romanticism, with power/beauty/goodness all neatly aligned on one side, while in reality of course the concept of "only the king gets to live forever because he is the king" is quite appalling.
