Aww, it's such a useful word though! It gets a bad rap because of its association with internet drama, but it has its place in academic discourse. Though if you know of a word that conveys the same meaning without all the baggage, hit me with it! I'd get a lot of use out of it.

I completely agree with you about emotion in writing. Ideas are great, but emotion is what makes the difference between "Well, this is pretty clever" and "I am genuinely invested in this story and its characters, and it's also pretty clever." For me, the most important thing of all is for the major characters have goals they're passionate about.
