I see where you're coming from. I guess I don't see the various meanings of the word as /problematic/ (haha), because it's pretty typical for English words to have multiple context-dependent meanings and we're really good at distinguishing them. I think it's useful in a social justice context because it's an effective shorthand for ideas that would otherwise take full sentences or paragraphs to explain--although, of course, it only works if everyone in the conversation is already familiar with the expanded definition. When I wrote my earlier comment, I wasn't sure if I wanted to use the word, but I decided it was the best way to convey my exact meaning without derailing my commentary with a lengthy explanation.

Still, it's totally up to you whether you want to use it! This is more an explanation of why I use it than an attempt to persuade you to do so.
