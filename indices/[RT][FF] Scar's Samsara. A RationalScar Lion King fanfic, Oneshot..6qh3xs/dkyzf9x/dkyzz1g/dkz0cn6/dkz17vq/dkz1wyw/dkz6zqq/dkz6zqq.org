I also think that all of the meanings overlap and work together in a useful way. When I use the word privilege, it brings to mind that the situation I'm referring to is unearned. Privileged people are lucky, not inherently more virtuous, and its deliberate use in social justoce circles cements this and constantly reminds me of this fact. It helps keep me humble.
