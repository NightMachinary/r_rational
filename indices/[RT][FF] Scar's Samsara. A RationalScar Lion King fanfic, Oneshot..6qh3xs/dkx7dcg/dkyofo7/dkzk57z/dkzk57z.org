I'd definitely read it, but don't necessarily feel you have to tie yourself down to this first chapter. Give it some time, think about everything, and feel free to do a "reboot" (even if it means just editing chapter 1) to make the story more coherent. You didn't write this chapter with the intent on continuing it so you don't want decisions you made with that in mind to weigh down on the whole story.
