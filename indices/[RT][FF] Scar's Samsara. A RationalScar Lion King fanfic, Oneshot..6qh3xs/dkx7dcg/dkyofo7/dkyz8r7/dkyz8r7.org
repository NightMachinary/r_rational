I personally thought the story worked really well as a one-shot. It's nice and tight and accomplishes everything it needs to. But sometimes I've read/watched the first part of an ongoing series and thought, "This doesn't need a continuation," only to end up loving the rest of the series. If you want to continue it, there's definitely stuff you could do with the potential power struggles surrounding the "everyone king for a day" plan, experimentation to determine the precise requirements for eternal life, the possibility of Simba discovering Scar murdered his dad, etc.
