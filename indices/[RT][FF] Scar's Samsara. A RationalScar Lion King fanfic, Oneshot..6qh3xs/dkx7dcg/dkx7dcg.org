  *Story Synopsis:* From Scar's perspective, it never made much sense to justify a divine kingship through a perpetual cycle of death and suffering, though that wasn't what was really bothering him. One little push and all his troubles would be over -- if only that darn cub wasn't so cute!

So, I felt like taking a break from NTBS and writing something completely different - and here it is! I honestly quite liked how it turned out. It breaks Yudkowsky's first rule of rational fanfiction by making only the protagonist rational, but I actually think that that works perfectly for a Oneshot story.

Also, the Lion King is an amazing movie. There, I said it.
