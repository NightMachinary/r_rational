To detail a little more, I think most "also everyone is immortal now"-type stories cheapen the worldbuilding that came before and almost always come off as 'un-earned'.

Kind of like how in Worm, Skitter gets to be labelled as "morally ambiguous" rather than "a villain with justifications" because she gets to spend Coil's money to fund her territory-building, so she never needs to gather money through drug trafficking or a protection racket.

Same thing here. I feel the ending kind of takes away from the main "Smart but cowardly brother wants revenge on honorable but brutish king" plot by having him do something nice at the end that he doesn't "earn", since it doesn't cost him anything and anyone could have done it before him.

Same thing for HP:MoR, sort of. The story that /could/ pull a "also everyone is immortal now" plot most elegantly is Twig, because transhumanism is a central theme to the story, and the worldbuilding includes lots of people working on longevity and staving off death, so it's clearly something that has been considered before and is part of the world.
