I actually thought the "everyone is immortal now" bookended quite nicely with the "Circle of Death" discussion at the start. I read this as a story about privilege and power, and how change only comes from those who are treated unfairly within the existing system. Mufasa was content to carry on with the status quo because he was at the top of the heap. The strongest of the apex predators have hoarded eternal life for themselves for generations, because they have the raw power to retain "kingship", and they retroactively justify this with glowing narratives in which kingship is their deserved birthright. At the end, Scar levels the playing field--now the antelopes, the hyenas, even the weaker lions finally get their share of the afterlife.

And it made sense for eternal life to be the stakes, since the story takes place in an established universe where "eternal life, but only for kings" is a canonical element of the setting. In another setting, the prize hoarded by the most powerful might have been something else.

I don't know whether this was [[/u/Sophronius]]'s intent, but I think it all fit together really well. It didn't feel like a cheap throw-in at the end to me, it felt like a proper and earned resolution for Scar's stated grievances.
