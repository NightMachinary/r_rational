Sure, it depends on how you interpret the "villain" label. I meant it less as "person whose morality I disapprove of" and more as bunch of personal traits that usually come with antagonists in most stories (pride, resentment, cowardice, etc).

Also, I disagree with the "ultimate goals of rationalist heroes". I thought the "everyone gets to be king for a day" part was kind of the weakest part of the story. I think "and then everyone lives forever" gets shoehorned awkwardly in way too many rationalist stories (I liked that The Reckoning has it as the antagonist's goal).
