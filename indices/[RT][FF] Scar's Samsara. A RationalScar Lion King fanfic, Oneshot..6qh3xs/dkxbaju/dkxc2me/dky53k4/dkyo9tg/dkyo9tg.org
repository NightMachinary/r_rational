It's supposed to a bit ambiguous, and of course it always sounds a little ominous with the villain talking about his future "benevolent rule". But like others pointed out, it doesn't cost him anything to save the world, so why not?

And that was also kind of the point of the story: That even Scar is not /nice/, he can still be the protagonist when the villain is the state of the world itself.
