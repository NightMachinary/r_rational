The word 'privilege' often doesn't convey any meaning at all, because it can mean any of a hundred things depending on the speaker, and the definition often changes mid-sentence. You can substitute it pretty easily for a more specific and meaningful word or phrase:

You are arguing from a position of white privilege --> being black sucks a lot more than white people think\\
You are in a privileged position --> you are in a position of power\\
It is my privilege to be here --> I am honoured to be here\\
This job comes with certain privileges --> This job comes with certain benefits\\
Check your privilege --> go f*ck yourself

etc, and so on, and so forth. Of course in some cases it's perfectly clear what you mean, but in the context of social justice it pretty much always does more harm than good.
