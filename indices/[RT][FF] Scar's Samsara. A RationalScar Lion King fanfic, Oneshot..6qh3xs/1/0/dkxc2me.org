Cheers!

I'll be honest, I have no idea at this point which of my work will be well-received or not, so I always have a fair amount of trepidation before I publish anything. But the story seems to be doing ok.

/Is/ this Scar a villain, though? I mean, he certainly isn't a good person. But at the end of the story, he does basically [[#s][tag]], assuming the canon religious/magical beliefs are still true, which kind of is supposed to be the ultimate goal of rationalist heroes after all.

From a strictly utilitarian perspective, he's not bad.
