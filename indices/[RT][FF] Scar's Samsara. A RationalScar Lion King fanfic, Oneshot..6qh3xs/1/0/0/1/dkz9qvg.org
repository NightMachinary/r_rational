My take on the concept of the villain is that they exist to be /wrong/ in some way to contrast agains the hero being /right/. This is usually in terms of morality, but I think it can also apply to intellect. The villain's view of reality has some fundamental flaws in it that dooms them to fail in their goals against someone who lacks those flaws.

In that sense, Scar seems like more of a anti-hero. He still opposes and defeats characters with flawed conceptions of the world that motivates them to hurt others, but he doesn't do so because he is heroic. Scar had his own debilitating flaws, his goals just happen to result in reducing the harm that exists in the world.

Similarly, characters like The Punisher or Dexter Morgan do kill people that hurt innocent people more than they do, but their reasons and methods for doing so are not meant to be virtues we should emulate. Anti-heroes are defined by their inability to be a proper hero.
