Honestly, I think the whole "being a kings makes you immortal" thing kinda goes counter to the spirit of the movie. It would make as much sense to me that all animal spirits live forever in some way, but only the kings get to be stars and talk to their sons in giant clouds; where "king" is not a technicality but some abstraction for "greatness" or "respect from the Pride" (which Scar would not get even by murdering his brother).
