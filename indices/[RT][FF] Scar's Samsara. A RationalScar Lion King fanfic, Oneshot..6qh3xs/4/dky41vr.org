What a great choice for subject matter - haven't seen TLK on here before!

I agree with everyone in that it's hard to have a satisfying ending given the movie's mythos and the length of the story - it almost makes me want to see something like Stargate's Ori, where the immortal kings have to share their power with each other, so when Scar starts handing that immortality to /Zebras/ they come for him lest he dilute the immortality too much.

Because as written, the immortality seems "too easy". Perhaps something more dystopian: you can't just have someone be "king for a day", you must be the genuine heir. So it would essentially end up with everyone becoming king and then immediately committing suicide to allow for the next king to take their place. It would be more horrific but still be an optimal course of action, until one greedy king decides to keep the earthly power for themselves rather than be altruistic since they're guaranteed immortality anyhow. Would also probably limit the whole thing to lions.

In fact, I can see it now: open with a lion pride that has ritualised suicide by the king periodically, just the bare minimum amount of lions to keep the pride functional and new babies, and then explain that it originated from the TLK universe rules. Alternatively, a world without lions with rafiki narrating? Who knows.

Anyway, thank you for posting! Needless to say it was a lot to think about.
