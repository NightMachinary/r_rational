Have you read the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series]]? It's a series of Harry Potter fanfics set in North America and it has some very solid world-building. /Especially/ if you're going for canon flavour. There are four stories so far, with a fifth being in progress, so if you haven't read them yet you've a lot of reading ahead of you, I dare say!

I'd definitely recommend them, even if it's just to ensure you don't do the same thing all over again, as AQ really does do a standard and canon-compliant version of wizarding North America very thoroughly already, complete with old colonial issues and Native Indian traditions and the whole she-bang.

I also quite enjoy the stories on their own (to the point that I actually think I like them more than I do HP:MoR, meaning AQ is my favourite fanfic of all time), though I could not justify calling them rationalist. Rational, /maybe/, in that characters tend to act and feel like actual real people. Some characters (including the MC a lot of the time) are idiots, but they're very believable idiots.

Edit: And, silly me, I forgot to actually respond to the question regarding giving you help/feedback with your world-building. I don't think I've got the time myself for that, currently. Sorry.
