Fake dragon balls, huh? Hadn't thought of it before, but is seems like an obvious plan in hindsight. Combined with the ability to hide the balls you already own, we're really stepping up the information warfare aspect.

The dragonballs are interesting in how different numbers mean different things. Seven is the win condition, then you can just make your wish and be done with it. With one you can't make a wish, but neither can anyone else. In having more than one but less than seven, the only real advantage is that you can store them separately for redundancy in case one location is compromised, but it might also be just as good to keep them in one place with Max security.

Meaning, the instruments might just want to wait for the enemy to gather up the balls first, waiting until they're gathered before hitting one spot with all their might. The alternative is splitting up and hitting many of those spots fast, when most of them will be traps and ambushes that will sap your forces.
