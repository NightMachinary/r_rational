Original character, I introduced her in chapter 17. When Muten took in Goku and Krillin in canon he asked them to go find a cute girl who would live with them as "payment" for his teachings. In canon they found Lunch. In this version, it was only Krillin, and Sherry is the woman he brought back. She's a prostitute from South City who took living with Muten and occasionally indulging his voyeurism as a long-term, if unusual, job.
