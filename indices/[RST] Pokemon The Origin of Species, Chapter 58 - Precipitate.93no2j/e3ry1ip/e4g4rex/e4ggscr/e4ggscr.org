I think it's more like, in our world, there's very, very little popular fiction (especially for kids) about evil jew-like characters manipulating the banking system. From Leafs comments about how psychics were treated badly in one of the regions, I'm guessing stuff like that used to be thing, and now talking about it again, or even exposing kids to it, looks incredibly racist, because it's something the 'psychists' use to say to justify their actions, or something like that. Though if psychics could change view unconsciously, it could help explain how the people in the pokemon world got so damn pro-social. But I don't think psychics can do that, to be honest. Or at least, I really hope Sabrina told Giovanni if they could, before he decided to experiment in making human-pokemon hybrid god. Also, if psychics could do that, how could they have a history of being treated badly? If Leaf can think of it pretty quickly, without even being psychic, then I can't imagine it taking very long for an early psychic to do so as well, and quickly start making people be at least "ok" with psychics.
