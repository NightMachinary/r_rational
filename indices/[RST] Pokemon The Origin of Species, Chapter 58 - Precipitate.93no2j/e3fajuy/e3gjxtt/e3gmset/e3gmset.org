Really, thats amazing to me! Regardless of whether Leaf is being a jerk or not, I feel like the narrative focus is still squarely on Red - he introspects, deals with emotions, considers actions, etc at a much higher rate than Leaf. But I dont doubt your experience as genuine, I imagine we come from very different places on how we see what makes someone a main character.
