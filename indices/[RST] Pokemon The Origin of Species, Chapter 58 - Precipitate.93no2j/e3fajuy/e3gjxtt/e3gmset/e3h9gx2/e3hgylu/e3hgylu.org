Oh I get it, yeah I see how Leaf has the ideology of "I can change the world" while Red has not been getting any "Through Reason I Will Triumph" moments as of late. I think thats just because this is a more human breather moment for Red, as he deals with Love(tm), and it will swing back. But thats because I am putting more weight on the narrative structures as telling me what matters over content.
