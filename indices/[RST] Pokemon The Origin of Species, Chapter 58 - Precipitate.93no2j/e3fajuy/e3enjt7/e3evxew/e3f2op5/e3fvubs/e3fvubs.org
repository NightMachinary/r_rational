I found this comment pretty funny on first read. That said, I think Red's withdrawal from Leaf was more that she displayed significant fear and distress because of his experiment, for which he felt ashamed, rather than solely because he thought her assessment was wrong - something he was willing to test by offering to beam her his emotional state about something not related to pokemon. Which she vehemently rejected, factoring into his instinct to withdraw.
