  I'm pretty sure the grief isn't a metonymy for his powers, in this case.

To Red, I think it /is./ His literal first explanation is, "That's just how it always goes with my powers. The grief isn't related to what we were thinking about." To him, the grief is from his powers, not from his thoughts.

I'm not criticizing Red for messing up the mindmeld, or for not communicating well, or for needing some space. That's all understandable. I'm criticizing Red's post-mortem analysis:

#+begin_quote
  he didn't think to stop and recognize how his grief might feel to her, how unused to it she would be.
#+end_quote

Leaf just isn't used to it the way Red is. Red is familiar with the grief, and he has it under complete control. Red's mistake is that he didn't predict that it would falsely look out-of-control from the outside.

  He should have gone slower. Should have taken the time to examine what was so hard about mimicking her state of mind, recognized that his partition had weakened too much, insisted on waiting.
#+end_quote

He'd been using his psychic powers a lot, so his partition was weak. Use psychic powers, get grief. That's just how it works. Sure, it's a bit troublesome, but the pain isn't a natural part of his thoughts, if his partition weren't so weak.

  He can't leave her. Not like this. If he does, she'll just... go on thinking that he's a monster. He has to stay, to show her... show her how he can stop eating pokemon, how he can stop using the /sakki./
#+end_quote

If he leaves, then she'll just go on being wrong about him. He needs to appease her in those obvious superficial ways. He could have thought, "He has to show her how he can control his negative feelings," and he didn't. That's what he should have thought even if he's sure she's wrong, because that's the actual thing that hurt her. This is the most damning omission that makes Red look immature to me.

Red regrets that he made Leaf experience the completely normal emotional cost of using his powers. At no point does he consider that the grief might be a part of his self, even to dismiss the idea. He deflects her concern at every point.
