I love this chapter, because it's the first one to really, truly bring up *that I can remember) what I was expecting to be a much bigger issue; how do normal people live comfortably in a world where psychics exist? Leafs fear of having her views unnaturally swayed seems to me like a phobia that should be a lot more widespread, especially if it turns out that psychics actually can do things like that. Psychics are already a seemingly required part of their criminal justice system (if I remember a renegade chapter correctly), so a psychic conspiracy could, from the get go, already wield significant influence, and so far it seems like the only viable counter to a psychic... is another psychic (unless Red's assumption on how the Silph CEO kept his mind safe, and all of Red and Leafs conclusions on why all those psychics were on the boat, are wrong).

This was touched upon in the chapter about Red's mom, and now again by Leaf, her protege, but I would be surprised if psychic-phobia isn't a big in-universe issue that Red doesn't begin to run into a lot more as his powers develop.

Unless of course I'm wrong about all of this, and little telepathy-detecting gadgets like the one Bill had are actually really common, and/or there's a really easy move Dark Pokemon can learn that can completely block mind-reading, or something like that.
