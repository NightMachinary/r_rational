I might think I'm on Red's side here. I can certainly see why he is as open as he is about the experiment even though it might change one or more of his values. If Leaf really thinks of Red as warped, maybe she could show him why? Or maybe this is beyond her and Red really does need counseling. I don't know. Values are meant to be challenged, though.

What are the chances Red found out that Leaf thought that way during their link?
