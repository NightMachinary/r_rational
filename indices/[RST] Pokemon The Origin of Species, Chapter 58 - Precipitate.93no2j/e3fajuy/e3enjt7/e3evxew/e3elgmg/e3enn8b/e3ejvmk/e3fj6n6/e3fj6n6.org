Really good chapter!

I gotta say I feel like Leaf was being kind of unfair to Red. Here he is, willing to accept and potentially incorporate aspects of her beliefs to his own and she can't even be bothered to do the same. It isn't even a matter of letting bygones be bygones, she feels like she HAS to change him. I really hope that Red doesn't just drop everything to impress a girl. I mean, I know he's just a kid but come on buddy. It isn't right that you should change everything about yourself and your partner doesn't try to accommodate to you in return.
