Loved the chapter. The way that Leaf thinks about Pokemon brought up something that I don't know will be touched on much: Are all Pokemon subject to the same legal protections?

We saw that Blue would have gotten in serious trouble for doing harm to his Shiftry (cutting off its arm), but would the same be applied if he did so to a Beedril? Are bugs and mammals given the same protection in this world, because they certainly aren't in our world.

Then there's the inorganic Pokemon like Gastly and Beldum. Are there laws against Ghost-Type Pokemon abuse? Are Beldum and other Machine-Based Pokemon viewed as lesser animals than Organic Pokemon? I know i'm posing a lot of questions right now, but I really think it'd be something that wouldn't be brushed aside in this world.

It would be especially cool to know how Leaf views the non-fluffy/ non-vertebrate Pokemon, as most people who care for animal rights in our world don't typically ascribe those rights to animals such as insects and arachnids.
