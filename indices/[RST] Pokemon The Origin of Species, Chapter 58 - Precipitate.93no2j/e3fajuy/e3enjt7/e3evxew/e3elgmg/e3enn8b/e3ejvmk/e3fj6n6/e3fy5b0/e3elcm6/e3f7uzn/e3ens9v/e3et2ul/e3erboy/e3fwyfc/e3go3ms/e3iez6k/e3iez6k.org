Not really, the fact that Pokémon are strange and dangerous is just that, a fact, they're not really sapient (smarter than most real animals judging by all the complicated strategies, orders etc. they can be trained in, but not person smart), have all sorts of poorly understood and dangerous abilities, naturally do plenty of fighting in the wild (and there they die instead of getting some rather excellent medical care, not to mention most trainers recall them before they get badly hurt to begin with), using them is completely required for humanity to be safe, and every indication seems to be they actually enjoy battling for trainers, most Pokémon we see genuinely like their trainers.

Leafs anti-battling attitude is just wrong.

Finally, Red's attitude is far closer to the norm, so being the result of a traumatic experience isn't likely, he'd pick it up from most of society.
