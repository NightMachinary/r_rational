Honestly I'm disappointed in Red's behavior, willing to throw away his Identity for the sake of a "Love" that's not willing to accept HIS Identity... I've has acquaintances who entered relationships like that, one specifically with a Vegan girl, and it always ended tragically.

Disappointing, but I guess he'll grow with time, experience and pain.
