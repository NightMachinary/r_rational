I feel that the reason she pushes Red so hard is because at her core she is pragmatic and realizes both consciously and not that Red is the only person she knows whose views she can potentially change. She probably has a lot of experience of failing to change the views of others with regards to her views on Pokemon and so shys away from those arguments with anyone other than Red. Red is so uniquely self-reflective that even without the friendship I think she would treat him differently than others.

Right after she feels his deep-seated and realistic distrust of Pokemon, she targets, subconsciously I believe, his most emotionally vulnerable point and tries to leverage it to force him to view his own emotions as incorrect. Regardless of whether she was correct, throw that at someone when they are feeling what she knows he was just feeling is incredibly manipulative and pragmatic as a method to change someone's mind.

I don't think that she realizes that deep down she is more pragmatic and cut throat about human emotion and beliefs than Red or Blue, but I feel that she has always acted as such subconsciously. After all, we see time and time again that she holds her cord beliefs sacrosanct while trying to change those of Red through subconscious emotional manipulation. After all, she makes unsubstantable emotional claims rather than logical ones (since those are also the only types of claims she can make) as her bassis to make Red change his behavior and worldview.

I say all of this while not thinking poorly of her. I think that she is earnest and means well, but is severely lacking and self-reflection and wow she has much self-doubt, she doesn't attempt to target her own moral superiority or core beliefs with it. We can see the gap between them in perspective in this chapter with Red's openess to changing his core beliefs if he concludes he is wrong and her unwillingness of attempting to do so.
