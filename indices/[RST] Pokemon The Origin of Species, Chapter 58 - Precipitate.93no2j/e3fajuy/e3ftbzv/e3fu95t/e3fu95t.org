I certainly dont mean to imply that Leaf is some terrible person or anything, just that she is being unfair right now. If that is the narrative, then its totally fine for people to have those flaws, I am just commenting on them. Though I think there is some level of authorial intent I am interested in - like, there is a gap between a /character/ judging a person and a /narrative/ doing so, if that make sense.

While Leaf doesnt know about his romantic feelings, I think friendship feelings are enough for her to push harder than she normally would. I would have to read archives, but I dont think she has ever pushed Blue or Aiko the way she pushes Red, and I think its because her and Red are closer than the other two so she feels more comfortable pushing. Which is fine on its on, but combined with how her topics are about his morality and her aggression on them, to me comes off a bit as taking advantage of their friendship. Red and Blue do and have fought, but its not normally about 'you /must/ do this', its about tactics or ideas (and they have hurt each other when its not, they arent paragons!).

Good to know about guileless though! I always read it as a nice way of saying "sucker", but if thats not the universal reading I will adjust my read of that scene accordingly (though its not solely that word choice that gave me the read).
