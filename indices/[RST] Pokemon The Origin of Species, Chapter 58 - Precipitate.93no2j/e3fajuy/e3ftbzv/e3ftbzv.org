I don't think this is entirely fair to Leaf. I get the impression that Leaf doesn't realize how much power she has over Red, so it's not exactly bullying when she goes on the offense here. After all, she's seen Red and Blue go at each other in a similar way, so why shouldn't she? I also don't think that "guileless" is necessarily a negative sentiment. I've heard the term used positively as often as negatively, because "guile" implies dishonesty and is not always a desirable trait. I don't see her looking down on Red, just strongly disagreeing with him.

On the whole though... Yeah, Leaf isn't really being fair. I hope she realizes it or gets called on it eventually. Neither of the viewpoint characters see it though, so it's understandable why it doesn't show up explicitly in the narrative. We do seem to be heading towards a sequence where she may see the /sakki/ used to help people, so I'm hopeful.
