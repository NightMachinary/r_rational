I do think the Red doormat issue is intentional - he is absolutely doormatting, and he didnt in the past, and he is wearing his biases openly. I assume future chapters will have him grow more of a spine and realize his mistakes.

If that doesnt happen, though, agreed that it would be a real blow to my respect for the character.
