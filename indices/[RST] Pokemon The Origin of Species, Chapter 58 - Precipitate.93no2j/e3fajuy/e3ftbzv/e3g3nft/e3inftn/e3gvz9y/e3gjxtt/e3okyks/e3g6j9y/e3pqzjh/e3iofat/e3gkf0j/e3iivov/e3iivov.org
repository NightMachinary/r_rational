I disagree in pretty much every way.

She doesn't like them being used as food. She doesn't like them being used as tools. She doesn't like them being used in battle when trained. She doesn't like them being used in battle when the training is suppressed. Her 'inner view' of them is of these happy, loving, fluffy things. There are plenty of people in reality who have this sort of view, and when they put it into practice, they get eaten by lions (because "KITTY!") or mauled by large grazers (like moose and cattle) or even get a nice dose of rabies from a feral cat or dog. And, honestly, they deserve it.

Despite her worries about Red and his fear, at least his fears are justified. He uses those fears as a motivator to not screw up. She's making up things to be afraid of. She has numerous examples of Red's careful testing. When he has failed at testing something, he revises his parameters. She knows nothing about psychic powers, but is willing to trust random psychics over his word. She literally lives in fear of something he has discovered and acts on that fear by urging him to stop testing. He made a point to not test it on humans. He did not intend to spread the concept until he could provably make it safe. He is handling it in a mature and rational fashion. She is not.

She is the irrational to his rational.
