  Imagine how much they'd deserve it if they also undid any training it had and exposed other people in the process. Like Red is proposing to do.
#+end_quote

Wild animals, by definition, have no training. Feral animals, by definition, have "lost" all training. None of which applies to the given example of people being stupid enough to assume that wild animals are nice and cuddly, as Leaf seems to believe

  Because Arceus forbid he talks to Professor Oak (who knows much more than him about pokemon in general than him), Sabrina (who is one of the regions foremost Psychics), or Akane (who admittedly isn't much, but is more of an expert than him and is at least someone he knows and trusts) first. These are hardly random people.
#+end_quote

Professor Oak is a trainer, but not a Psychic. He intends to study under Sabrina, the only one in this list who is both psychic and trains mon for battle--but he already intended to talk to her about it anyway. Akane is a psychic, but not a trainer.

  Again, he could at least talk to an expert about what he's doing first.
#+end_quote

No one has demonstrated such a technique before. He is testing in a safe, controlled manner. He is ensuring that mon he controls that are already bloodthirsty are not to undergo the process if it can be helped. He minimizes exposure and duration to the effect to the mon he has tested it on, and always ensured there were other people around to help. No one else has demonstrated the technique.

Therefore, Red *IS* the expert. He is not acting from a motivation of fear. Leaf is.

  Like all those people he's already spread the concept to without first proving that it's necessarily safe?
#+end_quote

All those non-psychics who can't replicate the technique due to not being psychic?

#+begin_quote
  He's a kid. There's a chance he shouldn't be experimenting with dangerous animals. His reluctance to at least consult a qualified adult is not inspiring confidence.
#+end_quote

He's a kid in a universe where children are allowed to go wandering a world full of killer monsters at the age of *TEN* with killer monsters of his own by his side. We've seen him experiment with them throughout the story, and its downright /expected/ for children to experiment with dangerous animals in this world. Either the people of that world have higher expectations of maturity, or they are all verifiably insane. The author has told us that it is the first.
