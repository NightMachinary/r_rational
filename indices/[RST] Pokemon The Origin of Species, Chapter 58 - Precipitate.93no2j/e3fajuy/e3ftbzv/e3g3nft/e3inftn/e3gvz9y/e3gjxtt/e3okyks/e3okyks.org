I think since the author is capable of writing Red, he's aware of how he's portrayed Leaf in this chapter. What I got from this chapter is he's trying to characterize Red as more self-aware than either Leaf or Blue, and how sometimes self-awareness means fully considering someone's reasoning when they aren't willing to extend the same courtesy.

  Red feels like there's an iron ball in his gut. He wants to insist that he is different, though clearly he's not, or that there's nothing wrong with her, but he can't think of a way to show that rather than just say it. "Maybe if... if you try to explain again, from the bottom... like your base values, what you're building from and why they matter?"

  "It's no use, Red. I think you just have to feel it yourself, or it won't matter."

Leaf is clearly just shutting down at this point. I don't think it's possible for the author to write this dialogue without recognizing that.

The question of "is the character acting irrationally because the author is irrational or just good at portraying what irrationality looks like?" is a fair one. Up to this point, I feel the author has done a good job of demonstrating that he knows what a self-aware character looks like, and so it's easy for me to give him the benefit of the doubt here.
