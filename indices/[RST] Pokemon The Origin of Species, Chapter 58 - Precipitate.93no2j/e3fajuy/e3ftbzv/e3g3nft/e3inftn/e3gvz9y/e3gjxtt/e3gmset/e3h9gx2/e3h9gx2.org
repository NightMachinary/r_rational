I felt like the narrative was leaning into portraying Leaf the way typical shounen protags are - Naruto, and many others - the only one, one against the world, with a special skill or views no one else has. It leaned so hard into that that that's what I came away with. Not that that would turn me off the other characters - Red as an unintentional villain or unwitting extremist is very HPMOR after all and would be an interesting twist.
