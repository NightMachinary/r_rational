I think it's rather the oposite. She thinks pokemon are just trying to make their way in an unforgiving world juts like humans are. She doesn't think they're perfect, but she does empathize with them.

Leaf isn't the person who pets the lion because "kitty". She's the person saying the dumb-ass who tried to pet the lion deserved what he got for provoking the lion when the ranger want's to hunt down and shoot the "man eater" before it "strikes again".

She understands that pokemon are dangerous, and that the only effective defense against wild pokemon are tamed pokemon. What she doesn't like, are how most people are so selective and arbitrary about their empathy. A trainer can love their Pidgey, and cry over its loss in a battle, but also order a plate of roasted Pidgey for dinner. What she hadn't realized until touching Red's mind is that otehr trainers aren't actually empathizing with their pokemon, and that what they're feeling is more like when someone anthropomopizes their car. She also dislikes battling for sport because she thinks it's an unnecessary risk, and the difference between having a trained guard dog vs dog fights.

I think that's why she thinks Red is broken. She was taught that empathy for your trained pokemon was good, and she knows Red is a lot more sad over-all than she is. So (correctly) thinks that his objectifying/othering of pokemon is a consequence of his grief, and that he'll never be able to empathize with pokemon the way she does unless he deals with that first, and (incorrectly) concludes that most trainers are more like her than like him with regards to empathizes/othering their pokemon.

Also I think her dislike of red's sakki (and Aiko's replication of it) is actually based more on a perceived lack of informed consent. Leaf doesn't think Red is adequately impressing the risk on the trainers he's having help him with it, and that he's possibly under estimating said risk himself. She thinks it's similar to agreeing to a fencing match when one side is secretly using a real sword instead of a practice sword. What Aiko is doing is even worse as one of the few safety mechnisms in red's approach is the real-time monitoring of a Psychic which Aiko's method lacks.
