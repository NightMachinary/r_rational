It's not that she thinks that Pokémon are perfect, or that any use of them is wrong. It's that it's a temporary remove of training that allows them to act on instinct, just like you said. And the reason they have training is because Pokémon acting on instinct ends with dead humans that often. If he's misjudging the risk at all or the ease and speed with which he can reimpose the training, he could easily be responsible for a Pokémon killing a human. We've already seen that that's a capital offense, and there's no due process involved. That's definitely something that should arouse concern. Spreading the concept without at least going it over with a more experienced psychic is absolutely irresponsible.
