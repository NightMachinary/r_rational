I feel like that fits the characters we've seen built in them. Red is always doubting himself and reanalyzing his own views while not necessarily questioning the core held views of others especially Leaf. Throughout the story Leaf hasn't really tried to examine her premises at all, so I feel like this is very fitting for her. She often times asks if there is something wrong with her, but it always comes from the perspective that she inherently is more moral, whereas caring about Pokemon as much as she does might be the inherently less moral position since it positions humans less important compared to Pokemon than others do.

This is not meant to denigrate her, merely to point out but she has not practiced self-reflection in the way Red has. She has realistic human faults just like all the characters in this story.
