(from comments looks like this might be an unpopular opinion) I feel like Leaf came off really badly in this chapter, and I am on the fence about how intentional this was. The entire conversation about battle sense, the emotional mapping, etc, all had Leaf coming in from the premise that she just *cannot* be anything but moral and logically perfect on these issues. She attacked Red's stance on Sakki from a position of Red being emotionally biased on the topic without ever considering (or Red raising) that she might have the same kind of biases in the opposite direction. She never stops to go "ok, let me listen your stance and map out how you feel on this issue, so I can understand", but instead is always on the offensive, while Red writes down a map of his own reasoning for self reflection and proposes the psychic sharing to try to understand her stance. And she gets constantly angry at him for his disagreements with her, while also sortof...looking down on Red, like her statement that he is guileless - should could have said honest, or emotionally open, but she instead portrayed it negatively. Leaf was ignorant of her own weaknesses and did not respect Red as an equal in this chapter.

Red himself never calls her on this or thinks these things, but instead keeps trying to resolve things to her liking while easily caving on her own reasoing. Now he obviously has some hella motivated reasoning going on, his feelings for her blind him and he isnt standing up for himself, thats all valid. But almost nowhere in the chapter is there any sense that Leaf has any self awareness of her own faults here, and combined with Red's lack of awareness I am suspicious that perhaps there isnt *intended* to be any, and I am supposed to see Leaf as being "in the right", which I cant get behind.

The future will tell though, I am sure! If future chapters involve some level of Leaf going "damn I was being unempathic/self-absorbed with Red" then 10/10, you made me acutely feel Leaf's internal biases ruling over her and Red's feelings letting himself be run over. If that is not at all the intent of the chapter, though, I guess you can count as one small data point of "this chapter made me think very poorly of Leaf" for the purposes of feedback.

Edit: I think it jumps out the most on the Sakki because Leaf is talking about something she knows *nothing* about. Its a psychic-battle-technique, two things she has little to no experience in, and yet her confidence about how dangerous it could be is absolute. She has a very strong bias against any form of battling, but cannot herself condemn it, so she overcompensates on subtopics where such strong condemnation feels safer, and also with Red who she knows wont say no to her.
