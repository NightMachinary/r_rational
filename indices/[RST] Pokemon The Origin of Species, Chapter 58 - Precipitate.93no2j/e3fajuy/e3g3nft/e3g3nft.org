I got the vibe throughout the chapter that Red was caving super easily, and that his feelings for Leaf had resulted in him wanting to be proven wrong not so that he would learn, but so that it would mean that she isn't wrong.

I don't think the intent of the chapter was for us to be on Leaf's side, and I also don't think it was for us to be on Red's side. Both of them were very clearly fucking up on the whole being-rational-thing. Leaf wasn't caring to examine her own beliefs, and she wasn't paying enough attention to notice the...it felt almost like desperation, coming off of Red. And while Red was certainly willing to entertain the notion that Leaf's mindset had an element to it that could be valid and unknown, he flinched away from his own base biases so hard that I think he might have whatever the rational equivalent of whiplash is.

What I got out of the chapter is that both of these characters are trying to be rational, but neither is there, and honestly, neither are even trying hard /enough/.
