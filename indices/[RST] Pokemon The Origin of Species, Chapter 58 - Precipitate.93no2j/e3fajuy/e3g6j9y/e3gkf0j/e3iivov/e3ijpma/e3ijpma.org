  ...And, honestly, they deserve it.

Imagine how much they'd deserve it if they also undid any training it had and exposed other people in the process. Like Red is proposing to do.

#+begin_quote
  He uses those fears as a motivator to not screw up.
#+end_quote

I'm not seeing much concrete accident avoidance here.

#+begin_quote
  She has numerous examples of Red's careful testing. When he has failed at testing something, he revises his parameters.
#+end_quote

Of course, some things you can't fix by doing better next time.

#+begin_quote
  She knows nothing about psychic powers, but is willing to trust random psychics over his word.
#+end_quote

Because Arceus forbid he talks to Professor Oak (who knows much more than him about pokemon in general than him), Sabrina (who is one of the regions foremost Psychics), or Akane (who admittedly isn't much, but is more of an expert than him and is at least someone he knows and trusts) first. These are hardly random people.

#+begin_quote
  She literally lives in fear of something he has discovered and acts on that fear by urging him to stop testing.
#+end_quote

Again, he could at least talk to an expert about what he's doing first.

#+begin_quote
  He did not intend to spread the concept until he could provably make it safe.
#+end_quote

Like all those people he's already spread the concept to without first proving that it's necessarily safe?

#+begin_quote
  He is handling it in a mature and rational fashion. She is not.
#+end_quote

He's a kid. There's a chance he shouldn't be experimenting with dangerous animals. His reluctance to at least consult a qualified adult is not inspiring confidence.
