It was interesting to see the different thought process in Leaf and Red's evaluation of pokemon. The way that Leaf thinks about pokemon is very inwards-out. She thinks first about her own pokemon and how they make her feel and expands those feelings to pokemon in general. Red on the other hand is outwards-in. He takes a more objective approach listing qualities about pokemon first and then brings that back to his own experiences.

This was very good characterization by portraying how and why they value what they do.

Leaf feels such joy from her own pokemon that she understands that all pokemon can possess those qualities thus all pokemon deserve to live and be respected.

Red sees that pokemon are amazing creatures. They are lovable and dependable but at the same they they are different from humans and these qualities that make them different are cool but dangerous, a danger that has caused the death of loved ones without any moral reason and therefore there must be boundaries.

Overall, great chapter!
