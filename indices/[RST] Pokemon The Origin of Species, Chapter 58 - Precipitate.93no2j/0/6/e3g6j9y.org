Popular enough of an opinion to me. The entire first half of this update had me thoroughly /disgusted/ with Leaf. There's no way for me to see her as being "correct" here, but she just assumes that her way is right and that Red is 'wrong' or 'broken' somehow because he disagrees with her, even after he goes through the process of detailing his own feelings and reasoning.

I don't know whether to credit the author or not, because I don't know if this is intentional--are we /supposed/ to agree with her views? Or is she being setup as the crazy person she seems to be? She seems to be a caricature of those hardcore vegan/PITA types who view all animals as perfect and any human who would use any product of them a monster. She neglects the massive cycle of life that is nature and she looks down on the "sakki" without realizing that it's just a temporary removal of training and allowing them to act fully on instinct. Either she doesn't grasp that such is the nature of things, or she willingly disbelieves it because she can't accept any other way but her own.

I also find it amusing that she doesn't want Red to 'change himself' with his psychic powers, but she /absolutely/ wants him to change his mind to her way of thinking based on her persuasion. It's like it doesn't matter whether he even is her kind of 'right' unless she is the one making him that way.

So, yeah, congratulations to the writer. I thoroughly despise the character, and she's arguably the least "rational" of the lot.
