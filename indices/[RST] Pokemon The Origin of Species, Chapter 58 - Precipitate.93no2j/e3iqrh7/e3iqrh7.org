This is a really interesting chapter.

I find myself really disliking Leaf's attitude though. She pretty much assumes that her opinion must be right, and that Red is lacking something. I'm not sure I agree; especially since in the psychic link it seems as if she reached into the "other side" of Red's partition. Kinda like if she'd just encountered a kid version of Red who'd just lost his father in the most traumatic incident of his entire life, and she was judging who he is now based off of that kid version. I'm really interested to see how this one plays out, since I really do feel that this is a really interesting character conflict. Red seems really willing to discuss and bend to other's views when they present them right, but I feel like Leaf was, and now she...isn't. Gonna be really interesting to see how Leaf's attitudes to pokemon hold up after an encounter with a Storm God.
