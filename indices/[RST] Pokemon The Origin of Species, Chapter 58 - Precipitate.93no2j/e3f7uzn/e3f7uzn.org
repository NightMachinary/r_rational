Another great chapter! To be honest, I have no idea what to expect. Will the story go off the rails in the same way Worm did after the Leviathan arc? Will Red truly refuse Sabrina's offer? I am quite conflicted about that last point. On the one hand, I'd be disappointed in him if he refused. On the other hand, I cannot imagine the story continuing in such a way, since it'd feel like interrupting the group's Pokemon Journey..unless something like Aiko's helping out at the ranch in the evening could be arranged for him? And dang, the psychic scenes were intense. About the ship being full of psychics..does anybody have theories about what's going on? Team Rocket shenanigans?
