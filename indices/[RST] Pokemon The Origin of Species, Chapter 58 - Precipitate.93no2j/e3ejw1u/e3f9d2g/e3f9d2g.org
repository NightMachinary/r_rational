Hm... not a typo per se, but I thought this exchange was confusing and I had to read it a couple of times:

#+begin_quote
  "How long?" Blue demands. "How long before it's ready? I... damn it, I already wiped Kemuri's ball... why haven't they already announced this?"

  "I don't think they know." Red notes his own surprise; he hadn't expected Blue of all people to want to bring back his pokemon instead of get a new, top shelf mon. But after further thought, it makes sense: Blue has never wanted to be seen as taking an easy route. That he proves he has what it takes himself to train and raise the best pokemon. "Honestly, I'd be surprised if they even know what's wrong. If it turns out to be trivial, maybe they'll be ready in a year or two. If it turns out not to be, well... a decade, maybe a bit more?"
#+end_quote

Blue asks two questions; Red answers the first one (with no acknowledgment of the second), but then his thoughts about his "surprise" immediately turn to the statement about Kemuri, and only then do we go back to his thoughts about when the tech will be ready, showing us what his first statement was referring to. So first I thought he was answering the second question (wrong); then I thought he was surprised at his own answer to the question (also wrong); then I read the rest of the paragraph and was confused and had to reread the whole thing.
