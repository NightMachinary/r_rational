Ah, that's a good point that his offered test wouldn't be effective. I didn't give enough thought as I should have into that part.

Mm, I still want to say it's a little different from what you're describing; I sympathize with that snap reaction where if I see something that seems obviously off, I'll just reach in quickly to adjust it (and of course, I'm pretty sure there's been many times were I was the one who was wrong). So I don't think Red's reaction means anything in terms not respecting Leaf's opinion as much as he should, given that he did try to step through it after Leaf's insistence, and he was allowed to only partially step through it before his emotions made them separate. I guess it's arguable whether not taking the time to curb that first instinct yet counts as "being twelve", though.

And uh, I don't think you can say he was thinking "my powers scared her" more than "my mindset" if it was the grief he regretted unloading onto Leaf. I'm pretty sure the grief isn't a metonymy for his powers, in this case.
