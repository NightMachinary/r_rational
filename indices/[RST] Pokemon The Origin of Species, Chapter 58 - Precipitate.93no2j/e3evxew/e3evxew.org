Red respects Leaf as a sane, moral person and he values her input. Even if they don't see eye to eye, he trusts that her perspective is reasonable and good enough that he wouldn't consider it a catastrophe if a part of his own value system was overwritten with a part of hers.

"Hey, Red, there's grief all over everything here. I think it's coloring your feelings more than you think it is. It doesn't look healthy."

What? No, no, that statement doesn't even deserve serious consideration. She's just not used to it! Stupid defective psychic powers, it's all their fault that Leaf got the wrong idea about his feelings when he shared his feelings! ...No, this is Red's fault. He should have known better than to trust Leaf to be able to handle what she said she could.

Damnit, Red! Stop being twelve!
