The moment I read that the feelings are symmetrical is the moment that I realized things could go horribly wrong... except they didn't really, thankfully, just mildly wrong but at least I'm glad leaf is aware and I hope they can sort it out eventually.

And then the real disaster finally showed itself but it's not the disaster I was thinking of, time for the relative peace to shatter and everyone go through the grinder again
