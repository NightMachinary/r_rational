I wouldn't say that for sure. It seems like he sees pokemon as dangerous entities that can be trained to obedience, kinda like a circus bear or something. It's pretty normal to think of a bear as something to be weary about in our standards, now add superpowers to it and I can see pokemon as some kind of 'other' to be feared and admired.
