Okay so first of all: whether Red is right or wrong is irrelevant to the fact that from the evidence of this chapter, Red's /thinking/ is warped. I wasn't talking about whether Red was right, I was talking about how the chapter just /told/ us that he views Pokemon as threatening, misshapen, alien, harmful and resents them for killing his father...which is a warped reason to be okay with eating Pokemon. What Leaf saw in his mind was something scary, not something well reasoned.

Secondly, I think it is actually very possible for an entire society to be warped by cycles of abuse and trauma. I would argue that many of our real-world social problems are actually caused by precisely this. In-story, the entire society could irrationally hate pokemon due to the danger and death they cause, and it would still qualify as warped moral reasoning.

Finally, when you compare them to animals, I think you might be dismissing the real moral questions a bit too quickly given that there are serious real world moral philosophers who object to various real world arguably practical and necessary uses of animals as well.... and then consider that Pokemon seem to be at least as capable of affection as dogs and at least as capable of performing tricks on command as cetaceans (and the jury is actually still out on whether or not cetaceans are sentient, they do pass the mirror test).

I mean, they do get a lot of simulations of love from their trainers in the pokeball. It's not really real. I'm sure dogfighter's dogs display affection to whomsoever feeds them too, yet many societies /do/ condemn dog-fighting (although of course, dog fighting has no compelling link to human safety)
