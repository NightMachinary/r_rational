From the standpoint that it feels like Red's general attitude to pokemon seems closer to the norm than Leaf's - acknowledging that that this judgment mostly goes off of gut instinct, and the sense that not many people at all are vegetarian like Leaf - yet people can't all have been chronically affected by deep grief and loss like Red has, I'm inclined to say that Red's right, and that while his mental powers had difficulty copying Leaf's mental state - whether because the powers themselves can't work with two polar opposite emotions at once or because Red's mind couldn't intrinsically comprehend Leaf's state of mind, and so can't pull of a good copy - I don't think the grief had much formative influence in Red that contributed into making up what he is now.

Though I do think it can go either way, really. I would say it just depends on whether that mental partisan of his is more akin to the stone walls or to the hired guards of the asylum - it's one thing to see that creepy building in the distance, it's another entirely to be surrounded by the people who's seen what got locked up in there.
