How should I talk to irrational people? In particular I have difficulty talking to someone who has power over me (eg. boss, parent), who seems to be convinced they understand me and treat me according to their models. When I try to point out their errors, they accuse me of using my arguments against others and not myself... [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AdYdLP2sRqPMoe8fb/knowing-about-biases-can-hurt-people][when that appears to be what they have done]]. My belief that they are the less rational party comes from prior experiences, with one particular case where I showed them that their model of me was wrong, but they continued using it.

They do not like being questioned, contradicted, the usual stuff. But I still require their good will, and I wish them well; they are a good person in general.

How can I communicate to them effectively so they do not feel antagonised by me when I suggest something they don't like? Any general tips for how to communicate well would also be appreciated.
