I was going to second the recommendation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People][How to Win Friends and Influence People]], but I see that you've already read it. In that case, I would recommend reading it again :)

That said, it bears remembering that, in general terms, humans do not default to being explicitly rational in the sense of epistemic or instrumental rationality. Instead, we are adaptation-executors, with adaptations pertaining to social status (external) and self concept (internal) being extremely prominent. Based on a combination of our own feelings and the reactions we perceive from others, we form a narrative. In that story, we play a role that we find plausible and appealing in some way -- rebel, leader, hero, victim, listener, communicator, student, teacher, etc.

Stories need contrast or conflict to be interesting. So while you might in some cases appeal to a common enemy or upcoming calamity to establish the need for an alliance, this doesn't always work. Instead, people often look to distinguish themselves from whatever role you are playing so that they can play a separate role.

Thus, while you are playing the role of the truth-seeking rationalist, assuming you do it well, it can produce pressure for others to respond with a visibly contrasting role -- pragmatist, perhaps, or faithful believer. This pressure basically continues until rationalism fades into the background and becomes a common cultural assumption instead of an individualistic trait. A possible solution to this would be to break the frame of the role they are playing by assuming an aspect of the role yourself, for example if they try to play the nutty flat earther as comic relief foil to a dour Spockian rationalist role you've fallen into, you might use logic based humor as a way to make the comic role redundant and thus less appealing.

Another issue to consider is simply cognitive miserliness. We tend to go with what needs less energy to process. So models that seem simpler and easier to process, or things we are instinctively attuned to (such as stories instead of math) tend to take prominence without any effort. In this situation it may make sense to pick a time when the person has extra energy (like on a day off when they are well rested, instead of right after work when they are exhausted) or motive to spend energy (like when considering ways it might be crucial to survival or one's reputation) on considering the correct model.
