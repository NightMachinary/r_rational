Thanks for your comment, this is a really interesting way to model things. Indeed, I have considered an issue of mine which rings in a similar way. I find that in interactions with people who have an expectation of me, I have this compulsion not to break their expectations (or as it really is, what I /think/ their expectation is). The feeling is quite similar to not wanting to admit to lying.

An example would be when someone is trying to convince me of something. Often I find that I come to agree with them, but my physical response lags behind, acting like someone who is slowly being convinced. I'm not sure if this is similar or completely different from your model of roles, but if you have any insight then I would be very interested.

I (think I) get the gist of your model but I don't see it in real life. I definitely have experienced unwittingly playing the devils advocate and rudely awakening to realise that while I mostly agree with the person I'm talking to, they don't know that since we've only discussed things we disagree on. I don't yet see this role-fitting on the more general scale, so I would be intrigued if you have any examples and elaborations.

For the case of my superior: Unfortunately, I don't think I play the rationalist role very well, and probably appear insolent more than anything; I suck at applying rationality to /actually doing things/ so it looks like I'm just trying to use cheap talk to get out of work. For all I know, that is exactly what I'm doing and all my rationality is just a story I made for myself. I hope it isn't.
