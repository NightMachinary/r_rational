My memory is poor and and I should actually make notes about my interactions. I'll give you what I can.

Situation a: Instruction.They would tell me to do something which I do not want to do or cannot do. I would either explain what is wrong or offer an alternative which I think solves their intention. Sometimes this is enough, but other times they would insist on it. Attempts to ask why are rejected. If I continue to try and argue it, they will get frustrated with me.

Situation b: argument.Either when I continue to refuse an instruction that I cannot do, or if we get frustrated at each other for any other reason. Since they have power over me, I must avoid offending them, but they do not hold back so much. Their arguments are based on their model of me, which while mostly right, also has many divergences which create "wrong" arguments which I reflexively refute (habit I need to control). The arguments rarely achieve anything.

This isn't comprehensive, if there is any questions you can think of then feel free to ask. I would also love general communication tips!
