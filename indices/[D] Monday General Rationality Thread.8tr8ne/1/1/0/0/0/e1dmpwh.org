Thank you for your response! I'll do my best to listen to let them talk and finish their argument. I'll see about joining a Toastmasters or Agora Speakers club, that sounds like it will be helpful.

On another note, I've noticed that my poor attempts at argument have created general counterarguments that they can use against me. Eg. "if you respond that means you haven't listened to what I said". This is probably my biggest mistake, as these communication blockers get in the way of us resolving any disputes we have.
