While it has several themes that we tend to like here (the most obvious being "smart people actually doing smart things win by being smart", I can think of several ways in which it is irrational. Silly characters aside, the most obvious is that part where the brother "disappears" and the sister magically knows how to play her game because their bond is so strong or something?

I personally quite enjoyed it though.
