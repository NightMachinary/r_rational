Go you guys think No Game No Life is rational fiction? For those who don't know, NGNL is about a brother/sister duo who are /very/ good at games, and get transported into a world where all conflict is decided by games.

I believe it is rational fiction, though it is hidden sometimes by silly character motivations and fanservice (Though, at one point the main characters use fan service as a distraction in order to win a game.)
