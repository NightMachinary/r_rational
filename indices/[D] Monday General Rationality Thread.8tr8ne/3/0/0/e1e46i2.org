This. It's entertaining for a lot of the same reasons, having a character who wins via intelligence rather than strength or having unique magical powers. But a lot of the intelligence is "told not shown", the games usually lay out the rules ahead of time in attempt to convince the reader that it's "fair play", but they're usually vague enough that the specific interpretation the MC uses to win isn't necessarily predictable. Usually that's how he wins, by exploiting a loophole in the rules because they weren't specific enough, so I guess that's somewhat rational, but only somewhat.
