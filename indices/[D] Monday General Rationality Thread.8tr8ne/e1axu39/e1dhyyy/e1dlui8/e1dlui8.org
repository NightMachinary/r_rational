You're right, I shouldn't believe that I am being rational just because I value rationality. I think that I do not overestimate myself, but I may very well be in error. I consider myself an aspiring rationalist at best, a wishful thinker at worst. I think that I am aware of the risk of my biases, but I am also aware that the thought makes me even more vulnerable.\\
I agree that believing they are less rational is inherently harmful, but I can't just will away what I think to be true. Even so, I only disrespect them in this one aspect; in general they are very capable and superior to me in almost every way.
