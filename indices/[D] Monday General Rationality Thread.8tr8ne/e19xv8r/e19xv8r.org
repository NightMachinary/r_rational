An oddball question - I'm a regular here, but using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I recently wrapped up my PhD and received an extremely prestigious award -- essentially "best PhD thesis awarded this year" from a very high ranking technical institute. Obviously, there is no such thing as "best PhD", but I'll take it.

Obviously, this affords me unprecedented opportunities - simply having it on my resume will give me better job offers and salaries. However, I suspect that taking maximum advantage of this will require more creativity. The obvious answers include putting extra effort into building up my contacts, as well as making sure that website+linkedin+resume work together to streamline people becoming aware of it, but I'm sure that I'm missing something. Thoughts?
