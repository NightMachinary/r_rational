Consider reading Dale Carnegie's /How to Win Friends and Influence People./ It has a lot of tips about optimizing your conduct to appeal to others, many of which boil down to friendliness and empathy.

The key to persuading others is to understand how they communicate and what they value, and then demonstrate their values in their own language. This can be tough, but it yields lifelong benefits.
