  On another note, I've noticed that my poor attempts at argument have created general counterarguments that they can use against me. Eg. "if you respond that means you haven't listened to what I said". This is probably my biggest mistake, as these communication blockers get in the way of us resolving any disputes we have.

Hmmm. The first idea that occurs to me to resolve this is a simple modification of the strategy I suggested earlier - after waiting and hearing out their entire argument, summarise it back to them. I'd recommend using a phrasing along the lines of "So, to rephrase your argument, <summary>. Is this correct?" - then, if they say 'no' you can ask for clarification, while if they say 'yes' they can no longer legitimately claim that you were not listening and you can go ahead and present your counter-argument.

I hope this works out for you.
