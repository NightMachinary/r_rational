  They would tell me to do something which I do not want to do or cannot do.

You're talking about bosses and parents. These people do have the authority to instruct you to do things which you do not want to do (you can negotiate, which as you point out does work some of the time). Ultimately, however, unless you have a moral objection along the lines of "I'd prefer to get fired" or you're asked to do something outright illegal, you are expected to either do as your boss requires or, if it is impossible, to get as close to his request as possible - whether or not the boss explains why.

  Their arguments are based on their model of me, which while mostly right, also has many divergences which create "wrong" arguments which I reflexively refute (habit I need to control).

This will be particularly frustrating - someone tries to tell you to do A, happens to mention B, and you reflexively refute B which has nothing to do with A. You've probably noticed this already.

Now, I don't really know how your arguments tend to progress, but one suggestion I can make in general - when arguing with anyone, for any reason, /do not interrupt/. Close your mouth and /wait/ for them to speak their /entire/ argument without interruption - and only once they have finished present a summary of your counter-arguments. (Exception - if there is something urgently time-sensitive, e.g. the room at the back is on fire, then interruptions are acceptable).

Finally, see if you can join a local Toastmasters or Agora Speakers club - they're all about teaching people to communicate effectively and you'll learn a lot more from them in-person than from me over a text-only interface.
