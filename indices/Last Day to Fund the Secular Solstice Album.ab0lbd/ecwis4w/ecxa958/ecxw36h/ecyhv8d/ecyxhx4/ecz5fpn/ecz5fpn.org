Not really, Facebook hates links. If I understand correctly, if the campaign raises $5000, there is not the option to record half the songs properly, because most of the costs of recording are fixed costs rather than marginal costs. (Recording 12 songs is not 2x the cost of recording 6 songs, more like 1.2x.) The options are to set the money aside for a future time when the remaining funds are covered, record the whole album to a lower standard using a cheaper alternative, or record the whole album as intended but Ray eats half the cost personally.
