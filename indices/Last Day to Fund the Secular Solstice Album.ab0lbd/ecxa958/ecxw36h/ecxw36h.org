You are mostly likely right that it will only reach half of its goal, but this is being done on Indiegogo not Kickstarter. Unlike Kickstarter, Indiegogo lets the projects keep all of the money raised, even if the goal wasn't met. So the album will still be getting some of the money for funding. They just won't be able to make all of the songs.
