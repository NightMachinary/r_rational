So the part that I liked the most about the Secular Solstice was definitely the songs and I'm really hyped to get an album of the songs (despite me never buying an album before in my life).

The problem is that I didn't know about this crowd-funding project until today at the last minute. It was only because it was posted as an update to the original Kickstarter for the Secular Solstice in 2014 that I found out at all.

I suspect that it was only really mentioned on the LessWrong site which I don't frequent too much.

So I'm posting about it here to hopefully drum up more donations to reach the funding goal of $12,000. Already donated $20 myself!

Hey if you don't want to (or can't) donate that's fine, but I still recommend clicking on the link because they have some songs available for listening on the page. Don't you want to know what the hype is all about?

Bitter Wind Lullaby is my favorite one.
