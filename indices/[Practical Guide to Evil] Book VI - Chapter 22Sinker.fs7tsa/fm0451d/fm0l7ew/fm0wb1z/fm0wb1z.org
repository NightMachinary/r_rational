Considering just how much time she spent setting up a band with all the potential traitors, it's not at all surprising she gets backstabbed. I'm just curious what her contingency is at this point.

Also, I'm not sure that this revelation about the Bard is going to do her as much good as she thinks it will. Yeah, she got it from the mouth of a Fae, but the only witness to that is the Fallen Monk, who is almost certainly about to die. So really she has just a little more hear-say to work with.
