I've been thinking about that. I think that Narrative means her claims can be trusted to be factual. If she lied, afterall, that would be guaranteed to come out at the worst time, and Tariq and Hanno know this. Also they know and trust Cat, so it would be really out of character for them to distrust her anyway.
