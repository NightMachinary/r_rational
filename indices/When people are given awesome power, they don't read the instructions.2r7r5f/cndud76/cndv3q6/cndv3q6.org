We definitely would have those things - it's just a question of how delayed the technologies would be without the concerted war effort pulling people from various specialties in and giving them a lot of funding. In a parallel timeline without WWII (and it's a big leap to go from "no Hitler" to "no WWII") you would probably have the funding done by private companies, educational institutions, or a government that didn't really care that a war wasn't on and just wanted to spend some money.

The first conception of the electrical digital computer predates WWII by two years, for what it's worth.
