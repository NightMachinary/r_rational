Wild Seed is about how two immortals relate to each other as the only long-lived humans on the planet. They have major disagreements in how they each attempt to create fellow immortal champions and there's strong themes of slavery and unique usage of social power.

I bring this story up here because it sounds like something people here are interested in, even if no one's obviously rationalist (just enlightened self-interest at best). It also has the best treatment of an ancient mind that I have ever seen.

Has anyone here read it and what do you think of it?
