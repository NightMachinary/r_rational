I have not, but on the basis of Bloodchild I am willing to try out another Octavia Butler fic.

(In Bloodchild, the protagonist is a member of a small colony of humans living on an alien planet. The humans live on a reservation and are used by the aliens to brood their young in a rather Alien/ichneumon wasp kind of way, except that death is not inevitable. The story is about the possibility of the protagonist playing host to another character's young.)
