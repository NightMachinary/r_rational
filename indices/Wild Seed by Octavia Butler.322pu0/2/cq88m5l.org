I read this as a teenager and forgot the title and author. After reading Jason Shiga's Demon, I remembered this story vividly but couldn't remember the title. Thanks for linking this!

This is one of my favorite stories. I highly recommend it to the kind of people who don't pay attention to Content Warnings when they open a new piece of fiction. I don't exactly remember what it was, but for some reason after reading this I did not lend it my 4-years-younger sister like I did with most of my novels.
