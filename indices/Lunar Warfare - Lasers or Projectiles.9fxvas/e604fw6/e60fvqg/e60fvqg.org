Well, but if you have a giant propulsion laser that's probably not going to have much in the way of quick, agile targeting - a solar sail is a target that /wants/ to be hit. Couple that with the fact that the destructive potential is obvious, and the propulsion laser will probably be made to be slow to target /on purpose/ as a safety measure, exactly for the same diplomatic reasons.

In other words, it won't hit the side of a space barn if someone can just as much as push it away by huffing and puffing.
