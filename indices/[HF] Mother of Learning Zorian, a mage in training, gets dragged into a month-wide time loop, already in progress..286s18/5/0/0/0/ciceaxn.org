How are you supposed to judge if a story is worth trying without a summary? It's the author's judgement call to make whether to put any kind of spoilers in the summary.

Edit: Also, if the author doesn't consider something a spoiler, it's impossible to avoid it by blocking the summary. They could put it in author's notes at the beginning, or, heck, even in the title.
