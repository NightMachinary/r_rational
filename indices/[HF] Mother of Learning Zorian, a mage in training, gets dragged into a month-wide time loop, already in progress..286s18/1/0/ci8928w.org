I know what you're thinking, and I'd recommend against it. Notice how you can't copy text on fanfiction.net or fictionpress? It's a crude attempt at DRM.

My understanding is that the staff is a little bit insane as far as copyright is concerned. Especially considering it's /fanfiction/ for fucks sake.

Archiveofourown is a less evil ff.net, specifically created to adress fanfiction.net's problems.

I'm already providing wordpress hosting for one rationalfic writer. It's not a bad platform for publishing fiction. I'd recommend using wordpress.com unless you plan on using specific plugins for monetization. I could set you up with a free wordpress install if you wanted to use wordpress with plugins. You'd need to supply a domain name.
