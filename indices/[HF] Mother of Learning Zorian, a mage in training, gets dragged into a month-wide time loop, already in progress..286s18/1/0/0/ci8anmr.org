Extremely crude. It took me less than five minutes of googling and installing a firefox addon to reenable fanfiction.net's copy/select text (because I like to highlight text when reading). I had honestly forgotten that they did that.

That said, as a reader I really like archive of our own or fanfiction.net or fictionpress over wordpress, simply because it is so much simpler to convert those sites into readable .epub files for my phone compared to wordpress (where no simple, already automated solution exists that doesn't involve modifying python scripts, afaik).
