I don't block the summary in the fiction search engines, but I usually find the ones I want to read through other sources; that tends to work out without too much telling. I've found the the author's notes and the titles usually don't spoil as much as the summary does.

(In this specific case, I found it spoilery because it felt like a riddle to be solved in the very beginning of the story.)
