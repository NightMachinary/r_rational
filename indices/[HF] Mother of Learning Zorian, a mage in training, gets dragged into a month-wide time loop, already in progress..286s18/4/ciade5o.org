  Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?

  Not even close to the end. The story basically has 3 arcs, and we're only getting close to the end of the first one. I'm really going to have to speed up the pace if I want to finish the story in anything resembling a reasonable time-frame.

My, it looks like this one is in to be nice and wonderfully long, if slowly updating.
