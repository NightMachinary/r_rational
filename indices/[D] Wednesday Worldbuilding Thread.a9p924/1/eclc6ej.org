Recently I've read [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18379245][How I became friends with Octopus]] thread on HN, and I thought it would be awesome to read a story set in a world where octopuses happened to live much longer, started forming societies, and ended up evolving alongside humans. Maybe we've been competing all along, maybe they lived in some isolated underwater cave and only recently we've made contact.

The story could explore how a completely separate evolutionary branch of intelligence has evolved, or it could be alien contact movie without aliens.

I don't have the skills to write one, but it would be super fun to read, octopi are such cool creatures.
