Star Trek could badly do with a rationalist!fic. This is a universe with teleportation, instant matter reconfiguration, holograms you can touch, casual time travel (just need a warp drive and a star), casual super intelligent AI (the Enterprise's computer was able to create a genius-level human brain from scratch in 10 seconds in "Elementary, my Dear Data"), handheld weapons that can vaporise half a dozen cubic meters of stone in one shot, personal force fields that can deflect bullets, cloaking devices the size of a backpack that can hide an entire battleship, engines so powerful they can achieve 1/4 the speed of light in mere minutes, total mastery over gravity and inertia .....and yet it's so. badly. optimised. Fights between people involve standing stock rigid and firing a single slow moving energy beam at the target, fights between starships look like sea battles during the age of sail.

I think you could justify this somewhat in-universe by saying the non-militaristic stuff is avoided because the Federation is very anti-transhumanist and very 'traditional values', so abandoning reality to live in a hologram sex paradise or creating a super human AI would probably be extremely taboo. The militaristic tech could be justified by saying all the conflicts we see on the show are low-tier affairs, and no one is willing to detonate the proverbial nuke by engaging in all-out 24th century warfare for fear of how horrific it would be. Self-replicating world eater viruses, clouds of nanites that strip flesh from bone in minutes, psychopathy-inducing-pathogens that turn your soldiers against themselves, drones equipped with blinding lasers that fly around and scorch out everyone's eyeball, dark matter bombs that sterilise entire solar systems.

This actually would have a real world parallel - in WW2, neither Churchill or Hitler was willing to use chemical weapons for fear that once one side crossed that line, the other side would start responding in kind and it would be hell on earth for both nations. We also have an example of this /failing/, with high explosive sniper bullets. Originally both sides agreed these were too terrible a weapon to field, and tried to avoid giving them out. But in the end, someone somewhere started using them and soon they become widely adopted and both sides just had to live with sometimes getting their hand literally blown apart or their entire shoulder turning into a crater.

So in the rationalist fic we'd see a Captain banished to the fringes of the Federation for her extremist views on transhumanism, only for Starfleet to start badly losing a war against an alien empire and be forced to lift all limitations on tactics and strategies. It would need some kind of cool sounding name, like "Final Days directive" or "Last Measures protocol" or "Operation Twilight Hope". Something that implies this is a procedure literally only activated upon the Federation being on the absolute verge of annihilation.

Our plucky Captain begins innovating and tinkering, doing the things she always planned to do but couldn't have before the war without being thrown in prison for life. This is how she's able to out-innovate the greatest minds in the Federation, she's been thinking about all this stuff for years and already has most of the designs worked out - she just needed permission to begin fielding them. Over time she's promoted to admiral, commands a fleet, and fights an utterly horrific war that scars her for life and changes the nature of interstellar warfare into something unspeakably more terrible. War becomes so awful even the klingons start avoiding it, instead preferring 'ritual combat' to resolve disputes with 2 warriors armed with bat'leth fighting 1v1. So good fun all around.
