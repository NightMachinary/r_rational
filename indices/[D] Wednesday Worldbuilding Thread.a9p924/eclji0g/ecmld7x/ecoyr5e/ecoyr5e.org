two issues. the first is power requirements, those military ships do use antimater after all.

the second problem is infrastructure. even with enough power, you only have so much to work with. if you focus on expanding infrastructure and have the skilled labor to do so, then your power requirement went up. how much antimatter do you have anyway?

so, you have finite skilled labor, finite infrastructure and power. ergo you get finite results, and channel a lot of resources into finding better ways to do things.

now, your engineer may be able to do that crazy thing... but he probably damaged the ship when he did it. damaging the deflector dish now to avoid a messy death is a good option, but its not a long-term solution.

star trek is also VERY anti-transhuman, as a result of previous genetically engineered superhumans (Khan!). human society is socialist (with the tech to support that), but still has the occasional criminal (such as Mud). i would further conclude that on some level, the society is against large sudden changes because many of those changes have very nasty negative externalities.

biggest threats in star trek cannon? time travel, mind-controlling parasites in the admirals, other space-faring empires (Borg, romulans, cardassians, ect), and problems caused by their own technology. Q also tends to get on the list, but he really isnt in the top 10. oh, and there is also a mirror universe.

telepathy is a known thing, as are empaths who can read you from another ship or in orbit. teleporters are easy to disrupt, but can keep you alive in stasis as long as the power supply holds out. all humanoid species can interbreed and have a common ancestor.

now, the best solution i can think of is that future-federation is causing some problems via time travel, above and beyond 'fixing' the problems created by earlier captains. the reason none of the stiff your talking about happens, is because the future does not want it to. time travellers from the future are screwing with your timeline, and doing so for their own benefit. time travel is the single biggest problem in the setting. we even get a temporal cold-war in one show.

so, why dont we have X? because that would screw with the future timeline, and then agent Jones wont be born. we need agent Jones to stop event Y. no, it hasnt happened yet, but its vital to the timeline. recursive logic, plus people in power keeping in power.
