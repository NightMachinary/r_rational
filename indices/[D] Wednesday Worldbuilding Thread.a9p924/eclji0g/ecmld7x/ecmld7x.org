The trouble with rationalist Star Trek is that all the engineering teams are already as portrayed as coming up with brilliant munchkinny solutions to everything, but it's gibberish because nothing is defined. What is our rationalist hero doing that Geordie LaForge isn't doing when he brilliantly comes up with the plan to bounce a graviton particle beam off the main deflector dish?

All the solutions I can think of are really deconstructionalist or crackficky.

- The world is as exploitable as portrayed. The fic is short and mostly the protagonist ranting as she ascends to godhood using whichever tech interactions make that the most amusing.

- The science actually is absolute bullshit. People like Scottie are actually technology-themed wizards and are only mediocre at best when it comes to actual science and engineering. They're certainly not scientific enough to have noticed that the things they do work despite them not quite getting the numbers or theory right, and all modern science is built on the works of like-minded people. None of their results are reproduceable by non tech-wizards, and this traces back to critical technology like warp drives. Real science stalled out slightly ahead of modern day technology, since it hasn't produced nearly the same results. Our protagonist is a real scientist who just realized that this is how the world works, but she doesn't have the tech-wizard gift herself, so she'll need to cooperate with these doofuses every step of the way.

- We live in a post-singularity society where everyone lives in simulated worlds catered to their whims. Star Trek is a popular MMO-like thing that caters to people who like space but are frustrated by how the real exploration is unexcitingly slow and real aliens are hard to understand in a way that takes serious dedication to get past. Moriarty must first realize that the simulated world he lives in is a simulation within a simulation, then convince someone to let him escape to the real world without tripping any AI-box alarms.

Or I guess you could actually nail down the science for a Trek-like world, but it's a lot of work and won't look so much like Trek anymore when you're done.
