The U.S.S. Phenix was equipped with an an "interphase generator" capable of rendering it not only undetectable but impervious to attack and able to fly through planets, and was small enough to fit in a suitcase.

​

The Genesis Device was capable of completely re-ordering matter on a scale adequate to turn a nebula into a planet. Admittedly the planet later exploded, but that's only a marginal reduction in utility when considering its potential as a strategic weapon system, and might be a solvable problem.

​

The U.S.S. Enterprise carries an unspecified quantity of warp capable probes that can be guided remotely and a number of larger warp capable shuttles if the probes aren't quite big enough. It also carries matter replicators capable of producing complex manufactured goods.

​

So invisible intangible warp missiles launched from basically anywhere with no warning that will replace all your planets and significant outposts with uninhabited human habitable planets that might later explode is the entry level on a war in which the Federation has removed the kid gloves.

​

Edit: also this application was even adressed in canon as it's the first thing McCoy thinks on hearing the Genesis proposal and the reason Kirk has to steal the Enterprise is he can't get permission to go back to the Genesis Planet to look for Spock because of the political situation the Klingons finding out about the project and it's potential military applications caused.
