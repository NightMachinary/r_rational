I think you're underestimating the full magnitude of how broken Star Trek is. We have matter replicators that work on the same principles as human-scale transporters, and at least one character with superhuman intelligence. You can just rig a transporter not to destroy the source material and clone Lt. Commander Data as many times as you have spare atoms. It's a hard takeoff singularity as soon as anybody bothers to try.
