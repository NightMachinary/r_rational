Plot twist:

None of the above happened because the Borg had a flotilla of cubes on standby in case their diplomatic solution (Locutus) failed. By the time the Federation realized this it was too late to begin building doomsday weapons.

In retrospect upon assimilating the Federation it became obvious to the collective that they should have assimilated the Fernagi first so they'd have some skill at marketing before approaching the Federation as the whole thing would have gone a lot smoother if they'd done a better job of articulating the benefits of being assimilated. As while techicnly true "Death is irrelavent. Self determination is irrelevant. Resistance is Futile." just doesn't play nearly as well as "look, you can either upload yourself to an immortal virtual collective where you get to live forever free of the suffering intrinsic to a biological existence and explore a universe far larger and more amazing than you can possibly imagine, or you can hope you live long enough be the old cranky guy who's complaining about how your children did and no longer call you."
