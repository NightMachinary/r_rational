Not that your necessarily wrong, but I'd point out that an intermediate period did exist where we had "muzzle loading" aka "cap and ball" percussion lock revolvers. The earliest Colt revolvers were all of this type and they saw extensive use in the US Civil War. So the existence of revolvers doesn't necessarily have to imply cartridges. That said I do seem to recall the description being cartridge based? I dunno is been a while since I've read that part.
