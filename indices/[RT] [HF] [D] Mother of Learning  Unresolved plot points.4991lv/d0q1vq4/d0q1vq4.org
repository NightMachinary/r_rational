Without re-read I'm going to mention these as well:

- Mysterious girl that was in Zach's group with Neolu in restart zero was never mentioned. She may or may be not important... because Zach is a bit of man-whore. But then, restart 0, important.

- Bully expelled from Zorian's class is never mentioned again. He was from a Noble house and holds a grudge against academy. May be or may be not important.

- Mystery not resolved: why do certain Ironbeaks hate invaders? This one could be an important clue.

Of those you mentioned: Damien is an obvious Chekhov's gun. Important. (Or the biggest. Distraction. EVER!). Grey hunter and Siverlake obviously important, doable now, as Zorian has a golem army. Maybe Silverlake will help with soul well thingy.

Winter wolf Alpha could lead to winter shifter tribe side quest: shifters don't like winter wolves.

And I need a re-read to confirm that Zorian checked each and every of his 19 classmates.
