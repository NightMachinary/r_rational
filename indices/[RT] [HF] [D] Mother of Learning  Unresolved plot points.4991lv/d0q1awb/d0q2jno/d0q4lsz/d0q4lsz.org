I don't think that Zach's magic missile mastery in chapter 8 is better than Zorian's in chapter 49 since there is no mention of his missiles being nearly invisible (like Zorian can make them). So assuming that by now Zorian is at half his max mana capacity, that would mean that he can cast magic missiles at half the cost he used to. If Zach has the same level of mastery, has twice the natural mana reserves of Zorian and has reached his max mana capacity he should be at about 160 missiles. Quite a bit short of 232, so I think there has to be more going on with his mana reserves.

The fact that two loopers have been mentioned as having higher than expected mana reserves (and the third is unknown) is really suspicious to me. Maybe the time loop also resets whatever eventually halts natural mana growth, or Zach has some special bloodline/and Zorian inherited a minor version of that.

Also, Taiven mentions that natural mana capacity growth does not interfere with control.
