I've been wondering for a while whether mana growth might be linked to physical growth, if we assume that physical maturity happens around the early 20's might that be when mana reserve growth stops? If that's the case then Zach and Zorian are both simply growing for much longer.

Especially Zach who's been aged 15 for well over a decade and has presumably been using lots of mana on a frequent basis (something that's mentioned as increasing mana growth) the growth would probably be both quick and continuing indefinitely so long as they stay in the loop and stay young.
