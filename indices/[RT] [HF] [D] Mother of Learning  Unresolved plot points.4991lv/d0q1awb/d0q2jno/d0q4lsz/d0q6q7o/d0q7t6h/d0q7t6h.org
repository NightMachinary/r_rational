We can estimate how much more efficient Zorian got at magic missiles: Zorian has been in the loop for a couple of years now, so I assumed that by now he had managed to double his mana capacity (I think I recall him have a capacity of 12 in one of the earlier chapters before he started grinding magic missile, up from 8). So since he can cast 35 magic missiles now, that means he would be casting at about half cost. So if Zach is similarly efficient and has hit his 4 times max mana capacity, that means his starting reserves were (232/2)/4=29. Which seems implausibly high (interpreting 8-12 is usually mana capacity to mean that average is 10 and sigma is 2 would mean that Zach is at 9-10 sigma)
