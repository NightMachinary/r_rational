I think 232 is around the ballpark that you would expect Zach to be able to cast. Kyron's booklet mentioned that most people's maximum is 4 times the amount they started with. Unfortunately we don't know how much more efficient Zorian's magic missile is compared to when he started(since it would be a product of his skill and natural mana growth) but if we assume it's 4 times as efficient then normal people would be able to cast 16 times as many magic missiles than they could initially.

For Zach to accomplish 232 and if we assume the above is correct then Zach would have to start with the ability to cast 14 magic missiles in one sitting. If he was truly gifted and could cast 20-30 magic missiles then he wouldn't need as much proficiency as Zorian to achieve the same result.

The only problem I see with this explanation is that Taiven, who is apparently skilled in combat magic, is shocked at the suggestion that someone could cast 200 of them. Either no one in the entire kingdom has thought to practice magic missile as much as Zorian has(which I find unlikely since someone in the military would have wondered what the limit of magic missile in the hands of an average soldier would be or even a random person's curiosity) or Zorian has an unprecendented amount of control over his mana which I find just as unlikely.

After all if the average person's magic missile magnitude is ~40 (after maturing) then someone who has practiced with it as much as Zorian would be capable of throwing at least 100 of them, and I wouldn't be surprised if 160 was possible with someone who bothered to practice it just as much as Kyron did. After all Kyron's missile was good enough to be invisible implying that he wasn't wasting any mana to turn it visible instead.
