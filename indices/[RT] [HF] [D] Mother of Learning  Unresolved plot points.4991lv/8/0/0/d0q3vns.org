  The truth is probably simpler, Silverlake is a bitch.

That's definitely true too. My main reason to believe that there is more to Silverlake than being a random ancient super powerful witch who won't help Zorian because she's a bitch is that doing that doesn't make sense from a story telling perspective.

Silverlake doesn't need to be an altruist to help Zorian. I think Zorian spent several days searching for Silverlake's house. In that time Silverlake could have potentially found out a lot about the invasion/other stuff that is going on and decided that helping Zorian is in her best interest.
