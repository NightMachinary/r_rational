I was mildly surprised that Zorian never went back to Silverlake after that and tried to flush her out and then tell her about the grey hunter egg quest (which she "jokingly" suggested). It seems like it'd be worth a try. Similarly, bringing Kael with him as she knows him.

If he really isn't capable of finding her yet, I wonder if this loose thread will remain until/if he gets some sort of soul sight to detect her demesne- just a wild guess.
