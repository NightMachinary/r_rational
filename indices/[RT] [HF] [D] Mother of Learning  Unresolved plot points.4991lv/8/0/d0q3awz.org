The truth is probably simpler, Silverlake is a bitch. This is kinda confirmed by Lukav (or Alanic?) when Zorian tells him Kael recommended her as well, reaction was "Kael recommended /her/? LOLWTF good luck with that, boy"

This is further confirmed by the fact that if Silverlake knows about time loop then she has zero motivation to ask Zorian anything, as all his gifts will be rendered useless by the loop. Unless she is a looper, she knows Zorian milks her for knowledge and then never shows at her doorstep again, at least while the loop exists.

Preemptively going for something that will help Zorian makes her an altruist... An altruist that is quite abrasive at the same time. My judgement: she is just a bitch.
