I was just doing a bit of a skim reread, and looked closely at the familiar bonds part. I am wondering if maybe the link between Zach and Zorian is much like the familiar bond, and that is what the foreshadowing is about.... Seems to be a lot of implicit and explicit mention of the similarities which makes me think that all the talk about familiars never had anything to do with Zorian getting a familiar and rather was just about him BEING a familiar (basically).
