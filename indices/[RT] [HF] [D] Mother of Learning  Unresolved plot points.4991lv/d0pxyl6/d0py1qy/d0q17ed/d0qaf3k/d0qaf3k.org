I don't think that the gun tech level is all that crude, we never get a great description of the rifles but the fact that revolvers exist tells us that they've moved past the point of muzzle loading guns. When considering how to take out the Grey Hunter he thinks about firearms but mentions that the calibre of weapon he'd need is only to be found in military bases and those aren't worth the risk. Whether that means larger calibre weapons or machineguns isn't made clear.
