Good point. Another thing to note is that we had cartriges for half a century before we had anything like assault rifles. The first lever actions were in the 1860s and saw some early use in the civil war. Then there were gatling guns that had to be towed around like cannon, the tommy gun was invented after WWI in 1928, but it wasn't until WWII with the StG44 and that we really saw full auto assault rifles.

I was kind of imagining The Mother Of Learning to be (stuck?) around 1870-something for mundane military tech, but it's also totally plausible that with magic around they might not follow the exact same order-of-inventions either.
