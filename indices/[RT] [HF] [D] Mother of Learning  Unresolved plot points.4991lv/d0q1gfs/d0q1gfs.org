There's one small thing from the first act that hasn't been resolved.

In Chapter 13, Zorian tries to levitate Kirielle, but fails. When he discusses this with Ilsa, she tells him that channeling mana through his hands all the time is limiting his shaping abilities, and demonstrates levitation without hands.

Did Zorian figure out how to shape mana without hands? (EDIT: Apparently so, see below) More importantly, did he ever levitate Kirielle?
