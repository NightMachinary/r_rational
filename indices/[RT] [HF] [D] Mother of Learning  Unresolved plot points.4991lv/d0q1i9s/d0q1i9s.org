From the beginning it was made clear that the *planar alignment* is important - the Benisek speech, university got a makeover, the associated party with so many important people present, the mention of mages teleporting a city during previous planar alignment.

*The Sovereign Gate* - mentioned by Vani, presumably a metaphor for a previous time loop. Could it be a real physical gate activated at some point by Zach?
