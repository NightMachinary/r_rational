Oh the planar alignment I had totally forgotten about. This is especially important when crossed with what Xvim was just talking about last chapter. He suspects there is an illusion cast on the sky, because a time resetting spell could not possibly include all the stars etc. But clearly the planar alignment is still happening so the spell should at least include those celestial bodies I imagine.
