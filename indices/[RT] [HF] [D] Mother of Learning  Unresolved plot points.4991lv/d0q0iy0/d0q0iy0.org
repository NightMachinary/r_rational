  Grey hunter was never killed

  Grey hunter eggs were never stolen and nothing was done with them(Silverlake/familiar bond/something else)

  Potion that gives soulsight was not discovered/made/used

My suspicion is that Silverlake figured out that Zorian is a time traveller (via casting some sort of powerful divination magic on him when she realized that he knew where her house was). Kael mentioned that there may be alternative ways to gain soul sight, and Silverlake is probably one of the best candidates in the story so far for knowing one of these (along with the lich and the mayor, neither seems hugely likely to talk).

Some things that point towards Silverlake knowing about the loop: She comments on how long it took Zorian to finds her ingredients (She was expecting him to find them very quickly since she expected him to have done the task before), she was paying attention to whether he possessed skills she would not expect him to have (traditional potion making as opposed to alchemy), and her having an immediate answer to the question of how to convince her the he is a time traveller.

As to why she wants him to get Grey hunter eggs: I suspect its an ingredient in the alternative soul sight potion. The fact that it would require Grey hunter eggs would explain why Kael wouldn't know about this method (since it is so hopelessly impractical that hardly anyone bothers teaching it).
