This is a world were divination magic is a thing. I assume she used some on Zorian and it gave a sufficiently strange result that it warranted a more thorough investigation. (Maybe she used the contact spell that spiders used to track that person with watch/wardbreaker and saw that Zorian was in contact with Kael. So she decided to check if Kael was OK, and then learnt that Kael had never met Zorian)
