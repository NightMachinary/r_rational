  Familiar bonds were mentioned, but Zorian still has no familiar
#+end_quote

I don't think Zorian will get a familiar, become a shifter, or undergo any other such process that would mess with his soul. Who knows how soul bonding would affect the marker or the time travel mechanism? It's too much of a risk to take for the benefits of a familiar.
