To be honest we don't know for certain whether Zach does have such an enormous well of mana, only that Zach can cast magic missiles, flame throwers, etc many times without tiring himself.

His ability to repeatedly cast those spells without running dry can be explained by practicing with them so much that they're incredibly mana efficient by now. Zach has spent a ton of time fighting against the invaders and thus has had a lot of practice with those spells.

The same thing is happening with Zorian. He's become so proficient with magic missile that he can [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/46/Mother-of-Learning]["cast around 35 of them in quick succession"]].

We also know, at least according to Taiven, that the larger your reserves the less proficient you are with your shaping skills. We could assume that Zach is a freak of nature but it would make more sense if he was just an expert at casting magic missile that it barely consumes any mana for him.

Sort of explains why Taiven was adamant that no one could cost 200+ magic missiles without losing their ability to shape magic, when Zorian mentioned it in one of the earlier chapters. Apparently no one practices magic missile enough to be able to do such a thing while Zach has had all the time in the world to do so.
