[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine]]

You can simulate any turing machine on a turing machine. Being turing complete means that you can simulate /anything/, because reality/math is turing complete.

But imagine if your world, your reality, /wasn't/ turing complete. None of your computers could run a turing-complete program, your reality couldn't contain anything that could be used to make a turing machine. Certain mathematical functions would just be impossible, civilizations rise and die, all without being able to run a certain set of functions. As far as they're concerned, the laws of physics simply don't let you do X.

Now imagine that our reality is like that, it's turing complete but it's not super-turing complete. There are functions that are computable by the system "simulating" us that we wouldn't be able to.

Imagining hypercomputation is kind of like that. We don't know what an oracle machine could do, or where they get their information, because they can't exist.

Now there are a lot of things in unsong that seem uncomputable, but cause-and-effect still exists. That implies that the world of unsong is /deterministic/ but not /computable/. That's impossible, so they must be able to compute the uncomputable. When the uncomputable is computable, we call that hypercomputation.

The other hypothesis is that the uncomputable /isn't/ computable, and the universe we see is the result of random noise. If you were to find yourself in a universe like unsong it would be reasonable to assume that your multiverse /isn't/ composed almost entirely of random noise, probably. The explanation for that is a bit more complicated and a bit more dubious.
