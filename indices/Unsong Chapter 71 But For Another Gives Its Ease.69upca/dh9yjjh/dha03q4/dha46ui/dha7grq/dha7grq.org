Hypercomputation can be thought of as a turing machine with several oracle machines tacked on. With the right set of oracle machines, you could do such a computation without it being equivalent to simulating the universe in question. Various things in unsong suggest that god has /some/ access to one or more oracle machines, as their laws of physics don't seem computable on just a turing machine.

In universe, finding yourself in a world with cause and effect that also doesn't seem turing computable implies that hypercomputation (and some set of oracle machines) is possible.
