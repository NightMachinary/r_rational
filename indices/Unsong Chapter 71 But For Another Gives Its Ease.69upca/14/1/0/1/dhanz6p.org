Is there a number of hedons that will make up for generating 1 antihedon? If so, just multiply all the antihedons by that number before working out whether a universe is net-good or net-bad.

Or are there some acts so horrible that they can never be justified, no matter how many trillions of perfectly happy lives will eventually result from them?
