I'm just going to go with Ana and say "they enslave their children's children who make compromise with sin". There's imperfections like stubbed toes, and then there's evil. I fully accept people being inconvenienced, or less wealthy than they might otherwise be, or whatever if that helps the big picture, but I can't truly believe in any sort of morality where a god can create a world with things like genocide and that can be OK.
