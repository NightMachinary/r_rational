Are you saying that an anti-hedon can never be cancelled out by any number hedons? Or just that it's say 6 hedons > 1 anti-hedon > 5 hedons?

Because if it's the latter, that's just disagreeing about units, and given the utter lack of specificity in the story about quantities you can't really tell if God disagrees with you
