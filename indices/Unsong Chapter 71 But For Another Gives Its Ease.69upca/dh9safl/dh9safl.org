On one hand, that's a shit answer. The good and the bad don't just balance out like that. I'd argue for at least a weak form of negative utilitarianism - I just don't believe that a tiny contribution to net happiness is worth /that much suffering/.

On the other hand, the chapter kind of illustrates the point - good enough to still be engaging, bad enough I no longer regret having a prior engagement during the wrap-up party. Utility optimizing for me? Maybe. I mean, I see how it relates to the digrammaton and everything, but yeah, not my favorite chapter.
