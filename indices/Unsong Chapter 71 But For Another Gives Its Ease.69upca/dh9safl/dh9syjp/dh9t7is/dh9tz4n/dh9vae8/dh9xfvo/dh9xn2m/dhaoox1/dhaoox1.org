There are infinitely many infinities.

One can be reached by counting up one at a time: 1. 2. 3. 4. etc. One which is identical to the first, except you start at -0.5. One can be reached by doubling: 1. 2. 4. 8. etc.

If UNSONG world consists of an eternity with at least slightly positive utility and without hell preceded by a temporary period where hell (and its very, very large negative utility) exists, that would eventually produce infinite utility.

But it's still different than the always-maximal-utility paradise described.
