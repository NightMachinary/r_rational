On the other hand, God describes infinite good and states that no more worlds can be infinitely good. So I don't see the destruction of hell as producing infinite good. Eliminating a source of future infinite evil, definitely, but the living world will still contain evil and an insufficiency of good. Eliminating hell is a big and necessary step towards infinite good, and may even be the push towards some net positive goodness, but I don't see it as a sufficient step. Of course, it sounds like the dead and dying go to heaven, but the living will still suffer, and why not simply start in heaven? I suppose we may see next weekend what the correct interpretation is.
