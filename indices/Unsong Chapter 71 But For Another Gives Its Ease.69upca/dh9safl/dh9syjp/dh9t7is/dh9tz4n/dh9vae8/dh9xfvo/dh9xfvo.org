It's interesting to see how the same chapter can be interpreted very differently. The chapter strongly implies that in the UNSONG universe, hell will not be eternal. I interpret this to ultimately result in an infinite degree of net-goodness. However great the degree of past suffering and iniquity, an eternal future without such evil will inevitably produce an unlimited quantity of good to outweigh the finite amount of evil.

Since we are told that this universe is towards the outer edges of the garden, and yet we can still expect an infinite degree of net-goodness, then I interpret the meaning of the garden edges differently. I think this implies that God's omnibenevolence results in all actualized worlds producing an infinite degree of net-good. However, the edges of the garden are where it becomes increasingly difficult and infrequent for a world with such a large quantity of evil to still end up resulting in such an infinite net-good outcome.

Thus all of the coincidences. Rather than one slipped coincidence changing the result from (Good - Evil = 1) to (Good - Evil = -1), I take it that one slipped coincidence would change the result from (Good - Evil = Infinite Good) to (Good - Evil = Infinite Evil). It becomes very rare for seeds in the vicinity of the UNSONG universe to manage to defeat and destroy evil to produce a net-infinite-good eternal future. So that is why God declines to create the worlds that do not produce the favourable result.
