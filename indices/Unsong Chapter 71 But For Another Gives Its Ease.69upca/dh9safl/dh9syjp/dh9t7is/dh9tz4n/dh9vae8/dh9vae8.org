  Because of these wastes of unrealized possibility, there may actually be a very large metaphysical distance in net-goodness between the hypothetical least net-good world and the actualized least net-good world.

I interpret that somewhat differently. The way I read it, even the reason the thicket of non-actualization exists is because even one coincidence less is enough to drive the net-good into negative values, where the world is an "[abomination] of wickedness". Additionally, it appears that net-goodness decreases monotonically as distance from the center increases, and UNSONG's universe is quite far from the center. It would seem that this means that UNSONG is almost certainly about a reality which is only barely worth actualizing by UNSONG!God's standards, and likely not worth actualizing by my own.
