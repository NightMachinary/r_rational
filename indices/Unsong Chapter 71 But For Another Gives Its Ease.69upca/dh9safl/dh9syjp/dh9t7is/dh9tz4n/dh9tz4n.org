Not necessarily the case. We must distinguish between two things: the boundaries of which hypothetical worlds are sufficiently net-good to be worth creating, and the boundaries of actualized created worlds which were able to fulfill those standards. The answer talks about how the world of UNSONG exists surrounded by a metaphysical vast waste of possibilities which were never actualized. This suggests that as you grow nearer to the edges of the garden, the actualized net-good worlds become less and less frequent from among the many possibilities. Because of these wastes of unrealized possibility, there may actually be a very large metaphysical distance in net-goodness between the hypothetical least net-good world and the actualized least net-good world.
