The main problem is that I've gotten vague expressions of interest from real publishers, I'm thinking of pursuing them, but if I did I'd have to do a lot of editing beforehand. I don't even want to think about it until I'm at least finished with the online serial version, and then I'll come to some kind of decision. Don't worry, I'm not going to leave this hanging without letting you know.
