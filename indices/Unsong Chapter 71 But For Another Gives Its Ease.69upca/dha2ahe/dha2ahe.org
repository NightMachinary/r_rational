I also don't buy it.

So, this is fun-theoretic modal realism theodicy. The claim is, to maximise total utility you have to actualize every possible different 4-dimensional block universe where the total amount of goodness is positive. Some of these universes will include instances of unimaginable suffering.

This entire setup is just a temporal version of one of Derek Parfit's [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/][repugnant conclusions]] - the repugant conclusion is a major paradox of Utilitarian reasoning that is still unsolved, but its a paradox for the reason that the conclusion is so repugnant. *If the message of Unsong is that God is moral to actualize all worlds with total utility >0, then it forces us to also accept the repugnant conclusion and all its consequences.*

Unsong will presumably conclude with all the prisoners in hell, freed and able to enjoy a wonderful existence for some enormous length of time. Just as in the repugnant conclusion, for every person suffering immense pain in Hell we can add another person suffering more intense pleasure/happiness for a longer period of time in heaven, making the total utility of that world positive.

These extreme worlds that God occasionally actualised, where everything would turn out best in the end even if there are intervals of extreme suffering early on, would be disqualified by the verisons of consequentialism that were created to avoid this kind of paradox (e.g. a critical level view). He should have actualized only all those universes where the welfare of individuals didn't fall below an absolute level.

So, God has his normative ethics wrong. It's wrong in a more subtle way than in actual religion (where He only cares about individual salvation, rather than individual happiness, thus justifying any amount of human suffering for the sake of greater salvation through faith), but still just mistaken - our values diverge because God's ethics falls victim to moral paradoxes.

Thus, at the end of Unsong, God's answer reduces to essentially the same, first and obvious answer to theodicy that intelligent people have recongised since the time of the ancient greeks - God is all powerful, he does things that are inconsistent with morality as we understand it, so his morality is not ours. If God has values that allow for the existence of Hell, then he may be good according to those values, but he is not good according to a sane human normative ethics.

It's not enough that the total trajectory of the Unsong universe makes it turn out good in the end - worlds containing large numbers of people whose welfare falls below an absolute level shouldn't be actualized. A moral theory that doesn't have this feature will fall victim to the repugnant conclusion and similar arguments. We might not be able to know exactly how to fix our version of Utilitarianism to account for this flaw, but it's clear we do need to fix it somehow.
