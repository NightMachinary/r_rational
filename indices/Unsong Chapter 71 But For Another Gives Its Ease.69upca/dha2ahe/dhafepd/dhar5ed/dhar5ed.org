  This means that God has created a sentient being and tortures it for trillions of years for no reason.

Why for no reason? This statement pretty much contradicts everything else you wrote, since the rest of your comment makes it clear both that there /is/ a reason and that you /understand/ the reason. You can /disagree/ with God's reasoning, of course, but to claim that he had /no/ reason seems empirically false.
