God only creates the initial conditions of a universe (the seed which forms the highest celestial realm Atziluth) at Time 0, so the suffering sentient beings in their boxes have to get there somehow and persist for trillions of years. Let's name the sentient being in the box Robin.

How did Robin get in the box? God may work in mysterious ways, but I don't think absolute bliss would abruptly self-transmute into torture. It's a punishment from God - let's name the representation of the severity of his punishment Thamiel.

We know at least one instance of a universe with a suffering Robin tortured by a Thamiel, but we also know that its "neighborhood" is almost completely barren of other universes worth instantiating. I take this to indicate that God, generally speaking, doesn't instantiate many universes with Hells. If he does instantiate it, there must be something worthwhile there -- God's utilitarianism might be one of the refined flavors that doesn't completely skewer itself on the repugnant conclusion
