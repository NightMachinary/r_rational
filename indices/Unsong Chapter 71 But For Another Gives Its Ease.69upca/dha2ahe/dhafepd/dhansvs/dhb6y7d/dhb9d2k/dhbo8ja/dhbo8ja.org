My interpretation of the text was that there is no fundamental difference between the worlds of perfect bliss where one has a giant Aleph at the center and the other has a giant Bet at the center. Unless the inhabitants are able to interact with these structures, their experiences will be the same. I don't see where in the context of the story this is refuted.

I will agree that if the inclusion of a giant Bet or a box with a suffering person gives the rest of the world's inhabitants a unique set of experiences, not otherwise attainable, then my argument does not hold.
