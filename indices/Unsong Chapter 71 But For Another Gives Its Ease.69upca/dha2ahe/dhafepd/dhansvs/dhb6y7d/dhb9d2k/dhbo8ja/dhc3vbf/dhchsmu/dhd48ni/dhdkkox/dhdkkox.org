I interpreted the text in the chapter to mean that God doesn't create redundant universes, but that redundant minds could exist. My reasoning was that a universe of pure bliss with an Aleph and a universe of pure bliss with a Bet would be distinct universes, but that most, if not all the minds in these universes would be identical.

If you suppose a parallel universe that mirrors ours exactly except for the fact that you didn't brush your teeth this morning, you have two universes that are demonstrably different. Your experience is certainly different, and this may cause some small ripple effect to change the experiences of those around you. But for nearly all of the experiences outside your cone of influence, the universes are fully mirrored. Since these universes are actually different in some substantive way, there would have to be a difference in starting conditions.

If Unsong God does not create redundant minds, or if he has some minimum threshold for considering universes to be distinct, or if the giant Hebrew letters are enough to impact every mind in these universes, then my agrument would not hold.
