If the unsong world is already at the very far edge of the garden, with its mere 6000 years of suffering in hell and its malaria and cluster headaches and guinea hookworms and heartbreak and depression.

Then there are NO worlds in which there is so much evil as you project.

Rejoice, all is whale in the worlds.
