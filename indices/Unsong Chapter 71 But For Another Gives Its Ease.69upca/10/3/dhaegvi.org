Kabbalah already resembles an oracle, in that it allows prediction of events that are not related causally. There's nothing to say the principles of Kabbalah, used by God, don't simply allow Him to determine, via a close reading of Adam Kadmon bare, the eventual goodness of a given universe. He might /model/ entities at some level of granularity, but the whole point of kabbalah is that it lets you skip steps.
