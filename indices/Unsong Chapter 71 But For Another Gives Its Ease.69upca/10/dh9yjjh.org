As a Tegmarkian modal realist, I'm unconvinced that God's choice of whether to instantiate a particular universe actually affects that universe's existence in a morally relevant sense. Indeed, one could even argue that to determine whether a universe is worthy of being created in the first place, God must perform a computation to determine its goodness. Such a computation would likely be equivalent to simulating the universe in question, which in my view is no different from instantiating it directly. Hence, by the very act of determining whether a particular universe is worthy of instantiation, God simulates (and therefore instantiates) every possible universe, including those that fail to meet his criteria.
