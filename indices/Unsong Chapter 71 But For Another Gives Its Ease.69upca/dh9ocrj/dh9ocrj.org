What annoys me is that that explanation for the problem of evil means that you're essentially living in a chaotic universe. Only an absurdly tiny portion of those worlds would have anything resembling cause and effect. Even if we assume we're in a universe where everything leading up to this point happens, almost all of them will immediately devolve into chaos.
