What's surprising isn't the coincidences all adding up to a good result. It's the coincidences all adding up to cause and effect. This isn't watching them drawing the winning lottery numbers on TV and having it match your numbers. It's watching the TV and seeing that, but the TV was never hooked up and you were watching static that just happened to show that.
