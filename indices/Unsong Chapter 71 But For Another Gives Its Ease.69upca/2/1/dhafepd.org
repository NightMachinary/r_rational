So, God will create and sustain a universe where the net total utility is positive over its existence? There is no point in making two identical universes since merging them into one will not result in the loss of any sapient experience, but God can create two universes that differ only very slightly. And, in this story that is exactly what he did. He created a perfect universe, then another that had a minor variation, and another, etc. From the story:

  THERE IS A WORLD MADE OF NOTHING BUT BLISS, WITH A GIANT ALEPH IN THE CENTER. THERE IS ANOTHER WORLD MADE OF NOTHING BUT BLISS WITH A GIANT BET IN THE CENTER. AND SO ON
#+end_quote

Apparently that small variation is sufficient for these to be distinct universes. So it stands to reason that there are a pair of universes which are COMPLETELY IDENTICAL IN EVERY WAY except that in one universe there is a box containing a sentient being who endures unimaginable suffering for trillions of years- and in the other universe this does not happen. Without the suffering box in universe 1, there would be no reason for both of these universes to exist simultaneously. This means that God has created a sentient being and tortures it for trillions of years for no reason.

In fact, since even minor variations are sufficient for there to be a new universe, God would create and torture every possible sentient being in a box in the middle of their own universe surrounded by bliss. In fact, he would create nearly infinite universes for each possible sentient wherein they are tortured in a differently shaped box or one with different markings on its surface. So long as there is sufficient bliss outside these boxes, the net utility of these universes is positive.
