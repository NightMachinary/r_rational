Let's suppose God is an algorithm that creates universes. Before a universe is created, Go checks:

1. Does this exact universe already exist?
2. Will the net utility in this universe be negative?

If the answer to both of these is "no", then the universe will be created. These criteria will allow, for example, the existence of a perfect universe with a giant Aleph in the center, another perfect universe with a giant Bet in the center, etc. Despite the fact that these universes are functionally identical, the algorithm views them as distinct enough to both exist.

There isn't really any reason for these to both exist since the experiences of the inhabitants will be identical, but algodrithm creates both anyway. It isn't accurate to say that the total utility is the sum of utility^{Aleph} and utility^{Bet} because there is no new experience in Bet.

Now suppose you have two almost identical universes. In both universes there is an impenetrable, opaque box in the center. In one universe, this box is empty; in the other universe, the box contains a sentient being who is being tortured. In this case there /is/ a new experience in the second universe, but is is one of negative utility. Algodrithm looks at universe 2 and determines that is is distinct from universe 1 and calculates that even with the torture victim, the net utility of universe 2 is positive. So God creates universe 2.

It has already been established that there is no reason to create two identical universes, and since the experience of those outside the box is identical, the only new information is the experience of the victim. So, yes, I can't claim that there is no reason for God to create universe 2, but functionally, the only reason for him to create this second universe is to torture that one dude for trillions of years.
