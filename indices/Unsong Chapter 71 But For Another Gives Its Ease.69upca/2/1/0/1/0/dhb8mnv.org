The God in Unsong says he only controls the seed of the universe, IE the initial circumstances, and also that he "prunes his garden" of universes regularly. I don't see any reason from the text to assume he doesn't take your point into account.

Assume, however, that the presence of a box containing an ever screaming being might have effects on the sapient beings in that otherwise perfect universe, causing them to differentiate significantly from the other non-screaming box. If you don't take the box having no effect on the other inhabitants of the universe as a given, said inhabitants may be significantly differentiated individuals.
