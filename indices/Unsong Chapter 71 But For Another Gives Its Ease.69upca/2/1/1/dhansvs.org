  So it stands to reason that there are a pair of universes which are COMPLETELY IDENTICAL IN EVERY WAY except that in one universe there is a box containing a sentient being who endures unimaginable suffering for trillions of years- and in the other universe this does not happen. Without the suffering box in universe 1, there would be no reason for both of these universes to exist simultaneously. This means that God has created a sentient being and tortures it for trillions of years for no reason.

The important distinction is that in both universes, there are trillions of sentient beings who are in a state of bliss for trillions of years. By adding the universe with the one suffering entity, the amount of total happiness has increased by trillions minus one.
