God could create two completely identical universes with completely identical inhabitants, but this would be pointless. Merging the universes into one would not result in any information loss since they are the same universe duplicated. From the story:

  IF TWO THINGS ARE THE SAME, THEY ARE ONE THING. IF I CREATED TWO PERFECT UNIVERSES, I WOULD ONLY HAVE CREATED ONE UNIVERSE.

Now suppose you have two almost identical universes. In both universes there is an impenetrable, opaque box in the center. In one universe, this box is empty; in the other universe, the box contains a sentient being who is being tortured. Even though the inhabitants are identical (except the victim), these universes are distinct enough for God to create both of them. The only new information that exists in universe 2 is the torture victim. This means that in creating this universe, the only new information God actually created was a sentient being who is suffering for trillions of years. There is no additional net happiness in universe 2 that is not achieved in the universe without the victim.
