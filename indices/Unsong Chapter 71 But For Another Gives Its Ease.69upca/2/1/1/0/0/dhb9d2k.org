I see the thing you're gesturing at, but I also get the sense that you're jumping to conclusions unsupported by the text. /In the ontology presented,/ the Aleph universe and the Bet universe are considered significantly different enough that the enraptured consciousnesses in each are not redundant, and do count. That single fact---indisputable given the text---knocks your whole argument over (though I admit your argument holds /if we ignore the text/).
