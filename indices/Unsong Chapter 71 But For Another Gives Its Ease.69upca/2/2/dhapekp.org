  We might not be able to know exactly how to fix our version of Utilitarianism to account for this flaw, but it's clear we do need to fix it somehow.

No need. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_and_total_utilitarianism][Average utilitarianism]] suffices to address this particular concern.

(Side note: I'm not an average utilitarian; nor am I convinced that the Repugnant Conclusion is all that repugnant in the first place. But even if I was, I wouldn't take that intuition as strong evidence that total utilitarianism is mistaken, since it's just as likely for my intuition to be mistaken. This sort of "intuition as law" attitude is actually one of my major pet peeves with the field of moral philosophy. It's as if they refuse to even consider the possibility that maybe, just maybe, it's their intuitions that are wrong, not the theory.)
