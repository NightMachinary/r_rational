Ah, I read [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/][Answer to Job]] right after the chapter because I remembered it having the same premise, and in that (but not UNSONG) there's the following quote:

#+begin_quote
  “I DID THAT TOO. I HAVE CREATED ALL POSSIBLE PERMUTATIONS OF THE HAPPY AND JUST UNIVERSE AND ITS POPULACE.”

  “All of them? That would be...a lot of universes.”

  “NOT AS MANY AS YOU THINK.” said God. “IN THE END IT TURNED OUT TO BE ONLY ABOUT 10^{10^(10^(10^(10^{984}}))). AFTER THAT I RAN OUT OF POSSIBLE PERMUTATIONS OF UNIVERSES THAT COULD REASONABLY BE DESCRIBED AS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND JUST. SO I STARTED CREATING ONES INCLUDING SMALL AMOUNTS OF EVIL.”
#+end_quote

That's obviously quite a large number, but still finite. I must have gotten that confused with the chapter, and thought he specified a finite number in both.
