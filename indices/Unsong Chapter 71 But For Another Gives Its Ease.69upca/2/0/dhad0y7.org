I'd be remiss if I didn't add some philosophers do accept the repugnant conclusion, and if you admit that then Unsong's God's actions are at least no worse than actualizing a smaller set of universes, assuming we decide the infinite set of all universes with goodness > 0 is meaningfully larger than the infinite set of all universes with perfect goodness.

However, Unsong is also playing theodicy on easy mode considering its God doesn't allow /infinite/ punishment, and isn't testing people based on their level of faith, unlike the Christian God
