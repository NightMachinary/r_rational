Just in case you haven't seen my explanation below:

The source paragraph is trying to prove that the "analogy between the world and a sea monster cuts across faiths" and extends that to atheists via the pun. The pun hinges on the term "gigantic fluke" and the two meanings of the word "fluke": 1. an unlikely chance occurrence, especially a surprising piece of luck; and 2. either of the lobes of a whale's tail Religious people tend to ascribe to atheists the belief that the world and the universe came about by chance (and not by divine creation); so both meanings of "gigantic fluke" apply. Sorry, that explanation turned out longer than I thought it would.
