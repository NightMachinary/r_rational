It's like in the [[http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%A1-binary/][Binary interlude]]. Under some mapping, you can express Adam Kadmon as a binary string. If you then subtract the perfect Adam Kadmon from this, then you get a 0 at every bit where it differs from perfection.

For each flaw, you need a single piece of information to determine where that flaw is, so flawed Universes are more complex (the perfect Universe, being only 1, is the simplest). Then, you can sort them by the number of flaws:

  “I DID. I CREATED MYRIADS OF SUCH UNIVERSES. WHEN I HAD EXHAUSTED ALL POSSIBLE UNIVERSES WITH ONE FLAW, I MOVED ON TO UNIVERSES WITH TWO FLAWS, THEN UNIVERSES WITH THREE FLAWS, THEN SO ON, AN ENTIRE GARDEN OF FLAWED UNIVERSES GROWING ALONGSIDE ONE ANOTHER.”
