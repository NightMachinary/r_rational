The universes seem to be ranked by their number of flaws, a norm [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics][equivalent]] to complexity.

If only a single universe can grow from each seed, the cosmos is deterministic ("Nothing is ever a coincidence."), and Adam Kadmon has to contain a recording of all true static (the sort of static that has maximal [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory][entropy]]).

If this universe is in the middle of a vast waste, we wouldn't expect to ever see any true static in it, because that static could have been instantiated differently and then there would be a neighbor in the vast waste.

If this universe is in the furthest edges of the garden, we can't have it devolve into true chaos because that'd mean additional complexity and getting even further from the center.

Corollary: Uriel, on the day that he wanted Sohu to remain, reached into Adam Kadmon and eliminated one of the degrees of freedom that could have meant neighbors in the vast waste.
