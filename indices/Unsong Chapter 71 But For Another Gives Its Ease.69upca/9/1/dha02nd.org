  Only an absurdly tiny portion of those worlds would have anything resembling cause and effect.

You're imagining a randomized bitmap. What you should instead be imagining is a set of programs that generate bitmaps, arranged by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity][kolmogorov complexity]]. Almost all of those programs/images will be vastly more deterministic than pure static, presuming that the maximum kolmogorov program has even 1 less bit than the bitmaps they generate.
