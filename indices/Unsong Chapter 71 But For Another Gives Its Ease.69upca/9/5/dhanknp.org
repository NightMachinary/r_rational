God is described as instantiating the seed of the universe, Adam Kadmon, which includes its own laws of cause and effect:

#+begin_quote
  I DID NOT SAY, ANA THURMOND, THAT YOUR WORLD IS GOOD NOW. I SAID THAT ADAM KADMON, ITS SEED, WAS A GOOD SEED. THAT IT WILL UNFOLD, BIT BY BIT, RINGING CONCLUSION AFTER CONCLUSION FROM ITS PREMISES, UNTIL FINALLY ITS OWN INTERNAL LOGIC CULMINATES IN ITS SALVATION.
#+end_quote

"Its own internal logic" sounds like it has rules that it abides by. And this is not implied to be unusual.

We have no idea what a "typical" universe in this space is like; although we know what the centre of the Garden is like, and we have one other sample near the edge, we don't have much of a probability distribution. It could be that universes with smaller descriptions are privileged somehow - that the universes whose laws of physics fit on one page are more common than those which have no coherent laws and whose shortest description is just a list of every event, moment to moment, with no pattern to it.

I mean, the total number of universes God is considering must be finite, right? Consequentialist ethics breaks down when dealing with infinities, the whole system has to be finite to work as Metatron describes. Very large, maybe, but finite (Answer to Job says it's more than 10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{984}}}}} ) And if it's finite, we don't know how many of your "chaotic" universes are even under consideration.

It could be that the typical universe is chaotic with no consistent rules. It could be that the typical universe has consistent rules that don't support life (e.g. there are no stable atoms). It could be that the typical universe is something else entirely. Answers on a postcard, please. But we really have no idea.
