The Unsong universe is in the middle of a barren field; a similar universe that dissolved into chaos prior to Judgement Day would not be, and wasn't, created.

This does raise the question of whether there are other, very different universes that fundamentally lack cause and effect. I think the answer to this is probably "yes" (see the Random Names Of God), but they wouldn't look like you're imagining; the random static must produce good things on average, which means most of these worlds will include "random" magic that produces magically good results n% of the time where n > 50.
