  In the terms of Uriel's Kabballah, Atziluth is the same in all possible worlds, and causality may be classed there

This surely cannot be. Uriel edited Atziluth to create SCABMOM. It must be universe-local.

I think Adam Kadamon, the world seed, is exactly synonymous with Atziluth, and causality may be a /very common feature/ or even universal among different world seeds, but we probably can't say anything about that one way or another
