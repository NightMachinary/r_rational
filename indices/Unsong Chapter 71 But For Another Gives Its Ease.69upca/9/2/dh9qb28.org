Not necessarily*. It's a modal argument. God is instantiating the best (set) of all possible worlds, but he's still limited by possibility and impossibility. He could not, for instance, create a world where squares are round, that has no referent. Things that are necessary in modal terms (like the existence of God or mathematical relations) must exist in all possible worlds. Causality could be such a thing, or perhaps it's emergent from types of cosmogony-seeds that are statistically common in creating goodness. In the terms of Uriel's Kabballah, Atziluth is the same in all possible worlds, and causality may be classed there, or may belong to a large portion of expressions of Briyah by the nature of the former's relation to the latter.
