There are many wishes that would have essentially the same result regardless of either heads or tails. Wishing a specific person 100 km directly towards the center of the Earth would kill said person either way for instance.

Other wishes would be completely harmless to you if the coin lands on tails. Like wishing for a specific valuable item or substance to appear at the exact given coordinates specified in your wish.
