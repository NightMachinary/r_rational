I would hope the coin is smart enough to know what you want to achieve, and create the opposite effect on tails.

For example, it could boil the wish "Move Steve 100 kilometers further away from the earth's center than he currently is" down to "Kill Steve", and on tails it would do something positive for Steve instead. Maybe extend his life by however many years you would have cut it short?

How it calculates these value estimates, though, would be another question. The least exploitable version, I think, would be for it to have some sort of utility function that roughly matches that of the average human, and takes your goals into account when fulfilling the wishes. That way the results are comprehensible and predictable, but harder to game.
