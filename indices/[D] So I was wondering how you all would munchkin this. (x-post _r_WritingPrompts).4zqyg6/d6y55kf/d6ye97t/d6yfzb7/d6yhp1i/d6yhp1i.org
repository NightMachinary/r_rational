That's not really the opposite though. Colloquially, the opposite of "A is moved by X" is "A is moved by --X". Formally, the opposite is "A is not moved by X".

There's no meaning of "opposite" that would lead to "All P such that P is not A are moved by X". Why would it operate on a complementary domain and, further, why would it use "the set of all people" as the superset rather than "the set of all things"?
