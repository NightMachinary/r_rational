I suppose it would depend on how much of a monkey's uncle the coin is. For example, say you want to be more intelligent. Obviously that's dangerous to wish for directly, so you wish for a Fountain of Cleverness. The coin comes up tails. Supposing I'm the genie of the coin, there are a few different opposites I can use here.

1: A fountain is created in the desired location. Anyone drinking from the fountain becomes a complete moron.

2: A fountain is created in the desired location. Anyone who doesn't drink from the fountain is imbued with cleverness.

3: A reverse-fountain is created in the desired location. Everywhere except the inside of the fountain is flooded with the Elixir of Cleverness, and everybody drowns.

4: A fountain is created on Pluto. Anyone who drinks from the fountain becomes a superintelligent paperclip maximizer and destroys the universe.

And so on.
