Plenty of ways to make money.

Put a straddle on a stock (purchase an option to sell it and an option to buy it), then "I wish for this stock to go up by 30% today." (You can make there be a large change, even if you can't control its direction.)

Bet on Leicester City at 5000-1 odds, then "I wish for Leicester City to win the Premier League this year." Or, buy a Powerball ticket and then "I wish for tomorrow's winning Powerball numbers to be 26, 6, 10, 65, 33, with a Powerball of 8." (You can make anything a 50-50 proposition.)

Or, "I wish for the Royals to beat the Red Sox in tonight's baseball game," then flip, then place your bet on either the Royals or the Red Sox. (You know what will happen in advance.)

"I wish for Jack to accept the bet that I'm about to offer him." "Hey Jack, I just flipped this coin and didn't look at it. I bet you $100 that it landed heads." (You can cause the coin state to be correlated with other features of the world.)
