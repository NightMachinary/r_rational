The big problem with this comes from the definition of "opposite".

If it uses stricly logical definition, meaning that the opposite of your wish would be [not][your wish], then you have nothing to worry about. After all, the opposite of a wish "please make it so [a glass of water appears before me]" would be "[a glass of water does not appear before me]"... which is simply [nothing happens]. Nobody said that the coin is creative in it's way of not granting your wishes.

If it uses more language based system, than it totally depends on how the wishes are compiled. RTFM first, munchkin later.
