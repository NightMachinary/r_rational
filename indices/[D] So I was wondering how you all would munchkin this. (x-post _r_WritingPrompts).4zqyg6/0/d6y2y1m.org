Just wish for the coins to always come up heads in the future. If it comes down tails, well it'll always come down tails in the future. If that's the case just wish for the opposite of what you want, hell if you're really lazy just preface all wishes with "I wish for the opposite of x".\\
Anyone who's not a complete idiot should realize that the coin has absolutely no drawbacks if you know which side is going to come up beforehand regardless of which it is.

If you can't manipulate the coin like that then just formulate more complex wishes such that they do the same thing regardless of which side comes up. For instance "I wish for a billion dollars, unless tails came up in which case I wish to be a billion dollars in debt."
