The most likely option is for that coin to land on heads, because the person using it can train themselves in such a way as to flip to one side consistently (And also because wikipedia says the chance of a coin landing on the same side it starts is .51). So the opposite, the least likely option happens-- sides.

To be fair, I don't know how the coin would determine "opposites," but there probably isn't a silver bullet for such a coin, or someone would have already munchkined themselves into godhood.
