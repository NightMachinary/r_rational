If you end up with a pound of dense protons, you'll probably only destroy a large portion of the planet. If you, unfortunately, end up with a pound of electrons, then at least the solar system might last a while longer.

If you convert the Earth to protons and the Moon to electrons, you'll end up with a black hole likely to eliminate the entire observable universe: [[http://what-if.xkcd.com/140]]

Please don't do that. And don't ask for a quantity of up-quarks either.
