You can't wish for static wishes over and over because you don't know how the coin is going to interpret the opposite of the wish, and the coin doesn't have to interpret the opposite of the wish such that a non-reversed wish will fix it. If the opposite of "she loves me" is "she hates me", then your trick will work. But if the opposite is "everyone in the world other than her hates everyone else other than me", it won't work.
