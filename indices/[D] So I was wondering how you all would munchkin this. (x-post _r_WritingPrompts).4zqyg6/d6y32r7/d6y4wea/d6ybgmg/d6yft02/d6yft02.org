But you can interpret "the opposite of a friendly AI on this flash drive" to be "a hostile AI on a different flash drive" (or even "a hostile AI on some place that is not this flash drive".

The entire thing depends on exactly what "opposite" means and whether it has a single meaning or whether the coin gets to choose a meaning so as to screw you over.
