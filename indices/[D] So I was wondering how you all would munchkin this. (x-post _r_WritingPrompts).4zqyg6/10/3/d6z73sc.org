I think you overestimate how much the coin is going to use your definition of wisdom, there's quite a few ways this could go horribly wrong...\\
Firstly they could become superintelligent AIs' dedicated to fulfilling whatever insane goals they had as humans.\\
Secondly if tails they could be superintelligent AIs' dedicated to do the opposite of what their goals were as humans, this would probably turn out even worse..\\
Those are just two scenarios, the definition of wisdom the coin will end up using (the prior two being one's ability to accomplish one's goals) isn't something you can know, /so don't assume it will use the definition you want it to!/
