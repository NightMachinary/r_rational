Hmm, that's not quite what I meant. Maybe I'm not using quite the right words? Let me try to clarify.

People make non-rational decisions all the time. But those decisions are still based on a self-consistent world, in which the reasoning and drivers of that person make sense, even if they're non-optimal. The problem I had with pith is that the decisions of the main character didn't really seem to make sense, even in the context of their own values and experiences. Not doing something that you otherwise should because you were too traumatized by the last time you did that thing is totally understandable, even if it's not the rational choice. Not doing something you otherwise should because it would solve the plot problem too fast... isn't.

Let me give an example from Pith. The MC is driven to obtain a new body for herself, even to the extent of violating her own ethics to a fairly major degree. She accepts extra-legal work to this end, helping criminal groups steal and even kill in the name of her missions. On one of these missions, her fellow agents happily kill the enemy and steal their bodies as needed. Our MC doesn't even for a moment seem to consider taking a body herself, however, despite this being the /central/ reason for her to do every single thing she does in the story. And not just that, she doesn't even /think/ about it as an option to weigh. It's just not even a possibility to be lampshaded; it's just off limits. Why not? the obvious answer is that it solves her central conflict too quickly and easily. There were several such situations that came up, to the point where my immersion was broken. The world and characters didn't seem consistent.

Does that make more sense?
