  the seeming complete lack of rational decision-making of the protagonist kind of turned me off

The that's the bar you've set, you're not going to enjoy the story. The MC is a person with a ton of trauma, naivete, and anger. Not to mention an overinflated sense of justice. They're not going to make the most rational choice all the time (or even most of the time), sometimes they just go with their gut.

But that in itself isn't a bad thing. The only way to make completely rational choices is to to not be invested in the choice personally and/or kill off your emotions. Which would make for a pretty boring MC.
