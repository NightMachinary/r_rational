I'd say that the characters are written rationally rather than written to /be/ rational. This means that they will at times behave irrationally and have consistent blind spots in their thinking because that's what real people are like. I personally think one of the big strengths of this story is that the characters have consistent depth and act in believable ways according to their motivations and experiences, and I find their cognitive blind spots interesting because they speak to the tensions at the core of each character.

I greatly enjoy the story and would absolutely say it's worth reading, but I also don't care if characters make poor decisions so long as those decisions are realistic and driven by the characters and their circumstances rather than the demands of the plot. Make of that what you will.
