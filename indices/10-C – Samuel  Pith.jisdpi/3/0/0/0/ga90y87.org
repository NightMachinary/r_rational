It's funny you picked that example, because the story specifically addresses it. From [[https://pithserial.com/2020/07/07/7-b-the-blue-charlatan/][chapter 7-B]]:

  After many missions, and many coughs, Hira would glance at me with confusion. “You shot so many,” she said. “You should just take their bodies, if they're going to die anyway.”

  When I thought about taking another's body, a yawning pit of disgust opened in my stomach. But I had another reason to hold back.

  Forced transference could only swap. It couldn't force another's Pith into the open air to make an empty chassis, unless you'd studied more advanced techniques.

  Which meant, if I took another's body, I'd have to give up this one.

  And I wouldn't be Ernest Chapman anymore. I'd lose my Grey Coat position with Lorne, lose my best shot at becoming a Paragon student. Maybe my best shot at a new chassis, too, at drinking mulled cider with a friend.

Even without that passage though, I wouldn't have found Ana's behavior to be inconsistent. Her self-righteousness is as central to her character as her desperation and body issues, maybe even more so. I'd be surprised if she resorted to stealing someone else's body while she still had other options available to her that she was working towards, even if the person she was stealing from was about to be killed. She's had to be dragged kicking and screaming past pretty much every moral compromise she's made, it's not something she typically does of her own initiative.

I can't tell you whether or not you'd find the story to improve on your criticisms because I personally never had that problem with it. I never found the characters or world to be inconsistent and I'm genuinely surprised to hear that you did.
