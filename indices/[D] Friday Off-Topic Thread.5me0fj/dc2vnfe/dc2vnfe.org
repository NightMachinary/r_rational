I wrote a short, half-serious (but still very tongue-in-cheek) [[https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/starfishtossingparable/][continuation to that "old man tossing starfish into the ocean" story]] a while back and think it might amuse some here to read it. I wouldn't say it's rational/ist but perhaps it's tangential. Not especially good but also not especially terrible? For that I have the day before yesterday's [[https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2017/01/06/poetry-take-one/][attempt at poetry]] ;D
