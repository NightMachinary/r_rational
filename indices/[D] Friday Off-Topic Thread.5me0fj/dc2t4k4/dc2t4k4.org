I come bearing news of bright and shiny projects!

First off, some time ago I ran a Kickstarter campaign for a book called /Strange Nations/, a collection of cultures that can be dragged and dropped into any setting. With a few exceptions, each culture has 4-8 pages of material, ideas for adapting it to other kinds of settings than the default (e.g. fantasy to space opera, or contemporary horror to fantasy), and best of all it's absolutely positively free.

Pay what you want or don't pay anything at all, it's free for you to download, share, remix, transform, and build upon so long as you extend the same privilege to others, because it's been released into the Creative Commons. [[http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/200950/Strange-Nations-A-Worldbuilding-Resource][Check it out!]].

This isn't all, though. Right now I'm running a Kickstarter campaign for a similar project that goes far more in-depth on individual alien species (40-50 pages rather than 4-8). In addition to being much meatier than /Strange Nations/, this project is designed to fit in with reasonably hard science fiction settings and each write-up not only includes major cultures (and notable subcultures, exceptions, etc.) but also the context of the species: its evolutionary history and other fauna and flora native to the planet. Like /Strange Nations/, it'll be free for anyone to use, and the purpose of the Kickstarter campaign is to outfit it with illustrations.

Does that sound interesting to you? Do you want to see lovely concept art and read more about the species due to appear in volume one? [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/825176040/species-shock?ref=aymbtx][Check out Species Shock here]], take a look at the backer rewards, and boost the signal.

One last thing: I've started up a Patreon campaign to try to fund other projects like these. I'm committed to releasing as much creative material as possible into the Creative Commons (you may have noticed that HSTW is in the CC too!), and by getting funded on Patreon I can not only afford to spend more of my time on these books but also cover the costs of smaller projects that might not warrant Kickstarter campaigns in themselves but would nevertheless break my budget if I added them together. I have five booklets written already, from a book on comparative mythology to a comparison of "horse nomad" cultures from the Great Plains and the Eurasian Steppe.

If you enjoy /Strange Nations/, /Heroes Save the World/, or anything else that I've written, then [[https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks][supporting me on Patreon]] will ensure that I can keep producing at my current rate and help me to produce even more.

Thanks to [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] for giving me permission to post this.
