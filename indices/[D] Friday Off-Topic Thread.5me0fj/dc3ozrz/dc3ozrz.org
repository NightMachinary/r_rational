I just read [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=27382][Why Batman Can't Kill People, Part 1]] & [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=27397][Part 2]].

This touches on some things I've noticed about rationalist fiction vs other fiction. We're generally actually going for a specific effect that requires bending the world in ways that don't necessarily make all that much sense from an outside perspective.

The ratfic world isn't more /realistic/ than other fantasy literature, necessarily, but tends to be more fantastical in ways that make science/rationality a useful trait for the hero personally in achieving their personal goals, much as other genres bend their worlds to make other character traits (like Batman's urge to personally punch villains in the face instead of sending money to good causes) more useful.
