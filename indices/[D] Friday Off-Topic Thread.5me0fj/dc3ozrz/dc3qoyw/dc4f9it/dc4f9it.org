Interesting points. Actually the direct comparison of Mafia to Rational genre might be useful. I wonder how much Hollywood Mafia stylistic stuff would translate directly to the rational genre if you lifted it there. (Fedoras! Uh... maybe?)

It occurs to me that one reason Mafia gets away with a lot of stuff in literature without losing audience sympathy is due to being family oriented (since family tends to be inherently sympathetic due to our evolutionary roots -- it's common to be willing to kill for family in at least some contexts). A "crime family" is still a /family/, despite the tension between family values and criminality, and that tension can be exploited to make a story interesting to a broad audience rather than just being about gawking at the horrors of criminality.

So as a parallel: What does a "rational family" look like? What kind of universe lends/bends itself towards commentary about familial bonds while also rewarding scientific nerdiness / munchkinry / transhumanistic ascension?

In the real world I think many rationalists experience alienation from their birth family due to adoption of memes like atheism and utilitarianism that conflict somewhat with the theistic/tribal mentality that favors large family sizes. The alienation factor itself has drama potential, but might need to be coupled with reconciliation if you want to appeal to a wider audience.

You can see some elements of rationalist familial alienation at play in HPJEV's conspicuous alienation from his birth parents (and sometimes condescending attitude towards his adoptive parents) and Taylor Hebert's constant lying to / hiding from her dad. They tend to form bonds with the intelligent people they "work" with (Hermione, Lisa) which the story spends more time on, with parents being more a matter of backstory.

Zorian's relationship to Kirielle is the best example I can think of off the top of my head of a positive family relationship in ratfic, and even there it's despite significant family alienation (he doesn't get along with his parents, resents his older brother, and considers Kirielle mostly to be an annoyance at the beginning).
