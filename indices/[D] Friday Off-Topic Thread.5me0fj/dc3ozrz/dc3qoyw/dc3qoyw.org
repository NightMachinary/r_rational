Agreed.

Also I think all that wish fulfillment is ineffectively trying to mask a certain inner emptiness of the rationalist mindset. Who would want be the cambist when they could be Lord Iron? That makes me wonder if, instead of creating wish fulfillment for the mindset as it currently is, rationalist writers should get busy making up a new and exciting mindset for the demographic. After all, Hollywood invented the cool mafioso image out of whole cloth, and real mafiosi adopted it.

Eliezer's Harry was a small step in that direction, I wish others would join in. You don't even need a fantastical setting. Finding the mindset is the hard part, and then you can just write about everyday stuff.
