Posting rants about a specific story / community not being rational (cf the Doctor Strange thread, the SV thread with the guys who hated us). You can't do it too often though, or the mods will probably catch on and ask you to stop.

Also it's mostly against the spirit of this sub and it's kind of dark side-ish, but I guess that's par for the course in a shitpost.

EDIT: Wow, this post is weirdly popular. My inner Skinner's rat likes it!
