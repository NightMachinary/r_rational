I haven't discovered any non-useful ways of karma-farming here. The simplest (but not necessarily easiest) way is to find a moderately rational, moderately consistent fanfic and post every chapter as it comes out. That's only good for a dozen or so karma per post, but anything more than that requires real effort.
