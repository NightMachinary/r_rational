Nah, "rational fiction" is useful from both a prescriptive and descriptive point of view, even if it doesn't encapsulate the entirety of the genre. "Hardened" on the other hand, doesn't describe this kind of fiction particularly well, and neither does it intuitively instruct authors in how to write in-genre.
