Writing that vampire yaoi novel. Trying to keep it rational. It's surprisingly hard. Vampires have all their own little rules and whatnot, and the vampire's lover would certainly figure some of the more obvious/culturally entrenched ones out pretty quickly. So I had to do a scene early on where the human finds out that the vampire needs to be invited into dwellings.

Here's the scene: [[http://pastebin.com/RswZ7Dg6]] - this has been a very... vulnerable experience for me, to do this writing, so if you're feeling kind enough to give me your thoughts, while I'd love criticism on the general rationality and plot elements, I haven't edited it thoroughly enough to be comfortable with people editing it for style, flow, grammar, and so on.

It was challenging to figure out how to make the above scene go down from a Rational perspective. The vampire is obviously 1500 years old and doesn't actually think of the human as human the same way we do, so he's going to want to trust him with as few weaknesses as possible, and exaggerate his strengths, and doesn't have any more moral problems with lying to a human than you would with lying to your cat. The human, on the other hand, is both entranced by this attractive, charismatic, powerful creature and kind of scared of him on some level because he does eat blood and whatnot. But the vampire absolutely cannot enter the house without an invitation, and in part plans to use the human's presence to keep other vampires away from him, so the human's going to need to know about this. So I'm wondering now does this scene have the vampire giving up the information too easily, or, conversely, not easily enough (should he just say "by the way you'll need to invite me in and then we can get right back to the kissing" since he rationally knows the human will figure it out pretty quickly).

Anyway, my writing/editing progress, as always: [[https://www.beeminder.com/mad/janowrimo]]
