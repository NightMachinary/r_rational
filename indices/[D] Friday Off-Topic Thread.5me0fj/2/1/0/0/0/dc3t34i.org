I like this term, but I'm not sure it applies since I invented the problem myself. Everyone told me that I'd still enjoy Abridged without having seen DBZ, but I thought I'd enjoy it more. Then I watched DBZ and thought I'd enjoy it even more if I had seen Dragon Ball. I chose to shave the yak even though I didn't need to.
