  am now reading dozens of chapters of a manga, so I can watch dozens of episodes of a anime, so I can watch dozens more episodes of another anime, so I'll find an abridged series funnier. I cannot think of a worse example of mission creep I have ever experienced in my life.

Hilarious. If you read the manga, why on earth (or Namek) would you then watch the multiple-levels of derived animated series?
