I'm rationalizing it as the more over-the-top fights are worth watching in animation. Hopefully by the time I get there I will like the characters enough that I can tolerate the annoyingly slow pace. However, I'm going to watch Kai since it cuts out all the filler so it shouldn't be so bad...right?
