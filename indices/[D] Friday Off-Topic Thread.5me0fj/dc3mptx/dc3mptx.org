I hope you can follow my logic here because I certainly can't. My friends are all fans of Dragon Ball Z so they've been nagging me to watch Abridged. However, I have never seen DBZ so I wanted to watch the show first even though I don't usually like shonen. I ended up enjoying the first three episodes of Kai, but I decided I wanted the backstory on all these characters so I started watching the original Dragon Ball show and later switched to the manga so I could get through the early story arcs faster.

I am now reading dozens of chapters of a manga, so I can watch dozens of episodes of a anime, so I can watch dozens more episodes of another anime, so I'll find an abridged series funnier. I cannot think of a worse example of mission creep I have ever experienced in my life, especially with such little incentive to do so or reason to think I'll get a significant return on my time investment.

I actually think this might wind up being a net-negative for me since after enduring this franchise I'm not going to have an excuse to avoid jumping into others. I previously refused to continue watching Adventure Time because I didn't like the early episodes, but now I'm specifically choosing to inflict a series on myself when it's just been okay so far. Is this what Dragon Ball does to you?

To be clear, I'm still enjoying myself and don't have anything more important on my plate right now. I'm just really surprised with myself for doing this when no one asked me to. I don't regret the decision I've made, but it's pretty damn weird that I made it and haven't regretted it so far.
