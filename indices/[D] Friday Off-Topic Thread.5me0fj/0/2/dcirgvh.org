Just want to say thankyou for allowing me to beta-read the Agloanikoi concept. I just realised that I subconsciously ported the concept of ritual warfare into my vampire story, because it's a logical extension of things that had been well established about vampires as a species.

Vampire wars are fought between individuals, though, and can consist of everything from "sending armies" to seeing who can write the superior opera.

Writing this note also made me realise that I never actually got around to backing the project. I've gone and done so and I hope you're able to reach the pledge goal!
