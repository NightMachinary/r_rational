Happy to have an idea soundboard, though I'm pretty happy with the plot of the first "volume" at the moment - the Tribute War makes a good way to introduce a new character and with it a source of conflict.

I showed the story to my boyfriend who pointed out some issues with the plot and pacing. At the moment I'm frantically going for quantity over quality, so the prose needs a /lot/ of polishing. Also, it's a yaoi romance whose first volume is set in WW2 Rome/Corsica/(yet-to-be-written)Ohio, so it's a style departure from the sort of stuff I tend to see here.

If you're still happy to read it and perhaps offer some high-level feedback, I'll email you some links as well as my outline for the rest of the plot.
