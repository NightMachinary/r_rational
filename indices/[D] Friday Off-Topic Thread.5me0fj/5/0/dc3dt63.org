  Are there general rules available that govern how chemistry happens between atoms, without needing to make 10000 special cases for every combination?

Yes! We call it quantum-mechanics; you can solve Schodinger's equation and find out everything you need to know. For nuclear reactions, you can run experiments and use empirical relations to approximate the functional forms of the interaction potentials for the strong and weak forces. Alternatively, if you prefer theoretical work, you can take a crack at [[http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/yang%E2%80%93mills-and-mass-gap][Yang-Mills theory]] and try to win one of the Millenium Prizes.

But actually being frank and helpful, not really. If you want lots of tables of atomic and molecular data, [[http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/][NIST]], the National Institute of Standards and Technology, has a lot of them, but I'm not sure if they include reaction rates for these things. In practice, using a lookup table is actually the fastest and most reliable way to do this stuff, even for academic chemists. Deriving reaction rates from first principles is a useful exercise for a physical chem or quantum chem class, but it's much too time consuming to do it directly in any kind of context.

Honestly, I'm a little baffled at what you want to accomplish with this game. You don't need to force chemical reactions, they already happen. Even if we take the premise for granted, I feel like a "simple video game" would not benefit at all from an addition of actual chemical reaction rates in its "magic system". Maybe you can elaborate a bit about what you have in mind?
