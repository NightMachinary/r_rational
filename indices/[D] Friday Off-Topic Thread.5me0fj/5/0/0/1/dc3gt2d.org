Some of the idea of making atoms via fusing/fissioning/forced chemical reaction sounds a bit like [[http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/][Spacechem]], but more based on whatever the magic is you want with the outputs and less on 2D puzzle solving. Spacechem is not really based on science at all though, except for the chemistry 'theme' - it uses chemistry more as an aesthetic and to draw background from, rather than as a central point.

Spacechem is itself a really awesome puzzle game that gets extremely difficult and complicated. I strongly recommend the game.
