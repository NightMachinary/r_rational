One thing I forgot to mention before is that magic acts as a pseudo-gas, and doesn't react well with solids (other than nano-scale powders). 1m^{3} of air contains about 3 * 10^{25} molecules that the magic can interact with, while 1m^{2} of graphite is about 1 * 10^{19} surface atoms, or 3 000 000 times less reactive to magic than a gas is (other solids are similar, at least within an order of magnitude or two).

Also, anything involving multiple molecules as an input is much harder/slower/more expensive to do as well, because there has to be a collision between magic and molecule 1, and then a second collision between [magic + molecule 1] and molecule 2 before anything happens. This severely limits the yield, as magic has a very, very short halflife after it is in the air.

Given that, I have a hard time seeing a mechanism for creating anything heavier than mercury (from sulfur hexafluoride), and I'm thinking I might just handwave fission away by saying that the Ancient Ones set a spell on the world that converts neutron radiation to hydrogen quickly enough to stop it from hitting the next atom over and continuing the chain reaction.
