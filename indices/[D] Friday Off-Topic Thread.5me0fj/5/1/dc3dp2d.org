I don't have a link on me for the database, but it definitely exists.

The field you're looking for is called "computational chemistry", and I'd strongly recommend starting by modifying some open-source scientific simulation software.

Note that for big (accurate) simulations, you need a supercomputer - benchmarks like "10^{6} atoms for 100 nanoseconds /only/ took 38 hours (on 16 CPU cores)" are common. I mean, don't start with one that does quantum solving - stochastic is plenty for a game.
