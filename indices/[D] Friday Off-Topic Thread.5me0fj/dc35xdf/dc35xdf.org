I just finished an inorganic chemistry class, and I'm thinking of making a simple video game containing magic that forces chemical/nuclear reactions (nuclear reactions produce no heat, because magic) based off of rates of reaction.

I have two questions based on that: where can I find basic information on all of the elements, in computer readable format, and are there general rules available that govern how chemistry happens between atoms, without needing to make 10000 special cases for every combination?
