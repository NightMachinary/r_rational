See I'm not sure you realize how absurdly powerful a magic system with just those capabilities is. In addition the idea that you would use the magic to recreate spells from D&D is also kind of absurd, but I'll assume you weren't seriously saying those would be among the most effective uses of the power.

See the thing is that if you're going to use a nuclear based magic system, then radiation will need to be considered. For instance somebody could take lead and fuse it with a hydrogen and a helium to get astatine which is /extremely/ radioactive. In fact if they created a sizeable chunk of astatine then you have a nuke.\\
Quite a lot of elements are extremely unstable and creating them with this power would be making a nuke. So obviously the question becomes can you use this magic from a distance? Because if so it destabilizes everything in your setting, and if not then you still have to worry about insane mages wiping out entire cities if they don't care about dying.

Also it goes without saying that depending on a rarity of magic rare elements would either not be that rare, or be much less so. This effect would be much more pronounced when it comes to elements that are naturally extremely rare, where creating a few hundred pounds of the stuff would increase the amount in existence several fold.

Also unless there's a separate magic system for healing, then you have way more problems than just the threat of initial casualties from atomic blasts.
