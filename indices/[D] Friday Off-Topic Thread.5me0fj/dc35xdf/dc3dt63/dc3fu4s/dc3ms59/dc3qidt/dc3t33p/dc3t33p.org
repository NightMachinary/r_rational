Requiring that fusion/fission use gasses won't alleviate the problems I raised. For instance you would be able to simply strip a hydrogen from radon to get astatine which as I pointed out earlier is /extraordinarily/ reactive. Limiting the base materials to gases makes things trickier but I don't actually think it rules out anything, I mean there's no element you couldn't get by fusing the right gases together. Hell with the right equipment you can expand your selections of gases drastically at high temperatures.

  Also, anything involving multiple molecules as an input is much harder/slower/more expensive to do as well, because there has to be a collision between magic and molecule 1, and then a second collision between [magic + molecule 1] and molecule 2 before anything happens. This severely limits the yield, as magic has a very, very short halflife after it is in the air.

Not sure how that works, why is it harder for the magic to fuse different atoms of the same type together than to fuse two different atoms? Maybe this just applies to scenarios with more complex molecules, because i'm mostly thinking in terms of atoms since once you get the atoms you can just use conventional methods to synthesize most molecules.

  Given that, I have a hard time seeing a mechanism for creating anything heavier than mercury (from sulfur hexafluoride), and I'm thinking I might just handwave fission away by saying that the Ancient Ones set a spell on the world that converts neutron radiation to hydrogen quickly enough to stop it from hitting the next atom over and continuing the chain reaction.

First off, you really should have referenced a periodic table because the fact you forgot radon is dissapointing. I mean yes there are gasses that are heavier, but for these purposes the only thing that matters is atomic number. Secondly, stopping neutron radiation would make normal nuclear weapons not work (which would have horrifying effects on the world) however it doesn't do anything against the type of method I mentioned.\\
Remember the elements you would be creating with this magic (for atomic explosions) wouldn't be ones that required a neutron cascade to detonate. There are plenty of radioactive elements that just have absurdly short half lives which would immediately explode in less than a second after they are created.

Also trying to implement that neutron radiation handwave would be extremely implausible/catastrophic. For one all nuclear power would fail, cutting out power in many places, but even worse it would affect stellar fusion in complex ways I can't really predict, but would almost certainly mean the destruction of the earth. Plus you're forgetting that neutrons are not the only form of radiation that could cause a nuclear chain reaction, yes things would be toned down without neutrons, however alpha, beta and gamma radiation would still work for sufficiently reactive elements.
