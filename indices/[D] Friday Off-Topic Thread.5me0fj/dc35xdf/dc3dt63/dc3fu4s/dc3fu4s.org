The unique selling point of the game would be that all spells are crafted from relatively simple roots: fusing atoms, fissioning them, and forced chemical reactions (all of which have no byproducts like heat, radiation, or neutrons).

"[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/flare.htm][Flare]]" isn't an elementary spell, it is a combination of three basic effects: [Fusion of Nitrogen molecule -> Silicon, Fission of Silicon to 1x Helium + 1x Magnesium, and a spark to activate it]. "[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/fireball.htm][Fireball]]" can be done multiple ways, including [Fusion of Oxygen molecule -> Sulfur, Fission of Sulfur to 16x Hydrogen atoms, and a spark to activate it] (which has the side effect of producing a large gust of wind as extra gas appears) or [Fusion of Nitrogen molecule -> Silicon, Fission of Silicon to 1x Helium + 2x Carbon, and a spark to activate it] (which is gas-volume-neutral). Alternatively, you could break existing CO2 and H2O up chemically into individual atoms, and just let them combust naturally. "[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/cloudkill.htm][Cloudkill]]" is as simple as water vapor -> neon -> hydrogen + fluorine.

My problem is figuring out what the gasses (or powdered solids, in the case of carbon) do after they are created.
