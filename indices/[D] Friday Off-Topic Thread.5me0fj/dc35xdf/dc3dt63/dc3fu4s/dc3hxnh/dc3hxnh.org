Well since they're mundane elements they can only do mundane things: nothing, smell funny, poison you, turn into something else through a chemical reaction that can happen in normal atmospheric conditions, or explode. Obviosuly with varying degrees degrees of each option.

Also, I hope you're aware that with these rules a normal mage can make infinite energy by creating fissionable material out of nuclear waste. They can't make easy fusion, but you can take spent material from a fission reactor, cold fuse it back into the fissionable parent, and hand it back to the plant for processing.
