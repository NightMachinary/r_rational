To me that's a different thing. "Hard" scifi or "hard" fantasy runs on rules, but it's not necessarily about thinky stuff, which is what I consider to be one of the hallmarks of rational fiction. Unless "hardened" is being used in a different way, in which case I think there's too much room for confusion with existing genre definitions.
