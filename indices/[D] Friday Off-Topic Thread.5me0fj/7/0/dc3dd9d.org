Contra [[/u/Roxolan][u/Roxolan]], discussion posts are not unrestricted. We ban 'what if' threads, you're only allowed to post one brainstorming thread per original chapter, and posts should otherwise be rational fiction or in a weekly thread.

Mostly it's that if nobody reports a post, I tend to only remove the really clear cases. So be the change you want to see! Cast votes, and report rule-breaking!
