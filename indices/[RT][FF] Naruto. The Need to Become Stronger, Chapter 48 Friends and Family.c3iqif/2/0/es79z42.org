Oops, I hadn't responded to this yet, but the family thing wasn't meant to be some kind of big reveal. It was just Sasuke's way of answering Naruto's question, “what am I to you?” And yes, there's the double meaning that the Uzumaki split off from the Senju and the Senju and the Uchiha both descended from the Sage, so in a sense they are brothers - just not a literal sense :)

I'll try not to make you wait too long with the updates.
