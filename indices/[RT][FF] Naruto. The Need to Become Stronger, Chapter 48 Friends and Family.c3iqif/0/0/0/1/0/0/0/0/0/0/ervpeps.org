  Yes, but he inspired Nagato to go superevil in the first place, so everything Akatsuki does can kinda be traced back to him.
#+end_quote

Yes, but what was Nagato's motivation to make the organization that way? And does an inspiration mean the guy is responsible for the others actions? There's a difference between indirect and direct causes.

#+begin_quote
  He has no reason to think that.
#+end_quote

You're kidding, right? He has /every/ reason to think that. The whole reason Tamari and Kankuro attacked him and his friends /in the first place/ is because Naruto killed Gaara. They ceased to get their revenge on him. It's is 100% likely that, if they are left to their own devices, they /will/ come back to fight him again, and they /will/ have no problem torturing and tormenting his friends if its means they can get to him. His performance in this battle shows he is willing to go out of the way to save his friends, directly proving that they are correct in their assumptions as to how he will act. Rationally, they will /have/ to go after him again.

  which hugely decreases the chances of them running into each other.
#+end_quote

The odds are pretty much 100%, because they will actively seek Naruto and his friends out. Sure, if Naruto stays in the land of the Leaf for the rest of his natural life, he might be somewhat successful in avoiding them in the future, but that requires he take all his hopes and dreams and chuck them in a dumpster.

#+begin_quote
  Naruto did teach Temari how to summon people (and indirectly, how to puppet people)
#+end_quote

OK, so one critical secret instead of one ultimate secret. Everything else still applies.

#+begin_quote
  Naruto definitely wouldn't go around assassinating people just because they know something about how ninjutsu works. I don't think defaulting to murder is rational at all.
#+end_quote

Good thing no one is making that argument that he's 'defaulting to murder' then. Sure, Naruto won't go around assassinating /random people/ for that reason. But /specific/ people who hold a grudge, murder and torture his friends, are political enemies to his homeland, and have critical secrets and are /right there/ fighting against him or trying to get away? Yeah, he'd at least consider it seriously, and realize it will be a future problem if he lets it go.

#+begin_quote
  Considering how Kankuro and Temari were actively falling back towards the bulk of the Sand's forces, and considering how Naruto's orders were to evacuate himself and Sasuke, retreat makes perfect sense.
#+end_quote

We've had battles where things are determined in /seconds/. I'm pretty sure he's got time to make the attempt. I mean, it's not like they don't just wander off on foot afterward slowly while Naruto, Sasuke, and Shino all decide to have a chat and perform some battlefield triage on the fallen. Naruto and Co didn't really retreat, they just sat there and let the sand leave. I'd agree that if the Sand ninja were like /right over there/ making a commotion and flashes of light and sounds of battle were getting closer, they might have some urgency.

The only /real/ argument for him not trying to kill at least one of them is whether or not his rather rational rant toward them was heartfelt and he was thinking it reasonably likely he could convince them that they shouldn't fight because they were being played. In that case, it's more him making a gamble on being merciful helping convince them he's serious.

#+begin_quote
  And with regards to common grunts not being dangerous... it doesn't work that way in NTBS.
#+end_quote

That was painfully obvious with the "Hokage killed during a training exercise" bit, which I appreciated. But you've also had scenes where it's pointed out the low tier genin and chunin just got /mulched/ by their vastly more experienced opponents, so I find that strictness of this rule rather questionable.

There aren't power levels in the conventional sense, but there are certainly 'tiers' of threat, and most of those common dudes aren't anywhere in Naruto's weight class, just like he's not in the division of the leaders or sanin. In any event, those threats aren't even visible or anything to him, and there's as much odds that Leaf ninja are in the retreat path as Sand.

#+begin_quote
  And as you could see from Kabuto's fight with Sakura, that kind of attitude could get you killed.
#+end_quote

Yes, but I'm referring to /running away/ prudently when you're obviously outmatched by a visible threat. You're referring to /trying to solo someone/ arrogantly because you think you are better than they are in every way. That's not a character flaw this Naruto has.
