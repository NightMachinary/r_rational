  that was basically Danzo's argument in both canon and in this story. But everyone hates Danzo and thinks he's evil when he says stuff like that

To be fair, when you have a militaristic pragmatic rationalist express his opinion and put his methods into action, a /lot/ of people get squeamish really quickly. Even, or especially, if their approach is probably the best possible solution.

  Rasa and Chiyo explicitly mock the Third and say he is a fool for not killing them.

And they are right. They have just butchered many of his people, led to the deaths of several of his most powerful supporters, and have shown zero remorse for what they have done. It's not the first time they have betrayed him or set him up in an almost impossible position politically in an attempt to bring him down.

And then he just /lets them get away with it/. No concession or agreements on their part aside from "stop attacking us now and we'll not attack you". Of course they laugh. Hell, /I/ laughed when reading it, and still can't believe him.

Sounds like a false dichotomy to me. We're talking about Naruto, right? Who, even in canon, is almost always the guy to Take A Third Option?
