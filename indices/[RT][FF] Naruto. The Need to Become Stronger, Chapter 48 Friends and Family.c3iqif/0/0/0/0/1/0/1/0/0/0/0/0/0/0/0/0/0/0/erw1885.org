  You're telling me someone who's whole power is being able to figure things out about people, wouldn't be able to convince a coworker that they interact with favorably over a long period of time that their boss is losing touch, and maybe it's time for a change in management?

Sure, her power can justify it, but her power could justify /anything/. That's part of the problem. Her power is a black box that sometimes tells her things and sometimes doesn't. It isn't satisfying to have her do stuff like that offscreen and have it work based on what essentially boils down to "a precog did it". There was not enough set-up for her bribing his mercs, and so it wasn't a satisfying resolution for me.

  The fact that he failed to kill her while using his power to stay safe, WAS shown on-sceen at least once, that was the point of the "he's going to kill you" subplot in the Mayor attack. We ALSO know that he HAD to use his power without a safe timeline, because time still moves normally forward, he just gets two shots at things.

But all of that is just an in-story justification designed to give Tailor a chance. There is no way, absolutely empathically /no way/ that someone like you or I would actually go "Huh, looks like my super-secret simulated attempts to kill this one superpowered individual all keep failing for some weird reason. I guess I have no choice but to do it again except for real this time, despite having no reason to think the outcome will be any different. Oh, and since just shooting her apparently doesn't work, I guess I'll instead use a convoluted scheme involving a perfect body double meant to trick her friends into thinking she betrayed her, and at the same time teleport her into a burning building that she can't escape out of unless she happens to have a gun or something, and I'll just stake my entire life on that. Yeah, sounds good."

The whole sequence is a comic book plot. And that would be fine, in principle, if it were that kind of story. But Wildbow generally tried to have things make sense. Coil was presented as a dangerously smart, rational villain. A ridiculous plot like this, where he ditches his best defence on a ploy that hinges on using new technology to copy her powers, her friends not catching on, her not being able to escape a building etc. when he *knows* that he already failed to kill her several times in the past... it makes zero sense.

  As far as how Taylor's reaction to Dinah's condition and lack thereof for all the other messed up shit, yes, that's true, it's also the point. She's basically using her as a rationalization for everything she's doing. It's the same as her "oh it's okay because it's just cover so I can bust these guys later." She's trying to rationalize her bad decisions but digging herself deeper.

Oh sure. That part is weird, but in character. Her odd psychology could sometimes make her frustrating to read, but it's not bad writing by itself.
