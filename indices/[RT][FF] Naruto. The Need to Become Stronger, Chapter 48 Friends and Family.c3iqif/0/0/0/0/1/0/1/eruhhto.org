It's not hard for me to see why people found Bonesaw redeemable; she was a fundamentally innocent child forced to become a monster to survive, while being put through constant psychological and emotional abuse. The only agency you can really argue her having was choosing not to kill herself at ~8 years old before Jack could basically brainwash her.
