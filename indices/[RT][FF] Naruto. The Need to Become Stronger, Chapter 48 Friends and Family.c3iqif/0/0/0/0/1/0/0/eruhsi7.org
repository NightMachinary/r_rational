  I... honestly don't see the difference between these two. Evil for its own sake is inherently irrational.

I mean more people who do evil knowing it's evil. Card carrying villain types tend to be more well-liked, for some reason - perhaps just because they're more obviously a fantasy and so don't register as a threat. People are much more likely to have personal bad experiences with irrational idiots than with hammy supervillains, so the latter is seen as harmless, or something like that. It's always been interesting to me how some people can write apparently sincere articles about how Thanos or Killmonger or Scar is actually the hero of their story, while at the same time thinking of their own politicians as unforgivable monsters. It's an odd quirk of human psychology.

  While pure genocide should be off the table, there's no way their /nation/ should be allowed to survive in its current form.

At the risk of bringing politics into this... didn't we learn from recent history that regime change is usually a terrible idea? If you think of the Sand as fantasy Iran, assassinating their leadership doesn't seem like nearly as good of an idea. The Third in this story has basically been doing the only thing he can do - try to improve relations with the current ruler to prevent the whole situation from becoming seriously worse.
