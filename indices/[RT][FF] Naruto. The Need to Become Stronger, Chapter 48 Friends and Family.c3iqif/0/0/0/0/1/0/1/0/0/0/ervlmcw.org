Okay, but... usually, child soldiers don't just change to "yeah, I'm good now" overnight. I get that you don't want to go over long periods of psychological treatment in a story like that, but it just feels... wrong. It wasn't just bonesaw either. The story was constantly going "hey remember that villain from 2 pages back? yeah we're on the same side now." Then again, the central premise was already that heroes and literal nazis were playing a game of cops and robbers with each other so they can team up to fight Godzilla, so I guess it's just one of those things you're supposed to roll with.
