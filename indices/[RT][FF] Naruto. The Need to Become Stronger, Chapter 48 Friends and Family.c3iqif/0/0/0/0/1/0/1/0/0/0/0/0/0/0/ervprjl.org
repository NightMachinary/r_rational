Oh no, I totally agree with that last paragraph. There is a lot of good character stuff in there, the world building is great, the escalation of drama is fantastic, all of that is true. And I certainly agree that rationality does not replace the need for a character-driven plot. HPMOR was written with the same philosophy, in fact.

But, that doesn't change the fact that in Worm things sometimes happen for no reason. There are a lot of "because path to victory says so" moments, which is just as stupid as when that happened in HPMOR, and things like "a Simurgh did it" is no better than the wizard version of the same. Yes, it's fine to sometimes have things happen without the POV characters understanding why, but things like the endbringers changing sides did not feel like it was properly set up to me, it just seemed like it happened because it was cool.

And the story does struggle a bit with constantly wanting to move on to the next cool thing. I remember being excited for the upcoming confrontation with Kaiser, but then Leviathan showed up and it was just dropped. I remember speculating excitedly about how they might counter Coil's power, but then he just drops his guard and dies. A lot of the time, I had this sense of immense potential that wasn't really explored because there always had to be new cool things going on, and by the end there were 10 new characters introduced for each old character that disappeared, to the point where it just wasn't a character-driven story anymore because they're all fighting to stop a prophesy because some character said so and now the SH9 are being mass produced so we have to fight them and wait that person is a bad guy now so I guess we have to change sides again...

Awesomeness is great, but a story also needs to have room to breathe. Worm didn't always get that, which was a pity.
