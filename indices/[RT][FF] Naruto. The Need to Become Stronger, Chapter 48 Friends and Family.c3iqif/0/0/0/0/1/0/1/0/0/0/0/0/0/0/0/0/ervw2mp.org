With regards to Coil, I can only link you to this crushing rebuttal in reply: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-need-to-become-stronger.33074/page-6#post-8773524]]

All nonsense aside though, the implications of his power were never really explored, and saying "he used it off screen for off-screen reasons really doesn't work from a story-perspective. The point is that there is buildup, you raise audience expectations... and then the thing simply doesn't happen. That doesn't mean that what does happen can't still be awesome, but you still end up disappointing some readers by never doing the thing you had effectively promised you would do. It's like Chekhov's gun: If you show the reader a cool railgun at the beginning of the story, it should be fired on-screen - not mentioned between lines how it couldn't be used in the final fight because it was already used off-screen.
