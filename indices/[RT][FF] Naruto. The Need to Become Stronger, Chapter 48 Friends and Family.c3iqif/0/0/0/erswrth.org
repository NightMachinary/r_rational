Well, I mean, that was basically Danzo's argument in both canon and in this story. But everyone hates Danzo and thinks he's evil when he says stuff like that, and yet I get the feeling that many of the readers who want Naruto to just unleash hell and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_60Jfwsylb8][kill all the sand people]] also think Danzo is a monster for thinking the same way. Heck, in this very chapter, Rasa and Chiyo explicitly mock the Third and say he is a fool for not killing them. So are they wrong to think so, or should the MC try to be more like them? Because I do think you can't have it both ways.
