And there we go, that's the conclusion of this act! I hope you guys like it. I ended up editing it and tweaking it quite a lot to try and account for the criticisms I received so far, but in the end, this is how it was supposed to go. On a meta-level, this is the part of the story where the villains have the initiative, where the heroes lose and it gives them the motivation to go "oh shit, we have to get serious", and it just doesn't work to try and spin that in a happy and positive way.

At the same time, I do get why some readers think there are not enough uplifting moments in this story. There tends to be a lot of grey, which is realistic, but... I can't help but think back to when I was reading stories as a kid, and I'd go "I wish I could write so I could make this story go the way it is /supposed/ to." It was so obvious to me that everything could be made 10 times cooler just by having more awesome things happen, and I wonder if maybe young me had a point. That maybe there's this artistic urge to make your stuff deep and complicated and to kind of sniff your nose going "well obviously you can't just give your readers what they /want/, only a pleb would do /that."/ I dunno.

​

Anyway, I'm officially through all of my pre-written stuff now. There is one last epilogue-type chapter coming and then there'll have to be a bit longer wait again as I get the new act together. I'm really excited to get this story completely off the canon rails and see where that takes us.

In the meantime - please read and enjoy!
