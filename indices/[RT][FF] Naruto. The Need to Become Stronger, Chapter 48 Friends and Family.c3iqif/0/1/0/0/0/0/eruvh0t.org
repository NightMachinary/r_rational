  Regardless, this decision will be a major plot point / point of discussion in the next act, so this isn't just some random weird thing that happened for no reason.

Understandable, looking forward to what ripple effects this will cause in Konoha.

  I've edited his dialogue in the new chapter a bit to make that more clear. He now refers to "our mutual enemy", and the strategic necessity of allying against them.
#+end_quote

Re-read the chapter and yes, it's a lot better with that clarified, yet still opaque reference. I still think this action was insanely naive and risky when there were alternatives, but I guess you have all the connections in your head, so I will wait for things to be slowly revealed.

  The point is that The Third needs there to be another Kage who is in the know and willing to fight against Akatsuki when it comes down to it, and his own death only increases that need.

Well, the option of killing and replacing Raza is still open to the Akatsuki. And considering Yura is probably an agent of Akatsuki, it wouldn't even be that hard. Hopefully Raza is savvy enough to maneuver through the murk.
