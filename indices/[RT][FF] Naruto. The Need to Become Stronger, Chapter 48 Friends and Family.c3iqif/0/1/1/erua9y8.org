  This move is a military and diplomatic blunder by the Hokage, (etc)

Appeasement doesn't work in the real world, and it shouldn't work here, either.

Honestly, I could only see this working if the Sand pulled off its plan but was then *immediately* betrayed by the Akatsuki in such a way that they lost something of importance or great value. Then the Leaf could point out how they were both betrayed, and they could make the excuse that it was another group, and then these two 'enemies' who had this conflict choose to visibly unite against a common foe, which begins a start of a long road toward village and national unification.

Except that this didn't happen, and the Kazekage even /laughs/ at how naive the Hokage is being by going this route. I have to agree with the guy.
