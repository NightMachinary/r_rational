This is basically over the Despair Event Horizon for me. The Sand people seem so utterly psychopathically fucked up that I can't imagine any happy ending that doesn't involve them dead as an end in itself. Making peace with a rabid dog isn't rational, it's just delusional.

Some of the Konoha people are decent enough, but everyone else should be given the treatment HPMOR Dumbledore urged for Voldemort - kill them asap, then forget they ever existed, because even their memory is pure poison.
