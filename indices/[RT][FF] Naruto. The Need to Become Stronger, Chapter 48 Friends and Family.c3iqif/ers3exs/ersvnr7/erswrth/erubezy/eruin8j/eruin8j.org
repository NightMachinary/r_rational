Oh, I don't think Danzo is the good guy actually - not canon Danzo, certainly. But a big part of what I'm trying to do with this story is show how the exact same actions can either seem horribly evil or totally fine depending on who does it to whom, and from whose perspective it is shown.

- Canon Danzo argued that the other nations are evil and that the Leaf should do a pre-emptive strike, and he was called a monster for it. In NTBS, he says the same thing... except he kind of ends up being right.
- Canon Sarutobi was all about tolerating horrific evil in the name of peace. And yet, everyone saw him as the good guy, even when the Head Torturer was standing right there next to him, because he was the Good Guy (TM)
- Canon Naruto was all about forgiving seemingly irredeemable enemies, such as Gaara. But when he does a much less extreme version of that in this story (not killing Temari and Kankuro) it doesn't feel so right. It feels like injustice.
- Canon Itachi slaughtered his entire clan, and most of the readership still see him as a hero, because he was cool.
- Canon Temari casually tossed Tenten onto a pile of her own knives and Shuriken after she was already unconscious and defeated, because... she wanted to show how superior she was, I guess. But it's okay, because she turned good later.
- Canon Kankuro trapped his opponent in an Iron Maiden and impaled him from every side at once with spikes, and he never stopped grinning and taunting even as his victim screamed and begged to be released. And we were *okay* with that because hey, Kankuro was on *our* side now, and he was doing it to one of the bad guys.

That's the point of this. I wanted to show what it looks like to argue for canon Naruto's philosophy of forgiveness in a world that isn't specifically tailored to make that worldview look good. That was the idea, anyway. That doesn't mean Naruto can't still find a way to make it work, somehow - but it can't be as easy as him forgiving Gaara in canon. That simply would not work in a rational story.
