It's not about "being more like the sand". It's not like they're just murderers, or treacherous or anything /mundane/. You're portraying them as almost a relentless train of horror for the sake of horror. There seems to be /nothing/ redeemable about them, they don't even seem to have actual /self-interest/ as a lever to pull on. It comes off like it would be more reasonable to ally with the /kyuubi/.
