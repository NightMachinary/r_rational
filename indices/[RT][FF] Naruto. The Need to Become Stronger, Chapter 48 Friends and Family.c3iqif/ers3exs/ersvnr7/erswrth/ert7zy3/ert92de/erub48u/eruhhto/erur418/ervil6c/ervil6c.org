Honestly though, it's not just a case of her being "really into" the monstrous things she did- hell, there are actual, real world analogues here. There are child soldiers in other countries, kids Bonesaw's age when Jack got to her, who get dragged from their homes and told, "either you fight with us or I shoot your mother in the head or worse," which is both unfathomably traumatic and also, I feel confident saying, OBJECTIVELY LESS TRAUMATIZING than what Bonesaw had happen to her. Then they get thrown in with other kids who just had the exact same thing happen to them, and get ordered to commit war crimes or else. Did you know what war crimes were at 8 years old? I sure as fuck didn't, and you're gonna tell me after it happens over and over again, and gets normalized, because that's how BRAINS WORK, that when they get captured or free or whatever, you would look at them and say, "yep, that 12 year old with Stockholm's Syndrome on steroids, yep completely irredeemable monster."? There's a reason we draw the line at adulthood when it comes to "how much agency does someone have." Is she completely blameless? No, of course not, but swinging the pendulum too far the other way makes even less sense.
