I don't disagree with that, but I would respond that while Bonesaw may have liked doing the things she did, Jack was the one who made her into that kind of person without her choice in the matter. For an analogy appropriate to that series, think of her like a dog whose been trapped in a dogfighting ring. The dog may come to enjoy what it does, but not for any fault of its own but the environment it was forced to be in.
