Taking the in story reason as given, it makes sense. If there was foreshadowing for the whole Eidolon thing I missed it. (The "they're not trying to destroy the world, just cause chaos" was one thing, but how did Eidolon do that? He was never aware of that being one of his powers, and the other powers in the work didn't have that much of a surprise to their holder.) Given the pre-existing stuff, it wouldn't have worked for the Simurgh to suddenly reveal a less passive Master ability and take over a bunch of capes >! and directly send them against You-Know-Who, even if that seems almost more in character. !<

Afterwards it is unclear what they are going to do/what their goals are, or what they'll do next.
