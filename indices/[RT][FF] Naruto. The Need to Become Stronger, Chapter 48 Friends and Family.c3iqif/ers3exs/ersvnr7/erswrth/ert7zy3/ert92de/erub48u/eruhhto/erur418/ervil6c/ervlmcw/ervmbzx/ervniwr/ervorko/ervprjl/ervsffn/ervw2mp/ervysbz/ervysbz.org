Okay, so while that link was very pithy and very amusing, I'm going to have to hard disagree on basically all of it.

For one, Tattletale didn't just wave a stack of cash and magically convince the mercs- she worked with them them most closely out of any of the Undersiders even before the betrayal, and is shown on-sceen to have a somewhat close and trusting relationship to them. You're telling me someone who's whole power is being able to figure things out about people, wouldn't be able to convince a coworker that they interact with favorably over a long period of time that their boss is losing touch, and maybe it's time for a change in management? We don't actually know the extent of Claverts relationship with the mercenaries, we don't know precisely what was said, but there's definitely more to it than "hey look more money."

The fact that he failed to kill her while using his power to stay safe, WAS shown on-sceen at least once, that was the point of the "he's going to kill you" subplot in the Mayor attack. We ALSO know that he HAD to use his power without a safe timeline, because time still moves normally forward, he just gets two shots at things. The debate was only going to happen once, he basically had to make his move then or else he risks the city getting condemned, and he didn't want to leave that up to chance, since if he fails it doesn't matter how many safe timelines he has, his whole enterprise crumbles.

So he's made this agreement about Dinah with the Undersiders, and he doesn't want to give her up because she's too valuable. If he goes back on it directly, they have enough dirt/firepower to be a serious problem. However, Taylor is the only one who REALLY has a problem with it (I'll get to that), and they all back her, so if he just gets rid of Taylor it's likely he can just convince the rest of them to play nice. Which is why he stages the whole "fake betrayal."

So he needs to kill Taylor (something he's been expicitly trying to do and failing multiple times with safe timelines up) without tipping off the rest of the Undersiders that he's doing it, since if they find out they'll go thermonuclear on him. But like I said, he needed to use both timelines already, and he needs to disappear as Calvert asap since he just faked his death, and if he gives up Dinah now it will be very hard to keep trying to get her away from Taylor. So if he leaves a safe timeline and resets to it, he loses Dinah for good. Was it worth him risking everything? No, but it's absolutely in character given how he's acted towards her the whole story.

Also, don't know if you have seen this, but WoG is that his power isn't actually parallel universe creation (which doesn't really jive with the rest of the setting), it's basically a precog power with a weird interface. Which isn't stated but it is implied, based on how his power interacts with Dinah's and the feedback being something that expicitly happens when precog powers interact.

As far as how Taylor's reaction to Dinah's condition and lack thereof for all the other messed up shit, yes, that's true, it's also the point. She's basically using her as a rationalization for everything she's doing. It's the same as her "oh it's okay because it's just cover so I can bust these guys later." She's trying to rationalize her bad decisions but digging herself deeper.
