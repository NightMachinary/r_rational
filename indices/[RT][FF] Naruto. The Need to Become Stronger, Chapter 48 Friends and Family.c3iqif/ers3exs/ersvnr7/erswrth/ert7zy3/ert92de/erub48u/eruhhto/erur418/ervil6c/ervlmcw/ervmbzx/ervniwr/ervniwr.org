...but even the endbringers were cooperating with the heroes.

It isn't that there was a lot of morally grey and complex characters in the story - I'm perfectly okay with that. It's more that characters were 100% pure evil, right up until the story needed them to be good, and then they just were. Don't get me wrong, I like the story a lot, but it was very definitely tailored to be awesome rather than realistic.
