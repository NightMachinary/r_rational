Who else other than Bonesaw are you referring to with that? I can't think of anyone other than the Nine who fit that criteria, and even them, other than Jack, had at least some mitigating factor or another.

The Endbringers also were explicitly NOT human, and were basically wrangled in by the Simurgh to help, and with her we don't even KNOW her motivations, for all we know she had something further down the line she was/is planning for. I would say they're a reasonable exception considering their role in the story as "forces of nature."

I'm sorry if I come off as confrontational here, it just really bothers me how a lot of people in this community REALLY don't seem to "get" Worm- It's not a story about optimizing superpowers and saving the world. It's an exploration in trauma, conflict, and communication and the lack thereof, in a world where the consequences are turned up to 11. You aren't supposed to take Taylor's narration at face value, Khephri isn't a crowning moment of awesome, it's a tragic ending to a complicated character who gave in to her worst impulses at a pivotal moment, and just because it worked doesn't mean it was the best path to achieving that victory. Amy using her powers the way she does ("suboptomally") isn't a strike against the story; if you gave most people superpowers at the same time they experienced trauma, their first thought don't going to be to bootstrap that power to infinite energy- which is ironic, because that's the whole goal of the cycle in the first place. This sub especially seems to go into it expecting it to be like HPMOR, and end up missing a lot of the nuance. Hell, some people in this sub miss the nuance of that too, since it's ALSO supposed to be a cautionary tale of assuming you're right about everything.
