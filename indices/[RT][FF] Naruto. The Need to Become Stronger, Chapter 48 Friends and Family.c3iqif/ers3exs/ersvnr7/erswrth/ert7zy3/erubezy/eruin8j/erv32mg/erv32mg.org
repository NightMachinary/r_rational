I wasn't saying he was good. I simply said he was a militaristic pragmatic rationalist. From his point of view, that's the best thing to do.

And honestly, he's still right either way. Even aside the fact that he's actually 'right' due to the plans of the other nations, he exists in a world where standing armies aren't a thing as much as /every army is composed of tiers of various levels of special forces/. Pre-emptive strikes are the /only/ real way to wage war in such scenarios.

Sarutobi may be the 'designated good guy', in which case people will tend to see him as much. That's more of a storytelling trope. But, being rational here, that doesn't stop them from being horribly wrong or outright stupid. If "Peace" is your goal above all costs, you will either force everyone to stop warfare entirely if you are powerful enough, or you will quite peacefully lead yourself and your people to the noose if you are /not/ powerful enough.

Oh no, when Naruto does it in the series, it feels like injustice too. I mean, maybe it's different for other people, but I find it hard to believe. The difference is that in the show he's one of the protagonists that does their best to /befriend the villains/ and show them a better way through his own actions (Tenchi Muyo comes to mind as being one of the archetypal anime that pioneered this approach). Now, realistically, this is /not going to work on hardened killers who grew up being child soldiers/, but nothing else in the world seems to run on logic anyway, so that's just one of the powers of the protagonist, I suppose. Still, it doesn't have to be /justice/, it just has to be /reasonable/. I can see him letting Temari off the hook here, as she was blinded for 'justice' for her brother. But I can't see Naruto, the guy who cares about his friends more than anything else, letting this version of Kankuro off the hook. If anything, he'd come to rightly believe that the man has at least a sizable portion of his brother's madness.

I hate Itachi and Sasuke. And like this version of Naruto, I see absolutely no reason why anyone would be falling and fawning over them in admiration. Even the guy that wrote Sasuke started with him being a "calm cool kung fu genius" type and reverse-engineered his flimsy 'personality' from there. Their characters are some of the /most irrational/ in the original series, and that's saying a /lot/.

The Canon Kankuro example seems more like the previous bit about the enemies being dehumanized. If they're so over-the-top evilbad, then we cease to see them as humans. I'd find his actions disgusting and unproductive either way. Emotions aside, it's impractical to do such a thing, because either the enemy is too weak to be a threat to you anyway, or the enemy is strong enough to be a threat and you are /just giving them more time to escape or survive/. If the latter, just knife them and be done.

  That's the point of this. I wanted to show what it looks like to argue for canon Naruto's philosophy of forgiveness in a world that isn't specifically tailored to make that worldview look good

Now /THIS/... /this I like/. Canon Naruto's philosophy in the series is just stupid, given everything we know, and it only works /because/ he's the designated Hero Protagonist and everything works out for him in the end. It's like an extremely proactive, offense-based version of Plot Armor. It'll be interesting to see if /this/ Naruto finds a way to make it work rationally, fails at it and has to adapt to the world as it actually is (as he did against Gaara here), or finds some reasonable middle ground in between the two extremes (what I'm guessing will actually happen).
