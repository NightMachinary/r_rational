  And honestly, he's still right either way. Even aside the fact that he's actually 'right' due to the plans of the other nations, he exists in a world where standing armies aren't a thing as much as /every army is composed of tiers of various levels of special forces/. Pre-emptive strikes are the /only/ real way to wage war in such scenarios.

Well, canon Danzo is just empirically wrong because his actions are the cause of 90% of the problems in the series. Heck, he was actively hurting his own country for most of the story, nevermind the rest of the world.

NTBS Danzo... we'll see. He'll definitely have more screentime in the next act, so should be fun. :)

  But I can't see Naruto, the guy who cares about his friends more than anything else, letting this version of Kankuro off the hook. If anything, he'd come to rightly believe that the man has at least a sizable portion of his brother's madness.

But he didn't let him off. He was actively trying to kill him and Temari until he revealed Shikamaru, and then he was in a position where he had to bargain for Shikamaru's life. That doesn't mean he has forgiven Kankuro, it just means he cares more about saving the living than avenging the dead. Like a rationalist should.

Technically, he could have attacked Kankuro immediately after he released Shikamaru, but A) this would be out of character for Naruto and B) the rest of the Sand's army was rapidly approaching, so that wouldn't have been a good idea at all.

He did the sensible thing in cutting his losses, IMO. But I get the impression that some people think Naruto just doesn't care - because he tries very hard to make his decisions based on logic rather than emotion - and that isn't true at all.

  It'll be interesting to see if /this/ Naruto finds a way to make it work rationally, fails at it and has to adapt to the world as it actually is (as he did against Gaara here), or finds some reasonable middle ground in between the two extremes (what I'm guessing will actually happen).

I'll note it down as a prediction :)
