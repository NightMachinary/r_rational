  I'm pretty sure Canon Danzo isn't the cause of 90% of the problems when you have other actors who are themselves actively trying to mess with them. And in the Shippuden arc you have Akatsuki messing with everyone.
#+end_quote

Yes, but he inspired Nagato to go superevil in the first place, so everything Akatsuki does can kinda be traced back to him. Also, everything Itachi does. And he was actively working with Orochimaru, too. And even Madara only got resurrected because of Kabuto, who was Danzo's spy until Danzo tried to have him killed. So yeah, he was indirectly responsible for at least 90% of the bad things that happened during the main plot of Naruto.

  And as this enemy is quite wiling to meat puppet and torture his allies for his own ends, it's pretty much certain he will have to deal with him again. Rationalists care about the future as much as the past.

He has no reason to think that. For a meta-perspective, sure, you can think "we haven't seen the last of that guy", but from Naruto's perspective Kankuro is just one potential enemy among hundreds, and one way or another the guy is not likely to be in Konoha for long, which hugely decreases the chances of them running into each other.

  *EDIT*: In addition, Naruto has revealed to them the ultimate secret behind familial ninja techniques. Eliminating both of them seems like it should be a high priority.
#+end_quote

No he didn't, they were not present for that part. Naruto did teach Temari how to summon people (and indirectly, how to puppet people) but it wasn't at all clear how much those two already knew. They are the children of the Kazekage, after all, and probably had access to quite a few secrets already.

Either way, Naruto definitely wouldn't go around assassinating people just because they know something about how ninjutsu works. I don't think defaulting to murder is rational at all.

  He doesn't know the details of that, and even if he didn't know, the Leaf ANBU were then surrounding THAT group's leadership. And, honestly, Naruto wouldn't have much of a challenge against their common grunts.
#+end_quote

He saw the Sand army, but didn't see the Anbu. Considering how Kankuro and Temari were actively falling back towards the bulk of the Sand's forces, and considering how Naruto's orders were to evacuate himself and Sasuke, retreat makes perfect sense. Yes, he has agency, but he also knows how badly things can go wrong when you try to take matters in your own hands - especially in an uncertain and dangerous situation like that.

And with regards to common grunts not being dangerous... it doesn't work that way in NTBS. There are no hitpoints or power levels. Literally any genin could have a forbidden technique that just so happens to perfectly counter your own. Or they could be Uchiha Itachi in disguise. You just don't know. And as you could see from Kabuto's fight with Sakura, that kind of attitude could get you killed.
