  Canon Itachi slaughtered his entire clan, and most of the readership still see him as a hero, because he was cool.

A cool villain, not a hero. At best, his story (initially) seems like it's trying to say, hey, maybe if you train someone to kill from birth, and don't treat them well, in a world that's a little short on clear right and wrong, they might a) go crazy and kill you, b) they might decide they don't like the side they're on and slaughter basically everyone they know, c) defect/go rogue and stop following orders. Why should you do something because someone tells you to, if they're obviously evil? In this light he killed because they were the best, so they were the ones who'd have gone/been sent after him. (Him defeating them /all/ in person is a little overboard - bombs, poison, etc. seem more reasonable/likely.)

Later this turned into >! "if they'll kill /anyone/ if they're ordered to do so, that includes their family/friends/clan". Would have been interesting to see how it'd have gone if the order had been to kill the Hokage. !<
