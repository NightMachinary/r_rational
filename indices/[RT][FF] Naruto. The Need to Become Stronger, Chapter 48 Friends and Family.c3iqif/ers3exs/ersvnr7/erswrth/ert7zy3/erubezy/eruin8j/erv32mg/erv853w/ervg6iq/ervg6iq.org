I'm pretty sure Canon Danzo isn't the cause of 90% of the problems when you have other actors who are themselves actively trying to mess with them. And in the Shippuden arc you have Akatsuki messing with everyone.

Should be interesting to see how this version turns out, though.

  That doesn't mean he has forgiven Kankuro, it just means he cares more about saving the living than avenging the dead. Like a rationalist should.
#+end_quote

You mean like *Naruto* should. A rationalist would reasonably weigh the life of his (possibly already going to die) friend versus the friends he /could/ be losing in the future if this enemy manages to escape. And as this enemy is quite wiling to meat puppet and torture his allies for his own ends, it's pretty much certain he will have to deal with him again. Rationalists care about the future as much as the past.

*EDIT*: In addition, Naruto has revealed to them the ultimate secret behind familial ninja techniques. Eliminating both of them seems like it should be a high priority.

  A) this would be out of character for Naruto
#+end_quote

Out of character for Canon Naruto, sure.

  B) the rest of the Sand's army was rapidly approaching, so that wouldn't have been a good idea at all.
#+end_quote

He doesn't know the details of that, and even if he didn't know, the Leaf ANBU were then surrounding THAT group's leadership. And, honestly, Naruto wouldn't have much of a challenge against their common grunts.

#+begin_quote
  because he tries very hard to make his decisions based on logic rather than emotion
#+end_quote

Except, of course, that logic only leads to the same results when it has the same inputs. Fail to provide all the pertinent inputs, and your output will be flawed. Sometimes logic and emotion can agree.

  I'll note it down as a prediction :)
#+end_quote

Sounds good. :D
