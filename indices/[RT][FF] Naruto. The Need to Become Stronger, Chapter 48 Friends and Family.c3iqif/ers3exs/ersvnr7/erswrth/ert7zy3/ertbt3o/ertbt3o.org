I am really not sure where this perspective is coming from. The actions of Suna seem to be well within the limits of what rational actors would decide to do on both a personal and grand strategic level.

It is perfectly rational from a grand strategic perspective for Suna to preemptively attack Konoha in order to counter their efforts to steal clients in Sand and to generally damage Konoha enough to ensure that the balance of power between Sand and Konoha does not shift in such a way as to overtly favor Konoha. Attacking another nation when they pursue a course of action that is damaging to your nation is a course of action that almost every country in the real world has pursued.

It is perfectly rational from a personal perspective for the Kazekage, Chiyo, and the Kazekage's children to support this attack on Konoha as they all possess a very strong motivation to avenge their loved ones. This is not a particularly nice motivation, but is perfectly rational for them to possess it and allow it to strongly influence their behavior.

I find it really disturbing for someone to consider the actions of Suna to be at "kill them all" levels of evil when everything that Suna has done is well within the bounds of what states and individuals in the real world have done. Do you really consider a preemptive attack on an enemy to be an offense worthy of Genocide? Is it really so hard to understand that people may want to avenge their murdered family?

I would also like to add that Naruto basically use two ideas (1: In order to protect my precious people I must preemptively destroy my enemy before he can strike, 2: It is okay for me to violate the rules in order to protect those that threaten or harm my precious people) to justify his murder of Gaara. These ideas are essentially the same as the ideas used by the Kazekage and Suna to justify their attack on Konoha.
