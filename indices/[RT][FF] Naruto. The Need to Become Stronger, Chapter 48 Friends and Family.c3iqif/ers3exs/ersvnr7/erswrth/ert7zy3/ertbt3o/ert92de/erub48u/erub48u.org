  Characters who do evil things for irrational reasons tend to be much more hated than those who do evil purely for the sake of evil.

I... honestly don't see the difference between these two. Evil for its own sake is inherently irrational.

You've got me, I have no idea. How they were totally cool with her Heel-Face Turn is beyond me, and it was one of the major dissonance moments for me when reading it. Same with "Valkyrie".

  So even if you think these specific people are pure poison, that doesn't justify a genocidal war against the entire Sand.

Yeah, but see, the biggest problem is that until those high-ranking Evil Overlords are put down, the soldiers are just going to do their jobs and fight. Especially if they fear their masters more than you. So unless you have a strategy that avoids all normal warfare and instead targets the leaders by specific groups of highly experienced individuals trained and selected for the task (ie: What I assume warfare would be like in a world full of Ninja, warfare "Salarian style"), you're invariably going to have to harvest a lot of regular soldier guys on your way to the top.

While pure genocide should be off the table, there's no way their /nation/ should be allowed to survive in its current form.
