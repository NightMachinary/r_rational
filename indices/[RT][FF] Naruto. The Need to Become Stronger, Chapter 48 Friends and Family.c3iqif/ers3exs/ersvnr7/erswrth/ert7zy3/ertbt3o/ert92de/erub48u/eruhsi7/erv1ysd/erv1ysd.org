  Card carrying villain types tend to be more well-liked, for some reason
#+end_quote

I'd say it's probably because readers/viewers can feel alright hating them or enjoying when they suffer. Since the character crossed a line into a territory where they aren't realistic /people/ anymore, it's OK to hate them, whereas in the real world that might not be morally acceptable.

That, and the hero's "goodness" is a mirror of the "evilness" of the villain. The nastier the villain, the more you root for the hero.

  how Thanos is actually the hero of their story
#+end_quote

That's honestly how Infinity War /actually went/. Thanos was a villain protagonist with a goal he honestly believed in. The fact that he retired to a farm at the end instead of doing more murderdeathkill shows that he honestly believed what he said. The other two examples don't fit as well, as Scar was simply selfish, and Killmonger was all about destruction and not working out a better system.

  didn't we learn from recent history that regime change is usually a terrible idea?
#+end_quote

/Looks at post-WWII Germany and Japan./

No. Regime change, properly done, can improve upon an otherwise hostile and belligerent nation.

What your describing is the more modern, lazy method where chopping off the head of the snake and then leaving while saying "Victory!" is the standard operating procedure. Of course, all it really does is create a power vacuum that causes even /more/ ruthless people to take over what's left and the process has to continue again.

Really makes you wonder if it's on purpose. But that's enough politics.

Allowing an enemy to completely screw you over and murder your people, as has been done here, will make the situation much worse. Absolutely nobody's view of the Leaf will improve from this except a few high-minded idealists, and absolutely everything will be harder from them. Furthermore, the /people/ of the Leaf are always going to wonder when it will be OK for someone else to raid and murder them and get away from it without repercussion.
