100% agree on the pacing, and I'd say that's probably the biggest flaw of the story. He definitely fleshed out a lot more of the world than he showed, and there were moments that could have been focused on for longer. Pact had this problem but on steroids, but Twig and now Ward are definitely slowed down, and I think better for it.

Also agree on the Path to Victory thing, although I think it works for what it is. I suspect we could probably talk in circles around that point for hours and not really get anywhere, so I'll just leave it at that.

The Simurgh I think works though, because when we do see inside her head we find out she's not quite as omniscient as people seem to think, and it works by showing how the "threat" of Simurgh influence, and people's subsequent reaction tends up being more dangerous than the influence itself.

I wouldn't say anything quite happens "for no reason," I can't think of any moment in the story where someone does something or something happens that isn't a result of people acting in their own best interest based on whatever information and perspective they had at the time, however flawed it may be.

Kaiser works precisely BECAUSE it's so sudden and unexpected, him and other characters getting demolished in that fight works to really ramp up the stakes and show just how dangerous this world is. Remember, these things are attacking a major city once every few months, and we really see the impact of that first hand. And it's not like his whole crew just disappears, the remnants of the EEE stick around and still have an impact on the story.

The whole Coil thing is subtle enough that I didn't actually catch it on my first couple read-throughs, but he didn't just grab the idiot ball, they defeated him exactly how you'd counter someone with that power in real life- they built up resources, slowly and subtly enough that he wouldn't notice until it was too late, and then get him in a position where he's forced to use his power with the safety off or risk losing long-term. It's also heavily implied he tried to kill Taylor many, many times without his power, and failed each time- the attack on the Mayor, when Tattletale's power suddenly gave her completely different info? It means that there was a whole timeline where he DID try to kill her, failed, and she went after him, so he had to hold off and try again. That entire fight sequence from the moment he kidnaps Taylor until his death is basically him using his power non-stop, and we only see the timelines where it goes least bad for him. Remember "don't use grenades, whatever you do?" The whole convoluted sequence with the barn and the fire isn't him cartoon villaining, it's plan Z after plans A-Y have failed over and over again. It's honestly one of my favorite parts of the book, and clever narrative structures like that are probably Wildbows biggest strengths.
