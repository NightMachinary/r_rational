Hah, Naruto certainly wouldn't want to be speciest when it comes to the prospect of allying with the Kyuubi (though he does have a tiny amount of common sense standing in the way), but either way I don't think that's entirely fair. Yes, Gaara was a literal psychopath, and Kankuro is more of a psychopath wannabe poser, but Temari and Rasa at least are both acting out of genuine grief. That doesn't justify their actions, certainly, but you can't say they have *no* redeemable qualities. Rasa also had a certain sense of honour in not wanting to go to war until Chiyo swayed him, refusing to go after the Third's son, and wondering briefly about the chunin/jonin in the guesthouse he had just killed.

Also an odd thing I've noticed: Characters who do evil things for irrational reasons tend to be much more hated than those who do evil purely for the sake of evil. Heck, Bonesaw and the Joker both have fans even though I see them as horrifically evil, and I still don't really get why the former was accepted as redeemable.

Anyway, all of that is ignoring the more important point that even if all of the named Sand characters are evil, that doesn't mean that the shinobi fighting for them are. You can see at the end of this chapter that the others seem to be afraid of Rasa and Chiyo, and for good reason. So even if you think these specific people are pure poison, that doesn't justify a genocidal war against the entire Sand.
