The redemption arc wasn't powerful because it just excused everything she did, it was powerful because she chose to stop at all. There's not a person on the planet, alive or in history, who could have resisted the level of psychological breakdown and brainwashing that Jack inflicted on her at EIGHT YEARS OLD, before grooming her for many, many years after. Yes, Bonesaw is a monster, but the reason that her heel-face turn worked was because once she no longer had Jack manipulating her, she was able to recognize on some level, "hey this is fucked up, I'm really awful aren't I," and chose to try to do some good in the world, instead of just accepting she's a monster and doubling down. It doesn't excuse her past actions, but it is a powerful moment in the story nonetheless.
