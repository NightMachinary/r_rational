Edit: re read your link again, didn't realize you brought up the WoG. You may be right about the "murdering millions of conscious beings each time" thing, but then doesn't Dinah do the same thing but on a much larger scale each time she uses hers? I feel like that crosses over into "suspension of disbelief" far enough, especially considering that powerful precog abilities are expicitly expensive but in the toolbox of the Entities.
