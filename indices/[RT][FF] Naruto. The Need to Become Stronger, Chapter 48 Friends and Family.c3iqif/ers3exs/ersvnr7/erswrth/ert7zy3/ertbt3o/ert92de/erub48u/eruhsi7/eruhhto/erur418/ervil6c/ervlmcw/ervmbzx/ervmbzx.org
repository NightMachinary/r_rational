Yeah, and neither did Bonesaw- remember, she was in that stasis bubble sans-Jack for a couple years on her own, PLUS the intervention of someone who's whole thing is saying/doing something at the exact right time to cause major effect (yes, yes, I DO admit Path to Victory is bullshit). And even after that, she was only as far as admitting she was broken, not "yes this person is perfectly fine and good now they're 100% heroic and everything is fine." And yes some of the horrible villians were cooperating on Gold Morning, because the threat of complete global annihilation tends to do that to people. And they STILL weren't actually all that great at cooperating until Khephri- aka "Finally, everyone was working together." It's almost like people having varied and conflicting motivations and experiences, that can't be easily defined in a hero/villian dichotomy, was a central theme of the book or something.
