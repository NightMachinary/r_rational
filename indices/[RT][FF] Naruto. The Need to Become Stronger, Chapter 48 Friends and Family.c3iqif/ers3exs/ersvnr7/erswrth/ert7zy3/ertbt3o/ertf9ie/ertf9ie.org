A pre-emptive strike can be reasonable and rational. Turning people into flesh-puppets ensconced in a nightmare torture cage, and then cackling about how much the sight must torment their friends is Hellraiser-tier horror-for-the-sake-of-horror. It would help if ay any point the sister, purportedly the saner of the siblings, ever tried to rein in her brother's hammy, try-hard Exemplar of Evil schtick. Instead she acts like this is all perfectly normal for a day that ends in 'y', and even a good thing because someone killed the insane serial killer brother who scared the shit out of her with his relentless, deranged psychopathy. Even the care for Gaara feels like informed ability, or just playing a role.

The grand strategic level also seems like it wasn't emphasized enough, if that's the rationale we're going with. My impression was that Sand attacked Konoha specifically to avenge Gaara, but really so the old lady could avenge her children. And again, the care isn't really developed, it comes across like disutility monsters pantomiming human emotions.

The net effect is that the Konoha characters feel like actual humans, while the named Sand characters are demons in human guise.
