  An analogy would be how a military can use napalm to kill many people without actually being comprised of monstrous serial killers who like to burn people to death.

Napalm and /animated iron maiden torture suits/ are nothing alike, /especially/ from a point of view of warfare. Napalm is generally used to cause damage to objects in the area, and incidentally also happens to get the people, too. If your enemies are hiding in dense underbrush or buildings and don't care about collateral damage, or you want to bomb a place and ensure that it catches fire and does more damage to the area around it (in which case collateral damage is the whole point), then napalm is a great solution to your problem.

What possible military purpose does it serve to put a person inside a suit filled with 300 poisoned metal spikes and throw them against their loved ones? Would you /honestly/ claim this was OK in the real world, if a nations military did that to another nation? You would actively support such a thing?

  The general idea is that using Monstrous tools should not necessarily make their user a Monster.

Tell that to the people who actually used the napalm or other monstrous things in the /real world/ and were psychologically affected by it. Now compare them to this version of Kankuro and tell me that he is perfectly sane and not a sadist.

  He could have quite easily killed all of his hostages in a horrific manner at any point.
#+end_quote

Ah, so the fact that he /didn't kill them in horrific fashion/ makes him a good person, and/or him hideously torturing his enemies and using them as pawns makes him a /better person/ than not torturing them to death, and so it's all good?

How about, instead, he has a specific mission to get revenge on the guy who killed his brother (Naruto), and instead of being a torture happy psychopath who delights in making the other Leaf ninjas suffer instead concentrates on his goals and either kills or incapacitates his foes instead of acting like a monster?

See, I don't mind him being written as he is in the story, but don't try and claim he's not a monster because he /could/ have been /more/ monsterous, and therefore it's OK.
