  There was no visible /punishment/ for this act of betrayal, murder and destruction. Horrible optics and an extremely negative hit to the morale of Konoha's prominent shinobi, who watched all this happen live.

Yes, all of that is true. Like you said, you can tell how furious this makes Ibiki - but the Hokage is Hokage and his will is law, while he's still alive at least. He's part of the loyalist anbu faction after all. Regardless, this decision will be a major plot point / point of discussion in the next act, so this isn't just some random weird thing that happened for no reason.

  You see, here's the problem with that. By attacking the leaf, they are /aiding/ the real enemy. And from the text, Sand doesn't know it yet. Even in these last moments, The Hokage makes absolutely no mention of a real enemy that they both know about, that are hurting them both, and so the Sand goes back to their lands, still ignorant, still a tool of the enemy.

This is not the first conversation the Third and Rasa had together. In [[https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2018/01/10/chapter-30/][Sarutobi's POV chapter]], he and the Kazekage discussed the threat of Anbu together, and Rasa very definitely saw them as the enemy:

/“Mercenary?” Rasa turned his head and spat onto the ground. “Call them what they are: Criminals and traitors. They staged a coup in the Hidden Mist and killed the Mizukage -- one of us, Hiruzen! Now, never let it be said that I was a great admirer of Yagura-” In fact, this had never been said by anyone. “-but it still sets a precedent. With Yagura gone, which of us shall be the next to fall? For all that we speak of our Lineage and you of your Will of Fire, those concepts only hold power for as long as people believe in them. If the world starts to see us as mortal...”/

Sarutobi might not have told Rasa about the Enemy (for the same reason that Naruto never talks about it - they're ninjas, and you never know who's listening in) but he's effectively using Akatsuki as a proxy here to alert the Kazekage of the threat. Rasa knows they're both being targeted, and the Third is obliquely referring to that.

I've edited his dialogue in the new chapter a bit to make that more clear. He now refers to "our mutual enemy", and the strategic necessity of allying against them.

  How much distrust would there be, between the Sand and Leaf villagers? How would the alliance even continue, when Sand traders and shinobi will be viewed with suspicion in the leaf?
#+end_quote

It was only ever an alliance of convenience, so that doesn't change much. They're ninjas: Nobody ever trusts each other. The point is that The Third needs there to be another Kage who is in the know and willing to fight against Akatsuki when it comes down to it, and his own death only increases that need. Especially after Mist effectively had a puppet ruler installed by Itachi, and considering how Stone was funding Akatsuki:

/“As Yūra was saying... we are starting to get an impression of Akatsuki's organization. We count their inner circle at nine so far, plus whatever assistance they may be getting from other countries.” Left unsaid was that the Hidden Stone was almost certainly supporting the Akatsuki by hiring them as mercenaries, if not worse./

  Hahaha, I meant more along the likes of the Hokage thinking like that, and why that is so jarring compared to what is happening around them. Obviously it won't be easy that :P

Well, bear in mind that you're seeing this from Rasa's point of view, not the Third's. Certainly it looks like naivety to /him/, but an equally valid explanation for the Third's actions is that he's just really really desperate. Just because you attempt something with a low chance of success doesn't necessarily mean you don't understand probability.
