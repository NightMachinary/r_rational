I feel like this move by the Hokage comes off as irrationally stupid because there's absolutely /no/ punishment here. Even the part were Gaara was killed was still within the established ninja rules, and Sand broke the rules when they started the attack, and now they've gotten away with it completely scot-free.

This move is a military and diplomatic blunder by the Hokage, since none of the main assets of the Sand (other than Gaara) have been neutralized, they and whoever else can twist this into making Konoha look very /very/ weak. I can estimate the ripple effect this will have on the different forces at play -

- For the other villages : (Akatsuki/Enemy sponsored) Headlines to the tune of "Leaf village elder assassinated, perpetrators escape from right under the Anbu's nose.". Konoha viewed as weak, naive, an easier target. Sand village more respected/feared for pulling off this massive assassination on the head of state of the most powerful country and getting away with it.
- For Konoha's enemies : Have more of a reason to come together, cooperate, be more aggressive, be much more demanding of Konoha. Impression of Konoha becomes that of "weaker village" Overall, more confidence to enemies.
- For Konoha's remaining allies : Shows weakness, taboo in ninja world, shows that even if you betray them they're gonna be fine with it. More likely for some countries to become neutral or lose trust of Konoha's capabilities as a result of this.
- For Konoha's shinobi population : Blue balls their vengeance, no thought given to what they might think about the whole situation. Makes all the powerful people gathered there look like fools, why did they even come there, if they were just going to let the Sand go? They were retreating anyway, so why the whole theatre? Many prominent clans have lost their children, when they find out that the Hokage simply let their killers leave, I'm not sure they will trust the village leadership anymore. Quite a lot of them could become more drawn to Danzo and his "kill them all" mentality. The village unity will be either be broken into a thousand pieces, or become united in revenge.
- For Sand village : Shows that Konoha needs them as allies, even after they pulled off things that would've made them enemies for generations in the ninja world. Shows them that there's a bigger enemy that Konoha is fighting, but (what a wonderful blunder) doesn't convince them that this is Sand's enemy as well. Shows them that they are willing to let them get away with pretty much anything as long as they help fight this greater threat, giving the Kazekage leverage akin to a leash on Konoha.
- For Akatsuki/The Enemy : Great news! Konoha is regarded as an absolute weak/naive nation on the world stage. Our subverted ally Sand has not lost any significant force (except Ichibi, which we have the means to recover). Much easier to convince some of the more neutral villages to side against Konoha, as they want to survive, and our protection became much more valuable than that of Konoha.

Trusting the Sand village to act in the interest of a better world, after they have been fooled twice (or possibly more) by the Akatsuki is absolutely not rational, it's just plain naivety. It's akin to acting like a person with normal values in the middle ages.

Alternate Konoha move -

- Capture all sand forces, kill those who resist. Try to convince Kazekage about akatsuki in prison, if agreeable, release them a little later --> now you have two villages that can cooperate against Akatsuki! Also let the news spread that Konoha didn't let the perpetrators get away. (Likely to fail, as Akatsuki is simply going to assassinate the Kazekage and try to subvert the next one).
- If convincing the Sand elders fails (which is likely, as they have already been fooled twice) keep the entire leadership in prison (or kill them idk, your choice), take over sand village yourself or install a puppet ruler (easier). Now you have a whole new village infrastructure and resources to use against the Akatsuki/Enemy!

After this chapter I'm actually very surprised that the other villages aren't sharing information with each other. My assumption was that each village would want to keep it's failures (Akatsuki's victories) hidden to the others, and so communication regarding that was impossible. But here the Hokage apparently doesn't care about any of that, and is willing to, idk, meet the Sand halfway regarding Akatsuki involvement? Strange, because not once were the Akatsuki mentioned by the Hokage...

I can guess that you, perhaps, wanted to show the audience that this is where the change starts, this is where the inter-village violence starts its decline, where the unification against Akatsuki starts, and a new age of world peace will eventually dawn because of this one move. But you decided to do it at the absolute worst time and place, and with such a drastic action. The sand has broken a treaty, betrayed an alliance, murdered your civilians and /children/ in cold blood. And you just let them go? In a feudal environment? It's the wrong move on so many different levels.

Change comes from slow steps, years of effort. It's never going to be doing or saying one thing, the other villages going "GASP!" and everything becoming sunshine and roses.
