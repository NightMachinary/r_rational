I think my favorite piece of imagery this chapter was the Kazekage hallucinating the Akatsuki members and them resolving to be the Anbu. That sense of paranoia and betrayal were beautiful. I like how it sets up in Rasa's mind that this was part of a set up. Not only for Leaf but for them too.

And possibly some foreshadowing about Anbu infiltration. Which would help explain that dude that blew himself up.

The more I read the more plausible it is for Orochimaru to be The Enemy, or at least directly working with them.
