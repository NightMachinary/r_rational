My perception of this chapter will, ultimately, depend almost completely on what comes next.

Konoha is in shambles. They just got betrayed invaded, and lost a lot of important characters. Almost every main character introduced so far has just sustained some serious trauma, or is going to when they find out what happened to their friends. Gai is going to come back from whatever he was doing to discover that both Lee and Ten-Ten are dead. The same can be said for Naruto and Sasuke; Sakura and Kakashi are both gone. And Kiba and Shikamaru and the rest just spent the majority of that invasion being tormented - I can only imagine how they are gong to react to all the horror they just endured.

And then the Third went and did what is probably going to go down in history as the most stupid move in his entire political career. He didn't punish the Sand ninja. Sure, the Sand lost stuff in their attack; but that would be like arguing its not right to press charges against the person who tried to murder you because you broke their arm during the attack. The Sand accomplished their goal (making the Leaf look weak so that they stop stealing their clients) and then made their escape - their overall plan went off without a hitch. They assassinated the leader of the 'strongest village in the world', and in return all the Third did was, basically, tell them to go away.

The Third just pulled a Jon Snow. He's so focused on the big picture that he's forgetting the people around him (especially his subordinates) are human beings with thoughts and feelings. Jon Snow was so focused on facing the Others and saving the Wildlings that he forgot the Night's Watch had been fighting the wildlings for generations, and many of his men had lost brothers to the people he was protecting (say what you will about the character, Olly was justified in his rage). The Third is so focused on facing the Enemy that he seems to have forgotten that his ninja just went through literal hell; just had their homes attacked and their friends butchered by a supposed ally... and then he just let them all go. This is going to blow up in his face spectacularly, and I can't wait to see it; the only sad thing is that the Third probably won't live to see how monumentally catastrophic the consequences of his blunder are going to be.

I could not see an easier way to make everyone support Danzo, than for the Third to let the Sand go without forcing any reparations. He's put the Leaf in a position where they need to be aggressive; they need to reestablish themselves as a force to be reckoned with, and they need to do it soon. I can only imagine what Cloud, or Stone are thinking, watching Sand get away with such a blatant attack on their most hated rival. Konoha is in such a precarious position right now that I'm honestly worried for the Village.

But anyways, to get back on track.; I'm fine with characters like The Third having flaws. I just hope this actually gets portrayed as just that; a flaw in his judgement, analogous to Jon Snow thinking he could just let all the Wildlings through the Wall without any consequences whatsoever. This may be the kind of move that might be good for The World/bad for the Enemy, but that doesn't mean that it's the right move for Konoha, and ultimately the Village should be the Third's first priority. He seems to have forgotten that mercy is a privilege of the strong; you can only afford to be merciful if you look/are strong - otherwise its just called weakness. The Third hear doesn't look strong to his own populace, much less the world.

This is why I prefer binge-reading. The fallout from all of this is going to be incredible, and having to wait to read it is going to kill me :(

And one last thing- When Sasuke talked about keeping it in the family, was he talking about some obscure canon fact that I've forgotten, or is this fic actually going somewhere different with Naruto's heritage/what Sasuke thinks Naruto's heritage is?
