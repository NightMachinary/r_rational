  It's simply not true that this attack did not cost them anything.
#+end_quote

You're answering the wrong question man, they lost all of this because of Konoha defending itself, not because Hokage told his ninjas to punish the Sand. Then only AFTER all the fighting ends, does the trial and punishment phase begin, but that never happened. There was no visible /punishment/ for this act of betrayal, murder and destruction. Horrible optics and an extremely negative hit to the morale of Konoha's prominent shinobi, who watched all this happen live.

  Third doesn't care about this because he /wants/ to spread a message of forgiveness
#+end_quote

This is, once again, extreme naivety on his part. How much do you allow yourselves to be rolled over and still forgive those who do so? Is there no limit to this forgiveness? Isn't this an open invitation for Leaf's enemies to attack and do whatever they want without repercussions? Also, from what I can see, this mentality is not shared by the majority of the city. And now the Hokage is dying, and in his last breath, he has performed an action that would piss off every single one of the families that had someone die to this attack. Who do you think they would follow as the next leader of the Village? Someone who talks about peace with the killers of their family? Or someone who preaches about strength and vengeance against this treachery?

  he simply doesn't see the Sand as his real enemy
#+end_quote

You see, here's the problem with that. By attacking the leaf, they are /aiding/ the real enemy. And from the text, Sand doesn't know it yet. Even in these last moments, The Hokage makes absolutely no mention of a real enemy that they both know about, that are hurting them both, and so the Sand goes back to their lands, still ignorant, still a tool of the enemy.

#+begin_quote
  He has realized at this point that the Enemy /wants/ the Leaf and the Sand to fight, that all of this was engineered just so that the two allies would kill each other... and so he simply chooses not to do that.
#+end_quote

This helps me understand a little bit more, BUUUT again, it is completely wrecked by the fact that the Hokage does not even SAY that The Enemy is involved. He just offhandedly mentions that this could've been engineered by "one of their enemies" which doesn't really inform the Sand about the gravity of the threat.

As far as the Hokage knows, the Sand still think of Akatsuki as either neutral or on their side. Naruto telling Temari and Temari telling her father about them is, as far as I can tell, not known to the Hokage.

And even if he did know, the Hokage simply namedropping them and reinforcing that he understands what is going on, might allow the Kazekage to at least understand that they had been played. But the Hokage didn't say /anything/. Even though we know he was thinking it, and was making a huge decision based on that knowledge. Why hold back this knowledge from the Sand if he thinks they are not the real enemy?

I re-read the chapter again, and this stood out -

#+begin_quote
  “Order everyone to stand down. If anybody so much as touches the Sand ninjas they will answer to me -- understood?”
#+end_quote

The people around him, Ibiki in particular, are holding back so much anger at this decision that I'm actually surprised they're still following the order, considering that the Hokage is dying and won't be around to be answered to anymore. But I guess they still have respect for the office, if not the person holding it. But do you really think they will simply let the Sand get back to their village in peace, with the alliance intact? How much distrust would there be, between the Sand and Leaf villagers? How would the alliance even continue, when Sand traders and shinobi will be viewed with suspicion in the leaf?

Also, even for the Hokage's own goals (peace, I guess), this move seems stupid. Once he dies, Danzo will rally the entire village with the promise of strength and vengeance, and the cycle will continue. As far as I have read, the Hokage doesn't really have a plan in place to counter Danzo's influence.

  I take all criticism to heart, but I think you're literally the first person to say that this story is too much sunshine and roses :P
#+end_quote

Hahaha, I meant more along the likes of the Hokage thinking like that, and why that is so jarring compared to what is happening around them. Obviously it won't be easy that :P
