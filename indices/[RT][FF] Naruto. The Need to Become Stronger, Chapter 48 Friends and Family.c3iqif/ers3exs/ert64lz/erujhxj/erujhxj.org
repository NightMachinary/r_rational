  I feel like this move by the Hokage comes off as irrationally stupid because there's absolutely /no/ punishment here.

No explicit punishment, no, but as Baki noted, they have lost half of their fighting force in this attack. They sustained far worse casualties than the Leaf (it is implied), Chiyo lost her arm as well as half of her puppets, they expended every last one of their explosive tags, and Rasa's son is still dead. It's simply not true that this attack did not cost them anything.

Are you right that this move makes the Leaf look weak? Of course! That's what Danzo has been saying right from the start - that the Third has made the Leaf soft. The Leaf has had that reputation for ages now, much to his chagrin (this is true in canon as well). The Third doesn't care about this because he *wants* to spread a message of forgiveness, and more to the point, he simply doesn't see the Sand as his real enemy.

Here is the Third's (apparent) reasoning: There is only one fight that truly matters, and that is the one of good vs evil, of light vs dark, and The Enemy appears to be actively trying to pull the world towards the latter. He has realized at this point that the Enemy *wants* the Leaf and the Sand to fight, that all of this was engineered just so that the two allies would kill each other... and so he simply chooses not to do that. It makes sense, in a way.

Now, as Rasa points out, what he *should* be doing is asking for hostages. Rasa would never permit himself to be captured, but the standard feudal thing to do in this situation is to hold his children hostage in Konoha while he goes back to the Sand. Thus ensuring loyalty. And perhaps the Third would have done that, except... he knows that even if the enemy is not literally right there in the village, they've still been actively manipulating things, and there's no guarantee that they couldn't kill Rasa's children to start the war all over again. And since the Third appears to be dying and things are slipping out of his control, he just wants the Sand out of the Leaf before someone like Danzo goes ahead and takes matters in his own hands. There's no time to discuss, no time to think, just do this one thing that he knows for sure his enemy doesn't want him to do.

  Change comes from slow steps, years of effort. It's never going to be doing or saying one thing, the other villages going "GASP!" and everything becoming sunshine and roses.

I take all criticism to heart, but I think you're literally the first person to say that this story is too much sunshine and roses :P

Rest assured, it isn't going to be that easy.
