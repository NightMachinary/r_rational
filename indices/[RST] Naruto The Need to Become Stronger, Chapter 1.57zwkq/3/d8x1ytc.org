TLDR: This good!

Okay so the writing style is a bit different, makes me think of trailers for movies where narator lines are mixed with scenes of protag. It's not bad just different to me.

Character behavior is pretty good and unravels pretty much how character descriptions and the originals would behave in real life, specifically talking about Kiba, Iruka, Sakura and Naruto's liking of her, and people's reactions to attacking noble and important figures.

Mizuki the QuirelMort seems a bit of copy from hpmor with his cynism, story and personality. Not a bad thing, just don't overdo it.

Prologue was good too. I like the attitude of Army > OP character/person in combat, I mean unless your special snowflake powers include out thinking a group of cunning people working in unison then you're gonna get screwed.
