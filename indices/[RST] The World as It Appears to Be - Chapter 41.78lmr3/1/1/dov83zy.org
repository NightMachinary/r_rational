That's not how I read it. It seems more like there were many history boxes, at some point they were good enough to be considered accurate to the point that people can be cleanly copied out of them, then there was a large (political) debate about the suffering caused within them (something that some people probably didn't understand, let alone care about) but the suffering was deemed acceptable due to the benefits and explained away as being merely a copy. Once the history boxes became widely commercialized for use in entertainment the old explanation as to why the suffering "isn't real" couldn't be applied anymore and the people on the other side of the debate won out this time.

Nothing in Lakshmi's speculation (because that's what it is) demands that the rules were implemented immediately after the first 'accidents' happened, just that everything happened in roughly the order she proposes.
