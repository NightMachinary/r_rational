Agreed about the suspiciousness of the setup--I also should go back and check a certain part related to the despairing amateur's motivation. Winston was immediately extremely alarmed about divergent terminations, albeit mollified a bit by them being self-terminations; it shouldn't take a 200-year alternate history for people to crack down on all divergence-causing interference ('chatting with celebrities'), or at least ensuring heavy regulation to ensure minimum divergence, similar to the lag compensation. That said, would the Iris stand by while Lakshmi lies about the Iris telling her things? Recall that any plan she can make to subvert what the Iris wants her to do, or any predictions she has about the outside, can be seen by the Iris beforehand. Hmm, I also remember a mention of 'pawn 1', so perhaps she has at least one other created individual to leave and try to maximise shareholder value in the outside reality too..?

That said, after all the ominous foreboding leading up to this chapter--particularly including the very last part of the previous chapter--this was a wonderfully refreshing subversion of expectations!

Let's see, anything else to consider while I'm writing... if deterministically feasible, I should definitely adopt the historybox pulling-out as a thing to do, and a thing to hope someone else does if I fail. In practice, probably requiring an assumption of infinite resources, in order to (potentially) make all dead inhabitants of all already-existed universes into equal god-like entities. Ah, there's the regulation matter again, the issue that a god-like entity must have oversight to prevent creating otherwise-impossible entities that then die without being turned into gods in turn... otherwise, in the short-term, might not be possible to even recreate the path of one's own branch. There's also the question of whether to have the 'first one' be equal to all others, though possible if all can have infinite resources, though an unchangeable oversight which isn't oneself is also scary in its own way.

I keep being interrupted while writing--ah, yes. Historybox revival: not (I think?) demonstrably equivalently desirable continued existence without dying even once, but one of the next-best things.
