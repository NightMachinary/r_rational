I... call bullshit.

If the "outside world" were so perfect and suffering-free and well balanced and well governed, no imperfect history box would have been created in the first place; especially since I'd expect those to be heavily regulated and monitored.

I suspect that Vishkar is lying to trick the other witnesses into believing she ought to win. If they believe that even for a second, she wins.

Also, I know I shouldn't complain about realism when reading an Overwatch fanfic, but /this is not how transhumanism will work, dammit/!

In Vishkar's testimony, humanity invented the history-boxes, used them wrong, then added a bunch of universal rules on how to use them. This isn't how science and engineering work outside of science fiction.

Inventions aren't discrete things. It's not "at time t there is no car, at time t+1 cars are invented and people have cars". Technological advances are gradual, they're based on previous advances and discoveries. And they're not implemented uniformly: distributing technology is easier in some cases and harder in others, depending on supply chains, existing infrastructures, how hard it is for people to learn to drive, etc.

My point is, by the time Mercy was able to simulate the universe well enough to save everyone from death, other people would already have built their own variations of history boxes; they would have bigger, slower boxes with rougher heuristics, but they'd be able to use them to do time travel, pretend to be Iron Man and stuff like that. The whole "is it okay to simulate suffering?" question would have been asked way before God!Mercy had completed her project.

I don't know exactly why this upsets me. I think people who imagine transhumanist futures don't realize how hard to imagine these things are, how simplistic most predictions are, or just how logistics work. It's like if someone in 1700 wrote a story about a guy inventing a car, then three months later everyone is already using cars all the time, then 3 years later the first road accident happens and people start worrying that maybe they should regulate the whole "car" thing. It makes for a simpler, more straightforward story, but it's completely absurd if you think about it too hard.
