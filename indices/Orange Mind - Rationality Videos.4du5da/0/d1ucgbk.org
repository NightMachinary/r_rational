Hey, everyone! I have been [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/492l86/qd_how_to_turn_abstract_rationalist_ideas_into/][talking]] about creating a series rationality videos, and now I finally made my first few episodes!!

I would really love to hear some feedback, so please let me know what you think =)
