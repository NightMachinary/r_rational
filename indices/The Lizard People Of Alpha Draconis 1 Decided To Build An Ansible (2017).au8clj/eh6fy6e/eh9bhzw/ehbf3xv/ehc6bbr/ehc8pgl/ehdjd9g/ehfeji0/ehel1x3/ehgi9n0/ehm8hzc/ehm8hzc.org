There are no two forms of FTL in the previous example. Moving faster than lightspeed is not required, only moving close at something like 99.9% lightspeed, to get noticeable dilation effects.

The only FTL that is present is an instant communication device.

The "the events occured before you saw them" is what inability to exceed lightspeed is.

Once you have ability to surpass lightspeed, this assumption does not hold.

I'll leave more detailed explanation to [[/u/crivtox]]

EDIT: [[http://www.physicsmatt.com/blog/2016/8/25/why-ftl-implies-time-travel][here]]'s an article with spacetime diagrams that should clarify the issue, in case you want a detailed explanation.

A relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  ...if we could just say that there was only one frame of reference where we needed to set up cause and effect, then we could have FTL without worrying about causality. However, there is no special frame of reference, there cannot be one if relativity is to be true. And relativity is true, because we all measure light to travel at the same speed (also, you need relativity for electromagnetism to work, which you probably do want).
