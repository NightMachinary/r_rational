#+begin_quote
  it seems like what you are saying is just the non-ELI5 version of what I was saying.
#+end_quote

Not quite; it feels like we have a philosophical difference. Specifically:

#+begin_quote
  Would it still be correct to say that in a given reference frame the only correct order of events is the one in which they are observed?
#+end_quote

I would say no, while you seem willing to take such observations at face value. Observations can be misleading, and the weirder your circumstances, the more misleading they can be. Saying that the correct order of events changes with your reference frame seems to me like saying that the shape of your body changes when you look at yourself in a funhouse mirror.

The practical problem with timeless physics is that we can't actually access an omniscient external view of our universe, so we can't use that view as a source of absolute truth. This leaves us with no viewpoint but our own limited and distorted one. We can, however, refuse to naively accept what our eyes show us, and can apply math to those observations to correct for known distortions.
