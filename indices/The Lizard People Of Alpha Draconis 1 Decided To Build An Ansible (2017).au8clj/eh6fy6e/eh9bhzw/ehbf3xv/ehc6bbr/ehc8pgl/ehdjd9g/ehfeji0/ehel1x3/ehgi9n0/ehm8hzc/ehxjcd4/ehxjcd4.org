  close at something like 99.9% lightspeed, to get noticeable dilation effects.

Well, there's you're problem right there. They will never see each other /at all/ as long as they continue at that speed. One object going 99% lightspeed in one direction while another goes 99% in an opposite direction will result in their relative speed to each other being much faster than the photons travelling between them.

Even if they are travelling in a similar direction, unless it is /exactly/ the same, the divergence will go quickly from "you can see them moving next to us right there" to "they just rapidly accelerated off into the distance and/or disappeared".

Hence my argument that this will require at least two different forms of lightspeed, the engine and the communications, or possibly even three as you need an 'FTL telescope'.
