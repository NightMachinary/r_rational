  Appearance or reality? Assuming A and C are moving objects, and B is a central point, using your scenario, are the speeds of A and C now reduced to half their previous amount, or is their perceived observable speed of each other merely capped at below c? Do A, B, and C all see each other moving away at the same speed?

One of the least intuitive parts of relativity is that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference#Special_relativity][there is no privileged reference frame]].

There is no "reality" that is more "real" than "appearances" from the point of view of any inertial reference frame. Which means that all three views are equally valid, and there is no fourth view that is more "real" than they are.

Regarding your question:

B sees that A and C move away from it at 99.99%c.

A sees that B moves away from it at 99.99%c, and C moves away from it at (0.9999*c + 0.9999*c) / (1 + (0.9999*c * 0.9999*c) / (c*c) ), which is to say, at 99.99999949995%c.

C sees that B moves away from it at 99.99%c, and A moves away from it at (0.9999*c + 0.9999*c) / (1 + (0.9999*c * 0.9999*c) / (c*c) ), which is to say, at 99.99999949995%c.

Also, they experience [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation][time dilation]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction][length contraction]].

  Subjective or objective? Is each 'traveller' bending its own localized spacetime to enable this perception, and if not, are the photons somehow violating their own maximum limits?
#+end_quote

Photons aren't violating anything. Subjective and objective are ideas that were coined before we knew how different reality is from the way our intuitions perceive it, you would need to read a book on relativity to untangle the exact question. A simplified, and imprecise answer, would be: every observer sees different picture of the world. In this sense it's subjective. However, each subjective view is equally valid, and there is no superior objective view. Meaning every inertial observer's position is as objective as it is possible to get, and no position is more objective than others.

  There has to be at least one, which is the one necessary for the supposedly causality-breaking communication.
#+end_quote

Yes, that's what the ansible is supposed to be.

  You'd also need some sort of insanely powerful visual system to pick up on something that will very shortly be sending you a rapidly diminishing number of photons for you to interpret its image from, anyway.
#+end_quote

Again, yes, but depending on distances, "very shortly" may be measured in years, and number of photons will not actually be rapidly diminishing: lightspeed is the same in all inertial reference frames. However, this visual system does not need to be FTL, an ordinary telescope will suffice.
