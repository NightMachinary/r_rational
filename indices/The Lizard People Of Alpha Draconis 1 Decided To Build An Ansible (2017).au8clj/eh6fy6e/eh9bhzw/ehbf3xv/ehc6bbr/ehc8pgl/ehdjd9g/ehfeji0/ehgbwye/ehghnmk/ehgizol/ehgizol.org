I'm probably missing something here, but it seems like what you are saying is just the non-ELI5 version of what I was saying.

#+begin_quote
  From this view, the only absolutely correct sequence of events is one that references the entire universe in four dimensions,
#+end_quote

Would it still be correct to say that in a given reference frame the only correct order of events is the one in which they are observed?

The bit you quoted was mostly to get rid of the idea that the observed order of events is just due to speed of light delays or some other measurement issue.

#+begin_quote
  Magic spells that don't work this way, and instead send information obliquely through time according to subjective views about what seems to be simultaneous, are /necessarily/ paradoxical.
#+end_quote

I think most, if not all, versions of FTL we see in fiction are supposed to be of this type (and therefor necessarily allow for time travel/are paradoxical).
