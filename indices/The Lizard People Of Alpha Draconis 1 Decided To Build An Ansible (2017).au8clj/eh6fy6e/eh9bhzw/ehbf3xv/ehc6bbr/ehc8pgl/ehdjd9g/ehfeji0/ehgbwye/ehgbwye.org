No, the events are actually /observed/ to happen in a different order depending on which direction you are moving in. The events themselves happen as they happen regardless of observation. For macroscopic events, observation of those events from different angles, speeds, and times has no appreciable effect on the events themselves, though observations taken from those different positions may well be unequal.

The problem here has little to do with FTL per-se, and more to do with the fact that the common-sense definition of 'simultaneous' breaks down in the face of relativistic time, since what is observed to be 'simultaneous' varies with reference frame. Resolving this is non-trivial, and probably requires timeless physics. From this view, the only absolutely correct sequence of events is one that references the entire universe (or at least the entirety of the relevant system) in four dimensions, detailing the exact position and velocity of each particle at each moment from the beginning of time to the end of time (or at least from the beginning of the question at hand to the end of the question at hand). If some /magic spell/ allowed you to 'instantly' send information from one part of the universe to the other, it'd be instant according to the timeless view of the universe, and not instant according to your own reference frame within spacetime. If possible, such communications would be non-paradoxical, since they necessarily could not be responded to prior to being received. Magic spells that don't work this way, and instead send information obliquely through time according to subjective views about what seems to be simultaneous, are /necessarily/ paradoxical.
