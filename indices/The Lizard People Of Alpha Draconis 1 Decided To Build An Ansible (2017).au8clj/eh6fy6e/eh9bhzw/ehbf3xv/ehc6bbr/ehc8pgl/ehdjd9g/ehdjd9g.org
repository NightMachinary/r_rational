Yeah, still not seeing it.

If we both seem to have slower frames of reference to the other, you can't sent it faster, because you have to see it after it's been slowed, then I have to see your /response/ after it, too, has been slowed by an equal amount.

Most of the 'FTL is time travel' arguments require you to have some /other/ method of sending information that is absolutely instantaneous. This one is not it.

Similar to what the prior reply said, FTL and instantaneous are not the same thing.
