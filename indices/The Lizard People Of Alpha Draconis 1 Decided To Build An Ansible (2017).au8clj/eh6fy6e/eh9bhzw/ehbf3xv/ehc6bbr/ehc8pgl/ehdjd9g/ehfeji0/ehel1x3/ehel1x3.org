Ftl is time travel, it's more obvious if you draw the spacetime diagrams or do the math but I'll try to explain it whith examples.

We start whith synchronized clocks at 2 pm.

From my perspective at the right speed when my clock is at 4pm your clock is at 3pm.

From your perspective when your clock is at 4pm my clock is at 3pm.

If you send an instantaneous signal at 4pm it arrives to me at 3pm , and I send a response back wich arrives even sooner(since when it was 3 pm on my side for me your clock was at 2:30) Efectively sending messages back in time.

I'm not sure I understand your objection, what do you mean by "the response has been slowed" And "absolutely instantaneous"?
