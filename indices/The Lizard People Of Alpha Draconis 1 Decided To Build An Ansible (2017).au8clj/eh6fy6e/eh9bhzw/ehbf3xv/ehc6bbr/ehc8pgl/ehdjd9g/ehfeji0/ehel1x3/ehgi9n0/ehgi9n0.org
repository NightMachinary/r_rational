  rom my perspective at the right speed when my clock is at 4pm your clock is at 3pm.

If you are observing at light speed, this either means one of two things. Either you are the functional equivalent of one 'light hour' distant as far as the observable medium is concerned, since your eyes only see the photons moving at lightspeed, or you are somehow doing time travel. Which do you think is more likely? Do note that if you are somehow observing the effects through some sort of magical divination that occurs at faster-than-lightspeed, then you are no longer affected /by/ the distortions caused by apparent and relative velocity.

  if you send an instantaneous signal at 4pm it arrives to me at 3pm

So to clarify, we are dealing with *TWO forms of FTL*, yes? You have your FTL drive moving you faster than lightspeed but not instantaneously, and you also have your communications device, which somehow is perfectly, absolutely 'fast'? I mean, breaking reality one way is fine, but I just want to be clear we're doubling up on violating natural laws.

  If you send an instantaneous signal at 4pm it arrives to me at 3pm , and I send a response back wich arrives even sooner(since when it was 3 pm on my side for me your clock was at 2:30) Efectively sending messages back in time.

The events occured before you saw them. The communications, even if instantaneous, still occur after the events you have observed, although its possible to receive the information prior to actually seeing it. Again, if you claim that you are somehow 'seeing' the event instantaneously, then it is not affected by the distortion, and you are STILL communicating after the fact
