Relativity is weird (or we are weird for not understanding relativity if you've been listening to [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7FSwbFpDsca7uXpQ2/quantum-explanations][Eliezer]]). Let me try to repeat the explanation that made it somewhat make sense for me:

If two spaceships are moving at very high speeds in different direction relative to two planet a very long distance away, the sequence they see events happening on those two planets can get out of order relative to what the other spaceship sees. So if for the people on the two planets event A on the first planet and event B on the second planet happen at the same time, for one spaceship A might happen before B, while for the other B might happen before A.

Note that this has nothing to do with measurement errors or anything like that, the events /actually/ happen in a different order depending on which direction you are moving in (check the wiki page on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity][relativity of simultaneity]] for more details). Yes, this is super counterintuitive and not at all how we usually think of time working, blame the ancestral enviroment for not including more near-lightspeed tigers for us to avoid.

So, on the planets A and B happen at the same time, but for Spaceship 1 A happens before B and for Spaceship 2 B happens before A. This is all perfectly fine and nothing breaks because the spaceships and planets are all very far away from each other, but what happens if we introduce FTL communications? Spaceship 1 can now send a message to the planets as soon as they see B happen, the planets relay that message to spaceship 2, who then holds on to it until they see A happening, at which point they send it to the planets who relay it to Spaceship 1. And since on spaceship 1 A happens before B, they receive the message before they initially send it.
