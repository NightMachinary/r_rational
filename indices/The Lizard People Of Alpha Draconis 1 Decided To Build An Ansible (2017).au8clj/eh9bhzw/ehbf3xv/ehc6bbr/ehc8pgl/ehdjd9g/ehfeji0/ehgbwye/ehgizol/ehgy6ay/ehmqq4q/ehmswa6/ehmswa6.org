That's... not what I'm saying at all, actually.

Recall that we are talking about a phenomena which appears to be impossible. Bearing in mind that either violation does serious harm to the models we are using to support our theories about what the results of the violations are, I'm suggesting that a violation of locality seems less impossible than a violation of causality.

Given such a violation in either case, it would be /most appropriate/ to start by throwing out the models in question, which explicitly disallow such violations. Regardless, physics in which violations of locality are permitted would also seem to permit simultaneity in a sense that our current understanding of physics does not.
