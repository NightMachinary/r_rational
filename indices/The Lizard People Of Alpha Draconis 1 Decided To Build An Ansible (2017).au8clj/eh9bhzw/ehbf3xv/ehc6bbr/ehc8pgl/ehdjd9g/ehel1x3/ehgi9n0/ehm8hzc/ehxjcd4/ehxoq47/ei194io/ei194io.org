  Relativity says that no matter how fast you move, you can never move away from other object at speed faster than c, even if you move at 99.99% c away from the starting point, and other object moves at 99.99% c away from the starting point in an opposite direction.

Appearance or reality? Assuming A and C are moving objects, and B is a central point, using your scenario, are the speeds of A and C now reduced to half their previous amount, or is their perceived observable speed of each other merely capped at below /c/? Do A, B, and C all see each other moving away at the same speed?

Subjective or objective? Is each 'traveller' bending its own localized spacetime to enable this perception, and if not, are the photons somehow violating their own maximum limits?

  There is no need for different forms of lightspeed.

There has to be at least one, which is the one necessary for the supposedly causality-breaking communication. You'd also need some sort of insanely powerful visual system to pick up on something that will very shortly be sending you a rapidly diminishing number of photons for you to interpret its image from, anyway. I originally assumed the example involved FTL travel of the ships, but since we're not doing that, the use of an /ansible/ is apparently enough.
