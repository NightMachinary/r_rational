  Well, there's you're problem right there. They will never see each other /at all/ as long as they continue at that speed. One object going 99% lightspeed in one direction while another goes 99% in an opposite direction will result in their relative speed to each other being much faster than the photons travelling between them.

Well, there's /your/ problem right there. You don't just add speeds of two objects to get the speed with which they move away from each other, instead you use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula#Special_relativity][velocity addition formula]], that's one of the big parts of relativity.

Relativity says that no matter how fast you move, you can never move away from other object at speed faster than c, even if you move at 99.99% c away from the starting point, and other object moves at 99.99% c away from the starting point in an opposite direction.

There is no need for different forms of lightspeed.

Relativity is highly counterintuitive, so it's not surprising you got it wrong. If you want to learn more, here is a good place to start:

EDIT: added the missing % to 99.99% c
