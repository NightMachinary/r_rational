Personally, I think that since it requires the deaths of millions of sapience it *corrects itself* by making itself obsolete, thus improving the net amount of 'good' (or reducing the net amount of 'bad') in the universe.

IE: The mechanic it uses to function is the same mechanic that makes it not worth using.
