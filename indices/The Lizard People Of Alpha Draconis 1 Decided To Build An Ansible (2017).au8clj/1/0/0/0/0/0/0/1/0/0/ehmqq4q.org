No , the thing you are calling a timeless god eye view of the universe its just a preferred reference frame which is what relativity is incompatible whith .

Simultaneity is just not an objetive fact about events , the actual god eye view of the universe doesn't contain it .\\
Time doesn't work in an intuitive way that happen to look like the less intuitive way , it actually looks like the unintuitive way .

You are assuming there's an "objetive" simultaneity and therefore if it looks like things being simultaneous or not depend on a arbitrary choice of frame of reference that must be a fact about our perception , not about reality.

But actually the objective absolute truth about the universe but it doesn't seem to contain facts about which events happen before others , just a different kind of relationship between events happening , which fits different orders of tings happening depending on an arbitrary choice of which velocity is 0.\\
And where causality IS absolute , unlike the order of events , as long as there's no physics breaking magic to go faster than light .

If you , in the situation I proposed before ,turn back when you reach me less time will actually have passed to you your clock will have advanced less , you will have done less stuff etc.\\
Its not a weird quirk of how things moving at different speeds look like , there are actual observable consequences.\\
(It looks like there's a paradox there whith you considering that less time would have happened for me but actually from your perspective it gets synchronized when you turn around to go towards me.)

Its not really about the observer , I'm putting the reference frame whith an observer because it's more intuitive but you can put it wherever you want .
