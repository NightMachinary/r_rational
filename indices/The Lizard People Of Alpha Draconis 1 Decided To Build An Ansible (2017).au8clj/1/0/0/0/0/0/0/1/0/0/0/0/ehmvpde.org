A ok sorry. Special relativity by itself doesn't say anything about locality as far as I unsertand And while this is getting out the limits of my knowdelenge of physics I think we currently say that you can't have violations of locality because they cause violations of causality and we asume you cant have those. You can perfectly do the math for ftl things,or draw the spacetime diagram it just gives you really weird results.

Though I don't know enough about general relativity to say this is the case for it.
