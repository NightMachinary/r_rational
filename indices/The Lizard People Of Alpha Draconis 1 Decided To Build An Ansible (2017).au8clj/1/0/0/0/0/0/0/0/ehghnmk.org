  No, the events are actually observed to happen in a different order depending on which direction you are moving in.

I came back to post exactly this, but *Endovior* did it for me. Thank you.

None of the "FTL is time travel" examples work because every single one of them so far presented still requires you to *observe* something, and that information is being transmitted at light speed.

Most of them require /three/ speeds, /TWO/ of which are FTL. They assume that a ship is travelling FTL, but not instantaneously. They assume some method of communication exists that is instantaneous (ie: faster than the FTL drive in use, which makes you wonder why they bother with it at all). And then they assume that observation of events is somehow FTL as well, despite the fact you can only observe it both after it occurs and after the observable medium has reached you the 'slow' light-speed way.
