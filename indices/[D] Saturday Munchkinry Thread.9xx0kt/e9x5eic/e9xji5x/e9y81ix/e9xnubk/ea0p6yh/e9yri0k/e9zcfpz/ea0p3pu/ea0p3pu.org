If you're in a single timeline setting then you should /really/ not send any butterflies back to before you were born (and that's presuming you getting this power was guaranteed even if you ended up growing up to be a very different person, if it's not then don't send butterflies back long before you got this power), since even literally microscopic disruptions will ripple outwards changing brownian motion within the butterflies future light cone and ensuring a different sperm (if any) ends up fertilizing the egg that would have otherwise become you.
