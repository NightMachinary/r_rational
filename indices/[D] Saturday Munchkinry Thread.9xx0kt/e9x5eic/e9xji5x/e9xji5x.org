You can send butterflies back in time to a location and time of your choosing. How do you optimize this so that you can send your past-self messages? Learn to differentiate butterfly species so you can assign some meaning to each, made more specific by sex, color, and other things I haven't thought of? What happens to the butterflies? Do they disappear once you deviate from the timeline they came from? Or do they stay, potentially being used again?
