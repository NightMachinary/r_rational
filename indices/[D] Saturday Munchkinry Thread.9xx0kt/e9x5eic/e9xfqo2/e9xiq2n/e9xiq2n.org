if you somehow remove a known grinch (be it redemption or murder), then a new grinch immediately appears elsewhere. and he just got that much more power. so no, there is no net benefit to removing a grinch, and the next once will probably be smarter than the last. the new grinch will appear AFTER christmass (when his hangover clears up), and have all year to use that power before you can act. maybe he ruins easter or halloween instead?

keep in mind- you cannot find the grinch. and if you can't find him, how do you target him with a miracle? the first grinch isnt that bad, hes just a selfish jerk. with whatever part of unlimited power you just gave him.
