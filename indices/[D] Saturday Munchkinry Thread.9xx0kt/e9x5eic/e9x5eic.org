well, the christmass movies are on TV again. so heres an evil idea for a power to munchkin.

you get nearly unlimited power, but only to perform a christmass miracle. the limits: it must be a G-rated family friendly miracle, the miracle must benefit someone other than yourself, and the end result must result in a positive outcome for those involved (no revenge). and naturally, the effects center around christmass eve and christmass day. using this power outside of that time requires it to focus on how it lead up to that time.

you can perform multiple miracles at the same time, if your clever. but for the plot twist- somewhere, a grinch gains power equal to the power you just used. you dont know who or where the grinch is, but their selfishness will ruin someones holiday. the grinch has no limits on power use, but cannot use them to find you. the grinch is not exactly rational.
