Well if you're the only one with a marker then it seems like you'd use the power to get stuff into space really easily and produce infinite energy (have part a turbine in the anti-gravity field).

If the whole world had this magic then space travel and space infrastructure would immediately become no more expensive than building things on earth, kinetic weapon attacks would probably become a massive danger with lots of terrorist attacks probably decimating cities and leading to a global winter and a perpetually dust filled sky. So in all likelihood the population would quickly begin moving into space habitats which can't be as easily targeted by extreme kinetic attacks (and are smaller and more decentralized than cities making you less of a target) as well as self sufficient underground bunkers. However in all likelihood billion would die. On the plus side this new space faring humanity would have tremendous advantages in every area from the fact they had virtually free and unlimited energy.

Were this magic to become available in 2,000 BCE then it would both probably kick off an industrial revolution (since the /relatively/ simple mechanical applications of this powers limitless energy is nearly endless, for instance allowing the easy transport of water against gravity, or building flying machines). However as the tech got more complex so too would the kinetic weapons, as people figured out how to make simple machines which would rise further into space before flipping around and smashing back down into their targets. Since you can't really stop some lunatics from putting insane amount of dust in the air from impacts, whether this would probably lead to human extinction is unclear: Since whether using the new tech people could save themselves in time is unclear (for one they'd have to figure out some way of growing crops despite the perpetually clouded sky, though machines could easily be used to generate heat).
