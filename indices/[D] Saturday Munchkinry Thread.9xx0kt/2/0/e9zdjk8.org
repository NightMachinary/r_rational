this requires ink... 2000 BCE would not have access to that ink, as well as a surface to draw on. expensive, controlled by an elite class, and is basically magic.

if its one pen and you dont know the rules, the odds of it being used correctly are low. how many people draw proper circles?

if its common and known, then it becomes technology. can i spin a plate inside a circle to align more or less circles? what does a hole at a right angle or reverse surface do? what if i put gravixt x2 here, and -2 there? is that a drive system in zero G? can we turn it on and off? because if we can, then we have not only propulsion, but free energy.

for free energy: put the +/- gravity disk on the end of an arm, and have its spin turn a wheel to generate power. numbers come down to limits of material science for how much force can safely be used.

so, free energy and arbritraily fast spaceships (again, limited by material science for how much gravity of force they can withstand). actual 1G in livable circular sections of spaceships. so big circle for people, smaller circle (hole) for the gravity drive. you ship is vaugly donut shaped at its core, surrounded by radiation shielding and life support.
