Sorry, you don't need to draw an actual circle, just like a squiggle that connects at exactly one point. A square would also work. It doesn't require ink. I guess "chalk" might have been better than "marker".

I'm not seeing the plate thing right, I think. Concentric circles cancel circles outside them. So if I draw a target with five layers, that counts as the center being a zone of no change, and the donut right outside that one has 2x normal gravity, and the rest do nothing.

yeah, you could turn it on and off by wetting an area, wiping it away, and then drying the area off and refilling it.

If it's on a vertical surface it'll try to face towards the drawer, otherwise normal. If it extends up to a vertical surface at a right angle, the zones will overlap but no additional effects, ie if two zones overlap that volume is just more of the same zone.

You can't quite get arbitrary accelerations because the mark is pretty thick and the maximum distance between any two points can't exceed 3m or you lose the magic. The packing problem might be pretty hairy but the theoretic best is 10cm diameter circles inside a 3m circle. Based on this: [[https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/smaller-circles-in-larger-circle-d_1849.html]] the most holes you could make is 698, but that would leave you a very small volume of 697x antigrav, so you'd want fewer than that, and 10cm is actually impossible since that would mean there was no actual hole, so smaller than that as well.
