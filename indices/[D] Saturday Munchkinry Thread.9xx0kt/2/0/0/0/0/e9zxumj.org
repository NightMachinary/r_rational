1) Yes. If you made a circle on the inside circle of a giant sculpture of a donut, it would act as if there was a surface inside the donut and it would extend in the direction that the marker spent most of its time pointing away from, ie, the side that you would have to draw it from you, so it would push you back as soon as you finished drawing it if you didn't get out of the way.

2) You can't nest concentric circles. This just removes the outermost ring's magic. If you drew on a slab and then placed it on top of another magic circle, they would add together but wouldn't go over the maximum. within the right zone, ie, 2+3=3, 2+ -2 = 0. This is true in any case where fields overlap.

3) Sorta, it's really that it's adding an additional n*9.8 m s^{-2.} So if you were on the moon and drew a circle with one hole, you would create a zone of 19.6 ms^{-2,} not a zone of whatever twice moon gravity is.
