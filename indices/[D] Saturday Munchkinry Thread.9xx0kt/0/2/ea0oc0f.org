Well it seems like the grinch uses his power after I use mine so it seems pretty trivial to ensure he doesn't get to do anything. Just create say some supernatural godlike being with your values that grows in power and intelligence exponentially every instant it exists for. That way when the grinch gets their own god it won't be able to do anything bad because my god can just overwhelm it in power at every turn.\\
Of course there's many other selections that might capitalize on your head start like this, but this seems like the most extreme and powerful example.

Alternatively beyond just relying on the fact you get a headstart on the grinch, you could also rely on the fact that it never indicated the grinch was as clever, knowledgeable or skilled in munchkinry as you. So there's a near infinite number of powers whose exploits are non obvious which would let you beat the grinch. I could list powers like that all day but the best choice will depend on which exploits you're familiar with. Here's a few assorted selections you could use that are from CYOA's I've done before:

- /Limited Divination/: [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/][As demonstrated by this short story]] (or rather the fact the makers of the that CYOA didn't realize the problems) you could pick divination extending say a month in the future and use that to chain information back from arbitrarily far in the future. Making you insanely more powerful than the grinch if they don't figure out to do this.

- /Always Winning Games of Chance/: Based on how most people don't think to use this to make up their own games whose win conditions are anything you want, the grinch probably won't think to use this to gain godlike power, especially if you place a time limit on how long you get this power.

- /Malevolent Wish Granting Item/: If you're tremendously skilled in the use of crafting airtight wishes then you could ensure you (and by extension the grinch) get an item that will try to (within some limits) interpret your wishes so as to be as beneficial as possible for the other party. This selection is particularly amusing because given how bad nearly everyone is at coming up with airtight wishes, in all likelihood you can just sit back and wait for the grinch to use up their wish and you'll end up vastly better off.
