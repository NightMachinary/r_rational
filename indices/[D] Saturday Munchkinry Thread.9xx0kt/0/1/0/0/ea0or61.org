  keep in mind- you cannot find the grinch. and if you can't find him, how do you target him with a miracle? the first grinch isnt that bad, hes just a selfish jerk. with whatever part of unlimited power you just gave him.

I mean given the lack many real limits on the miracles targeting the grinch directly seems completely trivial through any number of means.\\
However given this grinch is apparently not evil (as opposed to the normal grinch whose utility function pre-heart expansion demanded the suffering of others) it seems like the amount of miracles that would turn out fine is actually pretty expansive. All you have to do is ensure that the grinch's version of your miracle won't benefit him the most if he uses it in a way that leaves other people worse off.
