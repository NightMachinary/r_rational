loop mechanics make the most sense with multiple universes- A sends data to B, who sends data to C and so on. even if its the same universe, thinking of it this way clears up a lot of nonsense. and it also means you will always be in a place where the message exists before you send it. being able to send messages does not preseve your memory of the world before that message existed.

if you decide to send 1000 colorful butterflies to any point in the past with a major disaster before it happened, for example, then mythology about butterflies would change. and it would have always been so before you were born, so you would grow up knowing it was so... and wondering why it stopped after a certain point. and if it did in fact prevent some man-made disasters, then it would change when they needed to be sent.

so logically, you cannot bootstrap a solution that you cannot get to without the bootstrap. you could however speed up change by skipping steps if you knew you could trust butterfly messages. any real scientists would test that information, to verify accuracy (what if butterfly messages were only 98% accurate?)

so, the real question is if messages sent by A will show up for C and later? if they do, then you get a lot of false positives. if they dont, then you get a confusing absence of information. and you dont know which iteration of the cycle you are in. what if X fails to send any butterflies at all? such as if the change prevented getting the power, or even being alive long enough for it to matter.
