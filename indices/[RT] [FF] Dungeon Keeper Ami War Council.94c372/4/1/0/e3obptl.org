I've only really seen one intelligent charicter, all the others seem pretty much at best part of the scenery and the exsplainations often seem more like exscuses because the implications and reasoning are always good for her, infact pretty much nothing ever gors wrong for her. It improves over later chapters but by then it seems sorta too late because of how big a powerbase has become canon for her. For exsample the implications of teleportation don't seem to have been exsplored, especially before Mercury's arrival. Really it does seem rational but only where the story's focused, the rest of the world just acts however's convenient for the plot.
