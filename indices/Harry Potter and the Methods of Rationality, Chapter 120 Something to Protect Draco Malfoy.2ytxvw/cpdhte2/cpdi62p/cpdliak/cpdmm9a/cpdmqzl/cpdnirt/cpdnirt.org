But you see, Harry and the narrative seem to think that Harry is doing a nice thing. Harry even said "I won't manipulate you", etc. But if telling someone something to see their reaction and then making them forget to avoid the consequences is not a (pretty horrible) manipulation, I don't know what is.

It's like in canon you have a horrible story about Tom's mother and Riddle Sr., but then Hermione says with a straight face that "love potions are not dark or dangerous" (real quote).

Edit: missing word.
