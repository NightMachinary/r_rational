tl;dr: Ginny gives the Diary Horcrux to Hermione instead of trying to throw it away. Hermione does her best to penetrate the Diary's mysteries. 27k words, complete.

I was thinking that this story was at least a /little/ rational(ist). Hermione does a /lot/ of research in the library in order to check what the diary tells her, and she consistently engages in intellectual discussion with it--including some stuff on the classification of spells as "dark". She also explicitly calls out the Hogwarts staff and the Ministry for incompetence.
