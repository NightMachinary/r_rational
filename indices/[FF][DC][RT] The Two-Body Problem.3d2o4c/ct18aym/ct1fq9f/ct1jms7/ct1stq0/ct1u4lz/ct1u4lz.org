  True, but, er, calling the ministry out on its incompetence is kinda done-to-death at this point. Still no less true, but there it is.

Agreed.

Note that as nerdguy1138 said, you can't really even /use/ the Ministry in a story without calling out its incompetence. That would be like using Superman without pointing out that he wears his underwear on the outside. The subject will /always/ come up because it's /right in your face I mean come on what is that I don't even/.

Also, sometime I feel like binge-reading Ministry-bashing. It's like Kuno-bashing; sure the horse has been dead for two decades, but it just feels SO good.
