I liked this chapter, although.

First! Positives! I think you portray character shock, surprise and confusion quite well. Bill's explanations of things are well done, easy to follow, and easy to reason with. The subtle "huh, this is weird" about the meal are good.

Second! Critiques! The hologram "tour" was a little weird, felt wedged in. If Bill really didn't care that much, there'd be more evidence of carelessness about the system. Like if you got in a Tesla and the seats were uncomfortable (not that that's true).

It's lectury. More tell than show, even in the location descriptions; which kinda feel like they're just there to tell me how much of a research genius the guy is.

Something feels less-than-optimal about Bill, in his actions with the world. Have you ever seen Elon Musks' bit about first principles? His example is batteries: he says (paraphrasing), "you look at the price of the batteries, and then you look at the price of the elements that go into a battery, and, well, they don't add up. Batteries are too expensive."

Then you look at Musks' current work, and you see: Well, you look at the dangers to the future of humanity, and you pretty much get: We're all on earth, and we use polluting energy. How do you fix this? Well, rockets. And renewables - specifically, for home power, and for transportation power.

There's this simple-direct-single-mindedness style that's present in that thinking that doesn't quite come across from Bill. Now, Bill's not Musk and probably doesn't need to be, but in my limited experience, people that ridiculously accomplished have some simple driving underlying principle - Stark is fiction because he's "just good at everything" and then picks up interests. Real people get that ridiculously good for a /reason/. What's Bill's?
