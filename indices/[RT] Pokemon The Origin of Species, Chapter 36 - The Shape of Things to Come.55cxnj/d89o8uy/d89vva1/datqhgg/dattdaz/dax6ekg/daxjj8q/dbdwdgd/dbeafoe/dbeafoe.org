Fixed the typo, thanks!

The "it" he's referring to is whataever pokemon results from a sapient AGI.

  But otherwise, I dunno if it's just me rereading it or your edits but the chapter seems more palatable. Removing the clapping stuff definitely helped, IMO. It also seemed like the lectures were more evenly spaced out with scenery transitions, which also helped.

\o/!

  I first clicked your link to your website though and if you don't mind some criticism there....I tend to hate web design that interferes with usability and content in favor of art or beauty or creativity or whatever and I feel like that applies even more for a website meant to host stories rather than pictures or links. On your site the story takes up a relatively tiny column in the middle while pictures and the table of contents takes up the other half to 3/4 of the screen. I'd be normally too lazy to go to a different site if I'm already on yours but this bothered me enough that I went to fanfiction to read the chapter, where the text takes up pretty much the entire screen, as it should, IMO.

Yeah, I'm definitely not a web designer and I just focused on usability changes when making the site on wordpress (adding links from one chapter to the next, useful sidebars, etc). Some of those things are still not working the way I want them to, but I totally get why all the empty space might be annoying. I'll see if I can figure out how to change the text margins on the pages and posts.

Thanks for the feedback!
