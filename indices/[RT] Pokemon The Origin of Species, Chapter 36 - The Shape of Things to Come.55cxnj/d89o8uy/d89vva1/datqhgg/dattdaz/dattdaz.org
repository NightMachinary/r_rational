Yeah, I've done some rewriting since the chapter came out a few months ago, thanks in part to all the feedback like yours :) The whole section with storing people in pokeballs has been cut for a later point.

I also just now shifted a section from the beginning of the next chapter to the end of 36, to make the theme and impact of the chapter a bit clearer rather than waiting until the beginning of the next one to bring it home.
