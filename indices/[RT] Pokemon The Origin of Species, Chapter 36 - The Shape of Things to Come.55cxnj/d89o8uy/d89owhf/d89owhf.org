It sounds like what you're saying is that it has... pacing issues. Which the author acknowledges.

  Similarly, I'm concerned that I didn't hit the pacing as well as I could have, so more than usual, all feedback and specific suggestions on the writing is welcome.

You were ruder then you needed to be, you acknowledged a flaw that they're already aware of (but may have made him think it's more important then he already does, which could be good), and you didn't really include any concrete advice on how to fix it.

I was going to write a similar post saying how I found it a bit anvilicious. That it might be alright if you're already pretty close to the core rationalist community but he should strive to introduce these ideas slower. But I don't think you handled that particular set of complaints well.
