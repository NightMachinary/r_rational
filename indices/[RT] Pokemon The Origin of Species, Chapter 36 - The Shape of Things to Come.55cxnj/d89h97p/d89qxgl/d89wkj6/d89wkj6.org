Intentionally, yes. There's no one-to-one expy in my world, and while Giovanni's blogging is partially inspired by Yudkowsky, the "real" Yudkowsky in the pokemon world is doing what I imagine the actual person would be doing in such a world, which is the same thing he's doing in this one: trying to save the world from AGI. Giovanni, as it's probably become clear by now, has some decidedly different goals.

Of course I could be wrong, maybe Yudkowsky would actually try to become Pokemon God-Emperor if he were born in such a world. If the real [[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]] wants to stand up and say so, I'll be happy to re-adjust my mental models :)
