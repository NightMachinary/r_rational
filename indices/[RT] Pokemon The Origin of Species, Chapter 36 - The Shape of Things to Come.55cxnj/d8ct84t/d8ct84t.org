Late to the party an long time fan, just have to say thank you! While this wasn't one of my favourite chapters it did make me think a lot. This and To The Stars are among my favourite docs I've ever read and are some of my biggest inspiration for becoming a writer.

I'm even working on a Fic right now taking a more realistic look at the Pokemon world, not nearly as scientific as yours nor as rational though I do plan to turn it into a more political heavy Fic, but that's me rambling!

The main point I have to say is thanks for always bringing a smile to my face whenever I see a new notification email from you!
