I was planning on it being sort of a constitutional monarchy but not? (Not sure the word for this type of government). Basically the structure is this.

The champion is the peace of the region he can do what he wants... Except if all four elite four members unanimously veto him. You become leader of the country by being the most powerful trainer in the world, which well doesn't always work well and you can always be dethroned at any point too.

Next is the elite four, which is comprised of all previous champions who chose to stay ruling the region. So in this case Karen/Will/Koga/Bruno all were once champions but we're dethroned by the previous person, when asked if they wanted to stay on the league they said yes and they became the highest spot in the league. This consistently makes the league have only the strongest trainers at the top and the weakest at the bottom in a society based around power.

The league is heavily corrupt though, and actually run by the likes of Silph and Devon who fund essentially the entire country and if the champion makes a move the dislike, they will pull out making millions of people lose there jobs and potentially even civil war. So the champion does nothing without there permission and even enforces shitty rules like 10 year olds can go out into the world overrun by dangerous super creatures, just so the can get more pokeball and other trainer related item sales earlier on and don't care if the child dies.

Rocket in my world is disbanded (takes a few years after G/S/C) and rocket was an evil organization but they did it for a good reason, rocket wanted to try and revolutionize the two countries and make them into a much better system, abolish the ten year goal etc. it's how they got so many followings, of course there leader was corrupt and they did evil things in the name of good and that's why they ultimately failed. However, there original goal was one that was great in the first place.

On top of that there's plenty of advisors an other things that work at the league that help the champion (especially if there a 10 year old somehow) and you do always have the right to deny the championship too! The champion also is the head of the police force (if there's a ridiculously strong trainer that can't be taken down by police) among other things that mean a bad and corrupt champion is that much closer to being a horrible dictator.

That's pretty much the gist of my politics right now and while the plot has started very basic (trainer travelling to get badges) it is going to turn more into just trying to fix the league and all the problems with it.

I do plan on sneaking religion and philosophy in here at times too though (even though I am not a religious man) along with common things like adaptions to types over years/genetics and of course it will also be dark as hell, since that's what Pokemon in the real world would actually be like.

I take my biggest inspirations from you (darker more realistic world) and the stories Regret (darker more realistic world with adaptions), Language of life (gets pretty religious and philosophical) and the author Renaerys who wrote both Triumvirate and Clash of Crowns (darker more realistic Pokemon world, has adaptions and is super politically based though more the latter).
