I have already started it, it my first Fic (and a very ambitious one at that) that's teaching me a lot about writing as I do write it, it's just started though as hasn't even begun to delve into the politics like I plan to, since right now it is essentially the same starting journey type thing as most five on a slightly darker and grittier world, it probably won't start really delving into politics until a quarter to half way...
