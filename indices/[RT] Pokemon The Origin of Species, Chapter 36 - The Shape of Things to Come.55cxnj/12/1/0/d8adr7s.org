I think what it all boils down to is that it was just too fast. There was not enough foreshadowing, the plot felt like it was going in a completely different direction right up until this chapter. It doesn't flow, it doesn't fit, it's jarring as all hell. It was too much too soon. A lot of that conversation should be broken up and put into different parts of the story. Maybe instead of Bill spontaneously inviting them via professor oak, have something in Bill's AI research get public attention, and Leaf goes over there to get the scoop, and Bill reluctantly lets her in because he thinks she might portray his work more reasonably than other journalists (since she knows nothing about AI research and has not formed any preconceptions, and since she's the daughter of Professor Juniper). In fact, i wonder what would happen if Leaf went in there and Red didn't. Leaf would have a lot of interesting things to say to Red and Blue and would have to try to explain it to them instead of Bill. Imagine if Leaf was the one telling Red that he wasn't aspiring high enough. I think that would be a really interesting conversation.
