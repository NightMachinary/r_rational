  I'd rather see the trio of main characters level up over time and battle challenges within their realm of expertise than be slapped in the face with a super powerful potential ally operating 100 levels above them and dwarfing all the importance of the things they're working on and trying to accomplish.

My view on this is a bit different. I /like/ the idea of showing that the main characters are currently dwarfed by the power and importance of some of those they interact with. It ups the stakes, and puts their struggles in perspective of what they're trying to reach. To be important in a world with people like Bill and Professor Oak and Giovanni in it, you need to do much more than just be a good trainer or researcher or journalist.

You've got to be the best at what you do.

(Like no one ever was, even.)
