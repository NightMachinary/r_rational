Probably not as I definitely don't think it is even close to realistic enough to be on this sub as I don't plan on making much sense except for certain occasions of a fictional world with monsters that can shoot lightning beams out of there stomachs, I am definitely no biologist and can't even begin to think f that kinda stuff!

I might post a new chapter here or there to [[/r/fanfiction]] or [[/r/Pokemonfanfiction]] but O don't think it deserves to be here.
