Obviously the most important thing we learned here is that things can randomly become pokemon for seemingly no reason. We knew that "artificial" pokemon were a thing before this, but we were never told how they come to be.

What is the mechanism here? Did someone/thing do it on purpose or is it just a property of the world? This seems like something people should invest/bet a lot of money on studying.
