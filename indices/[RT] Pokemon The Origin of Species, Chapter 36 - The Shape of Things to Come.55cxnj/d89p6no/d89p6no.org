I think you should cut this chapter. It's too anvilicious.

They're going to be in bills house for a while, so consider simply splitting the content of this chapter up, across a few conversations. The pokeball-cryonics conversation should probably be part of an entirely different chapter, as an example.

No shame in doing some rewriting, and right now I don't think it's really persuasive for people who aren't already in the rationalist community core. Rationalist fiction should teach people, not just rationalists.
