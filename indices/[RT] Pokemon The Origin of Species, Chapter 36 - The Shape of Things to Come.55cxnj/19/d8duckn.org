I agree with a lot of the lecture stuff in the chapter but hate how it felt like an anvil being dropped into the story. We've got this guy who's super smart and characters who were contrary and questioning in earlier chapters just sort of nod along and get turned into subjects to be lectured at. Red didn't throw back even a single Steelman objection to anything he was being told.

Also if we're going ro 've lectured on AI there needs to be some kind of lead up in the earlier chapters. Something. It went zero to AI safety lecture in a paragraph like the author was thinking "I should name drop half the rationalsphere somewhere in the story. Lets do it all in one chapter"

Also the last little bit seems like a really massive hazard, pretty much bigger than all the rest combined.
