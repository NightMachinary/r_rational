In the future, when you have a lot of dialogue and lecturing to get through, I'd suggest splitting it up somehow. Maybe only have part of the conversation "on screen" and then have part in a conversation later where Red explains it to Blue, with some action in between.

Having it all together here breaks up the flow and makes it feel preachy.

Also, while the AI and Raikoth parts are interesting, I'd suggest shortening them (or moving them) if they play a major role in upcoming events, and removing them completely if they don't.
