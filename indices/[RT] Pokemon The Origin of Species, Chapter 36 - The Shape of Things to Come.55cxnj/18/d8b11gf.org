The part of me that has watched dozens of awesome fanfics slowly come to a halt is terrified that this fic will end before Red actually begins to use his psychic powers/ discovers something interesting with them; it feels like they are a plot point that will be developed, but so slowly that they won't really be relevant for a while.

I really enjoyed Misty's chapter; I feel like a psychic perspective would add yet another dimension to this rational Pokemon world. Are psychics treated differently in anyway? Is there any kind of discrimination against them? Are they allowed to gamble? How does any formalised testing work (for example any exams Red would have to take to qualify as a professor) if the candidate could glean answers off the person next to them? And given that psychics are extra vulnerable to dark type Pokemon, what provisions must they take to being completely incapacitated by a wild one, like Red was?

I really enjoyed Misty's chapter, because it began to delve into the world of Pokemon as seen through a psychic's eyes, and I greatly look forward to the day when Misty either becomes more integral to the plot, or Red's chapters can also possess that quality. I just fear that this fic, moving as it is, might be forced to abandon that plot element in favour of advancing the plot.

I guess I just hope that Red catching an abra will, in a way, kick start his psychic development.

And also a quick question; in Misty's chapter, I do believe she was only explicily said to communicate mind to mind with her Starmie, which is itself kind of a psychic pokemon. Can psychics in this universe not communicate mentally with non psychic pokemon?

And also, this chapter had a great ending. Hearing Bill talk about the dangers of a human level or beyond intelligent being with pokemon powers, knowing that Mewtwo exists, was awesome :)
