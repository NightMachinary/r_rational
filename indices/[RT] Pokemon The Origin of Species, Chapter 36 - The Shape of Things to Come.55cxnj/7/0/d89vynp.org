  They're going to be in bills house for a while, so consider simply splitting the content of this chapter up, across a few conversations. The pokeball-cryonics conversation should probably be part of an entirely different chapter, as an example.

I could do that, yeah. I actually added the pokeball-cryonics thing last (obviously it's at the end, but I mean I wrote it in after the chapter was done) because I wanted to bring it up so Red was aware of it as a safety option earlier than usual, but I'll see how the next chapter at Bill's flows and shift it around if necessary.
