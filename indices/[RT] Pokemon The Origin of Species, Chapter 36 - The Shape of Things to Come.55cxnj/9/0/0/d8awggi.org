As someone who doesn't know much about the issues covered, I personally found it a) interesting, b) necessary setup, grounding, and exposition for issues and events that will happen later on in the story, and c) an interesting dynamic to feature just Leaf, Red and another character, particularly with the addition of having Leaf take the academic lead rather than Red, as is usually the case.

I think the initial comment in this chain was overly critical and it isn't how I'dve put it.

People have different preferences. I do enjoy the action scenes and the battling as well and that is a big part of what I read for; but the world you've created has a lot of characters with different threads and plots running concurrently. A chapter like this is necessary and seems perhaps more 'unsatisfactory' read in isolation, than as part of a whole piece. In that sense, the episodic nature of publishing is working against you and against some readers' perception, rather than the actual content of the piece being a huge issue, I feel.
