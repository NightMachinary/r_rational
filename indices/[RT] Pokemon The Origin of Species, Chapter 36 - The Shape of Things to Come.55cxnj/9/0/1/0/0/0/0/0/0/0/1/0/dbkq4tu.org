Ugh. I'm just imagining that as a stupid game idea that basically means they improve the AI of the pokedex eventually, and maybe use a rotom to give it the ability to be mobile. It's such an underused concept that they really don't make it seem as if a pokemon is actually fused with your pokedex... witty banter and eyes on your device don't seem like particularly valuable innovations to me.
