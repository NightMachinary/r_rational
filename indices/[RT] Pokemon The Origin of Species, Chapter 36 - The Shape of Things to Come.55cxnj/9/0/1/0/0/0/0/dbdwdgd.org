I also don't understand what Red is referring to when he says "it might still be sapient."

But otherwise, I dunno if it's just me rereading it or your edits but the chapter seems more palatable. Removing the clapping stuff definitely helped, IMO. It also seemed like the lectures were more evenly spaced out with scenery transitions, which also helped.

I first clicked your link to your website though and if you don't mind some criticism there....I tend to hate web design that interferes with usability and content in favor of art or beauty or creativity or whatever and I feel like that applies even more for a website meant to host stories rather than pictures or links. On your site the story takes up a relatively tiny column in the middle while pictures and the table of contents takes up the other half to 3/4 of the screen. I'd be normally too lazy to go to a different site if I'm already on yours but this bothered me enough that I went to fanfiction to read the chapter, where the text takes up pretty much the entire screen, as it should, IMO.

But I am just a random user on the internet so feel free to ignore all this if you want, I'd definitely understand.
