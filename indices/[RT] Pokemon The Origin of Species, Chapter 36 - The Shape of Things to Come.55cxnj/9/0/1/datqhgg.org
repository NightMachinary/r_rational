  The problem of course is that putting in "foreshadowing," blunt as it may be, this early isn't always satisfying from a reader perspective. If I were writing this as a book, from start to finish, and then editing it afterward, I'm sure I'd make different choices about where the best place to put everything is. For now the best I can do is try to balance the plot progression with the world building, and that means occasionally missing the mark, as I may have here.

One place I've seen this done much better is /the gods are bastards/ (I don't think I'm spoiling anything in the following text so you can read it regardless of whether you've read that story). He's writing episodically, same as you, and had pretty large infodumps (ID), same as you. What I think the crucial difference in execution was that he didn't ID to foreshadow--he included elements of what the ID explained in the story, and their effects, without explaining them. Reading the ID then became a lot more tolerable because of the element of curiousity and because the reader could put all the pieces together themselves. You're handing pieces and promising a puzzle later while TGAB's author gave a mostly filled in puzzle and gave the final pieces in the ID.

It was also more organically done. The main heroes are in a school and the IDs were part of a lecture. It was very natural within the context of the story and provided a glimpse of the day to day life that is usually hidden from a reader. Obviously putting in /all/ the bathroom breaks and stuff would be very boring but putting them in every now and then actually grounds the story better and makes it more effective, IMO.

  Mental masturbation should feel good XD I spent way too much time researching to make that the case here.

Which is fine but if I wanted to read research, I'd read the sequences or go on google scholar.

  "No, let him keep going, this is amusing," Bill says, making them both turn to the smiling inventor. "I had about the same reaction."

I can't find this line anymore.

And this all is obviously my opinion, others may have others.
