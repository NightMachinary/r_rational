So first off, thanks for the critical feedback. I asked for it, expected it would come, and you delivered. I'll do my best to address your points, but overall I agree with your sentiment. I've already made some edits, and I'm sure I'll make many more.

And please reverse the downvote of yourself, I want to encourage comments like this :) I can take some slings and arrows if it means getting honest feedback.

  things that are only tangentially related to the story and almost completely unrelated to pokemon or its universe. If the entire thing would've been replaced with mewtwo is an AI, and you can capture abra here, and I would've been happier.

This is a situation I've been in before with the second interlude, where everything seemed completely unrelated to the plot where it currently was. Rest assured, the information here isn't just for informing the readers or world building.

The problem of course is that putting in "foreshadowing," blunt as it may be, this early isn't always satisfying from a reader perspective. If I were writing this as a book, from start to finish, and then editing it afterward, I'm sure I'd make different choices about where the best place to put everything is. For now the best I can do is try to balance the plot progression with the world building, and that means occasionally missing the mark, as I may have here.

  100% mental masturbation, almost nothing actually happens.

Mental masturbation should feel good XD I spent way too much time researching to make that the case here.

  I can almost see the marionette strings stretching from your hands to Bill's here. This just reads like a "and then he handed Red a crisp $100% bill while the national anthem played over the speakers and a bald spearow swooped in a window and settled on Red's shoulder and cried a single tear" story.

Rewrote this section, thanks for the feedback! Is this a bit better?

  "No, let him keep going, this is amusing," Bill says, making them both turn to the smiling inventor. "I had about the same reaction."
