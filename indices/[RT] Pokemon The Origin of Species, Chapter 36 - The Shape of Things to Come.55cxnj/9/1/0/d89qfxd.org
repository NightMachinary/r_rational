Perhaps, and I did downvote myself for it. I do like the rest of the story, it's just this chapter that did a pretty big shift in tone, IMO. It's like if Tom Sawyer had a sermon in the middle of it--I'm probably more upset because I liked the rest of the story and I like the subject matter presented here than I would be otherwise.

If I've offended daystar with anything I said, I apologize.

  and you didn't really include any concrete advice on how to fix it.

Chuck the whole chapter. The majority of it feels like it won't be relevant to the rest of the story (and the majority is not directly relevant to anything in the story thus far) and out of place and out of step with the rest of the story. Either than or split it up into bits and pieces and pepper it throughout the other chapters.

I acknowledge the effort it probably took to research and write it and I know it'd suck to have it all be wasted but I can't think of any other way to salvage the pacing to my preference.
