I thought this chapter sucked. 100% mental masturbation, almost nothing actually happens. And not only that, it's mental masturbation about things that are only tangentially related to the story and almost completely unrelated to pokemon or its universe. If the entire thing would've been replaced with [[#s][]] I would've been happier. The allusion to the [[#s][]] is about as subtle as a shovel in the face anyways.

I can almost see the marionette strings stretching from your hands to Bill's here. This just reads like a "and then he handed Red a crisp $100% bill while the national anthem played over the speakers and a bald spearow swooped in a window and settled on Red's shoulder and cried a single tear" story.

If you want to talk about AI that's fine and it can probably be integrated into a great story in bits and pieces but I don't like how you stopped the entire story dead in its tracks just to lecture the readers about it and have literally all the characters in the chapter support one particular viewpoint (probably yours). I /agree/ with the views expressed in this chapter but I don't want to read what is essentially a circlejerk about it in the middle of a pretty good pokemon story.

I'll downvote myself to save you guys some time.
