Its a bit harsh to completely condemn it and claim it must be cut when we haven't watched all the dominos fall yet. Once the story has progressed further somewhat, it may be fair to look back and say "this was a low point", but to claim that it offers literally /zero/ value with the information we have available is an extremely hasty conclusion.
