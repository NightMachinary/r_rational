Do Porygon exist in this universe? [[/u/DaystarEld]] ? Canonically they were the first fully human created pokemon, and I've seen a lot of fanon of them being made by Bill.

I'm not sure how they'd fit into his taonomy of AI given that they seem not to be any more intelligent than a normal pokemon/animal, but they may have something closer to general intelligence than a narrow AI. The simplest version woul be for them to be programmed to simulate pokemon, like an advanced version of a furby or nintendog type thing. Though not sure why they'd be regarded as "pokemon" rather than software, given we dont regard our virtual pet programs that way. Or they couldspontaneously generate in virtual spaces in the same way beldum and other pokemon do
