I also think this chapter is bad, but not quite for the same reasons. Essentially, my suspension of disbelief no longer exists now. With this chapter you have /significantly/ attached all the extra context of AI and such to your story, even going so far as to name-drop many actual people. I guess that's fine if that's really where you intend to take the story, but it does make /Origin of Species/ that much less unique. Oh well.

The only other real problem is that it's just too long. No matter how much research you do, it's never necessary to include an entire constructed argument in the chapter -- especially when you are replacing a chapter of a long-running serial with said essay! The only justification for it to be in the story was for the last few lines, so that an AI/Pokemon can be taken as scary. But we already had the Mewtwo interlude, so you can guess where it was going a third of the way through this chapter, so the tension just falls away.

I wish I had something more positive to say. Your story is still very well-written and unique, just... less so, after this one.
