Hey all, welcome back! This chapter took a lot of extra time to write due to research, and still managed to hit 10k words again. It's rather information dense in places, and there are some rather obvious shoutouts to specific people in our world. I tried to communicate their ideas as best I could, but am not an expert on any of the mentioned fields. More than any chapter before, I'm worried about inaccuracies I may have made in this one, so if you spot anything that's not right or is a poor explanation of one of the concepts, please let me know!

Similarly, I'm concerned that I didn't hit the pacing as well as I could have, so more than usual, all feedback and specific suggestions on the writing is welcome.

If you're interested in learning more about the AI topics talked about here, may I recommend [[http://www.arbital.com][arbital.com]]? It's a fantastic new site that attempts to teach high level concepts in easy to understand ways. Raikoth was stolen with permission from the great [[http://www.slatestarcodex.com][slatestarcodex.com]], which has dozens of top tier, informative, and persuasive articles on all sorts of topics. I don't agree with every conclusion its author comes to, but I always respect and admire the meticulous journey he walks through to get there, and always learn something from following along.

Finally, a quick note about my site: I've started adding blog posts here and there, on assorted topics. I don't have an RSS feed set up for it yet, but will soon: in the meantime, feel free to check it out and let me know what you think.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy!
