I really enjoy this story, but this chapter was.. kind of unpleasant for me. Maybe it's my personal preference, but the painfully direct real-world references are not doing any good for the world building.

In HPMOR, there are some direct references to psychology researchers, but they make sense as the HP universe is our real world universe+hidden society. Here it feels very out of place. Beside this, EY used his author notes for promotions and similar things, which I think is more appropriate. Heck those can be really influential, it led me (I have an incurable disease affecting my living quality) to sink in a lot of money into a certain medical company with zero gain. But this made me re-calibrate the trust I put in EY and not my judgement of HPMOR.

If you leave the promotion for your own pet projects or those of your friends in the story, this story might be seen in the future as something in between "The cool pokemon story where the author advertised these world changing applications before anybody ever heard of them". and "The cool pokemon story where the author advertised his crappy pet project that disappeared a few years after"

Wouldn't it be nicer to just be the "cool rational pokemon story"?

If the references are naturally part of the story, it works fine though. So mewtwo as the AI in a box and pokeballl-cryonics are both great ideas. For the ladder, Bill could rather just mention, his research suggests the damage done to human brains happens in the phase of getting out of the pokeball and not when they get in. Then it would be much more rational for Red to jump to his current conclusion without even questioning anything about the claim.
