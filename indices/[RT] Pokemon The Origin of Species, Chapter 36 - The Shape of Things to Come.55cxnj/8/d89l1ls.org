For some reason it won't let me drag to copy the text on the fanfiction site but I really loved the exchange when Red tried to pitch funding his research to Bill, and Bill denied.

It would have been cheap for Red to get a "technical" win on the self-imposed "funded through self-merit" by having Bill who's insanely rich and the stakes would be extremely low to fund do it.

But, Bill denies! And he doesn't mince words, but also doesn't slam the door shut in his face or admonish him for trying. Just that it has to have potential. So find something, anything and come back and show me.

And Red to his credit, puts in perspective. Doesn't cry or feel sore about it. He accepts it.

I really loved that. Plus the last chapter; Red being denied by everyone but a flimflam operation.

I really like Red. My guy is taking his lumps for real.
