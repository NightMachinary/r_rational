Yeah, it's a css setting. You can fix it using +stylish+ [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/38v4mu/supersimple_ways_to_allow_text_selection_at_ffnet/][this /r/rational thread]].

I really have a hard time understanding fanfic.net's thoughts on intellectual property. On the one hand, no problem using other people's settings and characters. On the other hand, we're going to make a big deal out of disabling copy+paste, poorly.
