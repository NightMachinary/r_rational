I like seeing Red struggle personaly. Too many rationalfic protagonists just steamroller through the world with their amazing smartness, which makes for a dull story, and a bad lesson. Much more interesting to see him struggle with relatively mundane but difficult problems (how do I get money vs. the world is ending)
