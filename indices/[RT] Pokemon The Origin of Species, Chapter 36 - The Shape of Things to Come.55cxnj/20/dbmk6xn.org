Since the AI stuff has already been discussed in detail I'l skip talking about that, but I do think you did a better job of fitting it into a context of other concerns than most LW inspired fiction does. Makes it seem less melodrmatic. And building up from oracle and genie helps. The raikoth science prediction market felt a bit shoehorned in though, unless it comes up later.

I was expecting from the previous chapters ciffhanger that youd use the mind swap with clefairy thing from the original, but i realise that would be ridiculously exploitable. The buildup of them entering the lab was very effective.

Bill's wealth comes from the storage system right? Unclear how he's getting that money since the trainers don't seem to pay for it. Is it funded by the regions? If so that would seem to require more interacting and negotiating with people than he is comfirtable with

His robots can make food and run the lab, but he hasn't got one to deliver soda to him yet? Or was that a pretense for testing their reactions. (Also, who has "a soda", don't people normally ask for "a coke" or "a sprite". )

I like that he tells them to wait a week. Shows realistic/sensible amounts of caution

He talks a lot about other people doing research in the things he isn't interested in, does that mean he's sharing his findings?
