  I was expecting from the previous chapters ciffhanger that youd use the mind swap with clefairy thing from the original, but i realise that would be ridiculously exploitable.

Yeah, that probably takes the cake as the single most ridiculous thing to show up in a pokemon game. And then it hasn't been mentioned in like 20 years of sequels, so I figured it was safe to ignore it as a thing... until the latest game references it.

Which is kind of annoying, but I'm still ignoring it until something of consequence happens with it :P Then maybe I'll come back and change things.

  Bill's wealth comes from the storage system right? Unclear how he's getting that money since the trainers don't seem to pay for it. Is it funded by the regions? If so that would seem to require more interacting and negotiating with people than he is comfirtable with
#+end_quote

His fortune was built by coding a relatively large number of TMs, which he's still collecting money from, but the storage system is his crowning achievement.

  His robots can make food and run the lab, but he hasn't got one to deliver soda to him yet? Or was that a pretense for testing their reactions. (Also, who has "a soda", don't people normally ask for "a coke" or "a sprite". )

He doesn't allow the machine too much generalized mobility: it can do things localized, but it can't move things from one place to another as part of risk reduction. Also I didn't want to make up a name for a soda, so I figured maybe he just doesn't have a lot of variety in his fridge and is happy with any :P

  He talks a lot about other people doing research in the things he isn't interested in, does that mean he's sharing his findings?
#+end_quote

With some people, yeah. Especially when he works collaboratively.
