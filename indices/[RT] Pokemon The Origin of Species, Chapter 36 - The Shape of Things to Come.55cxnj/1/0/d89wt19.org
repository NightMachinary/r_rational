  There's this simple-direct-single-mindedness style that's present in that thinking that doesn't quite come across from Bill. Now, Bill's not Musk and probably doesn't need to be, but in my limited experience, people that ridiculously accomplished have some simple driving underlying principle - Stark is fiction because he's "just good at everything" and then picks up interests. Real people get that ridiculously good for a /reason/. What's Bill's?

This made me consider that I should have probably put some of Bill's characterization later in the story in here. The reason I didn't is because there's a particular scene I have in mind for when it's supposed to come out, but it would definitely make this chapter feel less "lectury" and make Bill more of a character, so maybe I should do it after all. I'll see if I can rework the later chapter, and if so, edit this one.

Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad you enjoyed the chapter despite its flaws :)
