Looking forward to this! Still not sure what to think about this chapter. I agree that it felt somewhat out of place, but that won't be clear until we know more about where the story is going.

I'm not super excited to see the story focus on Big Important Problems that aren't specific to the Pokemon world in particular. This story stands out because of the world building and because it adds a new perspective on a rich and interesting source material -- I'm not sure how novel a perspective you'll be able to provide if the story turns to an investigation of Artificial Intelligence.

This is the sort of chapter that /has/ to change things in the story, if we're meant to take the protagonists seriously. In a way it's good that they are being made to confront these issues (though I'm not sure how affected Blue will be) but a lot depends on what happens next. The world keeps expanding, and I keep getting excited about seeing Red and co. enter the game, but before they get a chance to take a tenth of a level in badass the world expands again.

Like, since the start of the story we've been introduced to the natural-disaster scale threats of the Legendaries, the existential-risk of Mewtwo, the machinations of Giovanni (which, btw, Daystar may have [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/55cxnj/rt_pokemon_the_origin_of_species_chapter_36_the/d89wkj6][off-handedly narrowed-down a bit]]), and the world-to-universe scale problems of Artificial Intelligence. And yet, Red at least is still a total beginner, in terms of what he's accomplished and how much he's had to grow. His clever plan for catching Abra is exactly the sort of thing he might have thought up a couple of chapters into the fic, and yet it's a multi-chapter saga for him to execute it hundreds of thousands of words later.

This is a riff on the sort of complaint I've made in the past, and it's pretty unfair for me to bring it up again here since not much time has passed in-story since I last mentioned it. In fact, some of the things that happened in this chapter seem like clear steps in the right direction. Red's moment of surprise as he is told his ambition is too small felt almost like a third-wall-breaking wink at those of us who want him to hurry up and become like 3 times as awesome.

So why isn't this chapter exactly what I want? Well, for one, there's my comment earlier about how none of these issues are new, interesting things that follow specifically from the Pokemon world. Dealing with AGI-risk largely metaphorically by way of Mewtwo was a wonderful idea, but when it becomes explicit then we might as well be reading Vinge or Bostrom. There's also the hint of dissatisfaction stemming from the fact that Red didn't get to discover any of this on his own, and was instead just introduced to these issues totally by chance.

Then, and this seems to be a common refrain here, it's just too much. It doesn't look like Red will leave this conversation with a burning desire to become stronger and join the fray. He's been introduced to /too many/ first priorities. On the one hand it would be beyond embarrassing for him not to change his plans at all, but what is he going to do? Buy an Intro to CS textbook? In another context the Pokeball-cryonics idea could be a perfect hook, but I don't see the path forward from a dramatic perspective (though naturally one may exist). I hope he at least interns with Bill or something, or gives up on academia as a waste of his valuable time.

I can't help but expect that the story will continue largely as it has, in which case Red fails at Taking Ideas Seriously and from and out-of-story perspective why include the chapter at all? But if he does shift paths completely, I'll feel sort of mislead as a reader, or at least as if my time was wasted by watching all of his flailing thus far. Ideally there'd be some synthesis of his original (and eponymous) ambition and what he's encountered here, but I don't see it.

Despite loving this story, I'm feeling somewhat fatalistic as I write this comment. With the pacing and the update rate and the several plot domains and the three POV characters I don't know how Daystar will manage to leverage this chapter in a way that benefits the story overall.

I kind of want a meteor to hit or something, and then to see what Red looks like a year from now as he carries out sophisticated investigations on dozens of Abra and fiddles with Pokeball technology and never sleeps /because people are dying/ and pushes his psychic abilities as far as they can be pushed and keeps going because his boring human-level brain won't be sufficient for saving the world.

Or something similarly awesome. With nothing forcing him to be reactive, his continued failure to bootstrap himself into a position of leverage and agency remains frustrating (though, again, recent developments suggest improvements here). I kind of feel like I should stop expecting that, judging by his growth so far, but what is he even doing with his time? I know he's fictional and like 11, but I feel like /even I'm/ getting more done and learning faster than he is.

I do expect to continue enjoying the story though, and hope Daystar doesn't get too discouraged. This story is great and has been a source of much enjoyment and plenty of interesting and useful thought.

P.S. Red totally has a crush on Leaf and it's adorable. Look how defensive and annoyingly protective he gets when Bill is rude to her!
