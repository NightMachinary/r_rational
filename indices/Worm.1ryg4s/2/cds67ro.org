Oookay. . . I'll ask a question I led up to in my criticism of Inviolate over in [[/r/HPMOR]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rhn6d/recommendation_inviolate_a_deconstructionist_dc/][here]]

Is Worm rational fic? Specifically does the rising level of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold][Godzilla threshold]] *Warning: TvTropes* detract from plausibility, such that the decision making examples are no longer useful? Does the semi-constant idiot ball holding by the protectorate add or detract from it as rational story?

/disclaimer/ I am a huge fan of worm.
