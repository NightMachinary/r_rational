The decisions in Worm are usually being made under extreme duress or time pressures, an are mostly about quick thinking, decisive action, making use of opprotunities and clever improvisation. Later on there was a bigger emphasis on information gathering too, so I think it counts.

The Godzilla threshold is inevitable in the Wormverse and quite welcome.

As for the Protectorate and PRT... We only ever see two directors for any significant length of time, and there is evidence of internal sabotage, etc. so maybe they deserve a pass.
