Ironically the decisions that were made under extreme pressures were so much better than what Skitter did in her leisure time. That stuff infuriated me to no end. Because of that Worm did not seem a rational fic to me from the very start, and it kind of disappointed me (since it was advertised in [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]])
