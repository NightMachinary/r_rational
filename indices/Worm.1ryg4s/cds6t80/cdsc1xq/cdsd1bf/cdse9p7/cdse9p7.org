Right. I think an important thing for "idiocy justified by characterization" is that the "broken" utility-function a character ostensibly has, has to be one that readers can still /identify/ with; one they could imagine themselves having, or a friend having, without having long-ago been called out on their bullshit, or just having failed to thrive as a human being.

It's *easy* to imagine someone with a roughly human /set/ of values, but different weights on those values. A much heavier weight on, say, "enjoy rich food", might be a character's undoing, when they end up dying of a heart attack at a pivotal moment.

It's *hard*, meanwhile, to imagine a paperclip-optimizer.

/Smart/ paperclippers (ones who out-think every heroic act on their mission to produce paperclips) might be entertaining (and horrifying! I'd go so far as to say that the entire genre of horror exists to explore the interactions between humans and smart other-optimizers, with "murderous sociopath" being the default instantiation of the latter), but /stupid/ paperclippers are just grating. And comic-book villains are definitely stupid paperclippers.
