  ...no one really holds the idiot ball. There are still characters that act like idiots...

To put it another way: idiocy isn't in conflict with rationality when it's justified by /characterization/, rather than by /plot./ The entertaining kind of idiocy is usually what English majors call a "tragic flaw": some aspect of the character's personality (their utility function, really) that you can tell in advance will have that character make the "wrong" decision at a crucial time.
