I disagree with you, my earlier devil advocating against worm aside, on how we you are defining rationalist fiction.

The big 5 [[/u/seraphnb]] has listed are filled by Worm. You are disqualifying Worm because the [[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/evangelical][evangelical]] </definition 2/> author rants on rational principles aren't there; i.e. :
