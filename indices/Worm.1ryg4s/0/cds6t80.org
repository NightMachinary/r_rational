I wouldn't really describe Worm as a rationalist fic. It doesn't really espouse rationalist ideals.

Although rationalism is not a huge part of the storyl, no one really holds the idiot ball. There are still characters that act like idiots, but its portrayed believably and doesn't seem unrealistic.

Even if it is not necessary rationalist, its still an amazing story. I would encourage everyone to read it, it is so good.
