Friendly->best friends or friendly->acting in humanity's interest?

Lets assume we are talking about an unintelligent, war vet with a missing limbs ptsd and a history of child abuse bad enough they will not be high functioning anyway.

While yes a gai could in theory solve each and every one of those problems one after the other. Or it could control the robotic arm it would need to build and control it directly in a factory using non-medical steel, dropping the cost of the therapy and giving the cybernetic implants to someone else.

The factory would likely be able to produce more than one staffed with androids, the therapy could likely be more cost efficient if they took years rather than rushing things to get this guy up and running /now/ and the cybernetic implants lets assume its a straight 1 iq bonus for everyone, it would do better on someone already above average.

If the gai isn't god out of the gate, it would likely be best to keep this guy "on ice", give him new vices that will kill him slower than whatever he's taking and therapy to just keep him barely not suicidal; until everything else is far further ahead; getting space settlements going, all the factories so far beyond up to speed that its effectively post-scarcity for most things, immortality is figured out, etc. Then and only then do you go back and clean up the truly helpless.
