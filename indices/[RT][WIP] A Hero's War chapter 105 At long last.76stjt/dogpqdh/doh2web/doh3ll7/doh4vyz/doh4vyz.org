Why would you max the min? Its minamax not maxamin; jacks of all trades was humanity's stone age, specialization is the foundation of wealth.

80/20 laws are harsh and everywhere. You try to isolate the 20% cause of the 80% effect and squeeze it for all its worth, not the other way around.

Unless full employment is the end goal I don't see the propose of finding the the bottom <1% that checks off every bad trait and bring them up. Getting an extra 1,000 dollars worth of resources to tesla/einstein/etc. is likely to do more good towards any goal.

While you would eventually hit diminishing returns; you asolutely drop some % of the population out of the workforce as more trouble than they are worth.
