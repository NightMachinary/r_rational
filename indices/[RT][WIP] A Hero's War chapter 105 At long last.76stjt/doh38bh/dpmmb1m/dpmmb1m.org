If you think about it, the 'employer' is essentially taking advantage of children in a tight spot to get low paid child labour in unskilled positions. Welfare is pretty much just random charity from Aesin (chancellor's wife) meant for propaganda purposes than effectiveness.

Although I do agree that the recruiter could probably squeeze them for a bit more or he could be just cheating them in some way... but that would add to the word count of a chapter that my muse didn't want to write. So... yeah.
