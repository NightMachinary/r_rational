That was a new word for me, and a useful one. I looked it up at

[[http://www.pgrim.org/philosophersannual/pa28articles/gendleraliefbelief.pdf]]

And would define it as "a mental state where one's intellectual/intentional belief in a fact differs from one's default emotional/subconscious behavior."

I believe the statistics and math that say that approximately 60 million people die each year, or about one man and one woman every second. That's some literature and simple math, and obviously I would agree that's a bad thing.

But I /"alieve"/ that the death of my father would be a terrible, tragic loss, my throat gets tight just thinking about it.

I feel more motivated to take actions that will lead eventually to the extinction of death by considering my own father's death than considering that hundreds of people lost their fathers while I read that article and posted this comment.
