Seriously, there must be something cool that could be done by someone /otherwise normal/ in a loop too.

Sakura ends up avoiding a loop reset when her body is atomised because that can't impair her combat abilities.

Normals are probably limited to Coil type tricks (from Worm). We could brute-force Dinah or /maybe/ Contessa, but I'd guess some sanity damage would ensue from the time that would take.
