Waaaaiiiit... that's a /bloody great/ idea.

If you had enough space in your mind to hold other minds, you would be able to carry other people with you /through the loop-reset/, thus actually alleviating the whole "oh fuck I can't do anything and I'm so alone" problem.

Note: this is the only scenario in which I endorse creating self-improving AI willy-nilly, as a time-loop reset will inevitably destroy anything that's not you.
