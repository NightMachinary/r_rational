If it's like Groundhog Day, you're limited to gaining more information or more skills. You can run experiments as much as you want, but you're limited to whatever you can do in however much time you have available (usually a day?). The skills won't really help you unless you anticipate getting out of the loop at some point, and the information you could gain would probably be negligible.

Depending on what year it is, you might be able to contact someone at a national laboratory and get them to run experiments that they can set up in a day, if you have lots of loops to figure out how to short-circuit their disbelief and get them to help you. I have no idea what you'd hope to gain by those experiments besides more knowledge, especially since you wouldn't have any hope of building something like a large hadron collider or something.

I guess if it were me, after I had exhausted all of the obvious fun things I would set to work improving my memory so that I could take more and more raw information with me in every loop. But if you can't get out of the loop, there doesn't seem to be a point, right?
