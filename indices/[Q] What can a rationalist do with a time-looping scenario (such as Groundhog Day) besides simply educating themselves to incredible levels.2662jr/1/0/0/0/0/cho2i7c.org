Ah, so you're arguing that from a utility standpoint there's a purpose because you can make people happy and reduce suffering, even though there's no record of it the next day except what you remember. I guess I can buy that in the abstract, but I really think the psychological toll of "doing the most good" and then waking up to having everything reset would just be too large for me.

I sort of took for granted that other people in this scenario are essentially not a factor in my motivations, which I guess might say something about me or my philosophical outlook. I'm sort of tempted to say that a day that I'll remember is worth much, much more than a day that someone else won't remember, but I'm not sure that position is tenable. I'd have to think about it more.
