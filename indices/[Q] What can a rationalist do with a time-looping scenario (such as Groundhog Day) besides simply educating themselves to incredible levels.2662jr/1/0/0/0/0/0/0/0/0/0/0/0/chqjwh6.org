  So you're saying we shouldn't care about the universe outside Hubble Volume?

Nah, I'm saying that we should only treat things we can causally interact with as actually real. So if FTL gets invented, Bostrom's paper becomes quite relevant. OTOH, if we remain strictly limited to our Hubble Volume, then whatever.

Besides which, "my life up to now" is always finite, so we're really talking about countable infinities, so we can always deal finitely with the finite amount of stuff we've /yet/ come into causal contact with.
