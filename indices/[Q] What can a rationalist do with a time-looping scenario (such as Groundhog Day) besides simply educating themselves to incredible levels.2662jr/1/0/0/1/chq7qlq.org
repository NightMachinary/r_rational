  I'm not making a general case against immortality (which I think would be great) but being trapped for thousands of subjective years in a single small town where I can literally make no change that lasts longer than a day sounds utterly terrible. Eventually there would be no challenges left to your half-life and no pleasures that haven't turned to ash in your mouth.
