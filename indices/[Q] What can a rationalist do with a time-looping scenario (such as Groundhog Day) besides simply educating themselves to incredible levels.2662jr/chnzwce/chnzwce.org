Sounds like it's time to start experimenting.

I'd start by inserting a small harmless object, say a coin, into my ear. I'd also give myself a small cut. If, like in Groundhog day, all exterior damage is repaired, then it would allow me to experiment further. Where is the boundary for what gets carried over? The state of my neural net is a physical state, so there must be a physical boundary between what is brought over and what is not. I should be able to find it and use it.

If I can bring over objects by performing minor surgery on my person, then small computers could allow me to perform an Oracle test, for starters.

EDITs for clarity.
