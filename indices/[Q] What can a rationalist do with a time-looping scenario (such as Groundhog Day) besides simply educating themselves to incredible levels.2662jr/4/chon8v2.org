In this scenario, do you have the ability to end the loop, or foreknowledge of when it will end?

If not, you could postulate that the loop would continue forever. The only thing you'd presumably be able to affect would be the contents of your mind/memory, meaning that eventually you're going to hit a stable loop and just start repeating a sequence of days. (The most likely scenario being that you descend into brain death and spend eternity as a drooling husk.)
