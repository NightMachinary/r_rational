The first thing I'd do is figure out exactly how brains work, however many loops that takes. Then, I'd start optimizing.

First, I'd figure out some way to speed up my brain. Then, I'd find some way to create a body (or VR program) that can respond and move at a similar speed, and transplant my brain into it. Then, I'd keep repeating this process until the rate at which my brain time is multiplying exceeds the rate at which I am running out of time. This may take more than one loop.

Then, I'd start operating the same procedure on everyone else. Thus, I have created infinite brain time for everyone in a finite time, and the Singularity.

In the event that I reach a point where my brain will no longer speed up, I hope to be at a point where I can encode the memories of as many people as possible into the strings of my brain, then carry them and replace them next loop. This problem shouldn't be that bad, since there will probably be several thousand/billion subjective years between resets.
