On the one hand, I would say it's a complete reset. Whatever you had when you woke up the first time is what you have the next infinite times.

However, we are adding the carrying of memories, emotional state, and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory#Muscle_memory_encoding][muscle memories]]. All of these are unfortunately in the brain. I was hoping muscle memory was encoded in the muscles, but according to a quick Wikipedia search, there is evidence that it may not be.

So to carry something over, I would think it would need to be a state change of certain parts of the brain. Thus, my reckoning, would be that when the reset happens, the brain cells reorganize into the new pattern. If we go with that, then foreign objects would not be able to be passed to the next cycle (where would the excess silicon come from [no jokes]).

In my conclusion, I'd think that you'd have to find a way to scan the cells in your brain to determine their state, and have that be an encoding that can be 'uploaded' to a computer via scanning, and opened via .zip... then you can do your work, compress it at the end of the day, and 'download' it into your brain cells again. Though, I personally don't know if we have a way of purposefully rearranging portions of brain cells without causing more damage. Likewise, the storage space will still be limited (let's not compare brain masses), without interfering with other necessary portions of the brain.

However, if any of my assumptions are wrong, and there's a field with an 'inside' and 'outside' and everything in the inside gets replaced by the insides of the next cycle, then yeah, we can probably smuggle some things in~

*tl;dr* I imagine that the new cycle state starts from the base from the first morning, then reorganizes pieces of particular cells of the brain to get the effect, rather than porting in any material that didn't exist in that space beforehand.
