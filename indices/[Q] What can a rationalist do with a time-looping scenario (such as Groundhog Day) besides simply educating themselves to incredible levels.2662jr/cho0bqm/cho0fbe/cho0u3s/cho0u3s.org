I think there'd be less of a point to living if you could never make an impact on the world, and if you only had a day to get to know any person. Eventually you'd have read every book within your reach, and it's not like you'd be able to make art that wasn't extremely temporary (and not any art that takes longer than a day to make and enjoy). In /Groundhog Day/ he's effectively trapped inside a town of 7,000, and I have to believe that eventually the completely unchanging nature of the town would grow dull.

I'm not making a general case against immortality (which I think would be great) but being trapped for thousands of subjective years in a single small town where I can literally make no change that lasts longer than a day sounds utterly terrible. Eventually there would be no challenges left to your half-life and no pleasures that haven't turned to ash in your mouth.
