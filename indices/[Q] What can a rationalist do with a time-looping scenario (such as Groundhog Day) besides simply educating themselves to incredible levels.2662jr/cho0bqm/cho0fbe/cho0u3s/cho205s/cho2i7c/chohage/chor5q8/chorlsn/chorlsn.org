Okay so what are the implications of this? Should I care about a saved snapshot of a mind being tortured? 100 sequential snapshots? Theoretical ideas of tortured minds?

Wouldn't these snapshots just be numbers, if store digitally? Should I be worried about the existence of numbers that could be interpreted as a mind in pain? Couldn't I decide arbitrary rules for interpreting a number so that any number could in theory map to a mind in pain?

Where does the madness go? I really feel like I need to read more literature about this, but I don't know if anyone's written about it.
