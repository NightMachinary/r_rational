I don't know what the implications are, I'm confused even by normal ethics. Maybe you should care about them if you really care about them, e.g. if thinking about those tortured snapshots activates any of the morality nodes in your brain?

  Should I be worried about the existence of numbers that could be interpreted as a mind in pain?

Meh. What's the point?

#+begin_quote
  Couldn't I decide arbitrary rules for interpreting a number so that any number could in theory map to a mind in pain?
#+end_quote

No, I don't think you could do that. For the same reason that a random sequence of 0's and 1's doesn't automatically become a workable computer program. I think "mind in pain" has some objective criteria that needs to be satisfied in order for it to become a real mind in pain in any meaningful sense.

  I really feel like I need to read more literature about this, but I don't know if anyone's written about it.

It's not about this specific scenario, but Nick Bostrom's [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/infinite.pdf]['Infinite Ethics']] might have some relevance to this.
