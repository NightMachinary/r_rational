  My intuition is definitely very strongly that in a Groundhog Day scenario everyone else has no appreciable utility value whatsoever.

So imagine doing every /barely/ interesting non-violent thing for many many times, so many times that every such thing has lost every tiny shred of their flavor. The number of barely interesting things could be HUGE, as would the number of times you find /any/ utility in doing those things. But you will still grow utterly bored of doing those things. Would you start torturing people in the search of novelty? Would a person with the average psychological make-up? Is it inevitable? (I hope no one ever tests this by simulating the scenario.)

Of course this too would just postpone the inevitable, as those things would become boring too. I wonder what would happen after the number of days approaches infinity. My best bet is that there would probably be some sort of "equilibrium point" in how people would choose to live their days, that would be roughly the same day after day.

I think [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/12/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens/12-transequinism][“Friendship is Optimal: Caelum est Conterrens”]] has a good bit on this:

  There were several types of immortals defined. The simplest was the Loop Immortal, a consciousness that endlessly repeated a finite set of general behaviors, in a (potentially, not necessarily) infinite number of increasingly subtle variations. Most ponies in the system were loop immortals, their possibilities defined by the finite possibilities of virtual lives that in some way approximated the Equestria of Friendship Is Magic. Her original self, before the alteration that began a steady climb in curiosity and intelligence had been - and was - a loop immortal.

But would a typical day contain violent or non-violent things? Would it be similar to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypy_(non-human)][stereotypical behavior]], "repetitive behaviors in captive animals, particularly those given inadequate mental stimulation" -- "Stereotypical behaviors are thought to be caused ultimately by artificial environments that do not allow animals to satisfy their normal behavioral needs. "

  Could I just be a series of snapshots stored in memory? Could I be just a single snapshot? Could I even just be a theoretically possible arrangement of molecules?

Yes you could.

Although I don't think this particular case is very probable.
