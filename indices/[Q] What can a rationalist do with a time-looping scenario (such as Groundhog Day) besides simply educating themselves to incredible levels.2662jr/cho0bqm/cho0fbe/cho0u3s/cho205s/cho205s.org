I had interpreted your post as saying that there would be no point because all records of your actions would disappear. In response, I thought you would still be impacting the world, by making people experience happiness. It's just that the record of you having done so would be lost sooner.

I then thought that if records of action affect whether or not there is a point to it all, loop world wins out in the (very) long term because there will always be a record of your actions (you).

I hadn't thought you meant there would be no point due to boredom.
