Agreed. However, Dylan died before Erica, suggesting that he should have SKABMOM'ed into her. While it is unclear how much transfers, it is within possibility that whatever Erica got of Dylan would have been passed along with her to Ana.

Nonetheless, the question was about post-death SKABMOM, and that is all but unquestionable.
