Oh, was it confirmed? I've been looking out for confirmation ever since Sohu originally hinted at it, but never noticed anything definitive. If I missed it, I'd like to go back and look. I definitely /want/ it to be canon, because their friendship has been the main emotional hook of the story for me, and it would be nice if they were able to keep in touch for all that time.
