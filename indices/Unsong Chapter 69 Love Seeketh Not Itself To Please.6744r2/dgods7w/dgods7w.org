  “Sohu showed you the library? Go get me all the books you can find on Elisha ben Abuyah. It's time to learn everything we can about the Other King.”

+This ending doesn't seem to make any sense. If they truly knew TOK's identity, and had books on him, as one of the most important foes they faced, surely they'd have researched him already? And well before the current crisis. More importantly, if they think Thamiel and his demons will be upon them imminently, let along TOK, then that leaves absolutely no time for research.+

+The most reasonable explanation thus seems to get Aaron out of the way and keep him busy? Can't see why they'd really care though+

I misremembered, as [[/u/Fredlage]] says they figured out TOK's identity very recently in story, in chapter 50, so this in fact makes perfect sense.
