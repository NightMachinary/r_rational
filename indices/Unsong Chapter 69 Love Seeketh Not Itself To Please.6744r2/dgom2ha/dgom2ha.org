For your convenience, here are the lyrics to HaMephorash, as written by the fictional Leonard Cohen. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/Stuff/HaMephorash.mp3][Link to the song performed by the Bayesian Choir.]]

 

Now I've heard there was a sacred word

That Jala said, and it named the Lord

But you don't really know of magic, or us

It goes like this - a tav, a resh

A fearsome joy, a fervent wish

The Comet King incanting haMephorash

 

HaMephorash x4

 

Your faith was strong but you needed proof

Hay hay yud tav mem tav vav kuf

A ship on which another sailed before us

She saw his flag on the highest mast

She saw a dream that couldn't last

The Comet King receiving haMephorash

 

HaMephorash x4

 

You say I took the Name in vain

And after that I lost the Name

I gave it back to Him who holds it for us

But echoes sound in every word

It doesn't matter what occurred

You never really lose the HaMephorash

 

HaMephorash x4

 

Somebody had to, no one would

I tried to do the best I could

And now it's done, and now they can't ignore us

And even though it all went wrong

I'll stand against the whole unsong

With nothing on my tongue but HaMephorash

 

HaMephorash x4
