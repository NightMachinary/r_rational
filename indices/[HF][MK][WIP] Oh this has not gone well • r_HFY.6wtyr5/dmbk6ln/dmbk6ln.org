I am a subscriber (and occasional writer) on [[/r/HFY]]

Not sure it's exactly rational per say, more that it aims to put humans in the best light possible. Think of it as a counter to all the death, destruction, and general misery in the real world. As [[/u/NotACauldronAgent]] said, it's usually done through the antagonist +being an idiot+ missing some key feature.

Treat the stories as normal stories, without expecting them to be rational. And don't be surprised that some themes/tropes become very very common (and somewhat repetitive).
