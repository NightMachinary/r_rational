spoilers until about chapter 13 though nothing major :

I'm pretty sure it's not just about the proportions. How comfortable are you with entering long term relationships with a 16 yo? Also the waitress /knew/ it was just something casual and accepted it, you could even say she even wanted it that way so their interests aligned. If he got in a relationship with Sila he would've basically had to marry her or be even more of an asshole and dump her after he had his fun.

Long term relationships between elves and humans might not be a good idea at all, they can't have children and one lives 3 times more than the other so I don't see any reason to not respect him. Hell you could say he showed exceptional restrain to not sleep with her when she threw herself at him
