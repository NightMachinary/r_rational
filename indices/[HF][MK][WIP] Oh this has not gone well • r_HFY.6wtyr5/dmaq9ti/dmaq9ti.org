So I stumbled over this story on [[/r/HFY]] (highly recommend the subreddit itself), and I've only read the first chapter so far. But it seems to fit this subreddit very well.

It's about the standard trope of a protagonist being thrown into a fantasy word, but with a focus on him applying his modern scientific knowledge to the magic. The magic system isn't like a programming language or anything so recognizably modern. It's more like him learning DnD-like spells and munchkining the hell out of them.

Also, it works really well in a reddit format with the commentary that's just as interesting as the story itself.
