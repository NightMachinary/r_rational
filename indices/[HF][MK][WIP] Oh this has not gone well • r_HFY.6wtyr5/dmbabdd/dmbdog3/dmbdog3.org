Not remotely rational. Additionally, I tried reading all the top upvoted posts and found them all pretty average. Rather disappointing as I feel it's the kind of thing I would really enjoy. I remember feeling some pretty strong frisson when reading about Larry Niven's human-kzin wars or the yeerk's opinion on humans in Animorphs, for example.
