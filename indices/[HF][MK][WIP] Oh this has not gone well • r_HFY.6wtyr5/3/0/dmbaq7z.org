Ah, not really? It's nice and all, and the categories HFY and Rational are definitely not mutually exclusive, but most HFYs in my experience tend to be "humans are awesome because I've made the antagonists missing something" or just generic "humans win." Not to say there aren't good ones, I've enjoyed some, but despite often being pro- things much of the rationalist community are for, like space travel, fusion power, or transhumanism, most are merely science fiction.
