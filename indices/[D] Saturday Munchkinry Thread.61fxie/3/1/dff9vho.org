Hmmm. So, if I touch a tree, I can make the branches bend over and grab someone?

And if I touch a part of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_%28tree%29][the Pando tree]] do I gain control over the entire forest (apparently a single organism)?

...I can certainly climb walls like Spider-man (since nothing but me can break my point of contact).

But if I can bend things that aren't supposed to be bent - if I shake someone's hand, can I twist their bones into uncomfortable shapes? Or suddenly override their mouth and have them say what I want them to say (as long as I maintain contact)?
