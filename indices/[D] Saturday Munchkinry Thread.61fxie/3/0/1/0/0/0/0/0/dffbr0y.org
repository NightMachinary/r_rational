Hmmm. That depends on the specifics of the control.

If I can shape anything into any shape I can imagine without restriction, then I can make (and sell) artworks (such as sculptures) very rapidly. I could become a firefighter (just touching the edge of the stream of water coming from the hose will let me direct it very accurately, even around corners) or some sort of mechanic (I touch the car and the dents vanish). Or a performer, or stage magician - I can do all /sorts/ of unexpected things with a piece of rope. Or a long piece of string, touching my upper arm and usually concealed under my sleeve.

...I'm not sure. It's hard to find a job that this skill doesn't help with.
