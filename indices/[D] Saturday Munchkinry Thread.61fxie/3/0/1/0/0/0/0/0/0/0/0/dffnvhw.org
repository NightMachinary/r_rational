I would disagree - code is just a particular pattern of electrons (mass) in memory. So I guess it depends on how fine your control is, and whether components of a thing count as the 'thing' itself for purposes of this power. But even if I can't write multiple programs, I could alter specific locations in memory of an ATM (assuming my control is precise enough) to change my requested withdrawl from $10 to $10000, for instance.
