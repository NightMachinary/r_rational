Serious response, you control whatever you're touching so long as it's part of what you're touching and not just attached to it.

The only major restrictions are flight and controlling liquids (or anything else) beyond the point that they would collapse on themselves. Air would be even worse. Loose soil probably isn't the best. But if you can munchkin it then all the power to you my friend.
