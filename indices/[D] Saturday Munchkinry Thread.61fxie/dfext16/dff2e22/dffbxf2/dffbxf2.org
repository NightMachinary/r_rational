Collapsing the branch timeline would not save the memories of the branch you, which leads to the inherent risk that if you create a branch timeline, even if you can decipher its messages, the you there may decide they don't want to die, making future communication blurry.

The main way I see around that is convincing yourself that you don't get enough time to diverge meaningfully from the original, and thus collapsing your timeline isn't a 'death' even as it is a 'duty'. That would allow you to do quick information-gathering splits without winding up with branch timelines you can't do anything about.
