  Collapsing the branch timeline would not save the memories of the branch you, which leads to the inherent risk that if you create a branch timeline, even if you can decipher its messages, the you there may decide they don't want to die, making future communication blurry.

That seems like a bit of an understatement, I'd go further to say if you aren't suicidal there's zero chance of any branch you's collapsing their timeline.\\
The whole "if there's a copy close enough to the original in existence then it's not death" would only work if you (and thus the copy) was gullible enough to believe that. Since memories don't transfer it's blatantly obvious that your subjective experience ends when you destroy the timeline, and there's no distinct causal connection between forks when someone dies so whatever neural processes were generating /your/ experiences are just gone. Still even if you actually thought about it you might still be able to get things to work if you care more about whether some iteration of you fulfills your goals and didn't care about how that affects your personal anticipated future experience.\\
Another issue with caring about other iterations of yourself as much as your own life, is that if there's a multiverse then there's infinite versions of your, so that logic dictates death means nothing. Plus it raises the question of why you should care more about these particular copies of you than all the others.

Given available information it seems like honestly the best ways of using this are to create a small enough number of branches as to still be able to clearly pick out communication over noise, then have different iterations do different things. For instance once you diverge some versions of you are going to stumble upon interesting things which they will know the others will find entertaining or useful. You may split up studying somewhat and then transmit certain condensed versions of the info that will let you learn it faster than otherwise.\\
Still the clunky communication method is a serious limitation, so you would probably want to figure out some method of training that will let you more easily switch emotions, and induce stronger emotions at will (because that means you can tolerate more noise, thus you can make more branches).

Oh wait, holy shit I can't believe I totally missed the implications of this power.. jesus christ you can do so much more.

Ok so first find some groups that give out prizes for demonstrations of supernatural abilities, then prove your abilities and become extremely rich and famous from being the only known person with powers.\\
A demonstration that comes to mind is having the versions of the testers in both world use encryption methods (that could never be broken without computer assistance) to send messages back and forth through you, and further they could probably use that to send information that only the testers could know so they know you haven't just figured out some amazing codebreaking trick.\\
Once you do that then your abilities can actually be massively useful on a global scale, because they'd be so useful you can probably get some agency to make some kind of transcranial stimulation device in order to massively improve transmission.

Ok so here's some things you could help the world with:

- Policy experiments, both iterations of a government agree to try two or more different policies (or they do it by chance due to divergences between timelines) then they can compare the results and there will be no serious dispute over the results.
- Research, different timelines take turns conducting research, and share the results. This means all the timelines can get the effects of spending much more on research than any individual timeline does.\\
- Prediction, due to random butterfly effect divergences different timeline will have different events occur, or happen at differing times. So if one timeline has a terrorist attack, architectural failure, etc then other timelines can potentially learn from that and act on it without having to experience a disaster themselves.\\
- Existential risk aversion, different timelines would agree to slightly stagger certain decisions (or things would happen at different time just due to divergence) so if one timeline has a nuclear war others can potentially avert it. Same thing goes for bioweapons and all risks except GAI. With GAI the risk is no less because if the GAI figures out the existence of this communication (which it certainly would if it got any info about the world) then it can almost certainly hijak my mind and use that to get all other timelines to create it.\\
- Processing splitting, pretty similar to splitting research across timelines but different timelines split up computational work. This may not be of much use pre singularity, but it would be of massive use to a GAI friendly or not so it would probably alter your mind so the information bandwidth is increased arbitrarily. Then GAI can split up processing between a massive number of iterations of it.\\
- Violate thermodynamics, it seems like with the right maxwell's demon style setup (using timelines that just split so they're similar enough for this to work, or it figures out how to transmit info on quantum states uncollapsed through the communication) you could get many timelines create many version of these type of setups. Then you can get the results (which let you extract energy) of many systems, while only spending the energy to get information about one particular system, thus violating the landauer limit.
