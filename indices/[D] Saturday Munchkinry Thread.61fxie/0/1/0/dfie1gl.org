Mending ice is a new idea, thanks!

There are so many other ways to generate arbitrary amounts of power in Pathfinder/D&D. For example, the Light spell makes an object "shine like a torch." That's just flat energy with no need to be sneaky.

Now that you bring it up, I wonder how much thermal energy Light generates? It makes things shine like a torch, but do they shine in the infrared like a torch?
