That's a good idea! I already have a spyglass in my inventory, so I can disassemble that to do optics experiments.

I order to make the laser, I would need some way to make the light cohere. That would require sophisticated mirrors, I think. I could still focus the light to make a death ray (like the Mithbusters did.)

Going off of the feathers and needing 19 close packed torches, I could get a bit of loose-weave cloth and Light every thread as it's own torch. That way I could easily pack a bunch of torches in a small area for a higher powered torch.
