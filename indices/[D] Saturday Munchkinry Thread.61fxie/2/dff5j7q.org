You are a maximally convincing writer. If you attempt to write a persuasive piece, what you'll end up writing are the words which would be most convincing to the most people who read English were each English reader presented with the words. This power doesn't allow you to persuade every person of everything, it just gives you the best shot, while not being tailored to any individual. It's also a bit hazardous: If you write an essay intending to convince someone else of something you don't actually believe, you might end up convincing yourself of that very something!
