Tactile Telekinesis: Anything you touch you can sense and control like an extension of your own body.

Rules:

Nothing can separate you from your point of contact except you.

You are treated as a whole object by the laws of physics, in regards to centre of gravity.

Objects under your control cannot exceed their own structural strength

Limits:

Solids; any amount or distance of the same material so long as it is considered a whole object. No mixed media here.

Liquids; I was going to say equivalent mass only, but not exceeding structural strength is a pretty big limit already so go nuts, the ocean is yours if you want it.
