Keyboard repeat rates can't go much faster than the fastest typist. So I guess perhaps he could type faster, with practice, but I don't see it a being significantly faster than he could type by learning typing.

I guess he could use his power to pilot a giant robot /without/ needing to write a control system, but that's more a case of bypassing the programming than helping with the programming...
