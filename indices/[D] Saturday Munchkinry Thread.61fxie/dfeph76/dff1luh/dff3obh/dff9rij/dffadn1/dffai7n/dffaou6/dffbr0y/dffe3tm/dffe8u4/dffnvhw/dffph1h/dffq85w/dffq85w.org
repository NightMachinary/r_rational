Yeah, that's a fair point. But it's kind of academic, since if hacking an ATM using this power was the goal, then I could just move the innards to give me money, rather than reprogramming.

BUT I think there's still room to munchkin programming. Touch the keyboard, and then use your power to actuate the keys instead of typing, so you're programming 10x faster?
