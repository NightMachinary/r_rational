You have the ability to split the timeline in two, where at the moment of the divergence one timeline is considered prime and the other branching, and each version of you knows which is which. The you in the prime timeline can create more branch timelines, and the you in the branch timeline can collapse the branch timeline. This means there is one prime timeline and an arbitrary number of branch timelines, and none of you can know for certain how many branch timelines exist. The prime you is not notified when a branch you collapses their timeline, and a branch you is not notified when a new branch is made.

This lack of easy communication is because the only information that can be transferred between timelines is /emotional states/. Any you in either type of timeline can sense the collective emotional state of every you (yourself included), and each you contributes to the collective. The more intense an emotion, the greater an effect it has on the collective, so a sharp spike of fear in one you might make the collective emotional state feel like fear even if there are ten you's contributing.

From a starting position of prime you and no branches, how do you most efficiently utilize your ability to gain knowledge and power in the prime timeline? Keep in mind that the you's in branch timelines may be hesitant to collapse their timeline, and you have no way to force them to.
