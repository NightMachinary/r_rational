Wait does collapsing a branch timeline just merge their consciousness back with the prime (presumably carrying back memories) or what? I mean if not then I can't imagine anyone who's not suicidal would ever have any branch collapses.

Anyway if collapsing branches brings memories back to the prime then things are a hell of a lot easier, but if not then you will have to limit the number of branches to have any hope of communicating effectively over the background noise.\\
The best communication technique would be to just use series of emotion states as a particular code to send information, with messages being prefaced with the code of that branch (and nobody communicating while someone else is sending a message) the message would be repeated until the prime gave the understood signal.\\
You would all collect a bunch of videos, pictures or even just thoughts that could easily be used to elicit particular emotional. Then you would deliberately evoke particular emotions in certain orders (if you're really good at quickly switching emotions then you could even encode meaning into the timing) to send something like really slow morse code (it would have more bits, but it would also take a while to send anything).

If collapsing branch timelines means oblivion for those branch forks then you have to work out the communication system before you create any splits and your actions will be far more limited.

If you can just collapse your branch without killing yourself then you can do all kinds of risky things in order to obtain information, then just collapse the timeline escaping any consequences and merging back with the prime. If not then you're limited by the fact that none of the branches will want to do anything too unpleasant or dangerous.
