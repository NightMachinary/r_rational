Yeah once I stopped using the cached thoughts I would use for most CYOA's, I realized this is nearly exactly the same as a setting I made wherein you could open up portals to parallel worlds that would be exactly identical until they started diverging soon after opening the portal, except this is communication only and has a very crappy communication system.

Still the things I had thought of in that setting, like splitting research costs work the same (though other things like having different worlds produce different TV shows and either airing both of them or having both timeline's air the one with better ratings doesn't work with this crude of transmission).

Anyway you should expect tech to advance quicker with this power, and for the world to be better in a number of ways as a result of the things I mentioned in my answer.
