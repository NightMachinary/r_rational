Create branch timelines, try to seek out pleasure and happy experiences as much as possible while attempting to avoid pain and suffering.

I'm not suicidal, though I might be if I was suffering enough pain. Pleasure seeking can be shared across timelines, so I can increase the happiness of all timelines by just trying to plug in as much pleasure to the overall mental state as possible.

I'd also try and create as many branch timelines as possible. I prefer existence to non-existence, so its reasonable to assume that all the potential mes will also have the same preference.

If I was smarter and thought there was something I could figure out by sending only a few yes/no signals a night in the form of pain/pleasure signals than maybe I'd do that, but nothing comes to mind.
