I wonder how this would interact with specialized domains. If one uses this power to write attempt for the statement "P!=NP" does it start with a maximally readable primer on computational complexity and the problem, or does it only attempt to convince people who understand the thesis?

I imagine it would only be useful for simple domain problems in the former case because it would be easier to trick new learners with a flawed proof. However, in the former case you can use it as a way to generate maximally educational learning material.
