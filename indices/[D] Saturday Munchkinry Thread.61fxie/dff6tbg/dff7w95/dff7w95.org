I'm thinking use 'mending' to smooth out glass or crystal to make high quailty lenses, or make them and remove the imperfections.

Then get your torch spells and make a laser. Average torch is 80 watts? Industrial cutting lasers are 1500 watts, that's just under 19 uses of the light spell.

My first though was feathers for a small and lightweight light source but you could use the spell on the crystals/lenses themselves. See how many you can get in a row.
