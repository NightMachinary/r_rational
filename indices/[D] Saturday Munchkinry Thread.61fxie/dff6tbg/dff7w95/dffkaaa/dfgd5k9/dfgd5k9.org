I'm glad you like it.

Another thing to look into is if mending can be used to unseal something that has forcibly been broken/jammed shut. Especially if you can create water inside sealed objects.

The idea of using 'mending' to trigger a pressurised trap tickles me.

Then there's security applications; internal mechanisms in doors with a small component designed to 'break' every time the door is closed.

Or possibility for automation; If you break a piece of string holding a hinge open, would 'mending' the string force the hinge open again?

If you had string on both sides, would mending the string on one side forcibly break the other to allow the mending?

If so a magically toggled switch would have a tonne of useful applications.
