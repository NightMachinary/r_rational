I'm playing a level one Druid (of the natural laws) in Pathfinder. This is my first campaign, so I'm not too familiar wth the magic limits and science lore. I want to test out the limits of my level zero spells. GM said he approves of science and munchkinry attempts.

I would like some help in devising an experiment line up.

Rules:

I can cast a level zero spell once every six seconds, an unlimited number of times per day. I have seven days until the next adventure.

Spells I'm interested in and tests to do:

Purify food and water - "Purifies one cubic foot of food and water"

1. does purifying water get rid of visible particulates?
2. If (1)=no, how do I know water is pure? Are objects tagged with information about their state rather than having molecular properties?
3. If (1)=yes, are particulates taken out of water, or transmuted into water? Test volume and/or mass.
4. Test varying dirty water to mud. At what point does mud stop being water?
5. If (3)=transmuted, what happens to lead in water? Does mass or volume stay constant after purification?
6. If (1)=yes and (4) gives favorable results, what liquids can I purify? Some cultures consume blood, can I purify blood? a. blood inside something living? Would that cure disease or kill creature?

Mending - "Makes minor repairs on an object"

1. Can I repair a deliberately broken object? If no, I can't test further.
2. Will a whittled object be "repaired" to a block of wood?
3. Will a broken off piece or errant cut off a whittled object be repaired to the point of the original carving?
4. Does mend fill holes with new material?
5. If (4) =yes, can I mend a gold coin/ trinket to create more gold?
6. Can mend repair living things? Test rosewood armor/ green tree branches and work up to small cuts.

Light - "Object shines like a torch"

1. test size restrictions on object. Grain of sand? Boulder? Entire house?
2. Define "object." a. wet packed sand? Can it be broken apart and used as glitterdust? b. can part of an object shine? (Not sure if useful knowledge)
3. line of sight required? (Might be able to use as a lesser Faerie Fire to cancel concealment for team mates if I spot something first)

Create water - "Creates two gallons of water per level"

1. Pressure cannon? a. Air displacement if I create water in a sealed empty jar? b. water in pressurized bubbles on rocks or trees as land mines?\\

I have other spells available but these seemed like the most promising.

My goals as a character are to 1: understand the laws of nature, and 2: get battle techniques.

My goals as a player are to 1: get battle techniques, 2: understand the laws of magic and munchkin the hell out of them, and 3: RP entertaining enough stuff to get XP.
