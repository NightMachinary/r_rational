  --(4) Does mend fill holes with new material? --(5) If (4) =yes, can I mend a gold coin/ trinket to create more gold?
#+end_quote

If it uses existing material that opens a whole new series of questions as well.

Like could you cut in half a bunch of gold coins and use it to spend on things, and then mend the broken pieces of gold to just immediately steal the gold back from out of the merchant's coffers.

Or you do something similar with a trigger. Have a sliver of metal or wood that blocks the activation of a trap. Mend the original object and the sliver of metal/wood disappears allowing the trap to activate.

  mending
#+end_quote

Does mending display other objects? Like could you shiv someone with a piece of broken off wire, and men the wire while its inside of them and have new wire basically grow inside the person and displace all their internal organs? Or if new material doesn't get created, could you do something like that with a bent V shaped shiv and have it correct itself to a straight wire while inside someone?
