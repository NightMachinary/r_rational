Can you use purify food on living things?

What is the limit? Seeds, plants, fish eggs, insects, live worms. What is classed as 'food'?

If you have a diseased animal you plan to eat can you purify it or do you have to kill it first?

Does your adventuring buddy who just got poisoned count as food?
