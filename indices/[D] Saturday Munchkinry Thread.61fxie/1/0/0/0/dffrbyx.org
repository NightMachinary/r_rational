  Cross-domain applications did occur to me later, I just have to make it believable (since I'm not a cross-domain super-intelligence myself), without coming off as overpowered invention-X.

Well, /most/ cross-domain applications will start out as fairly esoteric and theoretical - he can write a paper on it, and maybe even figure out some of the application, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he can build a device to take advantage of it. The most likely result is that whenever he introduces himself to a scientist, the scientist will say something along the lines of "Oh, were you the one who wrote [paper in my field]? A most interesting read. Very innovative. You could go far as a [my field]ist. I see you've been dabbling in a few other fields too - if I may make the recommendation, you should probably drop the other fields and concentrate on [my field]."

Any "Invention X" type inventions should preferably be introduced early, and either explicitly kick off the plot or be no more than a slight, incremental improvement over what's already possible.

  Only paper (words printed on cellulose based matter) count as books.

Okay, that's fair enough - ebooks and so on are significantly different in physical structure.

New question - what happens if someone keeps poking him with new books while he sleeps? Can he be kept permanently unconscious in such a way? Can he consciously turn off his power, or can someone who knows of his power check for his disguised presence by asking everyone in the room to touch a two-metre-thick 'book' filled with random letters and seeing who faints?
