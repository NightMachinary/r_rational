  EDIT: To clarify, random letters won't do anything. It must be meaningful but taxing content, such as text books on law or taxation or govt. regulations or even better (or worse from your POV) govt. regulations on tax law! Talk of cruel & unusual punishment.

Okay I know this thread is a week old and the new thread is up already but it's only got one thing and this power interests me.

You said they understand the book if they understand the core concepts. Also that it's about as mentally taxing as having actually read the book.

So, what if a guy (like an antagonistic counterintelligence agent) floats out some communications they know will be intercepted with dummy information in a relatively complex cipher?

Now, maybe Bookworm doesn't know much about ciphers at first, but that's easy to get around with his power.

Then use the same cipher, preferably a rotating or changing one with several steps or stages to get to the final result that takes a lot of time to do even when you know the rules, and bind up a copy of The Odyssey or War and Peace or whatever.

Would the complexity of the code and the intermediary step of having to "translate" everything increase the mental fatigue?
