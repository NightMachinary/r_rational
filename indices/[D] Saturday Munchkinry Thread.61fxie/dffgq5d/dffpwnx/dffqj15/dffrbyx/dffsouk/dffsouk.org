Noted on the cross-domain plot ideas. Thanks. Yes, any 'deus ex machina' type plot kick-offs will be at the very beginning, just to give the MC his power. To answer other points, no he can't consciously turn off his power (That's a good plot idea for an antagonist to use, thanks).

EDIT: To clarify, random letters won't do anything. It must be meaningful but taxing content, such as text books on law or taxation or govt. regulations or even better (or worse from your POV) govt. regulations on tax law! Talk of cruel & unusual punishment.
