Does it have to be /new/ content? Can the MC immunise himself against a specific book by touching it once, and then he knows it? (For bonus points, after the antagonist uses government regulations on tax law to knock him out once, it would be fitting for the protagonist to get him investigated over some obscure tax law which had been in said book! And then, presumably, his other misdeeds come to light...)
