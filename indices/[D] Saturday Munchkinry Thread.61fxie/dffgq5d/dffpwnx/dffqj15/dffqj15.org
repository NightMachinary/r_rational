Thanks for the thought-out response. Cross-domain applications did occur to me later, I just have to make it believable (since I'm not a cross-domain super-intelligence myself), without coming off as overpowered invention-X.

To clarify the other points:

Only paper (words printed on cellulose based matter) count as books. Ebooks & online articles don't count. Arbitrary, I know, but I didn't want him rising to world-breaking levels too soon. There is a fatigue cost. While assimilation is instantaneous, he feels as fatigued as cramming a real book. Too many books and he can faint. So he can't assimilate the library in half-a-day. Maybe in a few weeks or months. Yes, he CAN use it spy on sealed or closed documents. I had vague ideas of the intelligence agencies trying to recruit such a character for his spying abilities/threat. A job in a mailroom or as a courier is an excellent plot point. I didn't think of THAT. Thanks!

EDIT: Come to think of it, the courier/spy idea has so much potential for social drama!!! He learns all the sad/dirty secrets of his neighbors with unanticipated emotional impact, as he feels compelled to help them with his new found "polymath" powers . Ooooh... I am thrilled.
