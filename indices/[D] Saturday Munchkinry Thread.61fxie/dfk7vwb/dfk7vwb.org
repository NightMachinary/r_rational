Congratulations, you've been selected to beta test the new Deluxe reincarnation package! Henceforth, when you die, you will retain your consciousness as well as your soul into your new life.

RULES:

- Your consciousness includes your memories, beliefs, values, continuity of subjective experience, and so forth.\\
- The deal does not specify what is meant by your "soul", but it's implied that it's not new, and that reincarnation has already been occuring naturally; this is just an upgrade to what would've happened anyway.\\
- For our purposes, "death" refers to the cessation of all co√∂rdinated biological functions. If you become a vegetable, you can't reincarnate until someone pulls the plug.\\
- There's a magical no-cloning theory at play. Once you reincarnate, any information left in your old brain is irrevokably scrambled.\\
- No one's brainstates are overwritten; your new body is selected at conception, and your consciousness is gradually transfered to your new brain as it develops.\\
- Only bodies of the same species are eligible candidates. This is determined based on the body you're leaving, not your "original" body, so you don't have to worry about the human species evolving into incompatibility.\\
- Your biological development is not affected. Good luck doing anything useful for at least a couple years.\\
- Of course, the transfer can't happen any faster than light speed.\\
- Your new body is selected so as to minimize this travel time.\\
- In ordinary circumstances, this just means the next available body, but may in extreme cases involve waiting briefly for one to show up closer.\\
- The above only applies if the body's appearance could in principle be predicted based on the current state of the universe. No shenanigans with prime numbers and petri dishes at the ready.\\
- You're not the only one with this ability; an unspecified but small fraction of humanity is participating in the trial along with you.\\
- If all goes well, this will be rolled out for all of humanity, either as the standard form of reincarnation or as a perk for good karma.
