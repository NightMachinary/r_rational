Am I the only one who's bothered that whoever wrote the book didn't find a more efficient way to communicate information to the kids than one morse word per book? Come on, if whoever bought the book didn't notice the matching owner tags, there's a lot more information they probably wouldn't have noticed either. Bolded letters, underlined words, etc.

Although, maybe there are more messages that the kids didn't find.
