That is reasonable, I suppose. I'm not very bothered myself, though. Their deductive skills, taken by themselves, are never unreasonable or Sherlockesque. Looking at the chapters, I don't recall any particular guesswork or far-fetchedness.

Whether or not it's plausible for the children to have these skills, the skills aren't inhuman. With that in mind, I think the story has fulfilled it's rational obligations. Backstories and explanations are secondary, so long as the story itself works within the bounds it has set for itself.
