It's their age that's really grating on me, I suppose. These kids are just that; kids. Hyper intelligent, sure. But they have no real world experience; their media is clearly censored and controlled by their alien overlords, yet they seem to have all of this relevant information needed handy. They make intuitive, logical leaps that are simply almost impossible to make without prior experience. Nothing they've said in and of itself is too unbelievable. But I find it unbelievable that 3 sheltered kids, with limited access to books and no Internet, can have made all of the conclusions they've come to in rapid succession in this short a time frame.
