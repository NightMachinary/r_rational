There's no instant jump to morse, you'll notice. Emma had already figured it out off-screen, and so had Ray. The only one to not know beforehand was Norman, and he didn't make the conclusion.

And, while figuring it out in a second would strain disbelief, doing it five minutes really wouldn't. They're kids. Looking for a code in a line, Morse is going to be the first thing they think of. Perhaps that's being right for the wrong reasons, but it's still perfectly plausible.
