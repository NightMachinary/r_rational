Yeah I think it's a more or less natural conclusion to come to if you're paying close attention to the details.

You see this owl picture in most of your books, but you notice that it's slightly different in each book you see. So you begin to wonder why it's different and what that might mean. Then you notice that the circles are made up of dots and lines. And if you're familiar with morse code that's probably the first thing that dots and lines would make you think of it.

It's a pretty natural progression I thought.

(Note: Not saying that I would be smart enough or observant enough to figure this out. Just saying that it all makes logical sense.)
