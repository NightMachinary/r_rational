It's possible that Emma has never read so many different books at the same time before.

Before perhaps she only occasionally read for fun. But now the books are one of their only clues to what the outside world is like, so they had to spend a lot of time trying to read them. This could be why she just noticed the pattern now.

And it seems as if Ray had already figured this out before Emma brought it to their attention, so who knows how long ago he had broken the code.

Also, even if they or some other gifted kid had broken the code in the past, it's a far cry from seeing a few coded words in a book to guessing the true nature of the farm.

Though admittedly I'm trying to shed this in the best light possible.

I'm actually half-surprised no one has innocently asked Mama about what the messages are supposed to mean and ruined the whole thing.
