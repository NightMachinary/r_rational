As others have mentioned before; the intuitive jumps they make are really starting to push the suspension of disbelief. I know that they're really bright kids, obviously, so they're all genius level. But that doesn't explain how they magically intuit all of these things. Especially considering the short time frame they've given themselves to work in. [[#s][]]

It feels like this work is becoming less rational and more "intellect porn" than anything else. "Oh hey, we have these really smart kids with all the odds against them. Let's have them Sherlock Holmes their way through this."
