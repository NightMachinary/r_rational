  Morse code is one of the first things you would think of when looking for a hidden message

This whole thing would have made sense if Ray was the one who had pointed them towards the stickers -- since he's the one who actually knew about the thing for years. Or if the story had begun with one of them having playing around having decoded the messages, but not imagining the thing was for real...

But somehow it was Emma who knew about the stickers, and introduced the other two to them, so she somehow wasn't noticing them for years, and only noticed them in the few weeks since they discovered all the information on their own, independently of the stickers?

What the fuck, these stickers came out of nowhere, plot-wise.
