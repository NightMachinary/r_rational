HJPEV is not a realistic protagonist in my opinion. I know child geniuses are a thing and I'm obviously not one of them but even still; he didn't feel like a realistic eleven year old at all. His inexperience never really backfired on him except in ways where it was practically guaranteed to.

HPMoR was a fun read; I really enjoyed it and felt it was an overall learning experience. But I would never point to Harry and say he was a believable protagonist; he was too good. Of course, that is an opinion and I won't begrudge others theirs, but invoking HJPEV doesn't really move me the way it might someone else.
