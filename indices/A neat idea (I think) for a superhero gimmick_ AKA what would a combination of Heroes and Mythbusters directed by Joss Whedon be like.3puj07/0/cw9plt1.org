For the last section you're treading into the area of "how does her power know what 'heal' means"?

If it's any changes to her physically, then she's unable to grow our develop new memories.

If it's some subjective trigger, you risk someone finding out what that trigger is and killing her without setting it off.

If it's a magic dwim spell, then she doesn't rebecome a virgin (unless wog declares it so, which is unfulfilling) and will likely end up being crazy overpowered.
