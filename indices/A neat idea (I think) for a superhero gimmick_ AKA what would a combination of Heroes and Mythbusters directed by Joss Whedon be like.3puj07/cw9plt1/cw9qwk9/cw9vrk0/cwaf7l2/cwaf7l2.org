Maybe her brain could work like a versioning system that stores the last neural synapses she gets while she's living, recognizes drastic changes in the brain structure/programming and automatically 'restores' the system to a previous version if the change was deemed too drastic.

It'd be interesting to ponder where it stores such data for recovery though and what would happen if someone were to 'tamper' with it. Also it may prevent her from feeling drastic emotions or delete traumatic memories so she wouldn't learn from them.

git checkout brain file/memories/trauma.txt

Man that's amazing!
