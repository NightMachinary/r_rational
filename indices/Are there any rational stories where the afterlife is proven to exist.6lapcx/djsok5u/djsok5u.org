The novel "The Terminal Experiment" by Robert J. Sawyer. It may not be up to the standards expected of rational fiction, but not for lack of trying. Opens with a researcher accidentally identifying a "soul" of sorts while working on mind uploading. The writer isn't exactly known for his flowing prose, but I personally like it (as well as his other stories).
