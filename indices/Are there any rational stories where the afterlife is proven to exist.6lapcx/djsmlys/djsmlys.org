This isn't super relevant to your request, but you did make me think of it, and it's the sort of anecdote that I think enough people here would appreciate to be worth sharing.

So, one of my favorite TTRPG systems is Legend of the Five Rings, which is a sort of pan-Asian-but-mostly-Japanese fantasy setting where the intricately detailed, socially repressive setting is one of the main selling points. A decade or so ago, a supplement was commissioned for the Shadowlands faction[1] called Bearers of Jade. An adventure module was written for inclusion called [[http://www.kazenoshiro.com/forge/4/Adventure-%20Mirror,%20Mirror.pdf][Mirror, Mirror]], but it was ultimately rejected. The preface to the adventure explains the reason why, and I'd like to quote a chunk here:

  Because creating horror in Rokugan is a different dance than trying it in GURPS Horror or Call of Cthulhu. If everyone is in character (which we are assuming in an otherwise functional game) you aren't trying to scare reporters and debutantes. That's easy. In L5R horror, you have to scare six hard-core, heavily armed martial artists, some of whom come from an entire clan of professional demon hunters *who do not fear death because they know for a fact they will reincarnate.* So we wrote an adventure that did. We sent it in to Alderac Entertainment Group. It was rejected. Why? Well, as D.J. Trindle, the line editor of L5R, put it: "You guys cranked this up to 11..." "I got chills reading it..." "You're not supposed to scare the GM."

Bolded for emphasis.

One of the things I like about L5R is that it makes reasonably rational use of the known-fact afterlife system. In one famous incident during the Battle At Volturnum, a fight over a gate to the afterlife realms, an entire legion commits mass suicide as a form of tactical teleportation, so they can emerge back through the gate as part of a pincer attack. The setting is filled with dozens and dozens of heroic last stands and noble self-sacrifices, all of which makes perfect sense because there is absolutely no ambiguity about the presence of an afterlife, and doing that sort of thing vastly increases your chances of a good-to-awesome one. It also makes the occasional self-sacrifice of /honor/, where doing the "right" thing gets you a /shitty/ afterlife due to the intense face/standing socio-religious rules, particularly poignant (this was a main element of the Scorpion Clan, my personal favorite).

I would never say the setting/story itself was rational, but this one element was consistently well done by rational fiction standards.

[1] Going into the Shadowlands was once described thusly: Imagine going to hunt xenomorphs. Except the xenos live in the Chernobyl 3 reactor. And the facehuggers are invisible. And the xenos worship Cthulhu. But Cthulhu isn't a distant, uncaring god. He hates you and your family, personally, with all the venom of a thousand years of rejection and imprisonment.

Doing horror in L5R is fun precisely because the stakes are so much higher than a normal horror game.
