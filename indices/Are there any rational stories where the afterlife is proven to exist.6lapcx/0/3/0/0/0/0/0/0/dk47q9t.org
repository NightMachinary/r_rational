Okay, I finished the first arc (10 chapters). I would say I like it. Sure it's dark, but it doesn't go into the "soul-crushing hopelessness" realm, and is always diluted with jokes that manage to not seem out of place.

And the art. The art just that awesome.

I could go more into details if you would like, but later: too sleepy XD
