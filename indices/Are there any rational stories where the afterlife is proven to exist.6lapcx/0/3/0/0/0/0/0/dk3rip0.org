Let me know what you think! I love hearing people talk about the comic, I've been a fan for years and I don't know a lot of people who read it. Even "I'm not into it for X reason" is cool to hear about because it's a new perspective.

The good thing is that some of the darkest shit happens very early on. You'll know what I mean when you get there. If you can get through that bit without wanting to die, you'll probably be okay with the rest of it.
