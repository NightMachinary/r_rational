To be honest, I disagree that it "doesn't make sense". In this case, "'ve" is clearly a "v" sound, not an abbreviation for "have." It's not that unusual of a construction. I don't know why anyone would ever read it as "afraid have."

If you find the written dialect excessive and distracting, that's a separate issue and it's perfectly fair, but I don't think being ungrammatical is a problem here.
