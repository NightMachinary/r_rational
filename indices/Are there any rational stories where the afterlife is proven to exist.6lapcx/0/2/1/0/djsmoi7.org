If the only thing bothering you is that you don't like Sette, I really recommend that you keep going--at least through chapter 5, which delves into the magic system. She isn't omnipresent, there's a /ton/ of cool stuff in Unsounded that doesn't involve her, and even when she's onscreen the story files the roughest edges off her brattiness pretty quickly. Once she starts seeing Duane as a person and not just a tool--and once you have some insight into her motivations beyond "steal everything in sight"--she becomes much more endearing. You stop noticing the thieves' cant after a little while too.

If the story's not for you for other reasons, then fair enough. But I think it's a real shame when people drop the comic just because early-chapter Sette is annoying.
