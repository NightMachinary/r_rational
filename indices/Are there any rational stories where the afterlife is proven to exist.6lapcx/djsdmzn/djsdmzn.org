Check out [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch01/ch01_01.html][Unsounded.]] It's a webcomic with an established afterlife that follows consistent rules (though some of its details are still unknown and hotly debated among the setting's religions), and which is exploited for research purposes and in the setting's "technology." The setting also has an equally consistent magic system that functions analogously to computer programming languages, and which characters use in creative and intelligent ways.

As far as Unsounded's relevance to this community goes, it has some pretty cool transhumanist/immortalist themes (coming back to the anti-death sentiment you mentioned). I wouldn't say that the narrative itself takes an anti-death stance; however, there are multiple characters who espouse those ideals, a canonical religion based around a rejection of the cruelties and indignities of mortality (including death and particularly the humiliation of physical decay), and an organization of hardcore scientists seeking to advance humanity, and the story doesn't appear to pass any kind of automatic moral value judgment on these things the way a lot of fiction does. The characters who are part of these organizations and believe in these ideals run the gamut, ethically speaking. And in fact, the idea of "overcoming death" increasingly seems to be critical to the plot and the driving motive of certain major characters, although exactly where the story will take this is still unclear. (There is also attention given to the component of the afterlife that involves immense suffering, a la Unsong.)

Aside from the ways in which its content is of interest to [[/r/rational][r/rational]], the comic is /very/ good. It is well-drawn, the characters and world are detailed and carefully crafted, it is updated on a reliable schedule, and the author puts a lot of thought into the structure and pacing of the story (which shows). I think its excellence is at least partly due to the author's habit of maintaining a large buffer, so that she can map out and tweak entire scenes in advance instead of rushing to post each page as it comes due.
