10 chapters! You're almost caught up!

I agree with you that the author does a good job balancing out the dark shit. I think it's partly the humorous bits, partly the occasional rays of hope, and partly the general sense of unwavering struggle against the world's cruelty. No matter how bad things get, we never stop seeing people trying to make things better. Sometimes in really fucked up ways, but hey.

Got a favorite character? I can never decide.
