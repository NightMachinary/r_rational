Okay, caught up to ongoing.

Fav character is Duane. For the same reason I liked Wonder Woman from the recent movie, actually - he is a paladin, one whose paladinship survived the utter crash of his worldview. Such characters are treasures, gotta love them.

Chapters 11-12 were a huge disappointment though. First, burning the town was as clishe as it was stupid. Second, Rahm's actions were beyond me: he is breaking a divine custom of his religion while working on a project an wishing for divine knowledge. Third, gotta agree with Winalils: for geniuses the Black Tongues are bloody gullible, and lampshading it is not enough of a saving grace.
