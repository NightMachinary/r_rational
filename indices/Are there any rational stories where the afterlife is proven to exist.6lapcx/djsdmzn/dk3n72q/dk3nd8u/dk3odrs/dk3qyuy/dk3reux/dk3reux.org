Yeah, that is what I'm doing right now.

There isn't any particular dealbraker, it's more of a matter of "mood" and "feel". It's possible to write quite cheery books in a setting as grimdark as /Warhammer 40k/, and it's possible to write pretty damn depressive and dark stuff in a setting as light as anime version of /Pokemon/.
