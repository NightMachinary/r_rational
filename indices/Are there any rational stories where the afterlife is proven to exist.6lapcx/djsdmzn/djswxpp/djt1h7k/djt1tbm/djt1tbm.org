The spelling doesn't make sense; "-'ve" means "- have". "Afraid of" shortened should either be "afraid 'f" or just "afraid of" and let the reader infer the pronunciation (there are plenty of cues as to how she speaks, and not every speech pattern is reflected in the spelling).

I think her dialect is altogether too pushed in this cartoon. The author was trying too hard and needed an editor.
