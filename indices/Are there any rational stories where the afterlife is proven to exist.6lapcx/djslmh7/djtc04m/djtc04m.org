Possibly /Foal Necromancer/, to a degree, in that the character eventually runs into and (to an extent) explores planes of existence which appear to function as afterlives or at least purgatories - to the point where he runs into people there who he personally killed, and also assorted dead family members.

Unfortunately, it stopped being updated years ago, and the author has apparently said they're not interested in writing any more. It doesn't help that it could have used a little smoothing out from an editor, too, and that there's a certain degree of Gary-Stu-ness about the main character. It does do some interesting world-building, though.
