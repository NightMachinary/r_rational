I'd actually plug the /Young Wizards/ series for having an unusual perspective on this.

Cosmologically, the story begins when the Lone Power invents death/entropy/endings/badness, and throws a tantrum when nobody is impressed. Literally the entire rest of the history of the multiverse is either the story of the /redemption/ of That One and its works.

So there is an afterlife, and it's much like this one but better (including the afterlife, recursively) - but what you do here matters too, so it's life that gives meaning to death. Pursuit of immortality is only a bad thing if you neglect the kind of life you're trying to extend, and death is a bitter parting but not forever.

If I could pick any universe to live in, it would be this one - (eventual) happy +ending+ continuation guaranteed.
