Maybe i'm an idiot but could someone explain what just happened? From what I can tell the All-mother and winnem roke switched places but if so where is the all-mother, shouldn't she have taken the earth by now? Is the all-mother the mother of Simole? Also what is the real rokes plan? Is the demon with nick the only one left truly, if so what is the all mother? Finally is the librarian a failed mage or like a half-demon because she appears to be very old and wrote the fairy tales of roke.
