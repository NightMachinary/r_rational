This chapter implies the Librarian is actually the All-Mother, who switched places with Winnum Roke ages ago (back in Roke's time). The All-Mother's plans aren't well known but is seems like her main goal is to protect the demons, rather than to destroy humans.

We don't know if Nic's demon is the only one left - it's certainly a possibility, though it could be that the rest are captured and used to create mages.
