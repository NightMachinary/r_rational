It's not perfect, and at one point the audience managed to convince the author to rewrite a chapter for less stupid plotting, but it's still the best treatment of a reverse portal fantasy story I seen.

In the end, it even manages to briefly become a sci-fi military thriller complete with geopolitics and Russian tank army, though not with a war.
