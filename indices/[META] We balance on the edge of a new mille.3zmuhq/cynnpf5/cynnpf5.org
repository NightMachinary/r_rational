As a matter of historical record-keeping, this sub was taken over (from the very charitable [[/u/centipeed]]) on 12/3/2013 following [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rz3k5/ripe_for_abuse/][this post]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rkkam/in_light_of_the_recent_slew_of_recommendations/][this post]] in [[/r/HPMOR]], the latter of which is where our sidebar rules originated (thanks [[/u/vivificient]]), now with some minor refinements. The original mod in the early days was [[#s][]], whose spirit is said to haunt our subreddit to this very day.

As a friendly reminder, the (bi)weekly challenge is now a little over six months old, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][and is cataloged here]] if you missed any of them.
