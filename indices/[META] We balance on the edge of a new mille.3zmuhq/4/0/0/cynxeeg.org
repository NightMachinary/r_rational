Yeahhhh [[/u/seraphnb]], guilty as charged -- tho I must say, I enjoy [[/u/sapphirebnb]] much better. I'd always imagined this sub as a rather laissez faire sorta place, so it makes me happy to see that most mod action is still along the lines of "promoting fun things for the community" as opposed to "approving posts and deleting submissions." You guys have done amazingly through and through, and I look forward to seeing where the future goes.
