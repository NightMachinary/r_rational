Ahh, I'm not actually subscribed in this particular throwaway. Here it is, then: 3994! (Edit: exactly 4000 at the time of editing!!! Woot!)

I'm glad this subreddit has grown so well. Kudos to our great mods, picked by [[/u/eaturbrainz]] -- and man, serious kudos to the dude who picked brains after realizing he needed to quit reddit for a bit ... bet he'd be really proud that his baby is lasting nicely. I remember when it was just an empty forum with a vague promise about "cool-headed discussion" or some shit like that ... a diamond in the rough. Super thanks to the dude who was really nice by willingly surrendering such prime domainspace in response to a short PM. By the time I even accepted the request to mod it, he'd already unmodded himself. Fun stuff.

Anyway, looking forward to seeing the new thousand.
