I was browsing thepiratebay for audiobooks and found the HPMOR podcast way up the top 100 audiobooks. And I figured, hey, HP fanfiction with a pretentious name that is popular enough to get its own podcast, might as well give it a shot. It cut out just after Hermione's little incident. So you know, that made me kinda motivated to go look for the rest of HPMOR. There wasn't much more written, but it did let me find the subreddit. Which links here all the time. I stayed because there's good content and good people.

Also, the squeaky clean reddit account I use on untrusted hardware is also subscribed, so I'm afraid there is /at least one LIE/ among those 4k. Gasp!
