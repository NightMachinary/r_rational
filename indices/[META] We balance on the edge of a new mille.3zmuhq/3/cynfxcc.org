Part 1 (circa 2011; 95% correct?): Found FanFiction.net → browsed stories, mostly for /Naruto/, /Harry Potter/, /Avatar/, and /Death Note/--but FanFiction.net hadn't yet implemented sorting by number of favorites or reviews, so I could only filter by number of words (>100k or >200k, usually) and sort by date of publishing or date of most recent update. How lucky I was to discover /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ in such circumstances!

Part 2 (circa 2012; 80% correct?): Saw that FanFiction.net had implemented sorting by number of reviews and favorites → sorted all /Harry Potter/ stories by number of favorites → discovered /[[http://hpmor.com/][Methods of Rationality]]/

Part 3 (circa 2014; 90% correct?): Found TV Tropes → stumbled across Polandball article → browsed r/Polandball → glanced at other subreddits → found [[/r/ParadoxPlaza][r/ParadoxPlaza]] → made this account to show off [[http://imgur.com/a/Lb4hj][the cool maps that I'd made for my own amusement]] → subscribed to various subreddits, including this one (presumably discovered through the RSS feed of /HPMoR/ updates)
