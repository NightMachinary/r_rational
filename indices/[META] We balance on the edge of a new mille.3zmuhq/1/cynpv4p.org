Whenever I got a noticeable spike in my fiction blog traffic, I'd do a search to see if I could find what caused it. Going back more than a year, there were periodic posts on here and a few other subreddits linking to my stories. I stayed away for a long time, because I wasn't sure about the boundaries for self promotion, and didn't want to offend, but after some nice feedback, I decided to make an account so I could answer questions and thank people. I'd never really thought of my fiction as 'rational fiction' so much as stories where smart people actually acted reasonably intelligently, instead of being driven by the whims of plot and limits of the author.
