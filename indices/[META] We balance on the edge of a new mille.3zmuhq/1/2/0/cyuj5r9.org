That's fine, not everyone likes romance, and it is certainly done badly often enough.

I tried to portray DASI as not 'just happening' to care about Doc--it was a natural consequence of the way he set her priorities, thus Stella's "of course" at the time. The unexpected event was full anthropomorphic intelligence before he had adjusted those priorities for it, though perhaps that could have been made a little clearer. Glad you liked Fall.
