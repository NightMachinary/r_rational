I haven't read your sequels yet, but I know I definitely enjoyed /The Fall of Doc Future/ and I was wondering if you were planning on releasing it in epub, mobi, or pdf form so we can have our own offline copies?

I enjoyed your story so much that I went to the trouble of copying and pasting each chapter into my very own Microsoft file and converted into a pdf for private use.

Thanks so much!
