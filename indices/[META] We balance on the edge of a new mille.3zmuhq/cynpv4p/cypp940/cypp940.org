That's what 'rational fiction' has come to mean. This sub was created as an aggregator for 'fiction that's like /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/', but as the community grew we've figured out what we specifically liked in that and what sort of story appeals to us (and what things we'd created tags for turned out to be superfluous). It's a fascinating process to watch.

I love your story, by the way. It and the weekly discussion threads are what keep me coming back here.
