We reached [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/38a2b1/meta_rrational_hits_3000_subscribers/][3000]] 218 days ago and we reached 2000 a year and three days ago. It took 58 days longer to go from 3000 to 4000 than it took to go from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2rcbbz/meta_rrational_hits_2000_subscribers/][2000]] to 3000. I suspect growth between 2000 and 3000 may have been inflated because HPMOR ended in that time which gave this sub a boost from people searching for an alternative source of rational/rationalist fiction.
