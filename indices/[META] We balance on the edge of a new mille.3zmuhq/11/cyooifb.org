Normally I don't participate in discussions on this subreddit, because the bar is set to high for me to contribute anything of value. I like how people reason over here and the interaction between community and authors.

A post on HN pointed me to HPMOR after the last chapter was released, I really enjoyed HPMOR. Afterwards I filled my reading time with worm and HPMOR fanfiction and then another post on HN finally pointed me to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]

I check regularly for new content and look forward to new chapters of Mother of Learning and Team Anko.
