This is flatly untrue. In fact, I'm pretty sure this has been discussed and refuted multiple times on this subreddit, but I don't know of a good way to find the threads in question, so I'm going to quickly go over why this is untrue. To that end, I'm going to use LotR as an example of your standard "good fiction". From the sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

Nope.

#+begin_quote
  Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

Sorta, but not really.

#+begin_quote
  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Ahaha... no.

#+begin_quote
  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

Not particularly, no.

So there you have it: LotR--which, I should note, I actually really like--fails to satisfy all four characteristics of "rational fiction" as described on the sidebar. More to the point, /you can write a good story that isn't rational/. You could /maybe/ argue that the first two rules ("nothing happens because the plot requires it" and "factions are driven by motivations other than good and evil") are present in most good fiction (although there are obvious exceptions to that--LotR is but one example), but there is /nothing/ requiring "good fiction" to obey the last two rules ("characters solve problems through intelligent use of resources" and "the rules of the world are sane and consistent")--in fact, I would argue that most stories actively violate these two rules, and are none the worse for it. They just don't qualify as rational.

TL;DR: No, "rational fiction" is not a synonym for "good fiction", and I wish people would stop conflating the two.
