The thing is there's just so much of bad fiction that do not respect those things. There's just so much work where I think that the characters are just being dumb or where things just happen because the plot requires it.

So, yes 'rational' is just a way to define good fiction but since there's so much bad fiction out there, it's good to have clear rules about what we value in fiction imho.
