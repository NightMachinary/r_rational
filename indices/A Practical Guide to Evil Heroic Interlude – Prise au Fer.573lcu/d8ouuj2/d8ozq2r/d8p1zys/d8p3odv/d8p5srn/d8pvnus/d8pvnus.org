Is UNSONG rational? No. Is UNSONG good? Yes. Is Discworld rational? Fuck no. Is Discworld good? Hell yes. Is Harry Potter rational? Not even close. Is Harry Potter good? Arguably, yes.

I want to make this clear: /the term "rational fiction" is not just another generic synonym for "good fiction"./ It's possible that some people use it that way. Those people are /wrong/. Rational fiction is not just generic well-written fiction. Rational fiction generally contains world-building designed to hold up under close scrutiny. Characters in rational fiction tend to make reasoned, logical decisions based on what they know, rather than acting on impulse. In rational fiction, logical implications /actually hold/--there's little to no glossing over the consequences of some minute detail. Above all, rational stories /stimulate the readers' minds/--they /make readers think/. There's a strong argument to be made that most fiction--yes, even most good fiction--does the /opposite/ of that. Thinking is hard. Most stories optimize for entertainment value, which means avoiding stuff that requires undue cognitive effort from the part of the reader.

I... look. This subreddit exists because certain people find certain qualities in certain stories appealing, and those qualities are not present in the vast majority of fiction, including published works of fiction. To that end, a new term--"rational fiction"--was coined to describe works that /do/ possess said qualities. Redefining that term to refer to generic "good fiction" (whatever that actually means) dilutes its meaning, and weakens its ability to specify targets in solution space. If that happens, people might start posting things here that are unappealing to the majority of this subreddit's users, which I don't want to see happen--but even more importantly than that, /it's an abuse of the term "rational"/, which I wouldn't want to see /even if there were no consequences/. Words have meanings. Please use them properly.
