Well as well as being a deconstruction, I'd classify it as tending to be rational...

Factions are defined by their beliefs and values (while one faction is called "Evil" and another faction "Good", the stories and motivations are more nuanced than this), characters solve problem through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources and the rules of the world are consistent (not sure I'd call them sane though :)).

One thing though, some things happen because the plot requires it since the plot and name is a powerful force in that universe.
