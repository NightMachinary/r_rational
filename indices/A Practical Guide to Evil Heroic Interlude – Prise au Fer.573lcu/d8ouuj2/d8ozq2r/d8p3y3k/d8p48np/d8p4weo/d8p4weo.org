It's overly nitpicky depending on what the story's a deconstruction of. If it's a deconstruction of DnD, then sure, but if it's supposed to be (or is being "sold" as) a deconstruction of the high fantasy genre then it's a valid argument to make that it clings too closely to DnD.

Personally, I've always heard it billed as general fantasy rather than a parody of DnD, which is why it's been hard for me to get into the story.
