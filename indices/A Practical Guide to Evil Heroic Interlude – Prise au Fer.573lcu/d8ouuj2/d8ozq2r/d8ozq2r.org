Literally the entire point of the story is that it's what the world would look like if all the tropes were actually accurate. The story wouldn't make any god damn sense if the author was like, "Yeah, so I'm playing with genre tropes in an interesting way but I'm going to ignore the tropes I'm playing with. Because that makes sense and would be logical with the rest of my story."

Like jesus, dude, you're completely missing the point. It's not a 'rational' story, it's a deconstruction. I don't even know why it gets posted on this sub.
