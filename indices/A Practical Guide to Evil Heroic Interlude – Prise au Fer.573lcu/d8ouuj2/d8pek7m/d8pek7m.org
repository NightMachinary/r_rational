I agree that the fake battles were annyong. I hated them too. I disagree with wroldbuiling. First I love the worldbuilding just for the sake of it so I'm biased. Second the various Devil, Demon, Angel relationships play later in the story and they are NOT the D&D ones.

Also I forgot about the thing trapped in stone, where was it mentioned?
