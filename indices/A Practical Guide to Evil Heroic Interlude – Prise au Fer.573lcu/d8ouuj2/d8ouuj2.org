I'm going to take this opportunity to shit all over this story. I quite like it in a lot of ways, but after reading almost the whole first book there are just too many problems for me to be able to recommend it to anyone. I dislike the way world-building is done, I feel it paces itself far too fast, especially at the start, and I have HAD ENOUGH OF FAKE BATTLE ARCS AAAAAAAAA

- The world building is terrible. Being a DnD-rip is not a good thing, even if you're aiming for the 'rational' genre of 'genre-savvy hero in recognisable world'. Why do you need a /mechanised/ set of deities: why do priests need magic? Why do /wizards/ need magic? Why do you need Devils (who are devils from dnd, and are lawful evil, because of course), /and/ Demons (chaotic evil) /and/ mysterious eldritch beings sealed in stones?

None of these were remotely story important except for 'building out the setting' at the time. There's a place for this, and I appreciated it the first couple of times, but then the author did it about 4 times more. I have no expectation that any of these details will be plot/thematically relevant, or handled in a particularly interesting way. You don't have to copy every aspect of a setting, if you arent going to use those aspects appropriately.

The reason I'm so annoyed about this is probably because of the mysterious high-tech gnomes, who ordinarily would be the biggest culprit of eye-roll, especially since we already have isolationist elves and a massive underground dwarf empire. However, the author actually stated some sort of storytelling intent- we're given an actually interesting detail about how gnomes are actually interesting, and potentially plot relevant. The fact that it occurred /after/ all of the 'standard irrelevant genre-required random shit' was extra irritating, since it shows that the author is actually capable of having good ideas.

Another related point is the chapter-starting pithy quotes. These I initially enjoyed a lot. However, it's clear that the author wasn't defining a list of characters to quote, giving say past emperor 'Horribilis II, the cowardly' a personality or relevance, by quoting him multiple times, but was instead just picking random names to go with the quotes he'd thought up. I'd compare this to Terry Pratchett's use of General Tacticus in quotes- one oft-quoted source of pithiness gains a personality. A long list helps imply the immense age and stagnation of Praes, but feels lifeless, in an already too-broad setting.

- The pacing improved, but definitely still deserves to be slammed. Admittedly you want to get to 'main character has Name, moves on with life' relatively quickly, but there was a real chance to make Catherine seem clever and badass, by making the other contenders from Squire deeper/tougher/giving them more than 2 chapters to be introduced and killed off.

- AAAAAAA WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO FAKE BATTLE ARCS THERE'S LITERALLY NO TENSION, EVERYONE ELSE HAS ALREADY DONE IT, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD WE'RE LIVING IN A POST-HUNGER GAMES WORLD. YES I KNOW IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO TRAIN YOUR OFFICERS IN A LOW-STAKES COMBAT SETTING. YES I KNOW ITS A LOT OF FUN. YES I KNOW IT DOES A GREAT JOB OF INTRODUCING US TO A LOT OF MINOR CHARACTERS. IT JUST FEELS UNORIGINAL AND HAVING THE HEIRESS BET ON IT TO TRY TO GIVE IT AN ARTIFICIAL LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE FOR THE OVERARCHING PLOT JUST ISN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR THAT
