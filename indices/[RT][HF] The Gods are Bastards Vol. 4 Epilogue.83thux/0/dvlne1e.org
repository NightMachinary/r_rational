I feel like this quote from the Vol 4 epilogue is of interest to this sub, (from one of the players monologuing to a minion):

“In the bardic epics, fairy tales, even the modern chapbooks and comics, enemies never talk to each other---at least, not openly. And now I find myself greatly threatened because so many of my opponents have simply had conversations, like adults. Foolish of me, unforgivably foolish.”
