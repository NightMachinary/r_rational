  Can I ask why no one was posting updates of this story?

I can hazard some guesses. FWIW I'm a big fan of the series, but I also know that some parts of it rub people the wrong way.

- The plot isn't purely rational. In fact, the biggest complaint I've heard about the story is that every character has plot armor. It's like the anti-Game of Thrones... if you have a favorite character, odds are they'll survive no matter what. After 13 books, the number of characters who have actually died can probably be counted on one hand... and none of them were "main" characters. Heck, or even secondary characters. This was actually addressed as a plot point in a recent book, where [[#s][Spoiler]]. But the result is that the stakes never feel that high because the characters aren't in actual mortal peril. They survive purely because the plot requires it.

- Parallel to that last point, the cast is HUGE after 13 books and no deaths. With eight primary characters in the freshman class (plus Tellwyrn herself), that's already a big cast. Then you get Darling, his apprentices, and then his group. And then the gods. And then Justinian's villain group AND his underlings. And all of the Unseen University students and staff. And then Basra's group. And then Trissiny's spin-off group. And then all the other families/friends/various oddballs. It makes for great world-building, but it also makes the story /very/ long and somewhat rambling (DD Webb has acknowledged this in his comments, and plans to streamline his future books more). It also makes it tough to take a break and come back later, because you likely won't remember who some characters were when they were mentioned several books ago and not since.

- Outside of the non-rational plot and the length, the main complaint I've seen is about artistic choice. Namely, the author seems A) Very progressive in his social views, and B) Very much like an otaku. Neither of these bug me much; heck, I like having a diverse cast of characters and find the tension between Avenist and Shaathist philosophies super interesting; but I've read people complain that it feels like "an agenda" is being pushed at them. The otaku part is more a personal complaint from the the last few books as more of the Old Gods' pasts were revealed and Siif was brought into play. But having characters suddenly break into Japanese, or discuss how the Old Gods loved Cowboy Bebop and World of Warcraft, just kinda breaks the immersion. I like the references, but cringe a bit too.

It's still a really good series. But when I've seen it recommended here before, there are usually people who complain about the things I wrote above.
