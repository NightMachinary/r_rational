I can try and elaborate later if you wish, but the main thing I want to mention is that this is at least partly a coming of age/school series. What we were told about the characters at first was meant to change. Especially in the case of Trissiny and Shaeine, what you see as a mismatch between what were told of the characters and how they actually act, I see as character development.

Trissiny for example /was/ quite reckless and hot headed. From attacking Gabriel for being half demon, to attempting to stand against a hellgate alone and solo a demonic version of a dragon. Perhaps more than recklessness in combat, her largest problem has been recklessness in thought and words (remember the arc in what was essentially the drow ghetto?)

As for Tellwyrn, her careless use of power is /exactly/ what caused the whole issue with the rouge Hand that was central to this most recent book. Which she was rightfully chewed out by the Empress for. She's also done a number of really badass thing's on screen.

Shaeine /DID/ act quite alien at first, and that has fallen gradually by the wayside. However that's her entire reason to be at Last Rock. She was raised to be a diplomat and then immersed herself in another culture to learn their ways. I'd be far more concerned about the story if she was still acting alien.

Someone mentioned Ruda, but she has indeed demonstrated her leadership ability and competence multiple times. Off the top of my head the first example I can think of is her performance in Sarasio.

I could defend Toby too, he very much serves as the team mom and helps provide emotional support to his classmates. He also played a much bigger role this arc than in the past. I will, however, agree that he and Teal are the weakest of the main cast.
