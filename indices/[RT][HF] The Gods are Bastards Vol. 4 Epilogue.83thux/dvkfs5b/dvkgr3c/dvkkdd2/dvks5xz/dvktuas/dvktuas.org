Agreed. Well, Ruda does have /some/ moments of strategy, like in that bar fight where she set it up so that no one was killed and they all ended up listening to her. But this most recent book was very much "Hot-headed Ruda rushes in and yells a lot." For a book mostly about her home, I actually ended more annoyed at her rather than less. Usually when individual characters get more attention it goes the other way!

Fross is just the best. Although I keep expecting some dark twist, where she realizes how much smarter and more powerful she is than almost everyone else, and turns out to become the next Tellwyrn or something. Then I remind myself that that's not how Webb writes characters, and I should stop looking for sinister overtones lurking everywhere, haha.
