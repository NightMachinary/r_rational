As someone who doesn't share his views, it seems to me like he is blatantly pushing his agenda. It's what drove me away about a year ago (around arc 11 or 12), but I've recently started reading again. Anyway, a couple of points to illustrate my frustrations with the way he (is he confirmed as a he?) inserts his views into his book:

- woman good, man bad: Most of the main cast is women. Now that's not inherently a problem, but it ties into the following. At first, the only male protagonists are Gabe (socially awkward nerd dude), Toby (Gay pacifist) and Darling (Chaotic neutral at best in his alignment). What I'm trying to say is that there is a distinct lack of a positive traditionally masculine character among his protagonists. Darling comes closest, but even then he's more of a behind the scenes kind of guy, a thief and morally gray at best. The Tirasian king, once you get a bit deeper into the book, is the closest to a traditionally masculine character.

- matriarchy good, patriarchy bad: the abstraction of the above. The societies in TGAB are very left-leaning as a whole, a reflection of the author's views and perhaps of the views of the people who created the world (The Elder Gods). The military cult (Avenists) is all female (and that's somehow okay) and feminist - call me sexist but that makes no sense to me, especially when considering the fact that men are more suited to combat than women.\\
  I may be particular in this regard, but it really makes it hard for me to suspend my disbelief. Even so, I can accept that humans in Tiraas aren't the same as humans on Earth (really ironic when you find out Tiraas was created by a bunch of people from Earth), but it would make sense to have a male equivalent of the Avenists right? Wrong. The closest thing to that would be the cult of Shaath which is a gross caricature of traditionalists and portrayed very negatively even disregarding that.\\
  Not to mention the fact that there exists a whole species of humanoids that organizes itself in a Matriarchal order, but no real masculine equivalent - again, I find it hard to suspend my disbelief.

- demonization of male sexuality: a lot of men are grabby, rapey bastards, are described as "ugh" by the women. This is demonstrated quite literally by Jeremiah Shook and Alan Vandro, who are again, caricatures of the traditionalist view on the norms of male-female relationships. At least a female equivalent is present in Basra Syrinx, although she seems less reviled than her male counterparts. And even still, Basra seems to be lesbian and acts in a very "toxicly masculine" way towards objects of her sexual interest, so I'm not sure that she is a clear parallel to the male rapists.
