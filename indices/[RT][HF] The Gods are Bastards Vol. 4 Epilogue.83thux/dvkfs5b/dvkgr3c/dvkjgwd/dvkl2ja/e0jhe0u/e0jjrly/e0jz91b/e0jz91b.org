You raise some valid points, but i think you misunderstood me on some of my reasonings. My first point us trying to illustrate that there is a big lack of positive traditionally masculine characters. Think Rambo, Conan the Barbarian etc. These are exaggerations, but i hope you're understanding my point. All the characters you listed are positively portrayed men, sure, but only Ruda's dad and maybe Vex are traditionally masculine, manly men. Not all men need to be traditionally masculine, but to have none be that way signifies an agenda to me. Joe Jenkins whole shtick is being an (autistic) femnist ally, so I wouldnt call him traditionally masculine either.

On matriarchy and world building - sure the setting is matriarchal due to worldbuilding, but the world was built by author, it's not self emergent. The setting offers as much of an insight into the auhors views as the way he writes his characters.

On Ingvar - Brother Ingvar is a TransMan, biologically female. Do you see where I'm getting at? The only positively portrayed Shaathist is one that breaks the mold - he is not traditionally masculine, because he is trans.

On the demonization of male sexuality Basra.\\
What I was trying to show, was that sure Basra is also vilified, but she is very masculine in demeanor and sexuality. She is portrayed as a sociopath, a predominantly male trait and is very masculine in her sexual pursuit of other women. As much as she is demonized, she is demonized for her masculine behavior.

EDIT: The points I didnt address, I believe are valid and I cant object to them.
