While the story does enjoy subverting some standard narrative tropes I found this quote a) too on the nose and b) not consistent behaviour with the character quoted who is a â€˜behind the scenes master planner/schemer' who has somehow elevated himself to a position of great power without realising that people in his world do not function like narrative cliches.

It feels like, in order to highlight how most characters in the story are not holding the idiot ball that the author has a character act as if people /do/ hold the idiot ball, then be surprised when they in fact do not, which really is just its own form of the idiot ball.
