Not the OP, but I'll chime in. As a quick synopsis, the story roughly follows a group of students attending a University for adventurers in a world setting that combines fantasy and western themes (and later sci-fi). Each member of the group has their own reason for attending the university, run by a 3000 year-old elven archmage, but primarily they are there to learn how to survive and thrive in a world where traditional adventurers and heroes are being phased out by a technological revolution and bureaucratic expansion.

The best part of the series is the world-building, and the second best is the character development. Witty banter probably comes in third.

The series so far is 13 volumes long and has a HUGE cast of characters. It has a bit of something for everyone, but also does a good job of explaining (slowly) why the world works as it does and /how/ it works as it does. There are fairly consistent rules about the different types of magic, what they can do, who can use them, and how they interact. The gods are discrete figures but /also/ abstract concepts, and their interaction with mortals is almost as fascinating as how their individual cults affect the world and culture. Recently the plot has been discussing how the world came to be, and where the gods (and Old Gods) came from, which is cool too.

The characters are great as well; you get a wide, diverse cast, and each of them have their own backstories, problems, and abilities. Webb (the author) does a good job of not only making each character unique, but also showing the connections between them all. And while the cast is HUGE by now, most characters really are connected by just a degree or two of separation. That said, some characters get more development time than others, and at the beginning a lot of their dialogue feels interchangeable. After a few books, they start to get their own "voices," if you will. But with such a large cast, it's not uncommon to meet a new character and then not see them for a few books... which may make you forget who they were. It's hard to binge-read 13 volumes, but the last time I did so I realized a LOT more connections than I did the first time reading as chapters were released.

Finally, the banter is great. The synergy between the main characters means they are full of witty byplay. It's not quite as badass as, say, APGTE, but it is still really entertaining.

Now, there are complaints about the series too (see my other post here). But the series is definitely a fun read.
