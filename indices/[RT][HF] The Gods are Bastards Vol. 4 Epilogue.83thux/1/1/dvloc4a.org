Been reading it since it was dropped in a monthly recommendation thread here I dunno how long ago, but it feels like years. I've puzzled over whether it belongs here as well, and I think it just comes down to it not really being a rational or rationalist story.

There's two real levels to the story, so far as I can suss out - pretty standard boilerplate, almost JRPG-like fantasy.

[[#s][Complete with]]

On the next level up, it's an attempt to treat with the fact that we, in a modern, industrial or post-industrial context are still enamored with the values and ideals of pre-Enlightenment, agricultural, feudalistic societies. It attempts to showcase how and why those values break down in the face of a modern, interconnected society.

However, it also attempts to reconstruct that society in the same breath as it deconstructs it - it offers something of an alternative set of values in the guise of Tellwyrn imparting those values to the student class - hence the complaints that an agenda is being pushed. Because it is. However, D.D. Webb's particular choice of values for an industrialized or post-industrial society aren't necessarily everyone's, which is the first hit against its ability to popular traction.

That might not alone be enough to stop it from climbing the charts - HPMOR certainly didn't shy away from pushing a transhumanist agenda as part of its presentation, but the second major hit is the pacing, and the ratio between the story acting on its first level as boilerplate fantasy vs. its second level as societal analysis.

TGaB spends so, so, so much time on the first level, filling chapter after chapter with fantasy adventure that I could find by pulling a random book of the shelf at Barnes & Noble with the author's name in big shiny letters on the cover, and spends less than 10% of its time actually engaging with the societal issues that might make it interesting on a rationalist level. As it stands, TGaB has been running for three and a half years, making pretty regular updates the whole time, [[#s][and]] If Webb expects to actually spark or have a discussion on values they're presenting and their merit, it'd be pretty useful to actually have laid them out at some point.

Instead, I get the impression that TGaB's thesis which I think I can best summarize as "we should be focused on network effects, system level consequences and incentives, and our role within institutions" will continue to be doled out by Tellwyrn or whomever else gets to be the author mouthpiece of the book, and we'll get a triumphant win at the end of the series when society is reconstructed all for the better to prepare for the coming industrial revolution and every pre-existing institution will have reshaped itself to better integrate. More "The Next Generation", less "Battlestar Galactica".

Still gonna read it until the end, 'cause it's entertaining, but it certainly doesn't feel like much more than an entire world constructed to showcase how great things are when people wise up and start behaving like Webb's ideal version of themselves. [[#s][See]]
