My single biggest problem with this story is how what we are informed of the characters by the narrative is completely at odds with how the actual characters act. That is, we are told by the story Trissiny is rash and hot-headed but good at fighting... but then she never is in the actual story.

I'm just going to quote from a [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/d-d-webbs-the-gods-are-bastards.535450/][Spacebattles Thread on the story]] rather than rewriting this specific criticism's examples myself. This contains *a bunch of spoilers for the story*:

  The biggest problem with the story is that what we're told is completely at odds with what we're shown, for basically every character in every scene.

  Tellwyrn is talked up as being super powerful, unstoppable, and someone you can't reason with. Someone who might kill you as soon as look at you, and who could totally get away with it even if she did. She's a natural disaster, a Z-20, etc. etc. etc.

  But despite all that talk? She never once actually does anything meaningful to the plot with that power. She can manifestly teleport people to alternate planes of reality, orbit, or anywhere in between. Instead, she gets taunted at by the various in-story villains, and just... puts up with it. For no discernible reason.

  At one point in section 12 she even comments how she can't kill one of the villains because, oh no, she'd get in trouble with the empire. The same empire that- in previous chapters- was repeatedly said to have a policy of 'let her do anything she wants, because we can't stop her'.

  Similarly, Trissiny is supposedly an awesome warrior, champion of the goddess of war, etc. etc. and is constantly being harped at about flying off the handle and using force instead of reason. Except, she doesn't do that. She has a very real tendency to lose plot-relevant fights. She has (very nearly) never killed any sentient foes, possibly excepting the centaurs in the very first portion of the story- but that was done off-screen.

  She has caused a mook to die by being clever at them- but that was in turn, used to set up a scene where she tries it on one of the actual villains, and the trick doesn't work. In short, Trissiny is shown to be caring, second-guesses herself frequently, and is extremely loathe to engage in fights which she seldom wins if her winning those fights would inconvenience the villains of the piece.

  But despite that, everyone on the story is constantly lambasting her for being too quick to use violence and brute force. The Trissiny-centric chapter 11 is cringingly bad as far as that goes, as neither her attempts to be clever nor her attempts to fight pan out, resulting in her being shown up as entirely useless at everything forever.

  Teal is a bard. A bard that never plays music, tells stories, nor generally engages in bardic activities on screen. She did, twice, in the dungeon crawl. Doing so got her smashed with a rock, the first time. It worked the second time she did it. She's never done so again on screen. Great bard, she is. But, uh, they say she's really into that stuff, honest. She's in the music program!

  Poor Gabe Arquin's already been discussed.

    I think the most blatant of this is probably Gabriel's characterization - the text keeps on insisting he is supposedly smart or book-smart or intelligent or something, but that characteristic is completely at odds with both his actions and words and most of the time everyone else spends time teaching him basic stuff he should probably know already, and he never seems to be the guy coming up with intelligent insights into anything important.

  His buddy Toby is just, ugh. He's one militant sonofabitch for someone who supposedly serves a god of peace. All he tends to do is just be judgemental at people. The way Trissiny is supposedly being? Toby's actually doing that, but is almost never called out on it- and when he is, he doesn't do anything different.

  Juniper, oh god. She had some character development! Juniper, supposedly the Only Sane Dryad, or anyway the only dryad that's been out in the world to learn more, to grow, to see others as people? Yeah, no. By the time we get to segment 12, there's at least five others. Considering there were supposedly like no more than double digit dryads in all of the world, in the beginning of the story? It really devalues Juniper as a character, and makes you go "but author, y u lie to us?"

  And, of course, the drow priestess darling Shaeine. I think I misspelled that. Anyway. She's talked up early on as having a really different culture. It comes up a few times, in the very early work. But then after some point it just... stops. And she's just this normal kid. She winds up being the shield bot slash heal-dispenser. For one of the supposedly smarter characters, who is more cleric than diplomat, she doesn't really seem to do much of anything related to her goddess. She explicitly calls for judgement once, because Juniper asked her to do so, and... that's it.

  Blah.

  And, of course, the constant drubbing about how brute force takes second place to cleverness. Except, brute force works pretty darn well for the guys that use it, on the rare occasions they do so, and 'cleverness' seems to be summed up by the bad guys having a copy of the script. Pretty much any time the protagonists attempt to sneak around and plan for things, it doesn't work out in their favor.

  And I guess the biggest telling-different-than-showing is, of course, the revelations previously mentioned, because dude, just... don't. Anne McCaffery you are not, and it didn't work very well for her when she did it either.
