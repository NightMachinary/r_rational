This is spot on and doesn't even mention Ruda who we're told only seems like a loud mouthed idiot on the surface except she does nothing to actually disabuse us of this notion. Perhaps that's why Frost has been my favourite of the group; she's not an especially complex character but she behaves consistently and in line with what we're told in story.

I do believe the author has the writing chops to pull off the character subversion and growth that he was attempting but he's forever adding additional extraneous characters and trying to reign in this unwieldy sprawling plot at the same time.
