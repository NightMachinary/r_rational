About the plot armor... honestly I've never felt it, because I felt like violence and possibility of death were never the concern of the story itself. In most the arcs, especially early on, the cast encounter increasingly complex problems that simply can't be solved by just bashing someone, where the main source of tension is whether they mess up the delicate political balance of myriad factions.

And well... by the standards of the world, the main cast is pretty overpowered.

Darling has [[#s][spoiler]]. Justinian apparently has [[#s][spoiler]]. And most of the other cast that we encounter are protected in some form by their own strength or the strength of the institution backing them.

Also helping the case is an antagonist who [[#s][spoiler]] .

About the agenda, well, I feel that's dependent on the reader how they want to take it. Personally, I disagree with his views, but I don't feel like his political views have seeped into the story, at least not yet (please tell me if I missed something in this regard).
