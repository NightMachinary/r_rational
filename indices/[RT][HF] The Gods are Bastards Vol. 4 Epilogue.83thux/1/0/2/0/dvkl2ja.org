I agree with most everything you say; I'm just pointing out that it frustrates some readers. Webb has stated that he doesn't like grimdark settings or killing off favorite characters. In many ways TGAB is like the anti-Worm. I can at least vouch that if you've read Worm and feel like you need a palate cleanser, TGAB is an /excellent/ choice to turn your mood around. And yes, the main cast is overpowered; however, they also frequently get lucky or deus ex machina'ed out of trouble. In context a lot of this makes sense; several of them have literal gods watching out for them; but as I said, it just takes a lot of the tension out of things. You /know/ they won't get too hurt or killed.

I'm not too sure of Webb's political views (besides him being anti-Trump), but I meant more of his social views. Through his characters and the way the culture and cults are discussed, he is pretty clearly pro-homosexual relationships, pro-trans people, pro-feminism, anti-patriarchy, and anti-traditionalism. I think all of that is fine, and I think he's been doing well at showing times when it's /not/ ok (Basra's "relationship" with her subordinate is obviously cast negatively, and Shaathism's positive features are praised with Brother Ingvar), but I remember early on people were asking if there were any exclusive heterosexual romances because the homosexual or polyamorous ones seemed to take center stage. It was something that never bugged me, but it seemed to irk some other people.
