I definitely see your points, but I'd note that most of them are countered even by your own post.

1. "Woman good, man bad" you countered by pointing out that the Emperor is a positive masculine character (as is Darling, more or less). We get plenty of other positive male characters over time too, though they aren't "main" characters. Ruda's dad, Quentin Vex, Schwartz (who is definitely more of the socially awkward nerd than Gabriel, IMO), Professors Rafe and Yornharlt, Longshot McGraw, and my personal favorite, Joseph P. Jenkins. Just because the "main" nine characters are skewed female doesn't mean that men are universally portrayed as bad or that "good" men don't exist. Plenty do.
2. "Matriarchy good, patriarchy bad" you point out is due to the world building. And even then there are obvious counters to it. We have side stories about how the matriarchy of the Drow is stifling to males born into it, for example. Shaathism is definitely shown to be bad, but also is revealed to be a corrupted version of its original cult - and characters like Brother Ingvar are shown to be positive examples in spite of the cult's issues. And a central concern running across books is how the Avenist cult structure promotes abusers like Basra. In addition, despite it being a militant order, there's a lot of discussion about how it is NOT a modern fighting force on par with other global powers; most of its reputation being based on its past victories. So again, it might be simple to declare that matriarchy is good and patriarchy is bad, but the actual details show it to be much more complex than that.
3. "Demonization of male sexuality" happens in the examples you gave, but as you point out - Basra is a counter to that. And I'd argue that she's absolutely reviled by both the characters in the story and the readers. Shook is bad too, but Vandro is shown as being more nuanced. But another counter example would be the dryads; Juniper's origin story has her raping and then cannibalizing her first human lover. And Gabe himself has to fend off advances by Vidius's cult leader, who wants him not for himself but because he's taboo - much younger, a demonblood, and the first Hand of Vidius. Like the last two points, it's easy to make blanket claims, but they are not actually accurate.

So while I do agree with the examples you've provided, I think you're disregarding counter examples. The story is so big that it has a bit of everything in it. You could argue it's not representative of our culture, and I'd agree. But even if it started as more black and white, as the story's progressed all three of those examples are increasingly grey.
