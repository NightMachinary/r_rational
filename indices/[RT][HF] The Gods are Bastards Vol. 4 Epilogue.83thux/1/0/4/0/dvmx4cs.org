I seem to recall it mostly being from a monthly recommendation thread a while ago... ah, [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5bay45/monthly_recommendation_thread/d9n5ing/][here's the complaint from when TGAB was recommended in the monthly thread back in 2016]]. I disagree with his complaints, but the response was more highly rated than the original recommendation, which to me seems to imply that he's not alone in his opinions. In addition, I regularly read the comments after new chapters are released. I seem to recall some amount of criticism of some of the themes there, although I can't think of anything specific recently.
