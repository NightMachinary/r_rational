Can you please expand on your third point, or perhaps link to some of peoples' complaints. I'm not quite sure what agenda people think is being pushed by the story. In particular, what do you mean by "very progressive"? I don't think any of the characters or factions are any where near as "progressive" as, for example, The Culture from Iain Banks' books.

It's fairly common in science fiction and fantasy to describe an alien world and explore the societal consequences of how it differs from our own, even if that isn't the main focus of the story. TGaB does this in more ways than I can easily count, but I don't think I would call it "pushing an agenda".

In my opinion, the main principle that should be respected is the self-consistency of the universe. This serves for the societal aspects of the story (is it plausible that everything functions as described, and are the changes taking place realistic consequences thereof?) as well as the backstory (is it plausible, given the rest of the story, that the elder gods were a bunch of nerds who, for example, had their guards fight mock-lightsaber battles with one another and decided to make their own elves?).

Also, apropos the plot armour, I forget the details but I believe it was heavily implied that Araneid will be fucking around with time in the future, and many of the characters will be needed to be present for some events that Araneid is manipulating.

There are certainly valid stylistic criticisms against the plot armour and very-nearly-immersion-breaking watching of star wars films in underground elder god bases, but these sorts of things do not, I think, compromise the work's self-consistency.
