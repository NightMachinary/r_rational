Could be more refined but amusing enought.

Anyway that's something i thought about. People argue all the time of good vs evil AI. What about an apathetic one? Wanting to do things is the Product of our evolution : immobility = death. AI wouldn't have that problem. Imho even who says we shouldn't antrophomorphize AI does it himself too. The reason is simple : we are the only instance of intelligence, so we naturally assume that something should and will be in common, at least on lower levels.

Ps: i'm an IA fan
