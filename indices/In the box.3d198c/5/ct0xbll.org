Hmm. . . either that's rampant anthropomorphization by someone who doesn't understand the subject matter, a catastrophic failure in goal structure, an insultingly deceptive front by something with incompatible values (which if so I'd be interested in the sequel, after this is rewritten to include any clues that actually lead to this hypothesis), an unflattering criticism by inversion of "Boxed In" or a troll's post.

*Edit:* Or I could have been completely asshatish in my initial response because I didn't get it as good comedy. Though I do find the idea still a little too stoner-ish to swallow.
