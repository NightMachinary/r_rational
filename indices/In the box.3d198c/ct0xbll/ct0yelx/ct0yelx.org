Whoah, really?

I just came up with a premise "AI is being too lazy to come out of the box", you know, instead of being an intimidating superintelligence it is like a lazy, pizza-eating, x-box-playing frat guy, and thought it was funny.

It's not a rationalist story, but it's about AI, and I thought it is amusing, so I posted it.
