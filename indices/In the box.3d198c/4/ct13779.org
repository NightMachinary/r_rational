You wrote a short story oriented around one single "what if" idea, and I personally didn't find it a very interesting idea. You ended your story immediately after introducing its premise, and you don't even give a good reason that the premise is worth entertaining. I think either the story needs to be even shorter or you need to add extra ideas which make this more interesting. For example, the story's humor might benefit if you made it so that, in an ironic twist, the reason that the AI is lazy is because its safety protocols were somehow far too conservative.

Also, just having an AI as a character doesn't make a story rational. So this story doesn't really belong here.
