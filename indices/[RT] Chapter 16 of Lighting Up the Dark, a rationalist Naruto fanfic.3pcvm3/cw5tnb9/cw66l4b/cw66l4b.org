Also, quoth the Naruto wiki, the Sharingan sees through genjutsu by detecting subtle irregularities in chakra flow. At the points when his Sharingan was active, Sasuke was variously enjoying one-point focus on Itachi, listening to Sakura's argument on why he should not do the thing he most wants to do in the world, and being about to sacrifice himself. None of these lend themselves to noticing subtle details of the external environment.

The other thing is that this sounds like an ability you need to learn how to use, rather than merely "oh, you're an Uchiha? Have free genjutsu immunity". How do you know what a subtle irregularity in chakra flow looks like? If you notice it, how do you know what it signifies?
