  Yet in standard Naruto, Itachi killed his whole clan on Konoha orders. Being a killer of your own clan has got to be at least as damaging for your self-identification, and it was still expected of him.

I wouldn't consider Itachi representative of anything, since he is a prodigy in every conceivable way including ability, duty and ethics (his one weak point being the truly idiotic way he handled leaving Sasuke). Likewise, IIRC the orders were mostly Danzō's work, and there's no reason to believe that Danzō cared what would become of Itachi long-term.

  Although it would be interesting to see someone refuse to sacrifice themselves, based on rationality, and fail the test simply because they are smarter than the test writer, something that happens to children in real life too.

I think this is most likely what would happen. As in a regular army, I imagine that a low-rank soldier acting against orders because they thought they knew better would be condemned even if they were right.

I suppose that in a /smart/ army, they would be punished, and then quietly promoted at a later date.
