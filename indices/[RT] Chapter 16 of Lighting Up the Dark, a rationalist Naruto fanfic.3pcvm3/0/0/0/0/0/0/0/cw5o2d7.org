I think that's fighting the hypothetical. Assume that the superior just told the soldier that order and didn't give him any more information, not even nonverbal information such as pointing.

The key idea is that the order /inherently/ contains a demand for observation and interpretation. Not only is it not disobeying orders, it isn't second-guessing your superior either. You're not thinking "my superior asked for X, but if he had known what I had known he wouldn't have asked for X" . You're doing exactly what was asked of you.

And the test is supposed to test that the ninjas will sacrifice themselves when appropriate. The test writers are not telling them what situations are appropriate; it's something they require the test takers to figure out for themselves. A test-taker who correctly figures out that sacrifice is not appropriate therefore has passed the test. It's stupid to pass someone who sacrifices himself when inappropriate and fail someone who only sacrifices himself when appropriate.

(If a ninja is told to deliver 2+2 shurikens, and the person asking believes that 2+2=5, but doesn't indicate that belief in any way, is the ninja second-guessng his superior if he only delivers 4?)
