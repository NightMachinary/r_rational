  I think a lot of people, while preferring survival over dying, would also have a strong aversion to the idea of living the rest of their lives with a self-identification as someone who sacrifices lots of innocents in order to preserve their own life.

Yet in standard Naruto, Itachi killed his whole clan on Konoha orders. Being a killer of your own clan has got to be at least as damaging for your self-identification, and it was still expected of him.

  And in the moment where he is forced to decide between self-sacrifice and survival, he is in no position to analyse the situation on that abstract a level.

True, but while that makes Naruto's decision /a/ right decision (since it's the best that can be expected from him given the circumstances), it doesn't make that decision the /only right one/. Does the grading guide for the test say "oh, also pass anyone who refuses to sacrifice themselves but gives a rational reason why that refusal helps the village"? I guess that's possible, since we haven't seen the grading process yet, but that would make this fanfic very unusual compared to pretty much every piece of media that contains such a test.

Although it would be interesting to see someone refuse to sacrifice themselves, based on rationality, and fail the test simply because they are smarter than the test writer, something that happens to children in real life too. Incidentally, this also shows the folly of having a test that you can fail based on a single question; that's pretty much always a bad idea because someone's performance on that test can be affected by unpredictable factors.

(Then we could have Naruto thinking that having to sacrifice himself is not a test because if it was a test, it's obviously a poorly designed one....)
