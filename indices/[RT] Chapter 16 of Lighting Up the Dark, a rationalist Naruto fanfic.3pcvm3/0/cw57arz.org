I am reminded of an episode of Merlin where Arthur "passes a test" by showing that he is willing to sacrifice himself by choosing to take both cups (one of which is poisoned) in order to save Merlin.

My reaction to this was "wait a minute, Arthur is a potential king, and is extremely valuable to the country. Merlin is at this point a nobody. I could just as easily argue that Arthur is making the /wrong/ decision by deciding to die honorably rather than sacrifice his honor to benefit his country (by not killing off a king).

If Naruto is exceptional, he could legitimately claim that he'd be better off saving himself rather than saving multiple bystanders. And he has every reason to believe that he is exceptional; he knows he's very intelligent and he has the fox inside him.

(Of course, deciding to save himself instead of other people is very prone to motivated reasoning, but it's not inherently motivated reasoning under all circumstances to believe that you are more valuable to the village than other people.)

Naruto could also reason that sacrificing himself is harmful to his team and that since he is supposed to be especially devoted to his team, he should save himself. In fact, if the loss of efficiency from making his team get another member up to speed is large enough to statistically cause the team to fail to save enough people, it may be a better idea, period.

(Also, you'd think Naruto would figure out that this is a genjutsu, even though it's harder for him to figure it out than for us. Since sacrificing himself to take out the threat would prove that he has the traits that ninjas would obviously test for, having it turn up at just the right time is unlikely if real but likely in a simulation. So he's in a simulation. I am reminded of a sci-fi story where a character is given a lecture about how unlikely it is for a meteor to hit the spaceship, but what to do if it happens. All of a sudden it's announced that a meteor has hit the ship. He stays in his seat on the grounds that if having a meteor hit the ship is unlikely, having it hit the ship right when they would test people's knowledge of meteors is doubly unlikely.)
