Thanks for the criticism. I think I skimp on the scene-setting as overcompensation for the opposite - spending too much time on detail that slows down the plot and is more interesting to the author than the reader. Anyone who's into their worldbuilding constantly runs that risk. That and I'm probably in a rush to get to the parts I most want to write.

As for character viewpoints shifting, that one's trickier and I'll have to think about it.
