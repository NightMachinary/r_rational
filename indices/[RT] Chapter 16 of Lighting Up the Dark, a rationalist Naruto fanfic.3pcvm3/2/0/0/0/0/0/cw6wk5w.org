  Why would this be easier than letting some civilian handle all of that bureaucratic mess for them?

Two reasons. First, the Daimyo have different priorities. They may choose policies that indirectly go against the interests of the ninja (say, heavy investment in vocational training that ends up reducing the number of potential new ninja). And attempting to enforce fine-grained policy control just with the threat of assassination is inconvenient to say the least.

Second, the Daimyo may not be competent. We know the Wind Country one isn't, and frankly none of the others strike me as cunning, resourceful leaders either (the Fire one just makes me think of a placid turkey).

With direct control over the government, ninja can choose to appoint competent proxies who serve their needs without the need for threats.

There's also the "full resources" thing. As it stands, ninja get what the Daimyo gives them, plus what they earn from missions or obtain through their own activities. A military dictatorship would be in control of the country's full resources and able to reallocate them however it wishes.

  Why are you assuming that the ability to perform landscape redecoration makes you more powerful than the most capable politician in your entire country?

Again, it's a big assumption that the Daimyo must be "the most capable". Rationalist fiction does not preclude things like hereditary rulership in a medieval society. If it did, you'd end up having to redesign human civilisation from the ground up to remove all the daft bits.

Even if he were, capability only goes so far. The Daimyo has no leverage over a group capable of landscape redecoration - he has nothing they cannot take, he has no allies that can threaten them, and if he uses his position to deny them legitimacy, they will simply turn around and remove him in a formal coup.

The only option that springs to mind is a large, powerful standing army loyal to the Daimyo alone. But even that won't work in a realistic setting. The ninja are naturals at spying, assassination and guerrilla warfare, and they operate from within a vast forest with a base hidden enough to avoid detection from /other ninja/. They can outmanoeuvre any conventional army, and cause it to disintegrate by eliminating the chain of command.

Edit: hm, some more text just appeared in your comment.

  You can fix this by saying that the Daimyo has his own personal ninja army that is loyal to him and him alone, which is not too far from canon given the existence of the Land of Fire's 12 ninja daimyo bodyguard (who even tried to stage a coup against the Hokage if I recall)

This, of course, runs into its own problems. For example, where does he recruit his elite ninja bodyguard? Is it from the village he needs protection from? Or worse, from another country's ninja village? Are they trained outside any village, and if so, how can they hope to stand up to professionals with generations of expertise behind them?
