  Two reasons. First, the Daimyo have different priorities. They may choose policies that indirectly go against the interests of the ninja (say, heavy investment in vocational training that ends up reducing the number of potential new ninja). And attempting to enforce fine-grained policy control just with the threat of assassination is inconvenient to say the least.

It's not optimal, sure, but neither is having to do it all yourself. If you had to choose between becoming the dictator of a country yourself, or being paid to lead the military, which would you prefer? I think the latter would be a nicer job, myself. It makes sense if you think of the Daimyo as a figurehead, and given the fact that Danzo at least mind-controlls the Daimyo with Koto-amatsukami, that's not an unfair assumption.

Yes, the wind daimyo and people being incompetent is a valid counter argument. But in a rationalist fic there's nothing stopping you from just boosting people's rationality until this is no longer a problem.

  This, of course, runs into its own problems. For example, where does he recruit his elite ninja bodyguard? Is it from the village he needs protection from? Or worse, from another country's ninja village? Are they trained outside any village, and if so, how can they hope to stand up to professionals with generations of expertise behind them?

Primarily from their own ninja village, I would think. But why would this be an issue? The Hokage also depends on his own ninja to not kill him.

I feel like you're arguing this by looking at the Naruto world and pointing out all the things that are nonsensical, while forgetting that you can do the exact same thing with the real world. In the US, congress is run by incredibly insane/incompetent people with an approval rating of approximately 2 (two people, that is), and yet they maintain power over the military despite not having any military ability themselves. Any ninja from the Naruto world would find that completely unbelievable if they read about it in a story. They would throw away the book in disgust and mock the author for writing something so patently unrealistic.
