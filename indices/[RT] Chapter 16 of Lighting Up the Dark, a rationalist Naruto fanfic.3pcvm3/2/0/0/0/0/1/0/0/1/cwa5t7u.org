I think that the comments in that thread cumulatively resolved that:

- A mission is normally carried out by a team of 4 so you need to divide by 4 to find out how much money the ninja actually gets from one.
- The village probably takes a big cut of the gross in taxes (rebuilding villages is really expensive)
- It is unlikely there are enough D rank missions for a ninja to be able to do a constant stream of them, and available statistics show /orders of magnitude/ fewer missions than 200 a year
- It is not true that low rank missions all take a day or less
- Even if 1 ryo = 10 yen or 10 cents, the value of 10 yen or 10 cents depends on cost of living and isn't constant (and Tokyo has one of the highest costs of living of anywhere, so thinking "what would 10 cents buy me in an average US state" would lead you to overestimate how rich ninjas are)
