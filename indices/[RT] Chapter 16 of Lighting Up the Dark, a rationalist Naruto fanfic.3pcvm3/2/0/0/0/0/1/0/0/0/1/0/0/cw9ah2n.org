  How many thousands of years did China have gunpowder and rockets without turning them into guns?
#+end_quote

Not really relevant. Ancient China was a bunch of uneducated farmers with rudimentary technology, whereas the Elemental Nations feature civilians with motorboats, refrigerators, and cell phones. That implies a really impressive level of mass education, technical sophistication, and mass production ability.

Militarily effective guns are easy to make if you have access to a machine shop and some decent explosive material for the propellant. The Elemental Nations definitely have access to the former. The only reason they don't have access to the latter is "because Kishimoto says so." As soon as you posit a rational EN, that excuse goes out the window. Suddenly there are explosives and therefore there are guns.

  Irrigation or swift construction of mud houses is not enough to get you out of a military race to the bottom.

Point of order: although those are called 'Earth whatever', the pictures show that some of them are actually stone. Hardly mud houses.

Primary point: The real world has somehow been neither a military race to the bottom, nor a single mass war for all of history. In fact, many times it's been the countries that focused on civil and political development that out-bred the military ones. Look at Rome -- it's debatable exactly why they were so successful, but some candidate reasons are:

- Religiously and politically tolerant, so people and even nations frequently petitioned to join
- Science and technology development were rewarded
- Excellent road network, allowing for fast movement of trade and ideas. [1]
- Excellent health and hygiene, greatly reducing deaths to plague

They also had some kick-ass soldiers, but so did the Persians and various other nations. Despite all sides having strong military they were not all locked in constant war.

[1] The Roman roads were de iure military (built to allow rapid movement of soldiers) but de facto civilian as they were used far more often by civilians than soldiers.
