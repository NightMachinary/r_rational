  It would be much easier for them to function as a military dictatorship that controls the entire country and its resources, with the same bureaucratic toolset as the one currently used by the Daimyo.

Why would this be easier than letting some civilian handle all of that bureaucratic mess for them? As long as the Daimyo /knows/ that they will be assassinated if they mess up, everything works out perfectly for the ninja. They get paid just for existing! Oh sure, gennin have to do worthless missions for PR purposes/to build character, but they're only gennin.

Of course this breaks down for the Wind Daimyo, who indeed would have been assassinated instantly... unless, of course, he's powerful in his own right. This is a rationalist fiction. Why are you assuming that the ability to perform landscape redecoration makes you more powerful than the most capable politician in your entire country? You can fix this by saying that the Daimyo has his own personal ninja army that is loyal to him and him alone, which is not too far from canon given the existence of the Land of Fire's 12 ninja daimyo bodyguard (who even tried to stage a coup against the Hokage if I recall)

No, the /real/ problem with Naruto canon is the fact that a few individuals have the power to destroy entire armies. There isn't even any point in having armies if that is the case. But if you even things out a little, everything else can be made to work.
