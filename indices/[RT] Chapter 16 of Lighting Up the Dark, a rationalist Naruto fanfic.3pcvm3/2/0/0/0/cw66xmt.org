There are a couple of problems with this perspective. First, the ninja of any given country are its most powerful military force, and can assassinate any civilian leader as easy as breathing. It would be much easier for them to function as a military dictatorship that controls the entire country and its resources, with the same bureaucratic toolset as the one currently used by the Daimyo.

Second, if the military exists to exploit the civilian population, they are terribly inefficient about it. They obtain money from "ninja missions" and the civilian government rather than direct taxation. They limit their resource and recruitment pool to the contents of their one village. They rely on independent civilian traders to ensure that the village has the non-military resources they want, including any luxuries they may wish to enjoy during their time off. They submit to oversight from an authority that isn't competent in their area of activity (see Sand having to revise their entire recruitment and training policy after the Wind Country Daimyo cuts their budget). They do not benefit from any greater rights than the civilian populace, not even shopping discounts. And so on.
