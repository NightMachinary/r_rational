I am fully aware that I'm fighting a losing battle here, but...

The first village to stop with the bullshit missions and dedicate all resources to war preparations is going to be seen as both a heretic and a threat by all the other villages, which would have every reason to band together to destroy it. It was emphasised back when Hashirama was advocating for the village system that no village can withstand a coalition of the others.

In regard to system stability, it is worth acknowledging the significant role of belief in impeding optimisation. How long did it take for humanity to twig that 50% of its population could be employed in the full range of industry and research, rather than confined to housekeeping or "women's jobs"?

  We're talking about the same people, who raise child soldiers to die following the orders of the village as a matter of course, right? Conscious choice of moral ideals over practicality seems right up these guys' alley.

Here you're judging them according to 21st century Western morality. For the majority of human history, children were expected to do the same jobs as adults as and when their physical and mental development allowed. In many societies (primitive ones are the most obvious example), being ready to fight for the tribe would be a central rite of passage, and would thus be undertaken by children in order to be acknowledged as adults. In the Narutoverse, children are fully capable of serving as effective ninja at twelve, and it probably seems strange to deny them the chance to use their skills for the good of the village.
