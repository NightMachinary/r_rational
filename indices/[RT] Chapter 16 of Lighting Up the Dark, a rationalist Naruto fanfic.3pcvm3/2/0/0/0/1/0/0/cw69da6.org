That's a classic race to the bottom, though, isn't it? The first village (or a coalition of clans within a village) to permanently stop with the bullshit missions and dedicate all the resources to war preparations is going to out-compete everyone else. Then someone else will follow suit, lest they be annihilated, and so on.

The system is not stable in the least, and, given that we're talking about ninjas here, someone would have jumped down the slippery slope long ago. The threat of mutual annihilation in Elemental Nations is supposed to be realised by each village having a biju on hand. And yet that doesn't stop world wars from happening every generation. Some measly tradition of waiting for civilians to come begging for protection, instead of simply taxing them, is not going to stop these people.

  But if you look at it as a conscious choice of moral ideals over practicality, it might just be believable.

We're talking about the same people, who raise child soldiers to die following the orders of the village as a matter of course, right? Conscious choice of moral ideals over practicality seems right up these guys' alley.
