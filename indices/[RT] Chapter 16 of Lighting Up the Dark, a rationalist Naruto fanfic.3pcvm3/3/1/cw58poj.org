No. It's pretty obviously a test, though not certainly- but i wouldn't make my test a genjutsu- too easy to have countermeasures. I'd make it look far more dangerous than it is, instead- assuming this is a simulation. I'd think someone would break the genjutsu, and change the test accordingly. instead, it's a technique that isn't dangerous, though it looks identical to one that is- or the civilians are trained ninja- or something like that. I could be wrong.
