Actually, that's only the case if Genin have no way to dispel genjutsu. IIRC (and I'm ruling it for the smart!Narutoverse even if I'm wrong), Genin know the Dispelling Technique because all it is is a targeted burst of chakra. Thus, if a Genin /realises/ that they're in a genjutsu, they should be able to get out of it. If they can't, then either they're not in a genjutsu, or the genjutsu is being cast by someone powerful, both of which are grounds for a serious response.

I also think that any would-be ninja who goes "there's a non-trivial chance that I'm in the middle of a huge emergency, but I'm going to assume by default that I'm not" would not make it past whatever screening is necessary to reach the Genin Exam. If you can be disciplined enough to give your life for the village, you can be disciplined enough to act as if your decisions matter even when you think they might not.
