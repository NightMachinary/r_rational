  Does the grading guide for the test say "oh, also pass anyone who refuses to sacrifice themselves but gives a rational reason why that refusal helps the village"?

It must, because Gaara is still here.

You cannot expect me to believe that either a) Gaara is put into a scenario where he /could/ sacrifice himself or b) even if he was, that he would choose to do so.

That suspends my disbelief all over the floor.
