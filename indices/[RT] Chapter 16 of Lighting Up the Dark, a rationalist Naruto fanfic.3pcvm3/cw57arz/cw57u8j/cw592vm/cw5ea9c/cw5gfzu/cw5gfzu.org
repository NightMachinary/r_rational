  I imagine that a low-rank soldier acting against orders because they thought they knew better would be condemned even if they were right.

If the test consisted of a superior saying "sacrifice yourself", refusing to do so would be disobeying orders. But if the test consists of "sacrifice yourself when the circumstances are right" and the test writer mistakenly believed that the circumstances were right, but you know otherwise, refusing to sacrifice yourself would be /following/ orders, not disobeying them.

If your superior tells you "shoot the guy in the front", because he has bad vision and mistakes a tree for a soldier, shooting the actual front guy is not disobeying orders.
