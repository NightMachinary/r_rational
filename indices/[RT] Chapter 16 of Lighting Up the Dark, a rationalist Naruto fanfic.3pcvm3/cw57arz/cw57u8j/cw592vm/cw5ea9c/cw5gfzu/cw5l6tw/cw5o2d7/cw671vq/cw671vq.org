For what it's worth, the exact instructions given are "If some of your team have to sacrifice themselves so that the others can complete the evacuation, then you must be prepared to do so". It may be argued from this that having /everyone/ sacrifice themselves was stupid (if you cannot trust the remaining group of civilians to reach one more checkpoint on their own), but that's a separate issue.
