Ooh, detailed analysis.

In regard to the decision, I think there's an identity component as well as a utilitarian component. I think a lot of people, while preferring survival over dying, would also have a strong aversion to the idea of living the rest of their lives with a self-identification as someone who sacrifices lots of innocents in order to preserve their own life.

I see Naruto thinking "I am superior to these people in both moral and practical terms", but I don't see him thinking "I should let dozens of people die because my life is worth more than theirs", even if it's an objectively correct decision.

As for the genjutsu element, bear in mind that he doesn't know in advance that self-sacrifice will actually be necessary. He is bad both at losing and at modelling the possibility of loss against an unknown opponent. And in the moment where he is forced to decide between self-sacrifice and survival, he is in no position to analyse the situation on that abstract a level.

If anything, perhaps he should have seen through the genjutsu out of genre savviness, but that's a superpower that kicks in only erratically.
