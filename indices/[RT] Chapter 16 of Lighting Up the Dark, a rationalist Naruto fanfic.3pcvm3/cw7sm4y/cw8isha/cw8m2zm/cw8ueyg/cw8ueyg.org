There are several instances when the gag is being stretched for far too long (or can be even entirely cut out). For example the protagonist does something, and we get 3-5 bits of reactionary dialogue from the vague crowd; or that one part where a whole paragraph was dedicated to listing all the rumours that were circulating about the bridge battle post factum.

There were also scenes like the already mentioned bath one, where extremely unlikely events were happening in attempt to make the story funnier. Another such scene was how Naruto and Hinata not only fell on each other clich√© anime style, but also somehow kissed while doing that (and the whole section that followed with Naruto explaining the situation to a doctor as well).

  but by then the story had advanced too far to credibly do something about it

Eh, bringing the same HPMoR that you've mentioned earlier as an example, its author was prone to changing various parts of the story when the community was pointed out to him the problems. It, for example, would've been a much more crackier story with scenes like the ghost busters one left intact.

p.s. In A\N you've mentioned a literary summer program of sorts. Can you elaborate what it was about and how can I find similar\relevant cources\articles online?
