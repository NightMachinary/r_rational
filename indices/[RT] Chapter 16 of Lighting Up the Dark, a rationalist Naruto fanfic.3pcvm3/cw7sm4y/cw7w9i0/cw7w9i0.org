I don't remember the bathing scene, but the silliness remains throughout. I share your preference for rationalist fiction that takes itself more seriously: It's just harder to have rational solutions to problems when the story is not designed to be realistic, but an author writes what he wills.

(One story that does this really well is The Waves Arisen, which manages to almost seamlessly transition from silly to exciting to emotional and back again. I recommend it to you if you haven't read it already.)
