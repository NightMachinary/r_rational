I dropped this story at chapter 4 at the bath spying scene. For a supposedly rational fanfic the one in a thousand chance? of dispelling a transformation seemed way too much of a coincidence. Why was he naked anyways when the transformation was dispelled anyways? It never worked like that in the original story, it makes no sense. The entire scene was just comedic relief fluff.

My question is does it get better? Can anyone tell me if things get more serious and rational in the coming chapters. If your going to call your story rational it better be rational and not filled with comedic nonsense like this. You've already primed me for a rational story, which increases my expectations and as such I'm harder on the story when it betrays the expectations I've set. I'd love to know that this is a one time thing so I can continue reading.
