Before reading any of the comments, I'm putting my prediction-stake in the ground. Last chapter I was 60% confident that this was a test, now I'm up to 80%. Evidence:

- A member of Akatsuki...
- was injured to the point of death but not actually dead, yet no one was pursuing him...
- ignored a group of genin and civilians on first glance...
- when he finally did decide to attack, it was with a slow attack that would have been useless in a ninja battle.

This is a test. I'm just surprised they're bringing the civilians in on it, but I guess it makes a good drill.
