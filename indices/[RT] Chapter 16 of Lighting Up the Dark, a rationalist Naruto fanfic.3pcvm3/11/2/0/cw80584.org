Ah I didn't realize that he used the clone when he was naked, that makes sense then. That brings up the question of why didn't he make the clone when they were discussing the plan earlier, so it would have clothes. I am kind of against comedy in general (aside from black comedy) so that's mostly my bias. I just don't like unrealistic situations coming up so that jokes keep happening. The one in a thousand chance thing is in my mind sacrificing plot for comedy whereas I'd prefer if comedy happened along with the plot. In my mind it would be more interesting if the girls broke the clone and the transformation and then they tried to find out who was spying on them (which could lead to them suspecting the totally wrong person leading to more plot relevant comedy). But that's me.

I'll read some more chapters and tell you what I think. I will tell you that your story is well written, I'm just harsh when it comes to these things.

@Sophronius I've already read The Waves Arisen and loved it, thanks for the suggestion though.
