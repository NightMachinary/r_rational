In regard to the chapter you found objectionable: thousand to one chance, yes, guilty as charged (though, to clarify, that was the chance of breaking the transformation AND not breaking the clone, rather than just of breaking the transformation). Naruto's nakedness, on the other hand, is entirely logical and does not break any kind of rationality. He was naked when he used the Shadow Clone Technique (what with being in a public bath and all), so his clones are also naked in their non-transformed forms.

As for the fic in general, yes, things do get more serious overall. No, this does not mean there is no more comedy. I firmly believe that comedy can belong in any kind of fiction as long as it is done properly. I've never heard anyone say HPMOR was not a rational fic because it had comedy scenes.

As for whether this fic becomes more rational, that's not something I'm in a position to judge.

If you want to take another look, try the next arc, Chapters 4 to 8 (you actually dropped it at 3). It's more serious, though not without humour, and I think more representative of the feel of the rest of the story than the first 3 chapters are.
