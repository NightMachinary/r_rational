The bath scene is a fairly egregious example, I suppose. It also has the problem of Sakura and Ino hospitalising a fellow ninja with no ill consequences - I was kicking myself when readers pointed it out, but by then the story had advanced too far to credibly do something about it.

Are there any other comedy scenes you can think of that could be cut without harm to the remaining story?
