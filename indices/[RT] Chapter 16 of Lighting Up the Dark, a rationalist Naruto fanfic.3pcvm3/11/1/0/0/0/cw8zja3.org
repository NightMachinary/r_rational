Thanks for the feedback.

  There are several instances when the gag is being stretched for far too long (or can be even entirely cut out). For example the protagonist does something, and we get 3-5 bits of reactionary dialogue from the vague crowd; or that one part where a whole paragraph was dedicated to listing all the rumours that were circulating about the bridge battle post factum.

I don't think a few lines or a paragraph of humour is a problem as long as it does not undermine the feel or flow of the current scene, and does not cause problems for the story like the bath scene did. Tastes will differ, of course.

  Eh, bringing the same HPMoR that you've mentioned earlier as an example, its author was prone to changing various parts of the story when the community was pointed out to him the problems. It, for example, would've been a much more crackier story with scenes like the ghost busters one left intact.

I'm /really/ uncomfortable with that kind of retcon. As a reader, I hate the idea of having a version of the story in my head, only to subsequently discover that it no longer exists and I must either systematically update my thoughts, impressions and reactions to the new version, or be permanently out of sync with that story's "canon". Maybe there are times when it's the best thing for the story, but I'd prefer to save it as the absolute last of last resorts. (also, for all the flaws of the bath scene, the hospitalisation contingent upon it does contribute to the story in important ways, by affirming Naruto's hitherto unseen bonds with the people around him, and setting up for his further relationship with Hinata, so I can't just go back and cut it out)

  p.s. In A\N you've mentioned a literary summer program of sorts. Can you elaborate what it was about and how can I find similar\relevant cources\articles online?

The course I attended was [[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/european/about-us/use-your-language-use-your-english/summer-school-2013][this one]]. It was actually a course for literary translators, and involved group translation of set texts with in-depth discussion (as well as lectures and other useful events). If you happen to be a translator working in the UK, and can find next year's version of this course, I would certainly recommend it, but otherwise I'm afraid I can be of no help in this respect.

In terms of other writing resources I've seen recently, the only one that springs to mind is [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Eliezer Yudkowsky's essays]], which you're probably already aware of. Sorry I can't be of more help.
