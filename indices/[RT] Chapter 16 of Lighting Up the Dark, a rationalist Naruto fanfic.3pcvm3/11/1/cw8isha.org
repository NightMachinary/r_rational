  It never worked like that in the original story, it makes no sense. The entire scene was just comedic relief fluff.

I was trying to wrap this same complain into a form of constructive criticism that would not sound insulting to the author. Too many stories that are being featured here suffer from this same thing: they start ok for the first several chapters, and then there are suddenly all these silly irrelevant “comedic relief” scenes that could be entirely cut out without any harm to the remaining story.
