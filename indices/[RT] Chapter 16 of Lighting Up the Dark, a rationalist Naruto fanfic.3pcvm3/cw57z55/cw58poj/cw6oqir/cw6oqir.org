Another point against a genjutsu:

Choosing a very unlikely but devastating event like a village invasion isn't well thought out. Suppose that a third of all applicants fail at this stage(we have many more applicants than final round contestors, so many have to be sorted out). Next time the village is invaded for real, many of the failed genin will think "Oh, this is just some big genjutsu again, let's just fuck around or sacrifice myself at the first possible moment."

Suddenly a big chunk of the villages genin are NOT helpful in the event of a real invasion.
