I'm curious, what's the justification for the "classic ninja running posture" in this particular AU? I think the real reasoning was that it's just easier to draw and animate, so it's a bit out of place in this otherwise rationalish world.

Also, great chapter, though it's very obviously a genjutsu, come on.
