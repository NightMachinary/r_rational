You're right, we've drifted a bit, also because I think I was partially arguing against AugSphere in the end there. I'll summarize my understanding of the matter instead of arguing:

The Leaf in canon is for a great deal self-centered and self-serving, with a good deal of corruption (danzo etc.) and with the Daimyo being portrayed as weak and mostly inconsequential. The ninja villagers literally never act on behalf of civilians unless they're being paid to do it, so I can't call them a military. On the other hand, the Leaf is also portrayed as mostly idealistic and wanting to protect civilians (much like they would want to protect children), but this is much less the case for other countries.
