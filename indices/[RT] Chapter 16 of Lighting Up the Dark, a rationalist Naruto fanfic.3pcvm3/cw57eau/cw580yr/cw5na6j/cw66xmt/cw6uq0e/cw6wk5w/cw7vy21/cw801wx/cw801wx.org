I think one or both of us are losing track of what we're disagreeing about here. My original point, vis-a-vis AugSphere, was that the Leaf military was a real military, because if it were a "bunch of murder-hobos" or a de facto dictatorship, it would be a very poor one. Are we still arguing about whether the Leaf military is plausibly a self-serving organisation that exerts indirect control over the government to its selfish benefit, or is it something else?

  Primarily from their own ninja village, I would think. But why would this be an issue? The Hokage also depends on his own ninja to not kill him.

Because the Hokage is trusting his Leaf ninja to serve the interests of Leaf. Under your theory, the Daimyo is trusting his Leaf ninja /not/ to serve the interests of Leaf, at least where they clash with his own.

  I feel like you're arguing this by looking at the Naruto world and pointing out all the things that are nonsensical, while forgetting that you can do the exact same thing with the real world.

This is the point that makes me think we're talking at cross-purposes. I've been giving examples why, based on Narutoverse canon, it is implausible that the ninja are completely self-serving and yet do not choose to assert direct control over the Fire Country government, and thus why we have to assume that Leaf is in fact a loyal military. It's not an exercise in pointing out the nonsensical elements of the Narutoverse for its own sake, but rather of elements that become nonsensical under the conditions of a certain hypothesis being true.

In regard to the Congress example, well, yes, there are nonsensical things aplenty in the real world. But we can't merely say "there is nonsense in the real world, therefore we should be free to accept a hypothesis that results in nonsense in the Narutoverse".
