And yet, only 16% approve of congress as a whole, and a whopping 75% express clear disapproval. I'm guessing this is a case of motivated reasoning: Nobody wants to admit that their own congressperson is terrible (in the same way that people defend their own crappy little band), yet everyone acknowledges that the end result is awful (in the same way that people admit crappy little bands in general are crap).

To be fair, a lot of politicians acknowledge that the political system is crap, for example the money-driven aspect of it, but not enough to actually change things (nobody is willing to actually stop begging for money).
