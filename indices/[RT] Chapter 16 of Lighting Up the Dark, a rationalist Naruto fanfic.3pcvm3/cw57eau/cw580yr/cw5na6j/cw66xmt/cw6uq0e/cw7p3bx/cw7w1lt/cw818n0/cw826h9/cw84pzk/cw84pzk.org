  On technology: Ok, yes, you're right, Naruto tech makes no sense. But I can still defend it a little bit: In a world where ninjas exist, there's less demand for weapons amongst the powers-that-be. In the roman empire, they invented the steam engine but never used it because they already had slaves, and when the calculator was invented the initial reaction was that there's no point because people can do math in their heads anyway. To add to this, going from "no modern weapons" to "modern weapons that can kill ninja effectively" takes several steps, which means that every intermediate invention will be regarded as useless much more quickly. So while Naruto tech levels are silly, it's not entirely baseless.

I can't agree with you here. Modern weapons are simply too useful outside of combat. Let's review:

- Explosives: clear a stump on your farm; cut through a ridge to build a road; logging; building demolition to clear the way for new construction
- Firearms: God's gift to hunting for all those rural types. Also, since the entire world seems to be full of bandits, merchants who can't afford / don't want to pay for ninja escorts will probably want to have some reasonable self-defense option. Also, the Daimyo might well fund it so that he can equip an army that has even a remote chance against ninja, just in case they ever try something.

Modern weaponry would develop for civilian purposes and later be adapted to combat against ninja.

    My understanding is the money gets paid from the customer to the Hokage's office and then a part of it is paid to the ninja in question -- basic taxation. All good, makes sense.
  #+end_example

  No, they are funded for a large part by the Daimyo, as evidenced by the Kazekage complaining about having his budget cut. In other words they get money from civilians for free, and then charge them again before they'll so much as lift a finger to help. Pretty sweet deal, and what you would expect from an entire village of godlings.

Okay. Doesn't really affect my point -- there is far more money to be made in the civilian economy than the military one. They can take their Daimyo budget and made more by irrigating fields etc.

    Storage seals 
  #+end_example

  Only certain ninja can create this, causing a limited supply, which means that only the most powerful people will have access to them: i.e. other ninja. Perfectly realistic.
#+end_quote

This was exactly my point. Give ninja some storage scrolls, have them use those scrolls to transport cargo. Although, since you bring it up, is it ever shown what the limiting factor is on making storage scrolls? My impression is that it's the time of the maker -- the materials are relatively cheap and available. Is that wrong? If not, storage scrolls should be a major export, especially if they can produce them in various sizes and maybe come up with a variant that only works a certain number of times..

  /EJ:/ There are jutsu which, e.g., create hundres of gallons of water in few seconds, or create elaborate structures. These could probably be used for irrigation and construction as well as face-stabbing.

  /S:/ Yes, but only elite ninja can do those
#+end_quote

Do you have a source on that? Because the wiki lists the [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Water_Release:_Wild_Water_Wave][Wild Water Wave]] and the [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Release:_Earth_Shore_Return][Earth Shore Return]] as a C-rank jutsu, up only one class from Academy level techniques like the [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Body_Flicker_Technique][Body Flicker aka Shunshin]]. Even [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Release:_Earth-Style_Rampart][Earth Style Rampart]] and [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Release%3A_Earth-Style_Wall][Earth Style Wall]] are only B-rank.

According to the wiki:

[[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/C-rank][C-rank]] techniques "[are typically] techniques intended for ninja of the chūnin level. C-rank techniques are often one of the first techniques a ninja will learn that require some amount of training."

[[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/B-rank][B-rank]] techniques "[are typically] techniques intended for ninja of the jōnin or chūnin level. B-rank techniques are typically useful and can be learned relatively easily with enough time"

Neither of those sound like they can be done only by elite ninja.
