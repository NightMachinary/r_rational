Tech levels. I have a whole screed about this in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/17/Team-Anko][chapter 17]] of Team Anko, but I'll cut and paste the most relevant bits here:

--------------

The tech level in the Naruto-verse is bizarre, and it's a big enough mess that I figure I better explain what I'm doing to make it make sense.

If you [...[[http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/8327][click this link]]...] you'll see part of an interview with Kishimoto (the creator of Naruto) where he states that /"Actually, the world of Naruto doesn't differ very much from our present time. TV, refrigerators and air conditioners exist in the world. The only exceptions are weapons and explosives, which I've decided to set in a much earlier era. That's why you don't see firearms."/

Among the things we do see are: TVs, VCRs, wireless headset radios, references to cell phones, computers, and satellite dishes. And yet, no firearms or non-chakra explosives.

This is baloney. Technology doesn't work like that; you can't drop out part of virtually every scientific field, wave your hands around, and say "well, no one thought of it." Even if you could, it wouldn't work: if you have satellites (for the satellite dishes) then you must have rockets. Rockets are effectively giant bombs that go off slowly, so if you have rockets then you have explosives. Even if you never got into space development and so you never came up with rocket fuel, if you understand science enough to build things like batteries for cell phones then you understand it enough to make high explosives.

In a world where ninja are a thing and go around intimidating and assassinating people, civilians are going to look for an equalizer, and if explosives are a thing then non-ninja are going to weaponize them for their own protection, so guns and explosives will exist. If guns and explosives exist, ninja would carry them---sure, jutsu and explosive tags let them do the same jobs without the equipment, but (a) there don't seem to be any jutsu with the same kind of range that a sniper rifle gives you, (b) guns don't require you to burn your own chakra, and (c) a chakra sensor ninja or those with various bloodlines can spot an explosive tag by its chakra signature. Landmines and IEDs have no chakra signature. Since sealing scrolls are a thing, there's no reason each ninja wouldn't be carrying an entire platoon's worth of heavy ordinance, just in case it was useful.

--------------

Then you run into issues with the economics. Start with the fact that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/19x2i5/basic_economics_in_the_narutoverse/][the currency doesn't make sense.]]

Move on to the issue of earnings. As far as I can tell, Konoha makes its living purely from the money from ninja missions. My understanding is the money gets paid from the customer to the Hokage's office and then a part of it is paid to the ninja in question -- basic taxation. All good, makes sense.

Here's the thing: you want to make money? There are better ways than getting a fraction of a percent of your population to get hired to kill people. Off the top of my head:

- Storage seals

These are little scrolls that work like portable holes. Put lots of stuff in them, it weighs no more the scroll itself. Ninja run ridiculously quickly -- I've seen estimates that some of the more powerful are traveling much faster than sound. How much money could you make just shipping goods around at high speed?

- Summoning

Ninja who have signed a summon contract can summon that kind of animal. (Toads, dogs, slugs, hawks...) You can choose the specific animal you want to summon (e.g. Gamabunta, Gamaichi, etc). If that animal isn't available, they can send another of their kind or a group in their place. Summons can carry gear. The animals can also [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Reverse_Summoning_Technique][summon their summoner]]. I can't find the reference right now, but my understanding is that when a summon is released it goes back to where it was.

Okay, great. We now have a teleportation system. Here's how:

1. Anko is in Konoha. She summons a snake (call him Bob) and leaves him there.
2. Anko goes to, e.g., the Fire Daimyo's court. She summons Bob, gives him a message, and unsummons him; he appears back in Konoha and gives the message to the Hokage. The Hokage wants to reply, so Bob summons Anko, gives her a message, and then she bamfs back to the Fire Daimyo's court.

This combines really well with the storage-seal cargo-transport mentioned above.

- Fuinjutsu traps

A storage seal can't store people, but a [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/F%C5%ABinjutsu_Trap][fuinjutsu trap]] can. Lovely! Now we can ship tons of people around using our summon-based messaging and cargo transport.

- Civilian missions

There are jutsu which, e.g., [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Water_Release:_Wild_Water_Wave][create hundres of gallons of water]] in few seconds, or [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Release:_Multiple_Earth-Style_Wall][create elaborate structures]]. These could probably be used for irrigation and construction as well as face-stabbing. How much does it cost to build a large office building or temple? Totally making up a number, let's call it 50 million ryo to pay for a crew of laborers for weeks or months. Suppose the Hokage said "Hey, for 5 million ryo we can have the outside of that up for you by tomorrow." A few million ryo is the price of an S-rank mission, which are incredibly dangerous and likely to kill some of those very expensive and hard-to-train ninja. Why do crazy hard missions when you could just build stuff?

Long story short: there's no reason Konoha should be making money from military missions. There is /way/ more money to be had in commerce.

This is all off the top of my head. Point is, nothing about the Naruto universe makes sense. Their economics are broken, their currency is broken, their politics are broken, their technology is broken, and so on and so on.

EDIT: Typos.
