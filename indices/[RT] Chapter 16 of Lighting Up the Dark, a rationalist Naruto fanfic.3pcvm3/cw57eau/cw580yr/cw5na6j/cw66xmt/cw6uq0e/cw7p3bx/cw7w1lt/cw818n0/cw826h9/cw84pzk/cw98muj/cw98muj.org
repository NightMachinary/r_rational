  I can't agree with you here. Modern weapons are simply too useful outside of combat. Let's review: Explosives: clear a stump on your farm; cut through a ridge to build a road; logging; building demolition to clear the way for new construction Firearms: God's gift to hunting for all those rural types.

Well, let's look at the historical evidence. How many thousands of years did China have gunpowder and rockets without turning them into guns? I'm not actually sure, but it was a really long time. So clearly it can happen (Yes gun technology was suppressed in order to keep the samurai dominant, but I imagine the exact same thing would happen in the Naruto world for the exact same reason)

  Okay. Doesn't really affect my point -- there is far more money to be made in the civilian economy than the military one. They can take their Daimyo budget and made more by irrigating fields etc.

But if we say that ninja get enough money to get whatever supplies from the civilians they need, what benefit does more money get them? Money is only as valuable as the things you can buy with it. The most valuable thing in the Naruto world is military power.: A country of ninja that spends time irrigating would get instantly crushed by its neighbor that spent its time practicing combat techniques instead. (I'm assuming here that you can't just turn any civilians into ninja) Of course every individual ninja would benefit from selling its services purely to enrich themselves, but that's why all the succesfull countries punish leaving the village without permission by death.

  Do you have a source on that? Because the wiki lists the Wild Water Wave and the Earth Shore Return as a C-rank jutsu

Fair enough. Creating a certain amount of water or earth walls seems like a pretty common ability. But the point I made above still stands I think: Irrigation or swift construction of mud houses is not enough to get you out of a military race to the bottom.
