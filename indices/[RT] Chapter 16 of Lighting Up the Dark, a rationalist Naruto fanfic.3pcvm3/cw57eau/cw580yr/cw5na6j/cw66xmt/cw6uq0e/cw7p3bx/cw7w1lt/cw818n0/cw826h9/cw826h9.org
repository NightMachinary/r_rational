Oh wow, you've thought about this. Fortunately, so have I :>

On technology: Ok, yes, you're right, Naruto tech makes no sense. But I can still defend it a little bit: In a world where ninjas exist, there's less demand for weapons amongst the powers-that-be. In the roman empire, they invented the steam engine but never used it because they already had slaves, and when the calculator was invented the initial reaction was that there's no point because people can do math in their heads anyway. To add to this, going from "no modern weapons" to "modern weapons that can kill ninja effectively" takes several steps, which means that every intermediate invention will be regarded as useless much more quickly. So while Naruto tech levels are silly, it's not /entirely/ baseless.

  My understanding is the money gets paid from the customer to the Hokage's office and then a part of it is paid to the ninja in question -- basic taxation. All good, makes sense.

No, they are funded for a large part by the Daimyo, as evidenced by the Kazekage complaining about having his budget cut. In other words they get money from civilians for free, and then charge them again before they'll so much as lift a finger to help. Pretty sweet deal, and what you would expect from an entire village of godlings.

  Storage seals Only certain ninja can create this, causing a limited supply, which means that only the most powerful people will have access to them: i.e. other ninja. Perfectly realistic.

  Summoning Fair, but to be honest summoning was always pretty vague. What does it mean to go back to your place of summoning, anyway? Is it the space you occupied before being summoned, or the natural place of your existence? But your argument works regardless.

  Fuinjutsu traps Pffff filler.

  There are jutsu which, e.g., create hundres of gallons of water in few seconds, or create elaborate structures. These could probably be used for irrigation and construction as well as face-stabbing.

Yes, but only elite ninja can do those, and those might be more valuable if employed to kill other elite ninja. And heck, who's to say that this isn't being done regardless? The great ninja villages have 5k-10k ninja each, but we never see that many. So it could well be the case that at any point of time 80% are away on 'missions' to do precisely this, and the story focuses on the rest.

Almost everything can be explained in such a way as to make the Naruto universe mostly work. Ok, tech levels have to be tweaked, but it's mostly workable. But a single ninja like Madara being able to single-handedly defeat every ninja army in the world at the same time?

Destroys any ordinary setting you might come up with.
