It gets worse when you realise that before the village era, clans apparently lived independently, and did not mix with ordinary people. So there's no historical precedent for them serving civilians either.

Here's one possibility: Hashirama wanted a village system to stop the clans fighting. The best way to stop the clans fighting is to give them a common goal, ideally a common goal that isn't a common enemy (since that just means you're fighting /different/ clans). Serving civilians is a common goal, and one which can absorb as much by way of resources and attention as you have to throw at it.

Perhaps the true purpose of the Kage is to preserve and further strengthen this tradition in order to maintain peace between the clans. Thus in Leaf you have Hashirama, who began the whole thing. Tobirama became Second Hokage pretty much by default, but shared Hashirama's goals. He then chose the (loosely speaking) pacifist Hiruzen over the warmonger Danz≈ç. Hiruzen then chose the pacifist Minato. It may be argued that along with strength, dedication to the village ideal is the prime requirement according to which a Kage chooses their successor.

Of course, then this noble plan runs into human nature, plus the generations of feuding and hatred haven't gone anywhere, and you get three Great Ninja Wars. But if you look at it as a conscious choice of moral ideals over practicality, it might just be believable.
