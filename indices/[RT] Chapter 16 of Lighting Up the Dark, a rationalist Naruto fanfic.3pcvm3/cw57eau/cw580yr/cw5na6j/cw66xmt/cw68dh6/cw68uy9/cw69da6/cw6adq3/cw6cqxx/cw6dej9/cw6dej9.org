Yeah, that's ridiculous. Any universe that follows that bit of canon would have to come up with a more rational explanation.

For example, perhaps the whole thing was set up by enemies of the Sand-Leaf alliance, who had Sand impoverished to the point where pillaging an easily accessible source of wealth was the only option - either seizing the opportunity to declare war on Leaf while the latter was vulnerable during the exam, or declaring war on their own country and becoming an enclave in hostile territory.
