Hey, really cool that you're writing again! And nice to see the plot picking up its pace again.

Though, if you would like some constructive criticism for the previous chapter especially: You could work on setting the scene/mood etc. more during scenes. Right now I'm getting the feeling that the story jumps a bit too much between scenes, making it feel disjointed. Esp. w.r.t. character viewpoints shifting (You should never show what's in anyone's head other than the viewpoint character, and it should always be clear who the viewpoint character is.) Just my two cents.

Anyway, I'm very interested in seeing where this is headed. Can you believe that the thought that all of this was a test didn't even cross my mind until after reading the comments? I must be tired...
