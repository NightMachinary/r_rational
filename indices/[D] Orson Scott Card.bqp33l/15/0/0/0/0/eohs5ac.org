#+begin_quote
  "Gay people molest children so shouldn't adopt," this would be a bigoted belief, yes?
#+end_quote

No. It depends on whether it is true or not. Also, since you are going with a Boolean that encompasses /all of a certain category of people/, the odds are almost certain to make it a 1. In which case it isn't.

Use rational skills here, man.

#+begin_quote
  If they justify this belief by saying "There are a lot of men who molest young boys," does this justification for their belief make it less bigoted?
#+end_quote

That depends on whether or not it is true. Again, due to your poor phrasing, it's almost an absolute certainty that your Boolean is a 1.

#+begin_quote
  because that doesn't change the classification of the belief as bigoted.
#+end_quote

But there's a bigger question here you will have to answer:

If a belief you call bigoted ends up being true, does that mean that it is still bigoted?

The answer to that one will honestly determine the path of the entire conversation, and it's kind of hard to get past it without wasting a lot of effort.

#+begin_quote
  but also for potential racism.
#+end_quote

Why, yes, you gave a striking example of this 'potential', and it uses logic not at all, merely feelings and opinions you have which differ from his.

#+begin_quote
  Prejudices of all kinds basically follow the same flawed epistemics
#+end_quote

You don't say.

#+begin_quote
  if someone shows signs of one kind of bigotry I'm certainly less surprised if they turn out to be bigoted in other ways too.
#+end_quote

Seems more like a sort of bias where you are more open to assuming the others are true because one has been confirmed...

#+begin_quote
  you're off the hook on not recognizing it
#+end_quote

Someday you'll learn that just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean they can't understand you. I doubt it will be today, or anytime soon.

#+begin_quote
  patterns of behavior that show him failing to distinguish truth from falsehood
#+end_quote

You don't say.

#+begin_quote
  the way I would expect someone who "hates the sin but loves the sinner" to do
#+end_quote

Interesting. Have you seen him being directly harmful toward said sinners, or has he been criticizing the sin? Cause it looks to me like he's been doing a lot of the latter, and some people simply assume that is the same as the former.

#+begin_quote
  Bringing up his worrying silence on the historic racism of his church doesn't fit my model of a Card who hates bigotry.
#+end_quote

It's like you openly admit your biases but don't care about them. Yes, he doesn't apologize enough /for you to be satisfied/. He's apparently going to be guilty until he makes you /feel better about it/ with the responses from him /that you want/.

Totally rational.

#+begin_quote
  Well, yes, according to many ex-Mormons
#+end_quote

"Many". Ahh, we're in 'data' territory now?

#+begin_quote
  I don't know how old you are, but if you don't think that's old enough to speak out against inequality,
#+end_quote

Again, he didn't meet /your/ standards of goodness, therefore he is evil. He did not work hard enough to convince you, personally, that his soul was pure from this stain that is on others, therefore he must be stained as well.

I swear, your line of thinking is /exactly/ religious. I'm sorry he didn't say whatever magic phrases you needed him to say for you to feel good about him.

Wait, no I'm not, I don't care.

#+begin_quote
  then we're operating on different expectations of people.
#+end_quote

That is clear. I don't require people to bow and kowtow to my beliefs and make proper obeisance in order to judge them worthy.

#+begin_quote
  Why do you care so little about his church's racism? His church that he thinks is infallible about gay people?
#+end_quote

One is racism. The other is not. *PICK ONE*. Which would you like answered?

I care little for its racism because I consider Mormons to be silly at best and heretics at worst and... more importantly... because they've fixed things and I don't consider them forever tainted by some 'original sin' of racism.

Most churches are against same-sex marriage. This is for the obvious reason that it directly goes against its tenets. This is also for the less-obvious reason that at the time most them originated, human lives were nasty, brutish, and short. Any society that didn't heavily factor into account the best ways to maximize its reproduction ceased to exist. If you really want to get into the depths of that topic, we can, but it's probably not best done here.

As they simply don't intend to have /church-sponsored/ marriages, and as same-sex marriages can be done /Just fine/ by the *GOVERNMENT*, totally ignoring religious institutions, this entire line of argument is a non-starter. If they decide, say, to start throwing same-sex couples off of rooftops or burning them at the stake, I will happily oppose them in various unfriendly ways. /Especially/ if some of those oppressed people are friends of mine.

#+begin_quote
  my point is if he did he should have said so
#+end_quote

This is something /you/ expect, if not outright /demand/ of him, lest you consider him guilty. I, on the other hand, believe in the concept of "Innocent until proven guilty", and the *best* you have to offer is an absence of said proof.

#+begin_quote
  might be racist?
#+end_quote

Might be. No, I don't stay up all night wondering if random people /might/ be racist.

If I did, with over 7 billion people on the Earth, I'd never get any sleep.

Even if he is /somehow/ racist, if he stays quiet, leaves it out of his writings, and doesn't actively hurt anyone, he's allowed to live his life how he chooses. I'm fairly sure this is /exactly/ the same view he has of the intimate relationships of same-sex couples in their own homes.

#+begin_quote
  You said X, I pointed out why X was wrong. I say X, you say Y, and Y is wrong!
#+end_quote

Not rebuttal.

#+begin_quote
  you don't CARE that OSC was incredibly insulting to Obama,
#+end_quote

He called him stupid. He called him the 'stupidest' on foreign policy. Is that all a President is? No?

Then hardly "incredibly insulting". I could call you incredibly stupid /right now/ and you probably wouldn't care, on account of it not being incredibly insulting, but maybe it /would/ rustle your jimmies.

#+begin_quote
  because you believe those insults were TRUE!
#+end_quote

If he is stupid, and it is true, is calling him stupid an insult?

We're back to the above problem I listed in this post. You seem to think so. I do not think the truth is an insult. You only take offense /because you disagree/.

#+begin_quote
  Nah, he also said he's a "black man who talks like a white man" and a bunch of other stuff that you totally read
#+end_quote

K... is this true? Did he say this, and do black men and white men tend to talk differently, on average, yes or no? Feel free to drag up more examples, because you're /finally/ doing your own dirty work for once.

#+begin_quote
  pretty much sounds like none of what you're saying here matters
#+end_quote

Must be nice to just dismiss what you don't agree with.

#+begin_quote
  It's not a really effective argument, you see?
#+end_quote

This would be true, had you not actually said that. Tell me, in your article, were you looking for the /weakest/ example you could find, or the /strongest/? Or were you just pulling at random?

#+begin_quote
  that you ignored the entire article I linked to
#+end_quote

You linked to more than one. Math, remember? X > 1 and all that?

#+begin_quote
  take this one line and spin a narrative about me and my intentions around it.
#+end_quote

A line that you said, a narrative that was true, and intentions that were fairly obvious and hamhanded. Do you deny you were trying to imply he was racist?

#+begin_quote
  that there was just one thing I was focusing on while ignoring all the other things I quoted?
#+end_quote

You mean the same cherry picking you are doing?

Shocker.

#+begin_quote
  Still no reply to that, so still waiting to see if you have the integrity to admit your mistake.
#+end_quote

Still waiting on you to admit your own. I imagine we will be waiting awhile.

#+begin_quote
  It's pretty simple, just admit that you shouldn't have said "One comment that the writer disagrees with" because there were more than one.
#+end_quote

Hey look, here's X> 1 again! Guess you'd better apologize for the one this is responding to, then. In fact, since it was first, I'll expect yours first if that's the game you want to play. I don't think you'll actually do it, of course, but hey, honesty.

#+begin_quote
  But are you sure you didn't expect different?
#+end_quote

No, that was sarcasm. I knew you were just another normal person. I should post quick YouTube clips or emojis or something so you can know the difference. (Meant in non-snarky way)

#+begin_quote
  Emotional turmoil. thundercrack
#+end_quote

Oh look, the "I'm rubber, your glue" thing you just called lame. Imagine my surprise at your hypocrisy. ;)

#+begin_quote
  there's a good chance things get less cordial from here and I'm sure you're actually a nice person in meatspace
#+end_quote

Nah, we're cool. If two somewhat-rational meatbags can't agree on some middle ground or method of understanding without turning into hostile murderhobos, then we probably shouldn't be on the internet or at least tip our fedoras and go our own ways.
