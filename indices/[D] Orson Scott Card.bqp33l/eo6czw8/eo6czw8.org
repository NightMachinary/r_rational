The connection here is pretty tenuous, but I figure enough people here are fans of Ender's Game that it might be well received. If anyone disagrees I'm happy to delete, but when I saw the post about r!Animorphs where a discussion about OSC's controversial beliefs was being had, I agreed with a lot that was said there but had a lot of my own thoughts, so I basically spent all day writing this and it got too big to just post as a comment. Thought it might generate interesting discussion.
