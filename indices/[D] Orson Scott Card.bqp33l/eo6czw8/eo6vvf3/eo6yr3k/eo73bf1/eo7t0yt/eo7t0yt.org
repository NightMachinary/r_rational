I don't see the fundamental difference, just a difference in the complexity and size of the belief system one has been raised in. Mormonism /entails/ racist beliefs, but also a lot of other things. Which are in fact significantly /crazier/, so if anything, they could warn you to the extreme frailty of the whole edifice (or wreck you with cognitive dissonance so thoroughly your brain becomes utterly incapable of rational thought by adulthood, I guess).
