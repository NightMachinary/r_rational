  But the magnitude of the mistake that Card makes in deciding that Mormonism is likely true because he can't imagine that someone could write the Book of Mormon, structurally and stylistically and in richness of content, as a hoax... is so irrational I would call it hostile to rationality.

The hilarious part to me is that he does this in several of his works, most recently (that I've read) in the Pathfinder trilogy where the world is /literally artificiality constructed and guided./ And the goal of the main characters is to find the truth, break out, and be free. I'd almost call it a 'cry for help' a la "closeted gays are the staunchest anti-gays" if I believed that sort of thing. It certainly is frustrating the mental roadblocks people can have.
