Yep. Too much credit, maybe, but unless it's a theme of the story I tend to think that characters like that are just expressing their own views.

Another example of this was the gay man in the Shadow series that was sad because he really wanted a family and ended up just gritting his teeth and having sex with women. I thought it was just a comment about how often gay people try their best to live hetero-normative lives and be happy in worlds that are often hostile to them, but now I think back on it with much more jaded perspective, despite technically it still being able to be read that way.
