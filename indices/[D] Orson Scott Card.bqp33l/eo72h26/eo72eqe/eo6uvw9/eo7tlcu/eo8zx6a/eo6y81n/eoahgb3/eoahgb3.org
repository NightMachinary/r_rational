  but it's easy to see racism in the depiction of the Calormen if you're open to seeing it.

It's hard to /not/ see it as racist, but perhaps it was Fair For Its Day as tvtropes would say.

The Horse and His Boy has a black girl as one of the two main characters and ends with an "interracial" marriage (Aravis is a Calormene and therefore black, Shasta is a white Archenlander).

In The Last Battle (IMO, a pretty awful book) one of the Calormenes is lauded as a good person and true servant of Aslan even though he had worshiped Tash in his life. The idea that because he had a good heart and did good deeds, he was saved even though he worshiped the "wrong" god.

Unfortunately I'm pretty sure those are the only positive portrayals of Calormenes in the series. Aravis has a friend who is an airhead but not a bad sort, but that doesn't count for much. Hmm, Susan was actually considering marrying the black Calormene prince until he turned out to be a dickwad - if it'd been a movie instead of a book, I bet it'd've been protested because of the depiction of a white woman being courted by a black man.
