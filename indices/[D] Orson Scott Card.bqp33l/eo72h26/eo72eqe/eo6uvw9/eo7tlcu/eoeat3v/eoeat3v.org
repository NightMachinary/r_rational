I agree with your comment but disagree with this example:

  e.g. the paranoia towards a tyrannical state that limits the number of children people can have

There was nothing that really framed the government as bad or evil in the book. It was just a feature of the futuristic society he was writing. If you had no idea what his politics were, I would be highly skeptical that you could pick that out as an actual paranoia of the writer's.
