Do you have opportunities to privately approach "elders" or "priests" or "whatever you have" with questions?

Would you consider asking them for their perspective on what happens to the church's attitude towards homosexual relationships in a world where children are born to two fathers or two mothers?

If you'd not consider asking such a thing, is it because "privately asking the priest/whatever about a personal crisis of faith" is a meme from Protestantism and/or Catholicism and isn't something done in the LDS church, or because you think you might be reprimanded for asking a question about /this subject in particular/ even if other questions would be welcomed, or because you're afraid you might get an answer that you feel in your gut is morally objectionable?
