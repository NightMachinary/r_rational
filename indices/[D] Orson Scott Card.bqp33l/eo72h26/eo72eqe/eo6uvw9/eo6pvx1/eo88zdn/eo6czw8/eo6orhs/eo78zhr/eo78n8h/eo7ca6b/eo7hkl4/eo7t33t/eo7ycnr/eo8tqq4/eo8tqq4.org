Sorry, there's like a framing issue here that I'm not sure we're going to get at without resetting the conversation a bit, because you keep saying what I said was beside the point whereas you're not hitting my crux at all, so we're clearly talking about two different things.

Let's go back to conflict theory vs mistake theory. I think Card is in Conflict Theory mode. I do not think he is seeking Truth, I do not think Truth on this topic concerns him: I think he has deep seated sacred beliefs (literally) that he is defending at all costs from those he believes will destroy something good and precious, and that attitude shifts his approach from one of clear sight to one of defensiveness and dismissiveness of anything that challenges his beliefs.

Without going into specifics of what exactly those beliefs are yet, do you agree with that much?
