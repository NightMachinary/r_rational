  Do you follow the Church's stance on homosexuality? (It's a sin to them and you can be kicked out for it.) Why or why not?

Are you asking whether I think that the church should hold that doctrine, or are you asking whether I think that, given the existence of the doctrine, it's reasonable for people to be excommunicated?

The latter should be fairly uncontroversial, I think. If you have irreconcilable differences of belief and practice with an organisation, naturally enough they may be unwilling to continue the association. That's not limited to this issue, nor to churches.

As to the former - gender and family go to the heart of our beliefs about the nature of heaven, and a relationship that excludes one of the genders and excludes the possibility of children cannot match the gold standard according to those beliefs. So yes, I think a homosexual lifestyle is a serious obstacle to eternal happiness.
