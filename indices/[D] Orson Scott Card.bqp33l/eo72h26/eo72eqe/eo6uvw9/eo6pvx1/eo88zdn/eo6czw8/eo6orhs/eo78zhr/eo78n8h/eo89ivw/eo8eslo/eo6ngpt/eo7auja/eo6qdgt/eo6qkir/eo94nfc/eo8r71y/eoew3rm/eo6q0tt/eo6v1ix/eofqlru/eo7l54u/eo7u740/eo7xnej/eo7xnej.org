If you go to a proper math course the first year they spend a lot of time speaking about set theory, how to define numbers, how to define addition and how to proof addition work the way they do. It IS an actually interesting question.

Now I believe the user above will not care for your answer one way or the other, but your answer of "this is below me to spend time to write about it" proofs his point of you actually unwilling to spend time on your assumptions.
