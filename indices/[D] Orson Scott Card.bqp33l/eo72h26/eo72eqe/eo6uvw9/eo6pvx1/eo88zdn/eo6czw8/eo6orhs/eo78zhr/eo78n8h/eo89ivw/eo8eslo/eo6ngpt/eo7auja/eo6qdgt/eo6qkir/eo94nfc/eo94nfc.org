This is a /very/ well done piece of propagandistic persuasion.

In the attempt to point out the biases of its target, stepping back for a moment and look at it, all it really accomplishes is confirming the biases of its writer.

The writer apparently went into this hoping to further understand someone he considered a "hero", only to realize that they held opposite opinions on some very key beliefs. The mental anguish of this discovery led to lashing out an accusing the person of insanity or mental degradation rather than accept the much more sane possibility that that person /did not believe the same as the writer did/. It's a simple truth of life that no human is perfect, and no person will completely agree with you on everything.

  “false beliefs about a specific demographic that knowingly disadvantage or cause harm to that demographic.”

This is the definition of 'bigotry' established by the writer. At no place is this established in relation to OSC. The closest thing to fulfilling the definition is pointing out that OSC thinks that same-sex marriage is a sin. This is not a false belief, it is in direct congruence with his religious beliefs. The belief is not even false in general terms, as all longstanding religions have the same tenet. OSC writing and working for his beliefs does not make them false. If one wants to take offense at the concept of 'sin', then one must follow a religion without such a concept or have no religion at all, in which case the proper response is "so what?"

OSC has expressed disagreements with things he does not believe in, and he has done it in ways less insulting than the original post.

  if you've spoken with bigots at all, they always have justifications for bigotry.
#+end_quote

All people have justifications for what they believe. Is the original writer implying that this is not the case? It must be strange to discover that other people might have rational reasons for their beliefs, but it should not be a surprise.

  So what were Card's views on black Mormons?
#+end_quote

I wondered how long it would take before the racist card would be played. About halfway through the article, it seems. The amusing part is that OSC doesn't much seem to care, but observe the written trickery that seems to accuse OSC of racism despite not showing racist tendencies.

It's about at the Obama portion that this entire thing falls apart, and it's right at the moment where *THIS* :

  While Card doesn't quite fit that pattern, and breaks from it entirely in some places, he made one that seems to run parallel to it in other places.
#+end_quote

Turns into *THIS*:

  Do I think he would have said that if Obama wasn't black?
#+end_quote

One comment that the writer disagrees with and falsely attributes to racism for OSC means that he is so, and thus also bigoted?

Yeah, no. I'm sorry, but just because the writer believes that Bush is more stupid than Obama, it doesn't mean that OSC disagreeing with him means OSC is a bigoted racist.

That's not rational. That's not even partially reasonable. THat's just... sad.

The entire piece follows a similar pattern, over and over, and it gets rather tiresome reading it. There is nothing direct, merely backhanded compliments that get torn down, and then indirect accusations that are not fully supported before moving on to the next. At least they are all tied together somewhat, with the implication that if enough of them are questionable then they must all be true, and thus OSC is a bad person.

I myself disagree with OSC on numerous points, but I'm not going to call him racist, bigot, toxic, or any of the other buzzwords that get thrown about nowadays. I am interested in the man's writings, not his politics, and I don't even agree with the mainstream that he's all that particularly amazing. Like Frank Herbert and "Dune", I consider his first work to be amazing and all the ones thereafter on a slow decline from that greatness, as if the most important concepts they had were put forth into a masterpiece that could not be equaled. But I see no need to accuse the man without basis, attack his beliefs, or attempt to imply he is something he is not.

The irony is that I rather enjoy the works done by the original writer here, and by reading this piece, I have just went through almost the exact same cycle of discovery that he went through with OSC. The well-done and extremely creative rational writings must now be forever separated from the beliefs and actions of the person who wrote them, as they are vastly contradictory. But I do not see him as an evil bigot or anything of the sort, just a man who believes differently. Ironically, this places him in the same company as OSC, and to use a recently overused quote: This does put a smile on my face.
