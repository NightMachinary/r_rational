GCU is an idiot (which word I feel entirely licensed to use since mods didn't object to their more direct insults in other threads) and a troll; scan back through their comments and it doesn't take long to see it. More damningly, they literally can't even tell what's going on; their summaries of what other people saying are consistently, overtly, indefensibly incorrect, and they couldn't pass an ITT if they had three weeks to study. /shrug emoji/
