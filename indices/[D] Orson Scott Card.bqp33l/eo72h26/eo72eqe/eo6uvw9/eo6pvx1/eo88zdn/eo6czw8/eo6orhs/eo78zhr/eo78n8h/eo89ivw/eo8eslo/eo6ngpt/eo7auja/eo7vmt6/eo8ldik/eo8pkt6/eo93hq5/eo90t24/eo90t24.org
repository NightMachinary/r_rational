  Do you just mean that they reconcile this by saying they both have the same perfect morality, so whatever one does, it makes moral sense that the other would do as well, or am I wrong about their beliefs?

Under Mormon doctrine they do have the same interchangeability of morality as you mention, but you're correct about the rejection of the trinity. The father, son, and holy spirit are considered separate individuals. It's easiest to consider those three as titles or offices; Mormons treat the father's given name as Elohim, and the son's given name as Jehovah, with the rank of "God" and the job description of "Father" and "Son", respectively.

Thus earth's existence has had Jehovah presiding over it as God in the world's longest on-the-job training, with Elohim only occasionally stepping in, such as when Jehovah was being a mortal, when directing the creation of the world, or when providing character references ("this is my beloved son").
