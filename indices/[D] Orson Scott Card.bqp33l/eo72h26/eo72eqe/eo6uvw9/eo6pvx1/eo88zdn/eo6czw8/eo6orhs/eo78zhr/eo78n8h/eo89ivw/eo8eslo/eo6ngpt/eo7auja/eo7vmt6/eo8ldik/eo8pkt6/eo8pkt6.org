  Mormonism squares this circle by claiming that Jesus is the same as Jehovah

Wait a minute here.

I thought that LDS explicitly rejected the idea of the Trinity (that YHWH the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three aspects of the same God rather than three distinct entities).

Do you just mean that they reconcile this by saying they both have the same perfect morality, so whatever one does, it makes moral sense that the other would do as well, or am I wrong about their beliefs?
