Where's the Middle Eastern DNA in the Native Americans?

/There isn't any./

What about the linguistic influence of their semitic language on the local languages?

/Nonexistent./

Where's /any/ evidence of this ancient Jewish civilization in Mesoamerica? We've got plenty of Mayan shit lying around, if there had /really/ been a Jewish civilization in fucking Honduras (or wherever the fuck) then we'd've found /something/, and there's /nothing/.

And what's with all the anachronisms in the Book of Mormon, animals and foods and whatnot that didn't exist in that area before Columbus "discovered" that area and trade started? And basic geographical mistakes? It's almost like it was /fabricated by a charleton/ who had never been there before and who knew that no one else he would ever encounter in his life would ever go there and who had no conception of a future where most people had access most of the time to the entirety of humanity's collective knowledge and all factual claims could be verified or refuted in a matter of seconds.
