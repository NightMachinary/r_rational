  I .. think you are reading more reasonableness into his position than exists.
#+end_quote

He elaborates enough on his position in the linked article for there to be no need of “reading more” into it.

  Imagine reading this: “Likewise, there are people who show a virulence in their hatred of black people that is obsessive, personal, and pathological, and I suppose racist could be regarded as the technical word for that.” You "suppose," OSC? How good of you. Just the "technical word," of course, which brings to mind "technically, but not actually."
#+end_quote

I think by replacing homophobia with racism you are cutting out the very reason for the hesitant tone of his admission. As some context / examples, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia#Criticism_of_meaning_and_purpose][here's Wikipedia's current take on the problems with the word “homophobia”,]] and here's [[https://www.conservapedia.com/Homophobia#Term_of_Insult_or_Manipulation][Conservapedia's,]] for the perspective.

  Faggot is a derogatory slur that has no meaning other than to degrade a sexual orientation. Other than cigarettes or bundles of sticks, it has literally no other use.
#+end_quote

That's incorrect but beside the point. Whether or not it has other uses is irrelevant, because the analogy he's talking about isn't about the background of the used words and about the manner and purpose of their usage. And “faggot” as a derogatory word can and is often used for the purposes highlighted in my previous comment.

  Homophobe is a label for a type of bigotry, no different than "racist" or "sexist." It has use as more than an insult; there is no other word to describe someone who yells "I'm going to kill you faggots!" at gay people.
#+end_quote

Which is again beside the point, since the genuine use of that word, one that isn't an ad hominem with washed out meaning, was not what he was talking about when he was drawing the analogy. You are missing the point, but I'm not sure how to rephrase my previous comment to better convey what I'm trying to say. Perhaps someone else will manage to articulate the thought better.

#+begin_quote
  If it shuts down a discussion he's been in, it's because that discussion was deemed unproductive and harmful by someone else, and if he disagrees with that, well, he's not really the one who gets to make that judgement.
#+end_quote

And now you're making baseless assumptions and trying to strip him of his agency without addressing his arguments themselves.
