The problem is you're talking at an object-level (religious and historical beliefs) and we're talking on a meta-level (why we believe what we believe). After a certain point it just doesn't do anything productive to keep arguing about specific things when there's a pattern of misaligned epistemics.

  But "I'm definitely right and you need to hurry up and agree with me," does not qualify. "You're wrong and I'm not going to bother saying where or how," is not a proper basis for discussion either.

It's not that. It's "You're demonstrably wrong and I don't want to continue this discussion until you put in more effort to falsify your own beliefs."

If you've ever argued with a flat-earther or evolution denier or conspiracy theorist, you should recognize where this sentiment comes from. People's time and energy are limited; we can't literally spoon-feed you the all the information that's needed to get you up to date on modern archaeology. Maybe some of us would still be willing to try if you showed sound epistemics, but as [[/u/somerando11]] said,

  Here's what really bothers me though, you seem really comfortable with saying things are unknowable and stopping there.
#+end_quote

I've observed the same thing. So has [[/u/elizabethrobinthales]]. Maybe we're all just assholes, or maybe that's just not rational thinking, and we're trying to point it out to you with varying degrees of niceness.

#+begin_quote
  To dismiss what I say because I'm not a professional archaeologist or historian, while making much more absolute and sweeping historical statements without presenting any credentials of one's own, is blatantly hypocritical.
#+end_quote

It's not, though. I know it feels that way from your perspective, but we're telling you /why/ we think you are wrong, we're just not telling you /how,/ because frankly it's a lot of work and there are like, a hundred resources on the internet that can probably do a better job. The fact that I've linked you to two of them and you presumably haven't tried to use them to answer these questions and uncertainties you have makes it really hard to think that further conversation with you on the object-level would be productive for anyone.

#+begin_quote
  And when someone makes it clear that simply because of my religious affiliation, s/he has no confidence in my honesty and integrity - what is the point of saying anything to such a person, who believes I'm systematically lying?
#+end_quote

You're making this about honesty and integrity and "lying," and it's none of that. It's really just about epistemics. You are not behaving like someone we model as /really actually interested in learning the truth./ You are behaving like someone who has /made up your mind/ on the issue without any firm ground to stand on, without even seeming curious about whether it's even possible to check your beliefs against reality... the way archaeologists and historians literally spend their lives doing.

There are things you could do that would change our minds about your perspective and the value of continuing the conversation on the object-level. I've suggested some. Insofar as you choose not to do those things... /shrugs/ Where we are is where we are.
