  I'm honestly curious: what were you expecting as a question?
#+end_quote

Some of your earlier questions were more on topic, and I felt like there was a more productive discussion there.

Still, I don't mind defending my beliefs to honest questioning or criticism or challenge. But "I'm definitely right and you need to hurry up and agree with me," does not qualify. "You're wrong and I'm not going to bother saying where or how," is not a proper basis for discussion either. To dismiss what I say because I'm not a professional archaeologist or historian, /while making much more absolute and sweeping historical statements/ without presenting any credentials of one's own, is blatantly hypocritical. And when someone makes it clear that simply because of my religious affiliation, s/he has no confidence in my honesty and integrity - what is the point of saying anything to such a person, who believes I'm systematically lying?
