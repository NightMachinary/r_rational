You raise a lot of good points, as does Scott, and I have actually read a lot of his articles criticizing SJWs; Radicalizing the Romanceless was my first exposure to the site. I'm a huge fan of his and his writing, but of all the things I agree with him on, his attitude and perspective on SJWs is the one I disagree with most; I honestly think he's often unaware of his own biases that lead to him missing the mark when he criticizes Leftists, and I think he recognized that a bit with his article on Conflict Theory vs Mistake Theory.

To address this topic specifically, let me expand on what I meant, and you let me know if we're more in agreement than it sounded.

My problem with IDW is not borne from ignoring the harms of PC culture: the reason I call them absurd and counterproductive is that they're fighting PC culture in the worst way I can think of. Maybe I'm wrong in that, but by making a tribe whose main identifier is being persecuted for unpopular ideas, and not of being rational or correct, they end up missing the mark rather often. The articles I linked to expand on this further, but Scott touches on it in his post too.

You know it's gotten bad when people in the IDW sometimes defend each other from attacks that are 100% deserved, like when Robin Hanson says something stupid and gets shouted at and others in IDW feel obliged to defend him, because an attack on one of them feels like an attack on all of them.

I guess I can sum up my position by saying something like, if the IDW cared more about pushing the overton window than pointing out how persecuted they feel, I think they would be more successful at pushing the overton window but less successful overall. This is related to Toxoplasma of Rage stuff that Scott touched on in that article you linked too.

I definitely agree with this:

  A movement can be popular and still be silenced at the same time. The famous and high status people are the ones who are able to speak their minds and get away unscathed. Most everyone else has to keep their mouths shut in public or face the consequences.

But my perception of IDW is that it's driven largely by the egos of those in it and so they can bash back against those who bash them, not ensuring that Joe Everyman can talk about gender differences at the water cooler.

I say this with varying applicability to each person. For example, Jordan Peterson is a good clinical psychologist and a hack at basically everything else he talks about. Sam Harris is amazing, and I think he deserves basically none of the yelling-at that he gets. Robin Hanson has a lot of interesting and sometimes good ideas, but he also says a lot of really stupid stuff, and he seems incapable of telling the difference, or putting in any effort to communicate his controversial ideas better. I haven't seen Eric Weinstein say anything that deserves condemnation or attacks, and indeed I'm not sure if he ever has been. Ben Shapiro is Ben fucking Shapiro, and if I have to go into the problems with him we'll be here all day.

(That's another thing: I think a lot of the problems these people face is not just because of the topics they want to talk about, but the way they talk about them, and by focusing on the way they're treated rather than examining what they said and why it got the reaction it did, I think they calcify. I'm actually writing a couple articles on this right now, hopefully I'll put them up soon)

  When someone's livelihood and reputation is put at stake over mere differences of opinion, even when those opinions arent prejudices, and the punishment is carried out without so much as a trial...

See, the rub here is whether or not it IS prejudice. As the comments here show, there can still be a lot of disagreement. But I definitely agree that the pendulum has in many places swung too far away from justified anger and more toward knee-jerk censorship.
