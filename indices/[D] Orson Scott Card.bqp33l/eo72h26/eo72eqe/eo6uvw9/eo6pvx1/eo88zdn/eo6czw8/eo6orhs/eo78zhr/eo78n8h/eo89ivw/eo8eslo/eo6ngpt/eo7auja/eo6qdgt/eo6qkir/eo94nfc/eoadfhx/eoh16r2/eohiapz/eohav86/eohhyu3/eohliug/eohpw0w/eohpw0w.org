  I didn't call him bigoted and I distinguished why, and the toxic thing was still 10 years ago.
#+end_quote

Are you saying that you no longer consider him toxic then and that your younger self was incorrect?

#+begin_quote
  I implied he might be because it seems like he might be.
#+end_quote

Implied. Seems. Notice this weak words that are a result of you wanting it to be a certain way, but lack any definitive proof for it? If you have such proof, why do you have to bring up indirect things that don't apply?

#+begin_quote
  People are allowed to believe things with some degree of probability, without having to say 100% that it's true or false, you know?
#+end_quote

Sure, and when you believe he is racist or 'might be racist' because of a single comment that has nothing at all due to race and everything to do with politics, despite the 'degree' of probability being so incredibly minute, well... your belief isn't very well founded at all.

But, I'm glad you phrase it as belief. I agree, in a pseudo-religious sense, you 'believe' that of him. You have faith in it, where there is no evidence.

#+begin_quote
  Ok, that's too much for a single "this,"
#+end_quote

Well, that's just like, your opinion, maaaaaan...

#+begin_quote
  Nuh-uh! nailed it
#+end_quote

I'm going to assume your use of humor rather than an agreement or refutation means that you are unwilling or unable to actually refute said biases. If you want evidence of them, I have your article.

#+begin_quote
  But it's not, so it was. I think. rereads Yes.
#+end_quote

Except it wasn't.

See how easy it is to do that?

#+begin_quote
  Good thing I didn't say you did? One of us is clearly confused. Reread it again.
#+end_quote

No one is confused if you are agreeing with me. Reread it again.

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't one comment, it was more than one.
#+end_quote

He called Obama the most stupid on foreign policy. You disagreed, and then went on to somehow claim this was 'proof' of his racism, through an illogical chain of supposition. Did you provide any others? No? Alright then.

#+begin_quote
  You keep dodging this and shifting the goal posts and making it about tone or insults.
#+end_quote

Ironic.

#+begin_quote
  It's math. You said one. There was more than one.
#+end_quote

Oh. I see. You have no point, so it's about semantics. By all means, keep doing that to cover up a lack of any evidence whatsoever.

#+begin_quote
  (Meaning the rest of your comment past this point was just more blatantly being wrong and throwing out red herrings and contradicting yourself
#+end_quote

Meaning you just didn't bother to try and argue it, but dismissed it because you didn't like it.

That's fine. Didn't expect much better.

Which is more insulting? Stupid, or bigot? You tell me.

#+begin_quote
  To be clear; you want to perform a survey, yes?
#+end_quote

No. Reread it. I assert that 'bigot' is more insulting than 'stupid'. You assert this is not the case. Feel free to test it. As you are the one claiming he is being more insulting for that insult, feel free to provide proof. Or, you know, just admit you're wrong on a silly detail, but I don't see that ever happening if you can help it.

#+begin_quote
  You've tried to shift the goalposts again
#+end_quote

Fail.

#+begin_quote
  That's the survey. Whether I was more insulting to OSC than he was to others
#+end_quote

Here goes the "Let's take a refutation and try to change it and turn it around rather than address the issue" bit again.

#+begin_quote
  So I'll post a link in the [[/r/rational]] discord and if more people agree that I was insulting
#+end_quote

So, let me get this straight, you want to take a guy who is well known in a community and have a popularity contest within said community, and use /that/ to determine if you are right or wrong.

Do you even rational, bro?

See, at least my offhand comment states you are running into /random/ people. Yours starts with a selection bias and just gets worse from there. But, by all means, do as you will, just know that the results won't accomplish anything.

#+begin_quote
  you'll admit you were wrong and that your reading comprehension is poor
#+end_quote

I like how on yours its a "my bad", but what you want from me is a big complicated list you are unwilling to actually do yourself. Hypocrisy, rearing its head again.

Like I said, hold your popularity contest, I do not care. If it makes you /feel/ better than people support you, go ahead and do what you want. You probably need it at this point.

#+begin_quote
  you just didn't like that he was insulted and that rustled your jimmies.
#+end_quote

Oh look, I'm being accused of things that didn't happen! I didn't know you were a /psychic/ in addition to your many rational talents. Is there anything you can't do?

Hey, by chance, did your jimmies get rustled that someone didn't agree with you, and did so with determination? Because, you know, if that's the case, then your entire post is a giant pile of projection.

Not accusing you, though.

#+begin_quote
  I know there's some worry of Halo effect because I'm me, so I'll let you pick someone to edit the survey questions to ensure they're neutral. Shake on it?
#+end_quote

Already answered this one in advance. It's not a worry, it's that your technique is flawed from the get go and the end rewards of any agreement would be heavily stacked in your favor regardless. Intellectual honesty is apparently not in great supply here.
