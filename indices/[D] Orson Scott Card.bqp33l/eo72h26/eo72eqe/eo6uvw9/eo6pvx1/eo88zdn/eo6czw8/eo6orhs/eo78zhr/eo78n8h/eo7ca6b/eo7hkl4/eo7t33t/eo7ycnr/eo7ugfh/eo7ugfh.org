Oh, come on.

The "I suppose" there is not a begrudging admission of the existence of virulent gay-haters. He's /explicitly talking about how the word "homophobia" is commonly used,/ and the "I suppose" is pointing straight at the motte-bailey. He's saying "people will fall back on saying that homophobia is just a diagnostic, denotative term for anyone who hates gays, but in actual usage it's a label thrown onto anyone who disagrees with the political trend of increased civil liberties for people with gay lifestyles."

I find your objection here disingenuous and maybe motivated.
