Card's "antigay" position is /exactly the same/ as his "anti-premarital-sex" position is /exactly the same/ as his "anti-adultery" position. If you read Characters and Viewpoint, he explicitly discusses the gay characters and how easy it was to port over empathy and understanding of Romance Type A into empathy and understanding of Romance Type B; I think it's extremely easy to see how someone could convincingly write entirely sympathetic characters engaging in all sorts of "sins" once they've decided to view "sinners" in general with sympathy.

I think positing latent homosexuality from Card's work is plausible, i.e. there's nothing to /disprove/ it, but not at all required, i.e. I think those works are just-as-strong-or-stronger evidence for general writing skill than for the specific hypothesis of secretly gay.

Or, as we say with tired voices, "authors are not their characters."
