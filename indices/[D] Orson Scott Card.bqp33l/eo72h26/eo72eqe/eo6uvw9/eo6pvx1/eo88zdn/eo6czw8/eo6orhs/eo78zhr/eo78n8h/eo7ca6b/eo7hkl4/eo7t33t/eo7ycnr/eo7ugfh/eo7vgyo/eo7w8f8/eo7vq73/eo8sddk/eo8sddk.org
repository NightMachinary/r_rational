No, I stand by it.

I'll check with some of my non-gay older friends and coworkers and report back, but also 1990 isn't the pre-mass-media age, and it's really easy to look into what the attitudes of the general public were like then.

I'm actually a little confused by your skepticism of this claim. I've been keeping track, and something like 1/11 of my suicidal calls involve kids who are gay or trans where people's attitudes toward their sexual or gender identity is directly responsible for their depression, anxiety, etc. By NO accounts or narratives that I've ever encountered has this problem gotten worse, rather than better, over the last few decades. I'm curious what exactly you think the 70s and 80's were like for gay people? Shows like Will and Grace, which are often cited as turning points for common perception of gay people, didn't come out until 1998.

(Random interesting tidbit, atheism is something like 1/17 the last time I checked my files. There's some overlap)
