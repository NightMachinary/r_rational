Hmm. What do you think about all that, [[/u/thrawnca]]?

Sorry mine is so long. I really don't know why the hell I wrote this in present tense, but I have to live with it because I'm not redoing all that. [[/u/thrawnca]], I'd recommend reading [[/u/callmesalticidae]]'s comment first if you haven't done so already.

  It's 2006. Hurricane Katrina happened recently, and the tsunami in the Indian Ocean happened about a year before that. My mother and my grandmother are talking, and out of the blue my grandmother says something like "god sent the hurricane because they were living in sin in New Orleans, just like those non-Christians in Asia last year."

  My mother meditates on that for a long time, thinks about all the recently born infants who died without ever having learned a religion, has an image in her head of mothers holding their infant children as they all die, realizes that those same mothers would be the ones imparting a religion onto those infants' minds, and intuits one of the common atheist arguments - that no one believes in their religion because it's the correct religion, they believe it because that's what they learned from their parents and their society. She also realizes that religion has only ever been an explanation for the weather.

[I do not endorse that exactly, though I think "explaining the unknown" /was/ an important aspect of the formation of early religion.]

  It's mid 2007. My mother tells me all this stuff she's been thinking about for the past year, and that she doesn't think she can believe anymore. She explains her reasoning poorly so it comes across like an emotional reaction to dead children or something, and I'm not convinced by her words. She still doesn't know whether or not there's a god, but she's thoroughly convinced that all known religions are man-made. I still believe. My mother does not.

  I observe that my mother is a good and moral person. I also observe that my religion asserts that */god is going to set my mother on fire forever/*. I find this disconcerting, considering that god is perfect and doesn't make mistakes and setting my mother on fire would be a mistake. I decide that my religion must've been misinterpreted by man because god wouldn't set my mother on fire, so I set about finding the hidden truth of god that's masked behind organized religion.

  I start researching into apocryphal texts and gnostic gospels and the history of the writing of the bible, stuff like the Council of Carthage and the decisions that led to which books to include and which books to leave out.

  I decide that the bible was divinely inspired, but that god simplified his message to be understandable for the ignorant semi-literate goat-herders who were living at the time, and then that simplified message was passed down through several generations via the spoken word before it was finally recorded by fallible semi-literate humans, and then translated and retranslated and translated yet again.

  I now basically believe that there is a god and a Jesus and a heaven, but that god's message has been so warped/corrupted by history that the only thing we can know for certain is that god wants you to be a good person.

  I discover that Revelations (aka the Apocalypse of John of Patmos) was included in the bible simply because it made for a more exciting conclusion and made the bible feel like it had a proper ending, and that it was nothing more than a coded message to early Christians written by a man who the Romans exiled for causing public disturbances. I look deeper and find that Revelations was not intended by its author as prophecy, and that "the end times" and "the Antichrist" were ideas invented during the Middle Ages when most people had no idea what the bible /actually said/ and had to rely on trusting the church's word.

  The most important thing I find is that the Council of Carthage almost used the Apocalypse of Peter as the ending instead, which is allegedly an account from the apostle Peter of a tour of heaven that he was given by Jesus Himself, who at some point said to Peter:

  *"It is because of them who have believed in me that I am come. It is also because of them who have believed in me that, at their word, I shall have pity on man. Thou must not tell that which thou hearest unto the sinners lest they transgress the more and sin."*

  No longer being concerned about god setting my mother on fire, I stop thinking about the history of my religion for a while.

  2007/2008 coincides with my freshman year of college. I take a world history class that fall, and a philosophy class and some sort of history of religion class that spring.

  At some point, I learn about Zoroastrianism and how it influenced all the little tribes in the surrounding areas, and I learn that the bible's account of "Jews vs Canaanites" is fabricated, they didn't coexist at the same time, Judaism evolved from the Canaanite religion. I also learn that the Jews were never slaves in Egypt, and that the events of Exodus are myth, not history... Moses is alleged to have been the author of Genesis and Exodus and Leviticus and Numbers and Deuteronomy, but there was never such a person as Moses. I find that linguistic analysis shows that each of those books was almost certainly written by multiple anonymous authors, and so there are weird mishmashes of multiple contradictory accounts.

  Having learned about the similarities between other religions, I decide that christianity fits into the same mold. Egyptian, Hindu, Greek, Roman, Norse, whatever, it's all a pantheon with a main/creator god at the top, the bible just calls most of its gods "angels." I now believe that god told all the peoples of the world the same story and a thousands-of-years long game of "telephone" / "the whisper game" had fractured it into all these competing religions. As long as you believe in god and live a good life it doesn't matter which religion's path you follow, because it's all the same corrupted story.

  I look into the historicity of Jesus, and find that there had almost certainly never been such a person, and that his life story is probably a result of several individuals wandering around Jerusalem anointing people with the holy oil during the same decade, and a few generations later it's merged into one story of one man, and elements from other religions have been added as embellishment.

  So now I no longer believe there was ever such a person as Jesus and I no longer believe that a single word in the bible is an accurate account of any event that actually transpired in the real world, but I */still/* believe in god.

  We skip ahead to fall of 2008. I go back to college, and because I had been a stupid/anxious kid who didn't know how to talk to people (/especially/ over the telephone), I had neglected the previous year to sign up for a dorm room, and now have to live in an apartment off campus.

  Because of this, I have the option of moving back to [REDACTED CITY] a full two weeks before school starts, and I do it because I haven't smoked /any/ weed or cigarettes /all summer/ (I've been working 5/6 days a week and living in my parents' house). People I had known the previous year have also gotten apartments, but they've done it on purpose to facilitate their ability to party without getting busted.

  During that two weeks I try alcohol and LSD and mushrooms and ecstacy, and between all of the "big events" I'm never /not/ smoking hella kush (my college is in a mountainous area near where a significant chunk of the US's "good weed" is grown, so everything I smoke is named, none of it is just generic "good weed," Northern Lights and Sour Diesel and White Widow and Granddaddy Purp and Purple Haze and AK-47 and even /actual/ OG Kush and /actual/ Pineapple Express)...

  I spend that time partying my way to Enlightenment every waking moment of every day. This sets the stage for the rest of sophomore year. Anything that doesn't directly relate to maximizing "the college experience" has been ejected from my mind. That includes religion. I go the entire year without thinking about religion even once.

  It's summer of 2009, a few weeks before the end of school. A FireFox extension called StumbleUpon is pretty popular during this time period. You click a button and it throws you to random internet pages based on your interests. It starts occasionally showing me articles about Richard Dawkins specifically and atheism in general. I hit "Stumble" again pretty quickly after glancing over these articles, maybe briefly thinking about how arrogant those stupid atheists are.

  It keeps occasionally showing me articles. The glances increase in length. Richard Dawkins turns out to not be the arrogant cockhead that christians say he is, and his words make a lot of sense. I ask myself "what would the world look like if god didn't exist" and it hits me that it would look /exactly like the world we live in now/.

  I have a very terrifying 30 seconds of confusion where I try to talk to god while also knowing with crystal clear certainty that god doesn't exist and that I'm talking to myself, and then I realized "oh wait, I already don't believe in god anymore..."

I don't remember exactly what went through my mind at the very end there, all I remember is that I just unthinkingly considered myself to be a christian right up until the very instant that I realized I didn't believe in god.

In a way, it's similar to your story, and to most people's stories - gradually accumulating knowledge that's incompatible with your beliefs, noticing contradictions - but there was never any growing doubt of god's existence. Like, if I'd had your experience with the Westlake Hunting Preserve, I would've reacted by just writing it off as fallible humans being fallible humans. I don't know why I lost my religion at that particular moment. It just fell away.
