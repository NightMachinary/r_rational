Re: Expertise

So, like, the basic failure of empathy is saying you are taking on the other side's priors and then continuing to operate using your own. Like if I'm trying to grok Dan who talks backwards I can't keep thinking that backwards talking is silly and then try to figure out why he loves silliness, what it is about silliness that attracts him, etc. In his mind, this isn't silly, this is reasonable and serious behavior.

​

Similarly, if you are going to step into OSC's mind and talk about the Book of Mormon, you can't say that he needs to be an architect to believe in it but you don't need to be one to scoff at it, because the judgement on which experts are credible is something you took along from your own brain. Google is vast, and the anti vaxxer or Book of Mormon truther can find links that tell them they are smart just as well as you can.

RE: dunking on dude

The reason I am disappointed in you for calling him senile is that it is the empathy version of a nuke. Once you set it off, you are done. If the person isn't a person (or rather, isn't fully modeled as a...you get it), if their behavior is determined by degrading cells or misfiring brain lightning, then you are done, yeah? They behave this way because someone hit them in the head with a hammer, case closed. You need a LOT of evidence to go there.

Re: Rationalist failures

The whole 'if they were really trying to X they would be us, ergo they don't care about X' is not just a classic rationalist failure, it is the easiest mockery that we let ourselves in for.

​

Dig it: "If DayStarEld really cared about entertaining people and exploring concepts then he'd give all his money and time to MIRI and hasten the fully automated gay space communism AI future. Checkmate! Now let's consider what sinister reasons he might REALLY have for writing his pokemon fanfic, since we've just proven it isn't the obvious..."

​

Like, the above isn't just wrong, it is wrong in a very particularly rat-adjacent way, and it is mostly what you are doing in your article. Dude can't be religious because his religion changed its mind on black folks? That's...you get that it proves too much, right? No Mormon can believe now? All X million of them, when they tell you why they tithe, it is all lies, since they used to have no black mormons and now they have some?

​

Halo/horns effect:

It is easy, when you are trying to do empathy with gross people, to get carried away with tweaking their noses. People fail the intellectual turing test on nazis way more than they do on firefighters. I'm suggesting that you mentally put OSC, or whoever you are trying to understand, in the right while you are in there, because it will help you avoid those errors.

​

Sum up:

Ok, like, there are some math problems that are hard because they have many steps. If you get just one bit of the long division wrong you are on the wrong path and barring a happy accident you will end wrong. But this isn't one of those situations. This is 2+2, but you have excluded 4 from the solution space. The boring, naive answer is the right one. OSC has the motivations that he says (over and over) he has.

​

Meta:

Categories are useful because they help us predict behaviors. "Bob is a bigot, black people don't knock on his door if your car breaks down." OSC is a person who won't shut up about his motivations and behaviors. Figuring out what categories he belongs in is a waste of time (because we don't need any help predicting his behaviors, they are famous), and could actually make you less accurate. Like, if you just knew him as OSC, famous bigot, you might well expect he'd support President Trump, but if you treat him as OSC, as-seen-on-tv, you know he loathes the guy.

​

This is kind of sprawling, wow. If you answer back I'll just let your response be the last word, don't want to end up writing a novel on here!

Big fan, can't wait for the next update!
