  Don't throw me in that Briar Patch, Br'er Fox!
#+end_quote

I'll try m'damdest not to.

#+begin_quote
  The part where you supplied details, then started going into calling him 'bigoted' and 'toxic', the part where you got upset at him not being 'racist' so tried to imply he was, etc, etc. IE: Most of the latter two thirds of the article.
#+end_quote

I didn't call /him/ bigoted and I distinguished why, and the toxic thing was still 10 years ago. As for the racism, if I said he was I would have said he's a bigot. I implied he might be because it seems like he might be. People are allowed to believe things with some degree of probability, without having to say 100% that it's true or false, you know?

#+begin_quote
  If it's calm and analytical, why did it read like a surly Facebook rant and not a piece of rationalist work?
#+end_quote

Well, that's just, like, your opinion, maaan...

#+begin_quote
  "This" being "The entire bit of work starting from his initial discovery, followed by the later research and deep dive, followed by the article that does not provide evidence of wrongdoing or bigotry on the target's part but heavily implies it instead".
#+end_quote

Ok, that's too much for a single "this," and I respectfully would like to file a protest of your misuse of language. I'll see you Semantic Court!

#+begin_quote
  You don't get to tie in the entire history and then when someone disagrees try to separate it into separate parts to call them wrong. If you tied all that time together in the article, referencing the entire span, then you will be judged on that entire span.
#+end_quote

Nah, that's just lazy thinking. People change in 10 years, their positions evolve. If your argument is seriously that I can't escape whatever baggage you think was there, then joke's on you, because in an alternate timeline I just omitted that paragraph and you wouldn't have reason to suspect this in the slightest, and would just take the article at face value. You know, like most people who read this did.

#+begin_quote
  Needless to say, however, mine is correct, because you have these biases.
#+end_quote

Shit, I already used Lebowski. Maybe I edit that one and use that here, and put something else there... eh, too much work.

/ahem/

Nuh-uh!

  If you want to change "mental anguish" to "disappointment" instead, sure, whatever. But as you linked them yourself in the article, and your view on him didn't change from what it was prior to the current time but only became more extreme in that regard, then what I have stated is correct.
#+end_quote

It didn't become more extreme, actually, but now you're just repeating yourself so I'm going to skip ahead. See above.

#+begin_quote
  It's not wrong if that is, in fact, what you stated.
#+end_quote

But it's not, so it was. I think. /rereads/ Yes.

#+begin_quote
  Good thing I didn't say that.
#+end_quote

Good thing I didn't say you did? One of us is clearly confused. Reread it again.

#+begin_quote
  Clarify.
#+end_quote

Simple math. You said "One comment that the writer disagrees with and falsely attributes to racism for OSC means that he is so, and thus also bigoted?" It wasn't one comment, it was more than one. You keep dodging this and shifting the goal posts and making it about tone or insults. It's math. You said one. There was more than one. I said your reading comprehension is poor. You insist it's not. But 1 < X, where X is the amount of OSC comments I quoted and 1 is what you said.

#+begin_quote
  This line of argument is thus a non-starter. But, if you like, yes, calling someone stupid is less insulting than calling them a bigot. If you doubt this, feel free to perform an experiment where you call random people stupid, and other random people bigots, and let me know which one causes more insult.
#+end_quote

An experiment was called for! TO THE THUNDERDOME!

(Meaning the rest of your comment past this point was just more blatantly being wrong and throwing out red herrings and contradicting yourself about OSC not being insulting again in a stubborn way that I trust most potential readers to see through, so before we go into the briar patch I'm sticking to this flag I planted.)

To be clear; you want to perform a survey, yes? You've tried to shift the goalposts again, so I'm dragging you right back to another flag:

"OSC has expressed disagreements with things he does not believe in, and he has done it in ways less insulting than the original post."

That's the survey. Whether I was more insulting to OSC than he was to others, like Obama or non-anti-gay-Mormons or anyone else.

So I'll post a link in the [[/r/rational]] discord and if more people agree that I was insulting, I'll apologize on my post, and if more people believe that OSC was insulting, you'll admit you were wrong and that your reading comprehension is poor and that you didn't actually read those articles you kept saying you did, or IF NOT ALL THAT, you'll admit that you don't actually care how insulting OSC was, you just didn't like that he was insulted and that rustled your jimmies.

Agreed? I know there's some worry of Halo effect because I'm me, so I'll let you pick someone to edit the survey questions to ensure they're neutral. Shake on it?
