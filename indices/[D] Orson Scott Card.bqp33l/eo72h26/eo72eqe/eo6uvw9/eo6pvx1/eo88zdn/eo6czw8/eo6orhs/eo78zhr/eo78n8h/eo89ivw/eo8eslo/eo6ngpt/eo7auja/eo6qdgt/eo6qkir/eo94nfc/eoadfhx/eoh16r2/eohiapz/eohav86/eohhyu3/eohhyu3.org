#+begin_quote
  You didn't even point out anything of OSC's that I quoted incorrect!
#+end_quote

Did I say you quoted him incorrectly? Or was that just something you brought up to deflect from the rest of it?

#+begin_quote
  I didn't assert that your tone was indicative of arguing in bad faith, why are you assuming mine is?
#+end_quote

Do you consider insults and passive-aggressiveness to be arguing in good faith? Ignoring points and bringing up completely different ones that were not listed rather than addressing the ones at hand?

Most people don't. But... I mean, you /could/, and if you /do/, well, that's highly unusual, so if your "banter" setting is higher than normal, then I really can't blame you. Just as long as you're able to receive as much as you give. ;)

#+begin_quote
  I'll try that next, if this doesn't work.
#+end_quote

Well, if you try the same technique twice and it doesn't work, then I do recommend you try something different the third time.

#+begin_quote
  I'm guessing you weren't there for when I unloaded on Sufficient Velocity forums when they were insulting rationalists
#+end_quote

Nope. You're deep in a subculture/community that I really don't go into. There's a couple of fics I read over there, but generally try to avoid all the shenanigans.

#+begin_quote
  as a warning I tend to get more and more bombastic when I sense people are up for a verbal spar.
#+end_quote

Don't throw me in that Briar Patch, Br'er Fox!

#+begin_quote
  I think it's too easy to be antagonistic over text, or read antagonism from snark
#+end_quote

This is true, and starts many unnecessary fights.

#+begin_quote
  Over 10 years later.
#+end_quote

Yet still true.

#+begin_quote
  Where did I indicate that?
#+end_quote

The part where you supplied details, then started going into calling him 'bigoted' and 'toxic', the part where you got upset at him not being 'racist' so tried to imply he was, etc, etc. IE: Most of the latter two thirds of the article.

#+begin_quote
  which does not describe the fairly calm and analytical frame of mind I was in when writing this article.
#+end_quote

If it's calm and analytical, why did it read like a surly Facebook rant and not a piece of rationalist work?

#+begin_quote
  this (this being this article)
#+end_quote

"This" being "The entire bit of work starting from his initial discovery, followed by the later research and deep dive, followed by the article that does not provide evidence of wrongdoing or bigotry on the target's part but heavily implies it instead".

#+begin_quote
  hoping to further understand someone he considered a "hero" (incorrect, that was 10 years aog)
#+end_quote

Actually correct. You considered him a hero. Thank you for agreeing. You seem to think that throwing 10 years in there makes it untrue, but it's not. Nothing I have said in that matter is false, and I'd appreciate you not trying to imply that it is, especially when you admit to it as you did here.

You don't get to tie in the entire history and then when someone disagrees try to separate it into separate parts to call them wrong. If you tied all that time together in the article, referencing the entire span, then you will be judged on that entire span.

#+begin_quote
  that implies that my motivation and state of mind from 10 years ago unquestionably biased the research and writing of this article
#+end_quote

Yes.

Exactly as you "imply" things about OSC. How does it seem from the other side?

Needless to say, however, mine is correct, because you /have these biases/.

#+begin_quote
  These statements are meaningless without the assumption of linked mental anguish between the me from 10 years ago and the me from Sunday.
#+end_quote

If you want to change "mental anguish" to "disappointment" instead, sure, whatever. But /as you linked them yourself in the article/, and your view on him didn't change from what it was prior to the current time but only became /more/ extreme in that regard, then what I have stated is correct.

#+begin_quote
  Well when you state something so blatantly wrong, what else should I assume
#+end_quote

It's not wrong if that is, in fact, what you stated.

#+begin_quote
  If you disagree with the idea that someone can hold religious beliefs that are bigoted without being a bigot themselves, you should have just said that, and we'd be having a bit of a different discussion!
#+end_quote

Good thing I didn't say that.

#+begin_quote
  I'm planting a flag here; are you admitting you were mistaken, or not?
#+end_quote

Clarify.

#+begin_quote
  Don't shift the goalposts and try to make this about my attitude
#+end_quote

Stop shifting goalposts to avoid the thrust of the argument then.

#+begin_quote
  I'm happy to justify that later, but not until you admit that what you said, and I quote, "OSC has expressed disagreements with things he does not believe in, and he has done it in ways less insulting than the original post," is factually inaccurate
#+end_quote

*Doctor Evil*: /How about.... nooooooo./

#+begin_quote
  unless you are honestly going to sit there (or stand, or lay down, I don't know your life) and try to argue that calling someone the stupidest President in history on foreign policy is "less insulting" than saying someone isn't bigoted
#+end_quote

I said /OSC has expressed disagreements with things he does not believe in/. Your Obama quote has zero to do with this.

This line of argument is thus a non-starter. But, if you like, yes, calling someone stupid is less insulting than calling them a bigot. If you doubt this, feel free to perform an experiment where you call random people stupid, and other random people bigots, and let me know which one causes more insult.

#+begin_quote
  but their religious beliefs are, which again I defined as “false beliefs about a specific demographic that knowingly disadvantage or cause harm to that demographic.”
#+end_quote

Again, is the Mormon church oppressing said people, causing them harm or disadvantaging the demographic? Are OSC's beliefs doing that?

#+begin_quote
  Not to mention all the other stuff he said, which again, you're not showing any evidence that you read
#+end_quote

I don't need to 'show evidence' that I've read anything. You're trying to put that burden on me because you falsely believe it advantages you. Expecting the other guy to do your side's work in a discussion is intellectual laziness of the highest caliber. If you want to bring up those quotes, do it, and I'll knock them down too if necessary.

#+begin_quote
  being a dictator by character
#+end_quote

He certainly did enough dictatorial actions. If the current President did half the things the previous one did, there'd be a bloodbath. This is, however, a completely different argument, and /meaningless besides as you've admitted OSC has ragged on the CURRET President as well/.

Honestly, I don't know why you're bringing this up at all unless it's to serve as a distraction.

#+begin_quote
  also the insults he's heaped on liberals and climate scientists and Mormons who disagreed with him
#+end_quote

Oh no, how sad. He's said mean things. Did he call them toxic and bigoted, too? Maybe "Bitter clingers"? If you /really/ want to go down this route, it's not hard to find mean things the targets of his annoyance have said, or even things you've said.

Wait... he disagreed with other /Mormons/? Well, there goes the "He must adhere 100% to the tenets of his religious group* bit brought up earlier. Good to know... now you can leave him alone on the racism part now that you've admitted this.

#+begin_quote
  I should warn you, I really dislike it when people avoid responsibility for their mistakes in arguments like this: it's all good fun until you show no integrity
#+end_quote

Best avoid mirrors, then.

#+begin_quote
  and then the gloves come off
#+end_quote

Anything but the Briar Patch!
