Brigham Young, Lorenzo Snow, Spencer W Kimball, David O McKay. Joseph F Smith and Fielding Smith and Smith Classic Edition...

These are all prophets who've on this matter, and they're just the ones whose teachings I can recall off the top of my head, after having been gone from the church for several years.

Not to mention, “And wo be unto man that sheddeth blood or that wasteth flesh and hath no need” (D&C 49:21).

“And Cain said: Truly I am Mahan, the master of this great secret, that I may murder and get gain” (Moses 5:31a) is just the cherry on top. You can leave it out and that wouldn't have changed my reaction to finding out that, contrary to generations of clear teachings on this point, the Church now owns a preserve where people go to kill animals for the sake of pleasure. This isn't exactly an Unsong-tier interpretation job.

And you thought that all I had was some Brigham Roberts quote that had to be “extrapolated”? The seminaries sure aren't making scriptorians the way they used to.

Anyway, I'll leave [[/u/ElizabethRobinThales]] to their thing. I didn't want to get involved in a bible bash kind of affair, as I said in an earlier comment, but most of the people who float on by here don't know a lick about Mormonism besides something or other about having thirty wives on Kolob, and I thought I ought to make it clear for them that there's a hell of a lot more here than you made out to be.
