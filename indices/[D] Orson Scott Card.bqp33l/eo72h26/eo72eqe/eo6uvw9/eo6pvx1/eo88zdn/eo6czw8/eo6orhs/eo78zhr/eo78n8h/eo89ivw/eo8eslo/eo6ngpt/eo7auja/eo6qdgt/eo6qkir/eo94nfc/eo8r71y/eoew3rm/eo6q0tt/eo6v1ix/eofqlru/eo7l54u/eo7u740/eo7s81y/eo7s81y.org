As about him as an author... I have read Ender's Game and liked it.

Read Speaker for the Dead and disliked it. IMHO his issues are showing in that one, the incestuous themes are too frequent.

Read his book on world-building and TTRPG preparations and liked it.

Imho he has good ideas but not that good as a writer.
