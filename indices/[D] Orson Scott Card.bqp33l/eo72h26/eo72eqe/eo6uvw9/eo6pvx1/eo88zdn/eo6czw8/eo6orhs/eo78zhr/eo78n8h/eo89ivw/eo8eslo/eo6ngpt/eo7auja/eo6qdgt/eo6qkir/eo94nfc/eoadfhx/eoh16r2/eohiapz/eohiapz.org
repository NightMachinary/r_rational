  You call his beliefs bigoted. Then you point out how "bigots" always try to defend their beliefs. ALL people try to defend their beliefs. It must be strange for you to misread something so simple.
#+end_quote

Alright, I'll break this down with an example: if someone says "Gay people molest children so shouldn't adopt," this would be a bigoted belief, yes? If they justify this belief by saying "There are a lot of men who molest young boys," does this justification for their belief make it less bigoted?

If you say yes, then we have bigger problems going on here, but if not, then congratulations, we agree! My point in highlighting this was to head off people who might argue that "OSC believes he's doing what's best for children/families/God/etc," because that doesn't change the classification of the belief as bigoted. That's all it really was; when making an argument, it's good practice to predict and defuse counter arguments, so that's what I did.

  Why? Why are you trying to make the discussion about something else than the supposed "bigotry" on his beliefs of same-sex marriage?... Do you clump all forms of "bigotry" together in a mass and assume that if one trait is shown, all the others must as well?
#+end_quote

Well first of all, because OSC isn't criticized only for his gay bigotry, but also for potential racism. So you know, it would have been a little weird to ignore that.

As to clumping it all together... Ehhh /waggles hand left and right/ Sort of, no, but a little, maybe. Prejudices of all kinds basically follow the same flawed epistemics, I don't know for sure if they're correlated, but if someone shows signs of one kind of bigotry I'm certainly less surprised if they turn out to be bigoted in other ways too. I do explain this in the post, but you're off the hook on not recognizing it since it's actually a rather complex point that I made over the course of a few paragraphs.

Basically, I was pointing out that it's really tempting to just blame Card's religion on his beliefs about gay people, but that there are underlying failures in Card's epistemics and patterns of behavior that show him failing to distinguish truth from falsehood and failing to empathize with or be charitable toward those he disagrees with, the way I would expect someone who "hates the sin but loves the sinner" to do. Bringing up his worrying silence on the historic racism of his church doesn't fit my model of a Card who hates bigotry.

#+begin_quote
  Yes. In your opinion, it's a very big deal. He apparently doesn't think much of it. Is such an equality still long-standing and pervasive? Do they continue to hold a person's race against them religiously? Are they oppressing such people now?
#+end_quote

Well, yes, according to many ex-mormons, but even if they're all dirty sin-blackened liars, dude was 27 when his church finally decided maybe black people deserve to be equals. I don't know how old you are, but if you don't think that's old enough to speak out against inequality, then we're operating on different expectations of people.

#+begin_quote
  Or is this a solution in need of a problem, when the original organization has since moved on? Why are you trying to make past views of the religion he belongs to a negative slander on a man who is indifferent to it? Is he not allowed to believe differently? Are all religious people within a certain religion in 100% alignment with each other on every single view?
#+end_quote

You know what, I'm turning this flurry of questions around, because their answers seem pretty obvious from my post (that you totally read fully and carefully). En garde!

Why do you care so little about his church's racism? His church that he thinks is infallible about gay people? His church that he defends constantly? Card isn't "all religious people," he's an outspoken and fairly famous member of his church, and of course he's allowed to think differently, my point is if he did he should have /said so./ You're not even a little bit concerned that maybe the guy who's totally "indifferent" about his church's about-face on racism might be racist? You don't see any remote shred of a problem, there? This really strikes you as totally off topic? Your picture of a non-racist Card just meekly stays silent on that? Because "indifferent" is not a good look on him at all, and if your goal here is to try to convince me I'm wrong, you're just shooting your argument in the foot with that word.

#+begin_quote
  Nice dodge. I notice you avoided the key part, but that's fine.
#+end_quote

You seem confused, that was a "direct rebuttal." You said X, I pointed out why X was wrong. Rebuttal, not dodge. And which key part was that? "Foreign policy?" I mentioned that, actually. You have to be specific here if you want to defend your points, because they're not doing well.

#+begin_quote
  Obama was pretty insanely stupid on foreign policy. At least Bush can blame the fact that Congress voted for that retarded war, but everything Obama has done is on his own hands.
#+end_quote

Oooh, okay, so this all kind of makes sense: you don't CARE that OSC was incredibly insulting to Obama, because you believe those insults were TRUE! Good to know we can use that as a defense; as long as I think I'm right about OSC, my insults are fine! Huzzah!

#+begin_quote
  But see, none of this matters, because it's all a distraction on your part. You disagree with OSC on his political beliefs about our previous President. Because he disagrees, you decided to call him racist, despite lacking any proof of such whatsoever, merely your own implications. Implications with zero evidence.
#+end_quote

Nah, he also said he's a "black man who talks like a white man" and a bunch of other stuff that you totally read because you totally didn't skip over the articles I linked to in your totally well thought out original response, so it pretty much sounds like none of what you're saying /here/ matters, because you're trying to distract form how factually incorrect you are by presuming my intentions.

You accusing me of accusing Card of racism just because he insults Obama is about as empty an argument as me accusing you of defending Card because he insulted Obama. It's not a really effective argument, you see?

Better stick to the actual point, which was... /checks/ oh yes, that you ignored the entire article I linked to and quoted multiple times from so you could just take this one line and spin a narrative about me and my intentions around it. Next!

#+begin_quote
  /Looks up at your entire series of very specific cut replies to my own post/ Funny, that.
#+end_quote

Laaame. Come on, that was weaker than the rubber and glue thing. You actually just tried to equivocate me responding to your post point by point (you know, the most thorough way to respond to someone's argument) with your blatant mistake (can't say lie, that would be presuming bad faith) that there was just one thing I was focusing on while ignoring all the other things I quoted?

/refreshes other page/ Still no reply to that, so still waiting to see if you have the integrity to admit your mistake. It's pretty simple, just admit that you shouldn't have said "One comment that the writer disagrees with" because there were more than one.

#+begin_quote
  In reality, however, you are far less rational than you think, and while it is disappointing to discover that you're just a normal, flawed, emotion-driven human being like the rest of us, I didn't really expect anything different.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sr0KtlQu_M][You got me!]] But are you sure you didn't expect different? Because unless you're just always like this, the antagonistic tone and poor reading comprehension of your original response could be easily explained by some...

(But seriously let me know if you want to hash this out over discord, because there's a good chance things get less cordial from here and I'm sure you're actually a nice person in meatspace and I'd rather avoid explicit insult swapping if that's where things are headed)
