Rereading some CT/MT-related articles, I admit that I was probably misinterpreting conflict theorists as a group in my previous comment. And probably you were doing so too. Or more accurately, the concept's broad and vague enough by now for both of us to be using different flavours of that concept and creating unintended misunderstanding because we're getting out of sync.

How about this: you give me your own, self-sufficient^{1} definitions / explanations for: 1) [a person operating in conflict theory mode], and 2) seeking Truth (just to be sure); and I'll answer your earlier question of whether or not I think Card operates in CTm.

^{1} i.e. not based on other vague/broad concepts and not based on external sources that are based on other vague/broad concepts. Or perhaps how you would explain it to someone who has never heard of it before.
