I see this as similar going into an advanced calculus lecture and asking if the professor has considered that their assumptions about addition are wrong. If you still find yourself on the fence or with the belief that bigotry is somehow not wrong, you need to find someone willing to teach at the level you're at and come back after, because I don't really have the free time to explain Morality 101.

How about you write an article explaining why the assumptions might not be wrong, and if you do that I'll respond to it?
