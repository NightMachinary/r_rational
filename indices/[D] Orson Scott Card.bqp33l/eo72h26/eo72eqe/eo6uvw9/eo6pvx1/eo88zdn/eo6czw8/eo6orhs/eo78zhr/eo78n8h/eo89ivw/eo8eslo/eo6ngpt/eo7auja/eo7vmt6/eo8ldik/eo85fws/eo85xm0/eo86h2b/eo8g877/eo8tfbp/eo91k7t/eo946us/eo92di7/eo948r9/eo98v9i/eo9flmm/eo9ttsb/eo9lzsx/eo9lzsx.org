  Here's what really bothers me though, you seem really comfortable with saying things are unknowable and stopping there.

Yes, in the same sense that I'm comfortable saying I have no idea of Shakespeare's favourite food, Johann Sebastian Bach's hair colour, or Plato's shoe size. Those things are not really relevant to the creative works they produced, and I don't know if or how I could go about discovering the facts if for some reason I wanted to. There are a lot of question marks in our knowledge of ancient America, but my interest in the Book of Mormon isn't archaeological anyway, so those questions aren't really relevant. If we find answers to them, great, but for me it would be like finding out Plato's shoe size.

In the case of the priesthood restriction, I would really like to know what was going on, but /no one/ in the church really knows, from the president on down. There was a fair bit of speculation while the restriction was still in place, and most of that was proved wrong in 1972. If I knew of a way to find out more about that one, then I'd be interested.
