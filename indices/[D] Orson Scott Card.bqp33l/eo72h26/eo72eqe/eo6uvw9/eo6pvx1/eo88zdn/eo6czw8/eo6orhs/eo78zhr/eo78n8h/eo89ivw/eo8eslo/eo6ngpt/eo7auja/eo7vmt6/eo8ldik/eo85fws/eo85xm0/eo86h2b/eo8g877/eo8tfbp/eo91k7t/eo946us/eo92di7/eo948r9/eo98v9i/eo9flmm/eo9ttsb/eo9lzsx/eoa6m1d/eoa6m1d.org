Alright. I think the value of Truth should be self explanatory. Little truths add up to big truths, which change beliefs. Any truth that is counter to your expectations should be especially valuable, because it means that your overall schema is wrong. Maybe slightly, maybe majorly; that's kinda the whole value at the heart of the scientific method.

Anyways back to the original topic. The Mormon church has a history of supporting bigotry and suppression of the rights of disenfranchised groups. Orson Scott Card actively championed those beliefs; that makes him a bigot.

Its members as far as I can tell, seem relatively unconcerned by the effects of the political actions of their church (or they've left). Casual acceptance of bigotry has very little effective difference from active support of bigotry. Financial contributions move that into active bigotry.

Finally, I haven't read a convincing reason why to listen to or respect such beliefs, especially legally. They're not the truth; members seem unconcerned with the truth when it becomes inconvenient. Either it's "I don't care to research it," or "we can't know," or worst of all "it's lost to the sands of time. (50 years ago)" These responses not only enable bigotry; they also prevent members from examining the present to prevent the same mistakes in the future.

These beliefs don't come from a coherent set of principles, because said principles are never named; having families and believing what leadership tells you seem to be the only principles that I can see. Worst of all, these beliefs seem to be constantly changing, yet their adherents don't seem to understand how that affects the relationship of the current beliefs to the objective truth.

Eh, the OP put it better than me when he said, "But I think it's important to note that, while hatred is about values, prejudice is ultimately built on poor thinking. One can be solved by education, another can't.

Unless, of course, the value of Truth is too low on the hierarchy. There's a chance that Truth just doesn't matter overly much to Card. He has too many beliefs that come not just from the land of ignorance but of falsehood. "
