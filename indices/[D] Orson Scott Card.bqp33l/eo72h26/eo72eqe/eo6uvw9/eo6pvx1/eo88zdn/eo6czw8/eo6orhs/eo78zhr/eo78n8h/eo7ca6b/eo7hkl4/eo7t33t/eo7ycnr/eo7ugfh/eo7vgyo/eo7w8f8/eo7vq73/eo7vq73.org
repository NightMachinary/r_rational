I can't tell whether you were replying "okay, I agree, I was overreaching/unfairly strawmanning him, but here's a /different/ argument, then," or whether you were replying "nope, I still stand by the thing that you think is a strawman." I note that neither one of us was really paying that much attention in 1990, and that it might behoove you to ask /someone/ who you trust to be a valid and representative source before just deciding that you know the answer to this one.
