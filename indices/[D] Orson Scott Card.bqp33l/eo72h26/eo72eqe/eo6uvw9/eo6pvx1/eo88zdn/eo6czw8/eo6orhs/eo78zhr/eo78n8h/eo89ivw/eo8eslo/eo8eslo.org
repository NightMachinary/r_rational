Good post, always nice to see some sane political discussion that doesn't immediately devolve into shouting.

With regards to religious views versus emotional bigotry, I'm not really sure about Orson Scott Card, but I think this is much more obvious with people like Ben Shapiro. When Ben says that he unfortunately cannot attend Dave Rubin's gay wedding because of his religion, I don't believe for a second that he is secretly disgusted by Dave. I am willing to take him at his word there. But when he talks about Palestine versus Israel, there's a degree of vitriol and irrationality that enters his speech that you simply do not see when he talks about gay people. So I think this is a clear example of these two separate kinds of bigotry, and in the same person to boot.

Of course all the examples you name in your post are w.r.t. right wing views, but I actually think that the refusal to acknowledge different kinds of bigotry is itself a form of left-wing bigotry. I have been told in the past by left-wing people when they found out that I liked Ender's Game that "this tells me everything I need to know about you". If that's not bigotry, what is? And when it comes to not caring about the truth... I have literally had people tell me that they view socialism as an /axiom/; that they literally view it as an end in and of itself. When I pressed them on their logical grounds for this, they happily stated that they do not believe logical consistency to be worth pursuing.

In other words, I suspect that those who decry Orson Scott Card as 'just another right-wing bigot' are, themselves, bigots who do not much care to find out what their political opponents actually believe. A lack of understanding makes it so much easier to hate.
