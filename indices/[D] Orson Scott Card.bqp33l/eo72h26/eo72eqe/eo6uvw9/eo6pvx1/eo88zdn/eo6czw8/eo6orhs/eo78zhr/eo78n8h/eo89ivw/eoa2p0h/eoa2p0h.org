Kind of my entire premise is that if it were that simple, I don't think he would be so adamant and vociferous about it? /shrugs/ Don't know who you're thinking of, exactly, but I don't think millions of people are like that. I think most of the people as outspoken about it as he is are actually bigots, hence why I think it's worth dissecting the ways he's similar or different from them.

To me understanding the root of something is intrinsic to being able to prevent or stop it. Kind of a big part of being a therapist; if you can't differentiate between different kinds of internals states that result in harmful behavior, you're not really going to be able to find the best responses.

  Also, like...you kind of veer into weird rationalist self parody in here. Read what you wrote over, but just imagine dude as holding a premise that you agree with, say he is an abolitionist or an anti smoking zealot back in the past, and I bet you'll recoil from the stuff you wrote.

Sorry, this doesn't really parse to me. Are you saying the style of writing is cringey, or the arguments are bad, or...? Can you point to something specific?
