  Also, he's not saying that “‘Faggot' and ‘Homophobe' are ‘exactly analogous,'”, he was saying that “Those whose agenda is "tolerance" and who insist that ugly words like faggot not be used against them have found an exactly analogous word to use as a weapon in their virulent intolerance of those who disapprove of either their behavior or their political agenda.”

I refute this point on the ground that both kinds of intolerance are not equivalent.

Reasoning. comming from the premise that gender is something you are not something you choose, then intolerance against people on the base of gender is inescapable. To avoid it you either have to hide what you are, leave or die.

Intolerance against homophobia instead is aimed at something people believe, not something they are. Being homophobe is also is mostly ok in the same vein that being a pedophile is ok, so long you dont act upon it. If you act upon your the homophobia you are acting on someone that cannot feasibly avoid the persecusion. To avoid being attacked for being an homophobe though? That is easy, all you need to do is avoid acting on the homophobia and the attacks should stop or atleast relent. There are others homophobes to persecute.

That is why both kinds of intolerance are not equivalent. One has an easy exit and the other doesnt. And the whole extra pressure of being persecuted for something you have very little control about is also very non equal.

Intolerance against those who are themselves intolerant seem to me as a moral imperative to defend those who cannot escape the persecution
