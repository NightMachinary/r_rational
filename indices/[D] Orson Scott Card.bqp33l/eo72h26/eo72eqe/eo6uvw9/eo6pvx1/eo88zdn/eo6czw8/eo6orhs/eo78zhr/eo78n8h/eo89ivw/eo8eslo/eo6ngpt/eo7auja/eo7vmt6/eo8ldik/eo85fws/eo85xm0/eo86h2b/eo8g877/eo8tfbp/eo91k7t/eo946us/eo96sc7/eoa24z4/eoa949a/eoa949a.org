  you're stating things that are just false.

That's a curious position, when most of my comment was pointing out that there aren't many definitive statements that can be made about Mesoamerican history either way. If you "don't have the time or inclination either to go into why and find all the evidence and reasons for why", can you at least /identify/ such a false statement? It's rather hard to address such a vague accusation as this.
