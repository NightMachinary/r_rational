My model is that it's the same closeted gay Card the whole time, but he could accept his situation when gays were marginalised by society. See [[http://www.nauvoo.com/library/card-hypocrites.html][this 1990 essay]] where he's arguing for a position of relative tolerance, but draws the line here:

#+begin_quote
  The only people I have contempt for are those who try to remain inside Mormonism while denying the validity of guidance from the prophets, and I oppose them, not because they live as homosexuals, but because of the hypocrisy of claiming to be Mormon while denying the only reason for the Mormon community to exist. If they prevailed, it would destroy our community.

As society gets more and more tolerant of being gay, the risk that the Mormon Church will rule that being gay is acceptable increases, which would mean that he's denied himself decades of boi pussy for nothing. So he becomes more and more stridently anti-gay.
