Ugh. Your poor reading comprehension even protects you from insults! I didn't say you're slow at /reading,/ you're slow because it took over 4 responses of mine pointing this out and you still didn't get it. I didn't "finally" get anything, gotcha or otherwise; this is a fault line I've been pointing out in your arguments since the very first response.
