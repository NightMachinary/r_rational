  Middle Eastern DNA
#+end_quote

Would we really expect to see this, thousands of years later? The Book of Mormon does not claim that middle Eastern migrants were the sole source of DNA in the Americas, and it does claim that entire family trees were annihilated by civil war. It would be quite surprising, really, if the genetics were still similar.

#+begin_quote
  Semitic language
#+end_quote

Again, the people who might have preserved such a language were, by the book's own account, exterminated by 400AD. And even by that point, even with written records passed down through generations, it attests that their language had altered. And much earlier, it recounts the discovery of a group of Jews who didn't bring any records - and after just a few hundred years, their language had altered so far as to be mutually unintelligible.

  Where's any evidence of this ancient Jewish civilization in Mesoamerica?
#+end_quote

How would we know if we'd found it? A lot of Mesoamerican writing is iconographic. With the culture itself long gone, and without the ability to read what they wrote, how would we know whether any given artifact was owned by people of semitic descent?

#+begin_quote
  animals and foods and whatnot that didn't exist in that area before Columbus "discovered" that area and trade started?
#+end_quote

You know, people have been saying that since the book was written, and the trend ever since has been to discover that one after another of these anachronisms did, in fact, exist. I'm no archaeologist, but that pattern suggests to me that it's wise to suspend judgement on the rest of the list.

#+begin_quote
  And basic geographical mistakes?
#+end_quote

Can you elaborate on this? The Book of Mormon does not clearly identify which region of America it takes place in; what do you consider to be "basic mistakes"?

Interestingly, it does make specific claims about Arabian geography, from the initial migration, and those claims are startlingly accurate.
