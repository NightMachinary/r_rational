  God punishing people who don't deserve punishment

More so the idea of infinite retribution for finite crimes.

  The Bible being of uncertain and mixed origin, with big question marks about the accuracy of substantial parts
#+end_quote

It is certain that the origins of the bible are not the origins it presents of itself. The Jews were never slaves in Egypt. There was never an exodus. There's no question about that. That means there was no Moses.

The accuracy of substantial parts is known to be false, it's not a question.

The creation story describes the earth as a flat disk set upon four pillars and covered by a dome surrounded by water; under the earth are paradise and purgatory, separated by the abyss; above the earth, set atop the dome, is heaven. This is not trivial. This cosmological premise is the foundation of the Noah's Ark myth and the Tower of Babel myth. Conservation of mass means there's only as much water as there is, and gravity works the way it does, and yada yada, long story short a global flood is physically impossible (and if all things are possible through god then why couldn't he Thanos-snap everybody but Noah's family?). The narrative itself offers the explanation that windows opened in the firmament and allowed the surrounding water to fill the dome.

And the Tower of Babel. That whole story rests on the premise that you can build a tower tall enough to breach the firmament and break into heaven. The story says god took that threat seriously. Which he shouldn't've done, if he were real, because there's no firmament. I know you guys believe god lives on the planet Kolob or whatever, but that isn't what's described in the bible, the bible says god lives in heaven and that heaven is sitting right on top of the firmament.

  In particular, doubts about the historical existence of Jesus of Nazareth
#+end_quote

No doubts. I've read enough over the past decade to be thoroughly and irrevocably convinced that there never was such a person. CS Lewis left an "L" out of his "Liar, Lunatic, Lord" argument: "Legend."

  The world would exist the same without a god, therefore Occam's Razor says you shouldn't assume the existence of one.
#+end_quote

Yes. I already know all about "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." This is a fallacy.

Say you want to posit the existence of the planet Nibiru or Planet X or whatever it is. We would expect to see certain evidence if it existed - gravitational effects on the orbits of other objects in the solar system, or whatever, I'm not Neil DeGrasse Tyson (though if there be an infinite number of universes then there's a universe out there where I am). The fact that we don't see that evidence is strong evidence that it isn't there.
