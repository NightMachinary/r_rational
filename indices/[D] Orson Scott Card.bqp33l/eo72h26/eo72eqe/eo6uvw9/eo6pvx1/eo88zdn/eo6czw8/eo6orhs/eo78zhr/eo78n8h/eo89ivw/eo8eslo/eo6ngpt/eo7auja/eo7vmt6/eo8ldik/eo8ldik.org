  Do you follow the Church's pre-1970ish views of Black people. If not, why didn't God reveal the truth earlier and save a lot of racism and discrimination?

Mormonism actually has precedent for God revealing things that the church wasn't ready for, the biggest example being the Law of Consecration, which was essentially communistic. Basically each family would regularly sit down with the bishop, determine how many of their assets were necessary for their need, and the excess would be allocated into the bishop's storehouse, to be redistributed to those without and/or to be used by the church itself.

Following the catastrophic failure of the system, God shrugged and said the people weren't ready, and instituted the "lesser law" of tithing as had been done anciently, which is still in force today.

Apologists claim the same deal would apply with the black priesthood ban, that had it been lifted before the US was on the same page it would have gone poorly. This isn't as totally out of left field as it sounds, considering that Utah was nearly invaded due to the polygamy practice, and that was only lifted when the US government basically threatened to sieze all places of worship held by the church, including the temples which are so central to Mormonism. It's easy to see how reactionary this would make the leadership.

  â€¢ How do you reconcile the Bible's non-violent version of Jesus with the Book of Mormon's one that [[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20?][burns and floods entire cities]]? If they're the same person, why are they worthy of worship rather than hatred for the act of destroying cities?

Mormonism squares this circle by claiming that Jesus is the same as Jehovah, which is to say if it's not consistent with the mortal teachings of the man in the New Testament, it's at /least/ par for the course for the Old. It's also claimed that his mortal ministry was supposed to exemplify mortal conduct, while the actions taken in a godly office are supposed to often be tough choices of letting the world go stagnant vs pruning the population to select for believers.

Also remember that the absolute negative utility of death is not nearly so absolute within a framework where literally everyone is going to be resurrected and granted an immortal body at the end of time. Under such a framework and with Mormonism's perspective of life being a brief 60 year stretch between two gulfs of millions-plus-years existences, the worst injustices and sufferings of mortality are supposed to be somewhat less severe than they seem; a cost for the whole system to function, waste heat produced while elevating mortals.

Which is scant comfort if they've flubbed some of the fundamentals, there.
