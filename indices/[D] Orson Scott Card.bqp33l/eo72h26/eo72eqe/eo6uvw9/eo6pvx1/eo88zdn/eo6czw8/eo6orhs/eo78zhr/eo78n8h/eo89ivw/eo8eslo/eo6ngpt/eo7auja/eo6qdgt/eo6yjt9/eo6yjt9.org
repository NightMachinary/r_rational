I should probably specify that a lot of it is a lot more uncertain in my head than it comes off on paper, like at any point where it sounds like I'm falling back and forth along a conclusion rather than settling on one it's because that's actually what's happening as I wrote it out, edited, researched more, thought about it again, reread, etc. I'm not more than 80% confident about any of it, closer to like 60% for the racism stuff.
