  Is it possible that there is another reason, besides being brain damaged, that someone might disagree with you? Say them thinking that gay sex got you damned by a magic man in the sky, as their parents told them when they were growing up?

You're taking that line out of context: the reason I found it so jarring is that Card's writing promotes tolerance and rationality, not blind faith that disadvantages certain minorities.

  Full stop, what is this? Like, why is dude being bad at archaeology going to help anyone learn anything from your post? What's fun about this fact? It seems like you are arguing that this disqualifies him from having an opinion about the Book of Mormon being true, but unless you are about to confess that you are writing this in between digs it seems like you maybe don't actually think only architects get to talk.

If someone gave up on med school for being too hard, would you consider their medical advice? Further, would it not influence your views on their alternative-medicine blog?

I'm not an archaeologist, so I don't contradict them in their area of expertise. This is pretty fundamental to general values of science acceptance vs denial, and I'm honestly curious what ground you think you're standing on by asking this.

  So, like, Card's words tell us what to expect from him, and his actions back that up. Why are you tying yourself in knots trying to figure out if 'bigot', or 'holds bigoted beliefs', or 'has aligned himself with bigots' describes him? What describes him is what he says and does, and that is clear no matter what label it ends up stuck with.

To me understanding the root of something is intrinsic to being able to prevent or stop it. Kind of a big part of being a therapist; if you can't differentiate between different kinds of internals states that result in harmful behavior, you're not really going to be able to find the best responses.

  A good trick to avoid doing this kind of stuff is to mentally put the person you are talking with/about on the praiseworthy side of a debate. Say it is the past, and OSC is obsessed with stopping people from smoking before that was cool.

I'm honestly not sure what you're trying to communicate with this... is the idea to just imagine them doing something good so I stop thinking about ways they might believe something false or harmful?
