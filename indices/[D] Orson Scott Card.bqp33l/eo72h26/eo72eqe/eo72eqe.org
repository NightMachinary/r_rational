Question: what rhetorical effect do you think it would have on your essay if you timestamped your OSC quotes? For example:

#+begin_quote
  *In 1990*, Card also said that gay sex is sinful and that not just gay marriage but sex should remain illegal
#+end_quote

This doesn't strike me as all that weird. Go back to 1990 and poll people; you'll find that a supermajority of Americans believed the same thing. It's hard to find a politician (democrat or republican) who /wasn't/ anti-gay marriage in 1990. I guess the most radical part of this statement is that he said "I think the laws that are currently in effect should remain in effect, status quo = good"?

You did timestamp one of his remarks as being "as recently as 2008":

#+begin_quote
  as recently as 2008 after judges began ruling gay marriage bans unconstitutional
#+end_quote

As an alternative to talking about what some judges were doing at the time, here's another way you could contextualized 2008:

#+begin_quote
  back in 2008, *when California (the most liberal state in the union by most measures, perhaps tied with New York) passed a ballot proposition by popular vote defining marriage as being between a man and a woman*
#+end_quote

Following 2008, we also had 5 years of presidency under an Obama that did not openly support gay marriage. So in this case, Card was indeed guilty of harboring anti-gay sentiment at around the same time that California voters affirmed "no gay marriage" and democrats nominated a presidential candidate who didn't openly support gay marriage (and then 4 years later we elected him again).

#+begin_quote
  He has pushed the frame that homosexuality is more environmental than genetic
#+end_quote

My recollection is that this wasn't a rare view within the scientific community in the 00's, and this wasn't even strictly speaking a partisan thing; there were plenty of gay advocates (and gay individuals) who in the past ascribed to the belief in environmental factors over genetic. The position I recall being the standard when I was in university at the time was, "It may be genetic, it may be environmental; to me the question is largely academic and irrelevant to the question of whether or not gay people deserve civil rights."

#+begin_quote
  I do not use that word lightly: it is one thing to say that you disagree with gay marriage, it is another to publicly state your position, and then it is yet another entirely to go to the lengths Card has gone to crusade against it.
#+end_quote

Do you think that Card has done more or less to harm gay people than, say, the democrats who controlled congress when Don't Ask Don't Tell passed under president Clinton?

I feel like the main thing that separates Orson Scott Card from these sorts of people (pick a Clinton or a democratic congressman) is that they all shifted views by 2013, whereas Orson Scott Card still believes the same things today that he (and essentially everyone within mainstream discourse) believed back in the 00's. And as I stated at the top of this post, I'm pretty sure that this is because the Mormon church has yet to update their beliefs.

The impression I have of most Mormons (of which you will find many other within science fiction and fantasy, see Brandon Sanderson and Stephanie Meyer for prominent examples) is that most of them are on board with what the church believes, and right now, that means believing that marriage is between a man and a woman (and if you're someone like Brandon Sanderson or Stephenie Meyer, doing everything you can to avoid talking about it in public). These people's stance "I am Mormon, and my position on gay marriage matches that of the Mormon church" would remain if the church's view changed tomorrow (which is to say, they would all be okay with gay marriage if the church was.

I'm sure you can mount a defense of democrat politicians not supporting gay marriage publicly because it was the politically expedient thing to do, even if these politicians did go as far as saying, for example, "Marriage has historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman." Maybe when Hillary Clinton said those words, she secretly believed in her heart believed that gay marriage was okay, and then she publicly changed her stance in 2013 after it was clear that supporting gay marriage wouldn't damage her politically, so really she was actually pro-gay all along, and it was okay for her to pretend to be anti-gay marriage because that's what it took to get elected.

To me, this idea of politicians who change views when the pollsters them gay marriage is okay seem analogous to the idea of a religious person who suddenly changes stance when the church tells them it's okay. I'm curious as to how you think "I said what I had to in order to get elected" ethically compares to "I said what I had to in order to be on board with the slate of beliefs that is supposed to get me into heaven."

Two possibilities:

- Card agrees with whatever the church's position is, and would support gay marriage if the church did. But right now, church says gay = sin, so Card believes gay = sin because that is part of the slate of beliefs he has signed up for.
- Card is anti-gay marriage, and if the church changed its mind, he would go against the church and continue to advocate against gay marriage. Under this model, his religious objections are merely a convenient cover for his more deeply-held belief that gay = bad; if the church changed its views, he would be exposed as not really being a true Mormon.

You seem to argue for the latter...while also claiming that Card's problem is that he considers Mormonism important above all else (including an honest pursuit of the truth)? I am deeply confused by this. Is Card's main loyalty to Mormonism, or hating gay marriage?
