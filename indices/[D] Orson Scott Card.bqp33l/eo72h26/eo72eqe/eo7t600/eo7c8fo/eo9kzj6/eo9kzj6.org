I really don't see his view as that different than Card's pre-disclaimer. His rhetoric is different, but the end result is the same. Some people are mostly attracted to the same sex. Get married and have kids anyways. Or live a sexless life. Post-disclaimer I think that he finds a way to avoid supporting discrimination while not changing his moral argument, which consequentially makes it a far more moral argument than Card's.
