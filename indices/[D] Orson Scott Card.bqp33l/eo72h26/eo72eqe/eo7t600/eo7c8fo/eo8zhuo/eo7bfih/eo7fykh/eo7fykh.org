It's hard to really actually run a fair hypothetical on "what if the Mormon church changed its views, tho" because in that case there would be significant /justification/ for saying "all right, the leaders of this church are themselves abandoning principle; these views are timeless and eternal and were never open to debate; this is no longer true Mormonism." And that justification would not necessarily have /anything whatsoever/ to do with a secret deep-seated bigotry (though a secret deep-seated bigotry would certainly be /sufficient,/ it's also far from /necessary)./

To put it another way, this is the inconvenient side of the AI/agent foundations concept that values work to sustain themselves, and Gandhi wouldn't willingly take a pill to remove his revulsion around violence because then he might be more likely to be violent, and he finds that repulsive.
