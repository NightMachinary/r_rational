This is also true. I think, though, that if someone's sticking point for "This is no longer True Mormonism" is changes in gay marriage, but not equality for black people, it's a pretty safe bet for homophobia.

Not absolutely, of course; they might just think the reasoning in one hand is sufficient while the other isn't, or felt the latter was a step too far and would have acted the same if the order of them was reversed, or if some other major belief was changed.

We can't know what's in other people's hearts. But after a certain point we do have to say we have "enough" justification to at least tentatively believe in one explanation, while holding ourselves open to other explanations that might gather evidence.
