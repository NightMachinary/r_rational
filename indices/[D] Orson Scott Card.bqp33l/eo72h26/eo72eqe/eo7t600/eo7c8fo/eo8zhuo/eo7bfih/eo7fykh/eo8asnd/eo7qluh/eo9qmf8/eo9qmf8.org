  I think, though, that if someone's sticking point for "This is no longer True Mormonism" is changes in gay marriage, but not equality for black people, it's a pretty safe bet for homophobia.

There's a lot more historical precedent for "sexuality is regulated by God/society" than color-based racism though. Maybe not in Mormonism, which was racist from the get-go, but even the earliest Mormons still came from a Judeo/Christian social background.

The whole "black people can't be priests because they were cowardly souls in the spirit realm" stuff was invented and then disavowed in a 150 year span. Religious and societal regulation of sexuality, including forbidding homosexuality, has been around a really long time.

Not that it would make SENSE to trust in the Mormon church on one but not the other, because it wouldn't, either the current President is a real prophet or not, that's pretty foundation to the religion. I'm just saying the two issues aren't exactly equivalent.
