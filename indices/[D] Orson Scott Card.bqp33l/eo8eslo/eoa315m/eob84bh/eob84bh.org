I think that's one of the biggest mistakes of the modern left, honestly. This over reliance on naive consequentialism: "My logical error is not as bad as your error because it does not hurt as many people". It doesn't work that way. The reason I'm calling it the same phenomenon is because that kind of lazy thinking is the exact what's causing so much needless pain and misery in the world right now.

Let me ask you a question: Do you really believe that this person I quoted does not also have prejudices about minorities? That they do not call right-wing black people Uncle Toms, maybe? That they do not talk about needing to protect our fragile women, or call right-wingers virgins and closet homosexuals as an insult? How on earth are we supposed to get people to become wiser, if some kinds of prejudice are considered 'not that bad' or 'not really bigotry' just because it's coming from people on our side? And yet wherever I go, those kinds of comments get excused by intelligent, thoughtful left-wing people, purely out of partisanship.

Ironically enough, it was the New Atheists who were originally accused of that kind of thinking, of worshipping blind utilitarianism and replacing one kind of faith with another. But in reality it was the Social Justice types who rejected the New Atheists that ended up making that mistake - perhaps precisely because the New Atheists had been warned about it so many times. I certainly respect people like Sam Harris, or even Jordan Peterson who you mention, a lot more than those folks.
