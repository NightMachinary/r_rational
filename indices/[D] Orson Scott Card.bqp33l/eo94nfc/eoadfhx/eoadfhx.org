Hoo boy, that's a lot of poor reading comprehension and passive-aggressive insults. Let's take a crack at this and hope we're both arguing in enough good faith to resolve the apparent misunderstandings:

#+begin_quote
  The writer apparently went into this hoping to further understand someone he considered a "hero", only to realize that they held opposite opinions on some very key beliefs. The mental anguish of this discovery led to lashing out an accusing the person of insanity or mental degradation rather than accept the much more sane possibility that that person did not believe the same as the writer did.
#+end_quote

Right off the bat, your timeline is off: you're describing my initial reaction from almost a decade ago as if it was the impetus for this article. And you seem to have badly missed my point; my "mental anguish" as you put it was in fact over the contradiction between his personal beliefs and the themes of his stories. Others simply believing different things is trivially easy to accept; understanding why is where the challenge lies.

#+begin_quote
  This is the definition of 'bigotry' established by the writer. At no place is this established in relation to OSC.
#+end_quote

Right, which is why I ultimately concluded that I don't think he's a bigot other than in the run-of-the-mill religious sense. You should probably finish reading articles before you respond to them.

#+begin_quote
  OSC has expressed disagreements with things he does not believe in, and he has done it in ways less insulting than the original post.
#+end_quote

I guess you didn't read the articles I linked to either, where OSC is rather insulting to a number of people who disagree with him. More on that later.

#+begin_quote
  All people have justifications for what they believe. Is the original writer implying that this is not the case? It must be strange to discover that other people might have rational reasons for their beliefs, but it should not be a surprise.
#+end_quote

No, the original author was pointing out that giving a justification for a belief that others deserve inequality does not make them less someone who believes others deserve inequality. Is must be strange to discover that you misread something that simple, but try to update on that surprise!

#+begin_quote
  The amusing part is that OSC doesn't much seem to care, but observe the written trickery that seems to accuse OSC of racism despite not showing racist tendencies.
#+end_quote

OSC not caring about his church's historic and blatant racism is not a point in his favor. Insofar as you keep accusing me of potential shock, it may come as a shock to you that not all people with prejudice show overt "tendencies," but keeping silent about the inequality of black Mormons when he's otherwise so outspoken about his religion and society is a pretty big deal, imo.

#+begin_quote
  One comment that the writer disagrees with and falsely attributes to racism for OSC means that he is so, and thus also bigoted? Yeah, no. I'm sorry, but just because the writer believes that Bush is more stupid than Obama, it doesn't mean that OSC disagreeing with him means OSC is a bigoted racist.
#+end_quote

Didn't you say that OSC is less insulting toward people he disagrees with? I certainly didn't call OSC the "most bigoted writer in the world," while OSC called Obama "the stupidest president in history" on foreign policy. Seems pretty insulting to me.

But more importantly, it wasn't just that one comment. It's clear you didn't read any of the articles I linked to, but I quoted multiple parts from that one. Why are you just picking one comment out and ignoring the others?

#+begin_quote
  That's not rational. That's not even partially reasonable.
#+end_quote

I'm glad you enjoy my stories, but I do hope you read them more carefully than you did this :)
