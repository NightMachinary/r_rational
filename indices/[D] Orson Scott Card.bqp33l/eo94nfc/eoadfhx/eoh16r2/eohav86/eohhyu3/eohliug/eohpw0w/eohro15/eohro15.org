Nah, nah, fuck it, I was doing the point by point thing again and actually thought we were getting closer to understanding, but then you said this

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    It's math. You said one. There was more than one.
  #+end_quote

  Oh. I see. You have no point, so it's about semantics. By all means, keep doing that to cover up a lack of any evidence whatsoever.
#+end_quote

And I deleted all I wrote, because we're in the briar patch. Here comes the condescension, and there go any fucks I have about hurting your feelings or what you think of me.

Its not semantics, kid. You're just wrong. Mathematically speaking, you fucked up. You're not just misrepresenting my arguments, you can't even fucking count them.

I cited /multiple examples/ from the article of what Card said.

#+begin_quote
  And then he wrote Unlikely Events, where, in regards to foreign policy, Obama is called “the dumbest president in history” not 5 years after Bush left office. You know, the guy who started the worst military blunder since the Vietnam war with no exit plan and caused massive instability in the region. No, it's not better that Card named white guys who have never held office as runnerups; somehow it's still America's first black president who has that honor.

  Do I think he would have said that if Obama wasn't black?

  Do I think he would say that “Obama is, by character and preference, a dictator” if Obama wasn't black?

  Do I think he would “imagine” (all in good fun, of course, haha, it's just me Card the kooky science fiction writer imagining things that definitely won't happen the way we science fiction writers do) Obama turning “young out-of-work urban men” into a national police force to maintain his dictatorship if Obama wasn't black?

  Or that he would say “Having been anointed from the start of his career because he was that magical combination --- a black man who talks like a white man (that's what they mean by calling him “articulate” and a “great speaker”) --- he has never had to work for a living, and he has never had to struggle to accomplish goals. He despises ordinary people, is hostile to any religion that doesn't have Obama as its deity, and his contempt for the military is complete.” if not?
#+end_quote

You ignored /all but one/:

#+begin_quote
  *One comment* that the writer disagrees with and falsely attributes to racism for OSC means that he is so, and thus also bigoted? Yeah, no. I'm sorry, but just because the writer believes that Bush is more stupid than Obama, it doesn't mean that OSC disagreeing with him means OSC is a bigoted racist.
#+end_quote

And keep insisting that your reading comprehension isn't abysmal despite doing it again, without even fucking checking:

#+begin_quote
  He called Obama the most stupid on foreign policy. You disagreed, and then went on to somehow claim this was 'proof' of his racism, through an illogical chain of supposition. Did you provide any others? No? Alright then.
#+end_quote

1 < X. It's not semantics, it's you ignoring data that doesn't fit your argument. As I said in my very first response where I pointed this out to you, using your own words: "That's not rational. That's not even partially reasonable."

You don't want to own your mistakes, you're not worth my time. Smell ya later.
