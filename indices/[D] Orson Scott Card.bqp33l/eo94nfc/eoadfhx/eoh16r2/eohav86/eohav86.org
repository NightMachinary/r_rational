  The latter certainly describes the initial article, yes.
#+end_quote

Oh come on, this doesn't even make sense! If you want to pretend you're rubber and I'm glue, you can't just go for the easy reversals. What about the original post is "passive aggressive?" You didn't even point out anything of OSC's that I quoted incorrect! /sighs/ Alright, what else we got...

#+begin_quote
  The repeated backhanded insults and passive-aggressiveness on the part of your response indicates that you are not actually attempting to argue in good faith.
#+end_quote

Well this is rather hypocritical of you. I didn't assert that your tone was indicative of arguing in bad faith, why are you assuming mine is? If you cut me, do I not bleed? Should I be a robot, here for you to rock and sock, while I politely point out your errors in a meek and pleading tone? I'll try that next, if this doesn't work.

(Seriously, this is getting fun, and I'm guessing you weren't there for when I unloaded on Sufficient Velocity forums when they were insulting rationalists, so as a warning I tend to get more and more bombastic when I sense people are up for a verbal spar. If it gets too spicy, let's hop out of here and hash it out over skype or discord or something, alright? I think it's too easy to be antagonistic over text, or read antagonism from snark)

#+begin_quote
  The article is inexorably linked to the original experience. It was unpleasant for you then. You decided to go into more detail
#+end_quote

Over 10 years later.

#+begin_quote
  and found that it was even more so at the later point in time.
#+end_quote

Where did I indicate that? I guess it was exasperating and disappointing, but by "unpleasant" you're linking back to "mental anguish," which does not describe the fairly calm and analytical frame of mind I was in when writing this article.

#+begin_quote
  Nothing in the portion you quoted was factually incorrect.
#+end_quote

Hmm, let's look again:

"The writer (that's me) apparently went into this (this being this article) hoping to further understand someone he considered a "hero" (incorrect, that was 10 years aog) only to realize that they held opposite opinions on some very key beliefs (still 10 years ago)."

Now you could argue that you meant "this" as "this whole endeavor of looking into any of OSC's beliefs at all at any point ever," but see, that's a pretty big sleight of hand trick, because when you say this:

#+begin_quote
  Part of the impetus for your 'deep dive' was previous discoveries. Part of the purpose of the article was to interpret and explain your findings in a way meant to convince others of your point of view. If A = B, and B = C, then A = C.
#+end_quote

You're using some pretty slippery assertions to set up an inexorable logical chain that implies that my motivation and state of mind from 10 years ago unquestionably biased the research and writing of this article that you're responding to. "Part of the," "part of the..." These statements are meaningless without the assumption of linked mental anguish between the me from 10 years ago and the me from Sunday. You're stating assumptions, not things "factually correct," as A =/= B, and so A =/= C.

What was that phrase you used? "Propagandistic persuasion!" Good show. Next!

#+begin_quote
  "I decided he's not a bigot, except that he's a different kind of bigot". I did finish the article, thank you for the false assumption that I did not.
#+end_quote

Well when you state something so blatantly wrong, what else should I assume? That you're lying? If you disagree with the idea that someone can hold religious beliefs that are bigoted without being a bigot themselves, you should have just said that, and we'd be having a bit of a different discussion!

#+begin_quote
  I did. I would assume you would try to be better than him. If you are saying you are the same, or that it's OK that you do it because he does, then criticizing him for things you yourself do is hypocrisy.
#+end_quote

Nice dodge, but no. I'm planting a flag here; are you admitting you were mistaken, or not?

Don't shift the goalposts and try to make this about my attitude, I'm happy to justify that later, but not until you admit that what you said, and I quote, "OSC has expressed disagreements with things he does not believe in, and he has done it in ways less insulting than the original post," is factually inaccurate, unless you are honestly going to sit there (or stand, or lay down, I don't know your life) and try to argue that calling someone the stupidest President in history on foreign policy is "less insulting" than saying someone isn't bigoted, but their religious beliefs are, which again I defined as “false beliefs about a specific demographic that knowingly disadvantage or cause harm to that demographic.”

(Not to mention all the other stuff he said, which again, you're not showing any evidence that you read, not just about Obama being a dictator by character, or being a contemptuous person, but also the insults he's heaped on liberals and climate scientists and Mormons who disagreed with him... but let's put all that aside, unless you want to earn extra points)

I'll wait here before going further on this post, or else this point will get lost. I should warn you, I /really/ dislike it when people avoid responsibility for their mistakes in arguments like this: it's all good fun until you show no integrity, and then the gloves come off :)
