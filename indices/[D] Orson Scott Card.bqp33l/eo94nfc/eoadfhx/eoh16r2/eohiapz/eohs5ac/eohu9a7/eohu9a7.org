Jesus Non-existent Christ you're slow. Pro-tip, when someone tells you you didn't read something carefully enough and you believe that you're actually arguing in good faith, you have to actually go and reread the article so you don't get caught out by simple shit like this. I was pointing this out from my very first response to you. You got so busy mocking 1 < X and playing "gotcha" when I put a mirror up to your shit that you clearly never stopped to think "Hey, maybe I'm the asshole who actually didn't read carefully enough like he keeps saying."
