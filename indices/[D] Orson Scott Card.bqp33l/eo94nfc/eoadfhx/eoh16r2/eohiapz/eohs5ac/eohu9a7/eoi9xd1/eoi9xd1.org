  esus Non-existent Christ you're slow. Pro-tip, when someone tells you you didn't read something carefully enough and you believe that you're actually arguing in good faith, (etc etc)

Or, and I know this will be difficult for you, it's entirely possible that writing takes /time/, and while /you/ are focused on a single point (and try to ignore absolutely everything else since you finally have what you think is a "gotcha" moment that makes you right in everything), the other person could be writing their own stuff to prior replies you made.

Right before Reddit goes down for maintenance.

Pro-Tip: Ignoring everything doesn't make it go away. I'll address your other one when I have the chance, but for now life gets the first half of my day.
