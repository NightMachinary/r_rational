  Hoo boy, that's a lot of poor reading comprehension and passive-aggressive insults.
#+end_quote

The latter certainly describes the initial article, yes.

#+begin_quote
  Let's take a crack at this and hope we're both arguing in enough good faith to resolve the apparent misunderstandings
#+end_quote

The repeated backhanded insults and passive-aggressiveness on the part of your response indicates that you are not actually attempting to argue in good faith.

#+begin_quote
  you're describing my initial reaction from almost a decade ago as if it was the impetus for this article.
#+end_quote

The article is inexorably linked to the original experience. It was unpleasant for you then. You decided to go into more detail, and found that it was even more so at the later point in time. Nothing in the portion you quoted was factually incorrect. You did that once. Part of the impetus for your 'deep dive' was previous discoveries. Part of the purpose of the article was to interpret and explain your findings in a way meant to convince others of your point of view. If A = B, and B = C, then A = C.

#+begin_quote
  Right, which is why I ultimately concluded that I don't think he's a bigot other than in the run-of-the-mill religious sense. You should probably finish reading articles before you respond to them.
#+end_quote

"I decided he's not a bigot, except that he's a different kind of bigot". I did finish the article, thank you for the false assumption that I did not.

#+begin_quote
  I guess you didn't read the articles I linked to either, where OSC is rather insulting to a number of people who disagree with him. More on that later.
#+end_quote

I did. I would assume you would try to be better than him. If you are saying you are the same, or that it's OK that you do it because he does, then criticizing him for things you yourself do is hypocrisy.

#+begin_quote
  No, the original author was pointing out that giving a justification for a belief that others deserve inequality does not make them less someone who believes others deserve inequality. Is must be strange to discover that you misread something that simple, but try to update on that surprise!
#+end_quote

You call his beliefs bigoted. Then you point out how "bigots" always try to defend their beliefs. *ALL* people try to defend their beliefs. It must be strange for you to misread something so simple.

#+begin_quote
  OSC not caring about his church's historic and blatant racism is not a point in his favor.
#+end_quote

Why? Why are you trying to make the discussion about something /else/ than the supposed "bigotry" on his beliefs of same-sex marriage? If you can't provide enough evidence of a thing to prove your point, do you /often/ try to start other arguments or make commentary on other subjects in an obvious attempt to poison the readers view toward the person? You know, instead of having evidence?

Do you clump all forms of "bigotry" together in a mass and assume that if one trait is shown, all the others must as well? You do realize the fallacious nature of such an argument, yes?

#+begin_quote
  but keeping silent about the inequality of black Mormons when he's otherwise so outspoken about his religion and society is a pretty big deal, imo.
#+end_quote

Yes. In /your/ opinion, it's a very big deal. He apparently doesn't think much of it. Is such an equality still long-standing and pervasive? Do they continue to hold a person's race against them religiously? Are they oppressing such people now? Or is this a solution in need of a problem, when the original organization has since moved on?

Why are you trying to make past views of the religion he belongs to a negative slander on a man who is indifferent to it? Is he not allowed to believe differently? Are all religious people within a certain religion in 100% alignment with each other on every single view?

See, for anyone else, it's a situation of "His religion believes something we may consider bigoted, but the man himself seems not to believe that". Somehow, you want to make this a negative thing, and there is little reason to do so unless you are trying to make him look bad.

#+begin_quote
  Didn't you say that OSC is less insulting toward people he disagrees with? I certainly didn't call OSC the "most bigoted writer in the world," while OSC called Obama "the stupidest president in history" on foreign policy. Seems pretty insulting to me.
#+end_quote

Nice dodge. I notice you avoided the key part, but that's fine. Yes. Obama was pretty insanely stupid on foreign policy. At least Bush can blame the fact that Congress *voted* for that retarded war, but everything Obama has done is on his own hands.

But see, none of this matters, because it's all a distraction on your part. *You* disagree with OSC on his political beliefs about our previous President. Because he disagrees, /you/ decided to call him racist, despite lacking any proof of such whatsoever, merely your own implications. Implications with zero evidence.

#+begin_quote
  but I quoted multiple parts from that one. Why are you just picking one comment out and ignoring the others?
#+end_quote

/Looks up at your entire series of very specific cut replies to my own post/

Funny, that.

#+begin_quote
  m glad you enjoy my stories, but I do hope you read them more carefully than you did this :)
#+end_quote

Exactly as you treat OSC. Your stories are good. When you're trying to tell a rational tale, you do it well.

In reality, however, you are far less rational than you think, and while it is disappointing to discover that you're just a normal, flawed, emotion-driven human being like the rest of us, I didn't really expect anything different.

Please, though, do /not/ stop writing your stories. You have a talent, and you should continue using it and sharpening it. If you think about it, you've learned much and grown thanks to OSC's works, despite your disgust with the reality of the man. Others may end up growing from your works as well, despite their dislike of your personal beliefs.
