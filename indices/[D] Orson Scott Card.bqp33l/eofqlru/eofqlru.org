One nitpick, just wanted to point out that you seem to be painting the intellectual darkweb with one brush. As a movement it leans right of center on average, but they have liberals as well as conservatives. When they talk about the intolerant left, they're not saying all leftists are intolerant, they're specifically referring to the /intolerant/ left, the extremist part which has come to dominate much of liberal culture and which bullies, silences and excommunicates anyone who disagrees with the tiniest part of their ideology. Or at least that's what a lot of them mean, it probably varies a lot. The intellectual darkweb's main if not only unifying goal is free speech and free intellectual discourse, and they came about largely as a reaction to censorship and persecution of dissenters by the left, which has moved a lot of civil and reasonable conversations outside the Overton window. Aside from that, I dont think there's anything else that everyone in the intellectual darkweb agrees on.

I agree with everything else you said in your article though.
