I get that and agree with some people in the IDW, but honestly find the group's concept as a whole a little absurd, and their attitude largely counterproductive. They're all fairly famous people who still spend time complaining about how they're censored, when what they actually mean is that the things they say often get negative reactions (often for bad reasons, but still). Fringe leftists yelling at people who disagree with them is no different from fringe rightists doing the same; it's just an unfortunate part of the territory. I disagree that it's come to dominate much of liberal culture, but mostly because I think people are bad at noticing gradients of poorly communicated ideas vs actual hateful beliefs.

Two articles I find I agree a lot with on the topic:
