[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas][Lawrence v Texas]] would hardly have reached the supreme court in 2003 if sodomy laws were not being enforced. For that particular case, the arrest and original conviction came in 1998.

So yes, it was illegal, and was being prosecuted back then. To what extent, I'm not prepared to say, but even if it was limited, the fact that it was prosecuted at all has a pretty clear chilling effect.
