I am not super knowledgable about Mormonism, but don't they support a husband having multiple wives? In that case, there's a gender imbalance, and that could be fixed by having celibate (or gay men) attached to such a family. I think there are definitely possibilities of a doctrine where gay relationship is allowed and fertility is an important virtue.
