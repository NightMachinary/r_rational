It is different within the framework of Mormonism, tho. Even when blacks were disallowed the priesthood (~lay clergy) there was a corpus of doctrine that stated this was a temporary measure--from the perspective of eternity, I suppose. It was supposed to be in force so long as the world existed, and then be lifted in the afterlife (so much for that), so merely "moving the timeline" on that is at least doctrinally /compatible/, if obviously not socially until the time it happened. How much of this is a post-hoc cover up is left as an exercise to the reader.

On the other hand I'm not sure what Watsonian justification would be used to permit for homosexual marriages, since so much of the lore insists that marriage and having children is something that continues into the afterlife and thus requires both sexes. It seems to me this is something the church will stand on, as they don't (doctrinally) have any other choice.
