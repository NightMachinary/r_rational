Pretty much. China actually /did/ that... the thing that was slightly suspicious in OSC's portrayal of it IMHO was how much stress it put on it being fundamentally persecutory towards Christians. It would be part of any real two-child policy in the West, of course, but he made it sound like somehow /of course/ Christians would be persecuted, everyone hates them. It's the sort of victimism detached from reality you often see in those political areas. But again, without context, it'd have been hard to tell if it was deliberate or not, or what did it mean.
