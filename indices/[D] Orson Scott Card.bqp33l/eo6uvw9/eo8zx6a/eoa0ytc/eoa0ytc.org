I think it does, actually, but like I said in the OP, I get that from the perspective of those being punched or those only concerned with stopping people from being punched, it might look academic.

To me though, understanding the root of something is intrinsic to being able to prevent or stop it. Kind of a big part of being a therapist; if you can't differentiate between different kinds of internals states that result in harmful behavior, you're not really going to be able to find the best responses.
