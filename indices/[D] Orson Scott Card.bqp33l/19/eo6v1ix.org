It's interesting to see how people who confess themselves to being rational can otherwise rationalize themselves into positions whereby they make excuses for someone in whom they are emotionally invested.

I really like the Enders game series, even the bean series which were a little on the nose in regards to its overt religiosity. But I can divorce my distaste for Card as an author from how much I like his books. It's seems as though /two/ rational authors here can't. It's a shame really.
