  Is it so hard to believe that bigots can write good literature?

Writing good literature is one thing, I think the amazing thing is reading someone espousing principles that if they /minimally applied to their own beliefs would send their whole world upside down/. The cognitive dissonance and irony can reach amazing levels (and I say this having read only Ender's Game, and yes, you could definitely see /some/ of his weird beliefs in it, e.g. the paranoia towards a tyrannical state that limits the number of children people can have).
