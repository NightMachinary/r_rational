Is it so hard to believe that bigots can write good literature?

Ender's Game is brilliant, but it did not surprise me at all when Card turned out to be a bigot. His beliefs about traditional gender rules are pretty evident in his work, including in Ender's game. Look at Valentine. Look at Petra, very clearly painted as an exception. I can't remember the exact quote but the text even explicitly makes statements to the effect of even though battle school is co ed in practice girls just don't make it into the program, can't fight millions of years of evolution. If your eyes are open to it you can see the sexism right there on the page.

If you were surprised when Scott turned out to be this way, it only means that at whatever age you read Ender's game the things he wrote did not stand out as objectionable to you yet (this is pretty understandable). For those who are still surprised, i recommend re-reading the stories, with an adult, modern eye.

Same with CS Lewis, who is mentioned here, his work is explicitly religious obviously but it's easy to see racism in the depiction of the Calormen if you're open to seeing it. There was an entire passage on washing off blackface that they used to disguise themselves and being "white Narnians" again.

Edit: I have located the exact quote

#+begin_quote
  "A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them. None of them will be like Valentine, anyway. But there'll be brothers there, Ender."
#+end_quote

This, in no way undermines that he wrote an amazing story. It's possible to be both sexist and a good writer. It's possible that /work you like/ contains sexism and racism or was written by someone like that. To be...not just surprised, but shocked...I get it, I don't mean to deny the feeling of betrayal

(I guess I'm a bit bitter about people who feel betrayed only /now/ as adults, because /I/ was betrayed right then, as a child, reading those words on the page /stung/ right then and there, to realize that the evil calormen were meant to depict /my people/, the people who were to weak for battle school were /women/, and I'm not a woman but... it still jumped out, in part because I wasn't necessarily mature enough to dismiss it as just bigotry, part of me was worried it might in fact be the /horrible truth/ of the matter)

...but it says more about our denial about how pervasive racism and sexism are, as if they are the property of some dark corner of our culture rather than /the overwhelming default/. I think it's safe to say /the majority/ of the work one personally enjoys and draws inspiration from contains some problematic stuff, because the majority of work in general contains it.
