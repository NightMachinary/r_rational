Yeah I don't really get this obsession with the internal reality of awful people.

Does it really matter if OSC's internal reality is that of a bigot, or if he's just a p-zombie who acts like a bigot? Does it change anything?

There was a similar theme in the documentary about Theranos. It spends a lot of its runtime obsessing over whether or not Elizabeth Holmes knew that she was lying. Is that really something that's worthwhile to examine?
