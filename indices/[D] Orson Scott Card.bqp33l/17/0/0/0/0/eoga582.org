  Only because theists view any expression of doubt towards their beliefs as a personal attack.

Also because it would be like dogpiling, I think, since multiple people have already said what I would say.

  How did you lose your belief?

Part of the Mormon experience is going on a two-year proselyting "mission." I started when I was twenty. I was kind of wishy-washy but I still believed (in my first six months I even wrote a small book about why God didn't care about homosexuality, with an analysis of every halfway-relevant verse in our scriptural canon, which is larger than the standard Christian set), and about six months in, I fell in with a crowd of...I'm not sure how to term them. "Fundamentalists" gives the wrong impression, "Literalists" is in some ways correct but overall is probably the wrong term because I believed that (1) even our most prized scriptures could have been translated incorrectly and (2) it was all written by imperfect humans, who had definitely experienced the divine but didn't always know how to express it and, as well, sometimes had their own agenda or were otherwise Unreliable Narrators.

We took scripture /seriously/. Let's put it that way. Some of us were fundies, sure, but that wasn't our unifying characteristic.

Anyway, that's where I was at the end of my mission, believing that the prophets and apostles living today had seen Jesus face-to-face, that atoms were self-aware (look up Brian Tomasik if you want to see a nontheist treatment of that idea), and that even cockroaches had the spark of godhood in them. During this time I also became a hardcore pacifist and a socialist (the former died down quite a bit after my deconversion, since a large part of it had to do with God saying that pacifism was the way to go, but I'm still more socialist than not), and near the end of my mission (last six months or so) I got into Mormon Transhumanism, which is some pretty weird but neat stuff.

The problem with taking your religion really seriously, though, is that you can't keep doing that and ignore the problems that you notice. For people who were supposedly on first name terms with Jesus and God the Father, the Church's leaders were acting in some pretty un-Christlike ways.

General red flags included a slow drift away from the original doctrines of the Church in favor of becoming, basically, Weird Protestants; supporting various political causes that were totally at odds with Christ's teachings (hello, Iraq War); and spending millions of dollars on nice-looking temples while people are starving and dying of easily preventable diseases.

These and other matters troubled me during my mission (and before, to be honest), and this only grew over time. The breaking point came when I found out that the Church ran a hunting ground, the Westlake Hunting Preserve, that didn't just support itself but /made money/ for the Church: the sin of Cain wasn't just murdering Abel but doing it to get Abel's flocks, or "spilling blood to make cash," to paraphrase a Hugh Nibley passage I can't remember word for word anymore (Nibley is one of the big scholars within Mormonism). Now, the animals being slain here weren't people, and you might think that gave the Church a pass, but our earlier prophets (in modern times) had in no uncertain terms said that animals were important too. Several of them had even condemned sport hunting specifically: hunting for food was okay, but hunting when when you had other ways to get food was just killing because you enjoyed it.

It was as if the Catholic Church not only owned Playboy Magazine but had drifted so far over the past century that your average Catholic wouldn't understand why you were disturbed by this fact. Once upon a time many Mormons believed that it was a sin to kill a fly if the fly's only crime was being a nuisance to you, and now we were making money from the shedding of innocent blood.

My doubts had been growing up to that point, but that conclusively proved for me that the Church's truth claims couldn't be valid. They could not be currently led by God and be effectively profiting off of murder.

Other religions have ways to get around this, but it's a basic tenet of Mormonism that this is the last “dispensation” (era when there is a church in existence that acts with God's authority) and that not only is this Church led by God, but it will never fade away or be corrupted like previous dispensations. This meant that if the current prophet was not led by God then the Church had /never/ been led by God and Joseph Smith had not been visited by angels. If that was the case, though, then the argument for e.g. Jesus looked thinner than it did the day before, because there was some stuff about Joseph Smith that still seems a little weird to me, and if that could pile up around a guy whose life was pretty well documented then who knows what was made up or exaggerated about somebody living two thousand years ago.

At this point, all my faith in God ultimately rested on Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. Here was some Weird Shit that couldn't be explained well except through the existence of the divine, you know? Except, once I saw how present-day Mormonism effectively refuted itself, it became apparent that I really just hadn't tried hard enough to explain the Weird Shit.

I'm not sure what I would have done without that experience. It was clear, at that point, that I was already performing some pretty amazing philosophical yoga moves, trying to bend the theology in all sorts of ways to keep it from contradicting either itself or what I knew scientifically, so there might have been a breaking point somewhere further down the line. On the other hand, maybe I would have just doubled down.

I tried to dodge the ethical concerns of supporting the Church by separating it from "the Gospel" or the doctrines and supporting only the latter, but the sport hunting thing just sent it all crashing down. If I had been, say, Jewish, I'd probably still be a Weird Theist (or at least Deist) because it wouldn't be as easy for me to come across a hard contradiction that sends the whole artifice falling down, and I was definitely suffering from motivated reasoning.

I really like Mormonism at its best. It's got some flaws, like various inaccurate truth claims, but its earlier prophets had a top notch ethical system, at least in some places, and I have a soft spot for anybody, past or present, who tries to build a utopian community. Looking at Mormonism as it used to be, seeing how it is now, and being able to imagine how it might have been if events had gone differently, I'm still angry at everyone who decided to take the low road and turn the Church into what it is today. It could have been a real force for good and, besides that, I'm not a terribly good rationalist: I might not believe the truth claims of Mormonism, but there are aspects of it which I miss terribly and cause me to wish, every now and then, that I had somehow been able to keep making those logical contortions.
