"makes milk, live births, has hair" versus "lays eggs, has feathers" is not always a distinction that /matters/, though, and for the purposes of a ritual I'm not sure I would care. I mean, I'm not entirely sure why I'd have endless rituals /anyway/, but if I did command my followers to have endless rituals, then I'd probably care less about the taxonomic categories devised thousands of years hence than I would about whatever is meaningful to my followers.
