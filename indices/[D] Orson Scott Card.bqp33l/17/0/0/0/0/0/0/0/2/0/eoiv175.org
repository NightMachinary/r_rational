  The opinions of prophets are often just opinions, like anyone else's - Brigham Young in particular believed a lot of wrong things, but no president of the church ever was or claimed to be speaking for God 24/7.

It sure is convenient how generations of consistent prophetic direction can be written of as “just the opinions of men” every time that direction becomes troublesome for us.

  And I already addressed the waste question

“sheddeth blood OR wasteth flesh” FFS man this is not college-level reading. Don't kill /anything/ if you don't have to kill it.

Even if you do find that passage unclear, we've got, as I keep saying, generations of prophets saying /sport hunting is bad, guys, sport hunting is bad./

  I think you're overextending what people have actually said; can you provide citations from Brigham Young et al to clarify?
#+end_quote

I can but not I'm not going to. As I said before, I initially replied to you for the sake of third-party observers. I've already seen how you debate, and I'm not going to waste my time. I don't actually care whether you stay in the church or leave it, after all.
