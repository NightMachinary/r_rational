  It is certain...

  There's no question about that.

Well whaddya want me to say? We're not arguing over whether pink or purple is the prettiest color, or whether buffalo wings are better with ranch or blue cheese. Not everything is a matter of belief or opinion, some things are simply matters of fact. It is a matter of fact that the Jews were never slaves in Egypt. I can't soften that or water it down in any way.

Once again, there's nothing else I can say. The bible makes all the claims of Genesis (the creation, the flood, Babel) and those claims are simply false. The earth is 4.5 billion years old and was formed along with the rest of the planets by the accretion/consolidation of the sun's protoplanetary disk. Life popped up about a billion years later, mammals a further three and a quarter billion years after that, and humans a paltry 200,000 years ago. If the bible's claims run counter to this, then it's not a question, the accuracy of the bible is simply false.

There are other factual claims.

The census mentioned in the gospels happened in real life. It didn't require a single person to return to the town of their birth, much less /literally every citizen/. IRL that would've collapsed the Roman economy. Also, that census happened in 6CE. Herod was a real/documented historical figure and he died in 4BCE. Matthew says Jesus was born during the reign of Herod. Luke says it was during the census.

Leviticus flat out states as fact that the bat is a bird. Birds are dinosaurs. Bats are mammals. The /humans/ who wrote that book didn't know enough about the world to understand that "Wings =/= Bird."

  thoroughly and irrevocably convinced

Well, yeah. That's a statement of fact. All I have seen of the world has led me to be convinced that there wasn't a real Jesus. Just like it's a statement of fact that all /you/ have seen of the world has led /you/ to be convinced that there /was/ a real Jesus.
