...That he left the church, ultimately, because the opinion of one person (B. H. Roberts) could be extrapolated into something that disagrees with current church practice (but which extrapolation I doubt Brother Roberts would have endorsed)?

I don't have a problem with someone choosing to be vegetarian, but really, "Cain murdering Abel is wrong, therefore the church owning a game preserve is wrong" is rather a non sequitur. He'd have a stronger case - albeit not a proper comparison to murder of humans - if the animals were just being wasted, which /is/ unscriptural, but IIUC that's not how Westlake is meant to operate; hunters are expected to take their kills with them.
