Thanks for posting, was an interesting read. I've thought about this before in the past as well, Orson Scott Card is an amazing author and the extended Enders Game series is one of my favorite series of all time, but some of thing things he says at times outside of his books seem unnecessarily fanatical.

It's complicated because for me Orson Scott Card is in a weird limbo where he's not quite hurtful enough with the things he says to fit neatly in the category of hateful bigot but also not quite innocent enough to perceive him as a merely misguided but otherwise pious and loving man. Most people I know about seem to lean more heavily towards these extremes but Card seems to have found some sort of awkward middle ground. At the end of the day I've had to accept that while I believe his ideas are harmful, I've ever read from him can reasonably be construed as hate speech so he has as much right as anyone else to free speech. And as you say, you can always appreciate his books independently from the flaws of the author.
