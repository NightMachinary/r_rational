  Of course all the examples you name in your post are w.r.t. right wing views, but I actually think that the refusal to acknowledge different kinds of bigotry is itself a form of left-wing bigotry.

Agreed, though the word "bigotry" to apply to it feels muddying, even if I know what you mean. I think those left-wing people that said that to you are just kind of dumb and incapable of critical thinking in a way that leads to prejudice. Maybe I'm splitting hairs too fine though.
