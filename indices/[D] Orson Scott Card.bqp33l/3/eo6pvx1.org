A good read, though your take on his statements is far more benevolent than mine. Just because someone claims they want others to be kinder and more compassionate to their adversaries, doesn't mean they actually care. This bit in particular I found extremely chilling:

#+begin_quote
  “How long before married people answer the dictators thus: Regardless of law, marriage has only one definition, and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy. I will act to destroy that government and bring it down, so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage, and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn.”
#+end_quote

That's extreme, it's a call to arms that is very carefully worded to give the author plausible deniability. 'I didn't say people should destroy the government! I just asked how long till they would!'

To me, that level of vitriol makes his calls for compassion and kindness a lie.
