  To me, that level of vitriol makes his calls for compassion and kindness a lie.

To be fair, a lot of people are happy claiming that if the government should become tyrannical, a violent uprising would be the only proportionate response, if a painful one. I mean, the USA's /foundation myth/ is rooted exactly in that, right? The British being too oppressive and the brave, freedom-loving colonists (who owned slaves and wanted to keep them, but never mind) rising up against such indignity. Where things start getting blurred is where does everyone draw that line of 'tyranny'. For some it's banning abortion. For some it's banning gun ownership. And for some it's gonna be allowing gay marriage, however nonsensical and completely removed from reality that is.
