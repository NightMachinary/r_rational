I dont say this lightly, but what you just said demonstrates extreme ignorance about the actual concerns that idw people have.

Yes fringe people on both sides of the political aisle yell at those they dislike, and both the left and the right do some pretty awful things at times, to a fairly equal degree I think. But they have different styles. they dont always do the same awful things as each other. For instance, the right's approach to science it doesn't like is to publicly deny the science and ridicule scientists. Meanwhile the left's approach to science it doesnt like is instead to move the overton window so that the science it doesnt like isnt socially acceptable to publish in the first place and if possible infiltrate a field to help facilitate this. This makes it a lot harder to catch left science denial than right science denial, but I've read a lot of stuff about researchers whose universities refused to publish them for fear of backlash, or when they do publish they get backlash. Researchers sometimes get fired from universities for talking about their research.

And there are plenty of cases where people lose their jobs and livelihoods because of expressing the wrong political views. When someone's livelihood and reputation is put at stake over mere differences of opinion, even when those opinions arent prejudices, and the punishment is carried out without so much as a trial...

Furthermore, the leaders of a movement are not the whole movement. A movement can be popular and still be silenced at the same time. The famous and high status people are the ones who are able to speak their minds and get away unscathed. Most everyone else has to keep their mouths shut in public or face the consequences.

I would strongly recommend you read this slate star codex article, it might put some things into perspective:

Also, I strongly suspect that you haven't read much if any of the SSC articles criticizing the sjw movement. Many of them are very insightful and informative and I think he has a LOT of very valid points which many people arent willing to hear. For instance you can find some of them here:
