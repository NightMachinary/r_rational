I'm going to give you the opportunity to convince me of the truth of your book. What I /really/ want an answer about is "why should I believe that this book is divinely inspired?"

#+begin_quote
  Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man by sleeping with him. But all the young girls who have not known a man by sleeping with him, keep alive for yourselves.

Moses says that, not god. However,

#+begin_quote
  The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, â€œYou and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the ancestral houses of the congregation make an inventory of the booty captured, both human and animal."

  Then Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord had commanded Moses: The booty remaining from the spoil that the troops had taken totaled six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep, seventy-two thousand oxen, sixty-one thousand donkeys, and thirty-two thousand persons in all, women who had not known a man by sleeping with him.

You know, chimpanzees attack rival tribes and kill all the males keeping all the women for themselves.

The book looks exactly like it would look if god was invented by a bunch of primitive warlords and modeled after their own behavior. The behaviors and commands of god are primitive and infantile and psychopathic.

#+begin_quote
  Samaria shall bear her guilt, because she has rebelled against her God; they shall fall by the sword, their little ones shall be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open.
#+end_quote

That is a quote directly attributed to god.

So. Given that this book looks /exactly/ like it would look if it were the work of primitive warlords justifying their territorial conquests, why should I believe that this book is divinely inspired?
