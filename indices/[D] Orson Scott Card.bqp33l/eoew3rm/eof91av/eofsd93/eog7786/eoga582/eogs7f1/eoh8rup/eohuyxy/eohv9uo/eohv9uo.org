The opinions of prophets are often just opinions, like anyone else's - Brigham Young in particular believed a lot of wrong things, but no president of the church ever was or claimed to be speaking for God 24/7.

And I already addressed the waste question and comparison to homicide. When you equate murder of humans with hunting of edible animals, I think you're overextending what people have actually said; can you provide citations from Brigham Young et al to clarify?
