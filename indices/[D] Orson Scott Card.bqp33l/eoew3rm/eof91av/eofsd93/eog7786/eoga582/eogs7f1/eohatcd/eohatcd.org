I'm going to see if I can accurately summarise the points you've raised that were incompatible with your belief in God (please correct me if I've substantially misinterpreted them, or missed something important).

- God punishing people who don't deserve punishment (it's not clear whether that remained a major concern for you, or whether it fell by the wayside eventually, but it was at least important to you at one stage);
- The Bible being of uncertain and mixed origin, with big question marks about the accuracy of substantial parts;
- In particular, doubts about the historical existence of Jesus of Nazareth;
- The world would exist the same without a god, therefore Occam's Razor says you shouldn't assume the existence of one.

Is that a fair summary?
