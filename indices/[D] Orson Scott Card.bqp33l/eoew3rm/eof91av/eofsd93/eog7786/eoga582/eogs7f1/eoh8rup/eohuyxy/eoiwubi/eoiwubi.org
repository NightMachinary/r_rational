  Anyway, I'll leave [[/u/ElizabethRobinThales]] to *their* thing.

I'm fine with either she/her or he/him.

IRL my name is Michael. Always has been, always will be. Michael is the one having the religious argument. If you see me participating in a legitimately serious/important conversation, I'm acting as myself.

But the name "Elizabeth" is a girl's name, so "she/her" is perfectly acceptable.
