Either way it's whatever. "He" is correct in the real world but "she" is easier to follow in a reddit conversation since it's referring to a feminine username. I don't care either way, and here 4 years after making the name up I sometimes wish I'd invented a male pseudonym instead, but I got it in my head to do it because JK Rowling used the name "Robert Galbraith" to write her crime/detective novels. Eh. Whatever though. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
