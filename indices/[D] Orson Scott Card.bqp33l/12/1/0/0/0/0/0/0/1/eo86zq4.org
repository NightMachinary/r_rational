I could certainly ask my bishop about that, and I'm quite sure he wouldn't object to the question. However, I doubt he'd have more answers than I would; if there were any official doctrine on the subject, I'd already know about it. The response I would expect is, We'll have to wait and see what God says if and when the issue comes up. But no one would criticise me for asking.

The only way I would expect church discipline is if I settled on a specific position, incompatible with church doctrine, and started preaching it to others.
