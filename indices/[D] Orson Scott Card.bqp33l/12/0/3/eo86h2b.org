  How do you support a religion with an obviously disproven/disprovable view of History? (I.E. Jewish people here, lots of European animals here pre-Columbian Exchange, worldwide flood.)

Sorry, I'm going to need you to expand on one of those; what do you mean by "Jewish people here"? (I'm going to assume for starters that you're in the USA, but what does the presence of Jews in the USA have to do with anything?)

Despite the personal views of some church members, even prominent members, there's actually no doctrinal problem with a local, rather than global, flood. And the Book of Mormon is definitely not a comprehensive history of ancient America, nor was it ever intended to be, so the possibility of other migrations is not a problem.
