It's not that /my/ words are indisputable, it's that /observable reality/ is indisputable. If you pick a fight with reality you lose by default. It's just a simple statement of fact that there wasn't a secret Jewish civilization in the Americas at the time of the Olmecs and the Mayans. Are you seriously pulling the "you weren't there in the past so you're just guessing and don't know for sure" card that creationists pull when they try to argue that dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time?
