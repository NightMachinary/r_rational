  Then why is the book of Mormon making claims in that area?
#+end_quote

It actually doesn't make very many historical claims. It's a religious history, with the authors explicitly and repeatedly stating that they left out most of the names and dates and places, because a) those things weren't the aim, and b) there wasn't room to write all of that.

There are a number of city names, but with no precise locations, only vague directions between them, and little indication of how such names might appear in writing, especially since Mesoamerican writing appears to be largely iconographic. Likewise the names of rulers, which would be even more of a needle in a haystack.

There are implications that the climate was quite warm, but that's not much to go on.

There are names of plants and animals, but exactly how they match up to the names we might use now is unclear. Still, the [[https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Basic_principles#Question:_What_is_an_anachronism.2C_and_what_should_be_borne_in_mind_when_assessing_the_Book_of_Mormon_.28or_any_other_text.29_for_supposed_.22anachronisms.22.3F][trend over time]] has been to discover that more and more of the claimed species did, in fact, exist.

If it helps, I'm quite willing to admit that there is insufficient historical/archaeological evidence to prove the authenticity of the Book of Mormon, although I could point out some remarkable guesses that Joseph Smith would have had to make in order to forge it. But ultimately, I haven't tried to prove it archaeologically, and as previously stated, I doubt that there can be enough certainty to either prove or disprove it that way.

The stated aim of the Book of Mormon was to testify of Jesus Christ and invite people to come to Him. It shouldn't be surprising at all that we don't learn very much detail from it about geography, language, architecture, or politics. It touches on all of those briefly, and more, but it never goes into real depth with any of them, because they're not the point.
