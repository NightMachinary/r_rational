  But for such a long passage of time, without a specific known location, with multiple cultures arising and then completely collapsing, in a climate not well suited to preserving artifacts, and with so few historical "landmarks", shall we say, in the Book of Mormon text

Yeah, that's a /super convincing argument/ coming from someone who, in response to being called out on not having any idea what we can or can't determine based on archaeology and anthropology and whatnot, offered up an apologetics website.

  My own [*opinion*] is that trying to prove either the truth or falsehood of the Book of Mormon by matching it up with historical records is a pointless endeavor.

Yes but you aren't qualified to hold an opinion on that topic, and the people who /are/ qualified to hold an opinion (/ie legitimate non-Mormon archaeologists and anthropologists and historians/) strongly disagree with you. I'm inclined to trust that /they/ know what they know better than /you/ know what they know.
