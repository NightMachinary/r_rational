In comparison to the Old World, /everyone/ is just guessing and doesn't know for sure. The Book of Mormon is a /religious/ history, recording the behavior of individual people and relatively small communities. Very little of its account was things that could leave traces millennia later. And it repeatedly states that that focus was deliberate. The authors would have considered that to be a waste of time and space, compared to their aim of inviting all to come unto Christ.

And really, I'm pretty sure the historical details are not all that important to you, either. Suppose we were to uncover an unimpeachable record of Mesoamerican religion around 500AD, with all possible tests proving it beyond reasonable doubt to be of ancient origin. Would you, because of its historical authenticity, take that record as a guide for how you should live your life? I think not.
