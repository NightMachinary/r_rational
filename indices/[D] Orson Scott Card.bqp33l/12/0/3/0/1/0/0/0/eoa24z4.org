I just want to back up [[/u/ElizabethRobinThales]] real quick and say... you're stating things that are just false. I don't have the time or inclination either to go into why and find all the evidence and reasons for why, and I'm sorry about that, but...

Is the most important thing you said here, and you should try to recognize that.

If you're sick, you ask a doctor. More than one, if you want to avoid mistakes or bias.

If your car is broken, you take it to a mechanic. More than one, if you think they're trying to cheat you.

If you don't understand archaeology, you ask archaeologists or look at their work.

There is no reason for you to try and defend Mormonism's version of history other than that you were (probably) raised to believe it. To the rest of the world, it's blatantly false because all the evidence is against it.

If you consider yourself any kind of rationalist (maybe you're just here for the entertaining stories, which is fine too), my suggestion is to head on over to [[/r/AskHistorians]] and try to open your mind to the idea that, like 99.99% of the planet's religious people, you're just believing what you were raised to believe because you were raised to, not because there's any better reason for you to believe it than them to believe their religious histories.
