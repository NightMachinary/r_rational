I'm not trying to be mean with these questions, but just honestly curious at beliefs in infallibility of things that are obviously fallible.

- Are the teachings of the Mormon church completely accurate? If so:

  - Do you follow the Church's stance on homosexuality? (It's a sin to them and you can be kicked out for it.) Why or why not?
  - Do you follow the Church's pre-1970ish views of Black people. If not, why didn't God reveal the truth earlier and save a lot of racism and discrimination?
  - How do you support a religion with an obviously disproven/disprovable view of History? (I.E. Jewish people here, lots of European animals here pre-Columbian Exchange, worldwide flood.)
  - How do you reconcile the Bible's non-violent version of Jesus with the Book of Mormon's one that [[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20?][burns and floods entire cities]]? If they're the same person, why are they worthy of worship rather than hatred for the act of destroying cities?
