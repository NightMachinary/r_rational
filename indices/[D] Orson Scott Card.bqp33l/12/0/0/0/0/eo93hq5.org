As a former Mormon, I can answer this one. Mormons explicitly reject the concept of Trinity, but Jehovah/YHWH in the Old Testament is Jesus before he came to earth and gained a mortal body. His father (aka The Father, aka Elohim) is a distinct entity, as is the Holy Spirit.

So I think the bit that's confusing you is the connection that to Mormons, YHWH =/= the Father. Elohim == the Father, Jehovah == Jesus, ??? == Holy Spirit.
