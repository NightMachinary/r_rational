The key to understanding Orson Scott Card is that he's a self-hating gay man with a tendency towards ephebophilia.

Watch video of him talking and he doesn't come across as straight... which isn't definitive, some straight men do have a camp affect, but still.

Now read the plot summary of his book Songmaster: [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songmaster]]

It's about a sexy young boy who is given drugs to delay his puberty and preserve his beautiful voice (a kind of castrato that in the world of the book is called a Songbird). He gets lots of sexual attention from older men, including a guard who is punished for groping him.

Here's how the book ends:

  Ansset eventually offers himself to the young man, saying, "I know what you want, and I'm willing". Josif lovingly brings the boy to his first climax. As Ansset experiences his first ever orgasm, he experiences enormous pain. The Songhouse drugs have almost killed him and he is forever impotent.

Orson Scott Card is always writing about pubescent boys, lots of naked wrestling in Ender's Game. He even makes up a sci-fi reason why the boy in Songbird stays pubescent but is technically over age.

Songbird is full of homoeroticism, but anyone who actually does any kind of gay stuff gets punished. Notice also how the enemy aliens in Ender's Game are called “Buggers”.

It's pretty clear that he's sublimating his own desires in his writing. He wants nothing more than to lovingly bring a young twink to climax, but that's so sinful for him to admit that, even when exploring his desires in fiction, he has to invent a contrived pretext where cumming from gay sex would cause terrible pain and suffering - which of course makes no sense; why would a drug that delays puberty make it hurt to have an orgasm?

No straight man would write a book like this, about the temptations of gay sex, because straight men aren't tempted to have gay sex. Only closeted gay men who have been forced to spend their entire life denying to themselves that they're gay.

I feel sorry for OSC. If he hadn't been born into such a conservative environment, he'd probably be a happy daddy bear with a husband half his age. Instead, he's had to force himself to father 5 children. The reason he's so against gay marriage and the idea that gay people are born that way is that he's spent his whole life fighting his own desires. If being gay is OK, if gay marriage is allowed, then it means all his battles mean nothing; he could have had companionship and intimacy with someone who he was actually attracted to, and his honeymoon wouldn't have been a grim charade of trying to hide his distaste for vagina.
