I don't think this comment is an example of rational argument. It doesn't even /try/ to disambiguate between "I think X for reason Y," "I think X just because," and "X is true." It doesn't meet my standard for worth engaging with beyond that, and I am wary of people who will agree with it because they like its conclusions rather than because they think it contains truth.
