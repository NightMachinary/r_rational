Sure, no prob.

​

"before I turned away from what seemed to be either the onset of dementia or a sad example of how people can calcify with old age. "

​

Is it possible that there is another reason, besides being brain damaged, that someone might disagree with you? Say them thinking that gay sex got you damned by a magic man in the sky, as their parents told them when they were growing up?

​

Here's another:

​

" (fun fact: Card studied archaeology before he gave it up for being “hard work”)"

​

Full stop, what is this? Like, why is dude being bad at archaeology going to help anyone learn anything from your post? What's fun about this fact? It seems like you are arguing that this disqualifies him from having an opinion about the Book of Mormon being true, but unless you are about to confess that you are writing this in between digs it seems like you maybe don't actually think only architects get to talk.

​

On an overall level, this is just a meandering take on labels, right?

​

Like, we know on the object level what Card does and will do. He makes it pretty clear. Being a writer, he isn't super bashful about saying stuff.

​

There's an old LW post about how it isn't worth it to beat yourself up about what labels are on stuff, if you agree on the underlying level. Like, 'tree falls in the forest with no one there makes no sound', both the sound guy and the no sound guy agree on all possible predictions, the whole debate is on the definition of 'no one there'.

​

So, like, Card's words tell us what to expect from him, and his actions back that up. Why are you tying yourself in knots trying to figure out if 'bigot', or 'holds bigoted beliefs', or 'has aligned himself with bigots' describes him? What describes him is what he says and does, and that is clear no matter what label it ends up stuck with.

​

A good trick to avoid doing this kind of stuff is to mentally put the person you are talking with/about on the praiseworthy side of a debate. Say it is the past, and OSC is obsessed with stopping people from smoking before that was cool.

​

You wouldn't write this about him then, right? You'd put his priors in place and work out where his beliefs came from, and what they implied, without all this random dunking on dude. You are mad smart, you'd do great at it.
