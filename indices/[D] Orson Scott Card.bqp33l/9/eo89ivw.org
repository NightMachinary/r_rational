I feel like you are overcomplicating something that is super simple.

​

Like, OSC is straight up 'love the sinner, hate the sin', vs gay people, yeah? This isn't like a complicated or nuanced viewpoint. He would help a gay person he found on the side of the road...right over into the church for some corrective therapy. Dude thinks gay sex is bad, because it costs you soul points, he'd like to help gay people conserve their soul points by doing less of it.

​

That's all that's going on. Millions of people are like this.

​

Also, like...you kind of veer into weird rationalist self parody in here. Read what you wrote over, but just imagine dude as holding a premise that you agree with, say he is an abolitionist or an anti smoking zealot back in the past, and I bet you'll recoil from the stuff you wrote.
