  It's hard to really actually run a fair hypothetical on "what if the Mormon church changed its views
#+end_quote

This is kind of a funny statement as there are quite a few historic examples of major view changes. E.g., polygamy, black people being allowed into heavy, etc. Most recently they enacted a policy of not allowing children of gay parents to be baptized a few years ago and then reversed it this year.

My anecdotal observation is that most people defended the prior bad position but then switched views with the church and were happy when the church got rid of bad positions (esp. black people and baptizing children of gay people)
