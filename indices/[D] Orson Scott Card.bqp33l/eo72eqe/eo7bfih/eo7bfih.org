You raise a good point about the year stamps, and I linked to each article so that people can follow the timeline themselves, but when someone continues to hold a belief into the present day I don't think it's all that important, to be honest. If OSC came out for gay marriage and I wrote a piece saying he's not a REAL ally to gay people because he said X and Y and Z and I didn't include how long ago that was, I think that would be misleading. But since he still basically believes all that, I don't really care when he thought it unless he's written about how he has meaningfully changed his mind since. If you have any examples of that, please do share it.

But "he was anti-gay marriage at a time most people were" doesn't really excuse it, to me, because I hold him to a higher standard. To be frank, most people are pretty dumb, politicians included. OSC demonstrated that he could think. His valuing his faith over his reason feels like a moral failing in a way that [insert Democratic Politician] not being particularly more intelligent than their constituents, or pretending not to be, doesn't.

  Do you think that Card has done more or less to harm gay people than, say, the democrats who controlled congress when Don't Ask Don't Tell passed under president Clinton?

DADT was a compromise between those who wanted to allow openly gay members to serve and those who wanted to find and remove gays from the military, iirc. Are you referring to the democrats who voted against Clinton? Obviously they did more than OSC, but I don't know if that's about power or intention. You just made me realize I didn't read a single thing about his views of gays in the military, and I just searched specifically for it and couldn't find anything. Maybe I'm just being optimistic, but I actually wouldn't be surprised if he was okay with it.

  You seem to argue for the latter...while also claiming that Card's problem is that he considers Mormonism important above all else (including an honest pursuit of the truth)? I am deeply confused by this. Is Card's main loyalty to Mormonism, or hating gay marriage?
#+end_quote

If Card's concept of Mormonism is shaped by his personal views and faith rather than what the church ultimately decides Mormonism is, that would resolve the confusion I think. I don't know for sure if that would be his reaction to it obviously, and it's a large reason why I wish he'd written something about black Mormons before or after the policies changed.

Ultimately I think his faith is meaningful, but just blaming his faith isn't enough simply because there are people who are raised Mormon who either leave the church or stay and accept homosexuality. It's an explanation, not an excuse.
