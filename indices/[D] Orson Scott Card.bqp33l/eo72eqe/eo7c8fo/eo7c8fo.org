  The impression I have of most Mormons (of which you will find many other within science fiction and fantasy, see Brandon Sanderson and Stephanie Meyer for prominent examples) is that most of them are on board with what the church believes, and right now, that means believing that marriage is between a man and a woman (and if you're someone like Brandon Sanderson or Stephenie Meyer, doing everything you can to avoid talking about it in public).

My impression from at least Brandon Sanderson is that, yes, he stands by the church's view of homosexuality, but he is a lot more nuanced about it than Card is. Compare [[https://brandonsanderson.com/euology-dumbledores-homosexuality/][this]] to some of the stuff Card wrote.

Note that this is from 2007 (with a preface/disclaimer added in 2011), so 2 to 5 years before the moment you're saying the majority started shifting views in America. As you mentioned he has since stopped talking about it in public (wisely, I think), so we don't really know how much his view has shifted over the last 8 years.
