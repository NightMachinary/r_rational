So my understanding of Conflict Theory vs Mistake Theory off the top of my head goes something like this:

Mistake Theory assumes people who disagree with you on major issues that cause harm are just "mistaken." That they lack the right information, and just being properly educated will change their mind. The failure mode is in thinking Truth matters to others more than it often does, reserving judgement on those whose motives will not change over civil conversation; see literally hundreds of famous examples of people throughout history, even just US history, who cover up the truth to serve their own interests, from tobacco and oil companies burying research to US presidents explicitly targeting minorities through the drug war.

Conflict Theory assumes people who disagree with you on major issues that cause harm are just following incentives/values. They know they're doing harm, or they don't care enough about harm to let it stop them, and are just trying to amass or have enough Power to enact their preferences. The failure mode is not just assuming that others' intentions are bad, but that the proper response becomes to care as much about Power as them, which leads to the risk of losing sight of Truth that undermines your perspective or proper solutions; see all those who fall too far along a political ideology and into extremes, and start attacking whole categories of people ("millionaires," or "the media" or "socialists" or "Christians" or whatever) rather than evaluating if their own presumptions are true.

So to me, someone operating in Conflict Theory mode is not trying to find the Truth of their own beliefs or their opponent's arguments. Maybe they know them both thoroughly already, maybe they don't; either way, their mind is Made Up (as far as they believe) and they are much more concerned with gaining power or preventing their opponents from getting power than they are with sitting down with them and trying to hash out who's actually "Correct," because they want something that can only be gotten through power or there's something valuable they think is under attack by those amassing power.

Someone seeking Truth is doing their honest best to falsify their own beliefs until they have enough evidence to withstand strong criticism of it, and is willing to say "I don't know" and not make strong statements or acts until they do, unless they have to. This may be unfair, but anyone sticking with a religion kind of automatically fails at this, unless they are actively seeking out other religions and trying them too, or in the process of digging into every base assumption their religion teaches them.
