Great response, thanks. I agree with a lot of your points, but obviously have a different conclusion, and I think jumping to this point will best get to the crux of why:

  besides, wouldn't being in CT mode require for him to hide his true objectives and present false arguments for his audience? In the article he's being pretty straight-forward about his worldview that includes a god, the concept of sin, etc. So there isn't even any need to use CT as a meta-level argument against him, since all you have to do is criticise his worldview (religion, sin, etc).

Not at all. Conflict Theory is not about acting in bad faith: it is about a set of values or beliefs about a situation that simply dismiss as irrelevant certain types of information or arguments.

As an example, someone who believes that Capitalism as a system concentrates power in the hands of the mega-wealthy, who then use that power to serve their own interests at the expense of others, does not care about data or facts that might convince the rich that what they're doing is wrong, because they believe the rich are not "mistaken," but simply waging economic warfare against the poor. The goal is not finding more Truth, it's to acquire enough Power by trying to mobilize the poor that they can fight back. That does not mean they necessarily must act in bad faith, just that their goals and methods are different from someone operating in MTm.

I'm not basing my idea that he's in CTm by just the one article, but by his attitude over the space of decades, not just on homosexuality but on other topics too. I think Card is bad at evaluating truth and arguments that might undermine his sacred values because he's not actually looking for Truth; he's defending Marriage and Families and so on. I think that comes from his CTm.

Does that make sense so far? Sorry I know you wrote a big thing and I just responded to one portion of it, but I want to try to focus in on one crux at a time, and this feels like an important point to establish first. We can address the rest as necessary soon if needed.
