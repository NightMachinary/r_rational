Thanks for expanding; I thought it was obvious that I was not asserting that Card literally meant that both words meant the exact same thing, but rather that the two are equally derogatory words.

I disagree that Card is drawing the line as distinctly as you are, though, and think you are reading more reasonableness into his position than exists. This part in particular;

  Likewise, there are people who show a virulence in their hatred of homosexuals that is obsessive, personal, and pathological, and I suppose homophobia could be regarded as the technical word for that. The overwhelming majority of the cases where I've seen homophobia used, however, it was used not to describe the pathological condition, but rather as an ugly word to fling at anyone who does not go along with the political agenda or self-story of various activist wings of the American homosexual community.

Is such a spineless and grudging admission of the existence (but not prevalence) of homophobia that honestly I find it a minor point of evidence toward him actually being homophobic.

Imagine reading this:

#+begin_quote
  Likewise, there are people who show a virulence in their hatred of *black people* that is obsessive, personal, and pathological, and I suppose *racist* could be regarded as the technical word for that.

You "suppose," OSC? How good of you. Just the "technical word," of course, which brings to mind "technically, but not actually."

Maybe I'm not being charitable, so I'll be extra clear about why I think he's wrong in this:

Faggot is a derogatory slur that has no meaning other than to degrade a sexual orientation. Other than cigarettes or bundles of sticks, it has literally no other use.

Homophobe is a label for a type of bigotry, no different than "racist" or "sexist." It has use as more than an insult; there is no other word to describe someone who yells "I'm going to kill you faggots!" at gay people.

Card can disagree with the use of homophobe against him, and there are definitely those who use homophobe too loosely in the way he describes. But by calling the two analogous, even by specifying that he just means as a political weapon, he's showing his ignorance of the actual dynamics of what life for homosexual is like.

People started calling people faggots because they hated that they were gay. Not because it reflects on anything they believe or said.

People started calling people homophobes because those people hated/feared gay people. And yes, sometimes because they hate those people for hating/fearing gay people, or just appearing to.

OSC is trying to equivocate the two because it serves him politically to do so. It protects himself, it protects his allies, it furthers his cause of disenfranchising homosexuals. It even resolves dissonance when people use the word to describe him to just dismiss them as trying to "shut down debate" or "censor disagreement."

It's neither of those things: it's just the word that arose for people who argue against equal rights for gay people. If it shuts down a discussion he's been in, it's because that discussion was deemed unproductive and harmful by someone else, and if he disagrees with that, well, he's not really the one who gets to make that judgement.

His attempt to equate them in any way is no different from any other attempt to discredit attacks on intolerance by equivocating it with intolerance. It's a semantic shellgame, and pretty empty of substance in most circumstances, I've found.
