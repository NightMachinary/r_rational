And I disagree with his assessment.

Let's read this again:

  The overwhelming majority of the cases where I've seen homophobia used, however, it was used not to describe the pathological condition
#+end_quote

The /overwhelming majority/, OSC? In 1990? Get the fuck out of here.

Look, I know the world probably looks very different to me and OSC in this regard. My experience of when people get called homophobe is that they said something homophobic. His is that HE or his friends/allies said something people thought was homophobic. I'm sure that makes him dislike the word and think it's just being tossed around as an insult.

Hell, I got frustrated at the word "Islamophobic" for a similar reason when I was younger. It gets used a lot to describe someone who criticizes Islam, but doesn't hate Muslims, as if they just hated Muslims.

But I understood that the reason for that is there were a shit-ton-fuck more people who hated Muslims around than those that just criticized Islam, and they often say many of the same things. Recognizing that moderated my language.

So yes, I find his language insufficient to denote a clear understanding of the world. If someone said something like that in person I would call them on that shit in a heartbeat. I find it mealymouthed and sly, a concession of the least possible kind that somewhere, out there, occasionally, there might be people who legitimately hate or are disgusted by gays, but that the MAJORITY of people called homophobic are mislabeled.

Shit, I might even admit that was true today, in 2019. But 1990? Fuggeddaboudit.
