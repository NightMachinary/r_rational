Look, I don't have what it takes to dig into this any further. Just know for your own metacognition that my belief is that you're displaying a pretty large bias here, of the form of having already written the bottom line/blurring the line between sufficient and necessary. We can talk about it in depth at some future point if you want, but each additional piece of confirming evidence that you bring doesn't change my sense that you're not doing anything to falsify.
