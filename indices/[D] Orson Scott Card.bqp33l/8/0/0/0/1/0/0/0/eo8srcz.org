I think we just have different thresholds for how much evidence is necessary to make judgments about people's characters. Again, I'm not certain about any of this, but I feel confident enough about it that I'm willing to risk being publicly wrong.

I think I'm significantly more hesitant to make such judgement than the average person, but even still, I'm glad you have an even higher threshold, honestly, since people like you let me check my thinking and bring me down when I overreach or get sloppy, even if I think your threshold might be too high at other times.
