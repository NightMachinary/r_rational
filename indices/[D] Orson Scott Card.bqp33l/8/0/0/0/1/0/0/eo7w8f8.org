And FWIW, I still think you're confusing "sufficient" and "necessary" /all over/ your thinking on this one. Everything that you're saying is /plausible,/ and basically /none/ of it seems to me to be /required by observation./ I accept all of this stuff as perfectly valid hypotheses, and I don't think any of them pass thesis defense as conclusions.
