I'm actually considering this in a whole class of mistake that does not require "outright lying," and that is what I'm trying to point at. It's something like "insensitive to the breadth and scope of the problem." His response fits my model of someone motivated to not believe homophobia was as big a problem as it was, and his approach to other issues like ACC and Mormonism make me doubt his ability to see the world clearly, which can easily birth or feed into prejudice.

To draw this to my own life again, I genuinely think that people who want to criticize Islam but are unaware of how widespread Islamophobia actually is are failing on a number of levels, and one of those levels may be prejudice. I feel sympathetic to Card in this respect, but my sympathy does not make me judge him less for his response. I didn't stop criticizing Islam when I got frustrated by accusations of Islamophobia, but my whole attitude and rhetoric on it changed. That his response (to me) diminishes the prevalence of actual homophobia and identified homophobia, and paints those pointing to those things in such a negative light, is a point against him.

I don't expect Card to have been hooked into news of all the hatecrimes around the country, hell even with the early-days internet it would have been very difficult for one person to be aware of it all, but the Stonewall Massacre, the assassination of Harvey Milk, the AIDS hysteria... these were hard things to miss, and his language does not convince me that he had a solid grasp of the scope of the problem. /shrugs/ It's a pretty common blind spot, to be honest: most people are not historians or wide consumers of contemporary affairs that don't concern them.

Incidentally, I managed to speak with a few older coworkers about their experiences of the time period. There's a lot of interesting (and often off-topic stuff), and I even recorded a few if you want to listen to them. General consensus was that they rarely heard the word used back then unless applied to someone who was talking about disgust/hatred rather than just protecting marriage, since that was most people's position.

One of them who's gay actually pointed out that, in the New York gay community at least, you'd practically never hear the word "homophobe" used in the 70s or 80s because it was taken for granted that most people outside of liberal cities were, and the most outspoken against gay marriage or culture were more likely to just be called "backwards rednecks, since homophobia was just part of that package." His recollection is that the word gained more popularity after AIDS hysteria blew up, and that while he thinks that was more about fear of disease than homosexuals themselves, at the time most people called that stood out in some way beyond the "run of the mill" nonacceptance, which he said just came from being misinformed, not actual hatred or fear.

He agreed it's overused today, particularly among the gay community talking about "internalized homophobia" (he was against gay marriage and finds effeminate gay men unattractive, so he heard/hears that a lot apparently), but to the hypothetical "If someone in 1990 said that most accusations of homophobia were just being used shut down discussion, do you think it was accurate back then?" he said no.

Obviously his life informs his own view, like OSC's, but yeah, it seems trivially true to me that in the 70s and 80s that Card lived through before he wrote that piece in 1990, "homophobe" was not tossed around carelessly and inaccurately, because fear of gay people, either on an individual or societal-health level, was far more prevalent. Whether or not it's justified to call someone like Card homophobic, then or now, is a different question, of course, but I find Card's attitude at the time unconvincing in a particular way that makes me count it against him.
