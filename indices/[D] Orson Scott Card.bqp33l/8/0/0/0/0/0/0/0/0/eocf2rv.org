  That does not mean they necessarily must act in bad faith

By "acting in bad faith" I meant the hypothetical exploiter capitalist not presenting his real goals and opinions, instead resorting to information warfare techniques. They'd be using disgenuinity / bad faith as one of their [different methods] for pursuing their [different goals]. Just wanted to clarify that, although it's ultimately not important by this point (see the discussion backtracking request in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bqp33l/d_orson_scott_card/eoce666/][my other comment).]]
