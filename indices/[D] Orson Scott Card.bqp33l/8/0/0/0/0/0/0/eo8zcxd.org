  (1) I think Card is in Conflict Theory mode. (2) I think he has deep seated sacred beliefs .. that he is defending at all costs from those he believes will destroy something good and precious, (3) and that attitude shifts his approach from one of clear sight to one of defensiveness and dismissiveness of anything that challenges his beliefs.

I disagree on №1 (in a 3-valued logic, with the value being "unknown", rather than "false"). I agree on №2 (though I'm not completely sure, but it at least looks like it). And I agree on №3, but probably draw different conclusions from it than you. The conclusions being that just because he's being defensive doesn't mean you can automatically judge him being in CTm and dismiss his argument, and have to instead still properly dismantle his arguments to criticise his opinions and his position.

Some further elaborations follow.

--------------

I admit that the conflict theory is very valuable in understanding the motivations of other people, predicting political developments, etc. Further than that, however, I think we'll be facing some disagreements:

- I don't think conflict theory should be considered an acceptable direct argument or counter-argument for several reasons:

  - 1) during the argument itself it's essentially nothing more than a subtype of an ad hominem attack --- your opponent presents you argument X, and instead of addressing that argument itself, you just accuse him of operating in CT mode and simply dismiss his argument. Whether or not his argument itself had any merits, remains undetermined after this;
  - 2) for most of the cases, you won't be able to accurately determine under which mode your opponent is operating without having some mind-reading capabilities, complex psychological profiling software / expertise, etc;
  - 3) if accusation of CTm became a generally acceptable first-level strategy to use, everyone would start using it, and arguments would devolve into meaningless rounds of mutual accusations;
  - 4) entities operating in bad faith by default (e.g. Russia's propaganda school) would be benefiting from such a status quo the most.

- Perhaps it would be ok to rise to a meta-level and involve CT/MT as an argument, but only after your opponent started demonstrating being unreasonable or inconsistent with the nature of their argumentation. Examples of unreasonable attitude would be deliberate use of underhanded techniques (e.g. fallacies, firehose of falsehood, etc), examples of inconsistency would be sticking to the same dismantled opinions without at least addressing the criticism against them, making self-contradictory statements, etc.
- Regarding Card himself, I don't think there was enough information in the context of the current discussion (your article, and his) to determine beyond reasonable doubt that he's acting in bad faith / in CT mode.

  - he explains rather clearly why he thinks homosexuality should not be legalised --- among other things he thinks it will cripple the institutions of marriage and family, destroy his community, and so on. All these are arguments / opinions that can be targeted for criticism directly, with no need to assume bad faith or to resort to CTm against him yourself.
  - besides, wouldn't being in CT mode require for him to hide his true objectives and present false arguments for his audience? In the article he's being pretty straight-forward about his worldview that includes a god, the concept of sin, etc. So there isn't even any need to use CT as a meta-level argument against him, since all you have to do is criticise his worldview (religion, sin, etc).
