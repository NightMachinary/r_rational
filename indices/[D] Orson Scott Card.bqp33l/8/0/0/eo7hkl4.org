Sure. I was criticising not the “analogous” in your interpretation, but the “exactly”. Compare: 1) “A and B are exactly the same.” 2) “In some cases, A and B are exactly the same.” The first implies that the two "functions" “match” (or correspond to each other) all the time, while the second only implies that they match only in some of their sections. So there's a significant difference in Card's statement compared to your interpretation of it.

Card was saying that “faggot” and “homophobe” are analogous when those who use them are so convinced of the righteousness of their cause that they are willing to deny the right of others to disagree with them. That they use these words:

- as ad hominem attacks without any real meaning behind them;
- not as valid arguments in a serious discussion, but as a weapon to derogate the opponent when they don't go along with the user's political agenda;
- to silence opposition, to subvert legitimate discussion;
- to force others into a perfect uniformity of thought.

So when these conditions are met, the sets of usage for these two words intersect, making their usage analogous to each other. The “homophobe's” set still has areas outside of this intersection, which Card either doesn't address at all or hesitantly accepts to be an accurate usage for the term “homophobe” (Ctrl+F to "Likewise).

What your interpretation of Card is saying, on the other hand, is that “faggot” and “homophobe” are exactly analogous, and that's pretty much it.

Your interpretation of Card trivialises Card as someone using the word homophobe in the abovementioned manner would be trivialising a target who is presenting complex arguments that the user of the word doesn't want to understand or agree to.
