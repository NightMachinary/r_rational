  Similarly, if you are going to step into OSC's mind and talk about the Book of Mormon, you can't say that he needs to be an architect to believe in it but you don't need to be one to scoff at it, because the judgement on which experts are credible is something you took along from your own brain. Google is vast, and the anti vaxxer or Book of Mormon truther can find links that tell them they are smart just as well as you can.
#+end_quote

This is basic to /understanding why he is Mormon,/ but it is not sufficient to cast judgement on his /continued belief in Mormonism's irrationality/. I totally get that he has reasons to think he's correct. That doesn't mean I can't cast judgement on his ability to determine if he actually is or not. There are plenty of people who were raised Mormon and somehow managed to realize, hey, this all doesn't really add up.

  The reason I am disappointed in you for calling him senile is that it is the empathy version of a nuke. Once you set it off, you are done. If the person isn't a person (or rather, isn't fully modeled as a...you get it), if their behavior is determined by degrading cells or misfiring brain lightning, then you are done, yeah? They behave this way because someone hit them in the head with a hammer, case closed. You need a LOT of evidence to go there.

I didn't say that I think he is senile now: I said that when I first encountered his toxic ranting online years ago, it was a possibility that I considered to explain the level of disconnect from the intelligence and empathy his characters showed.

  Like, the above isn't just wrong, it is wrong in a very particularly rat-adjacent way, and it is mostly what you are doing in your article. Dude can't be religious because his religion changed its mind on black folks? That's...you get that it proves too much, right? No Mormon can believe now? All X million of them, when they tell you why they tithe, it is all lies, since they used to have no black mormons and now they have some?
#+end_quote

But that's not what I said. I said his silence on his Church's attitude toward black people despite his prolific writing on the Church and society in general is a mark against him. Not slam dunk evidence, but yes, evidence. This seems similar to the attitude that you need someone to shout the N-word to think they might be at a wee bit racist, and anything short of that is just speculation. Sometimes you need to be able to make a judgement on insufficient evidence. I'm not betting my life on any of this stuff, but I'm not going to bully my reason into ignoring it. That just feels like another form of PC thinking.

  It is easy, when you are trying to do empathy with gross people, to get carried away with tweaking their noses. People fail the intellectual turing test on nazis way more than they do on firefighters. I'm suggesting that you mentally put OSC, or whoever you are trying to understand, in the right while you are in there, because it will help you avoid those errors.
#+end_quote

What makes you think I can not or did not do this? This is like basic empathy. If you think I can't pass an ITT on OSC, you could just say that. I'm pretty confident I could. Seeing him the way he sees himself, as a good husband and father, a pious man who's protecting his faith and society from degrading forces, doesn't change his words and attitude, and those are what I'm examining.

  Ok, like, there are some math problems that are hard because they have many steps. If you get just one bit of the long division wrong you are on the wrong path and barring a happy accident you will end wrong. But this isn't one of those situations. This is 2+2, but you have excluded 4 from the solution space. The boring, naive answer is the right one. OSC has the motivations that he says (over and over) he has.
#+end_quote

Well, that's just, like, your opinion man :P

Saying I've excluded 4 from the solution space is... kind of insulting, to be honest. It's like you think I'm just so stupid I can't possibly imagine that maybe OSC really is just what he says. But my entire article is pointing out why I think it's not that simple. It's like... shit, put yourself in MY head for a second; why do you think I spent hours of my life writing this thing? Because I just wanted to bash the poor old man? Because 4 was just /inconceivable/ to me?

Obviously I think it's possible that his stated motivations are his real ones. But my assessment of his words and behavior do not lead me to think that is the most probable state of reality. In all the different possible realities, the ones where his motivations are what he states look /very different/ to me. Being someone who lives in the world and pays attention to history, I've noticed a hell of a lot of people insisting they're not prejudiced who do or say prejudiced things. Do you want me to just throw out those observations? Sounds like you're the one excluding possible answers from solution space.

As I said elsewhere, we can't know what's in other people's hearts. But after a certain point we do have to say we have "enough" justification to at least tentatively believe in one explanation, while holding ourselves open to other explanations that might gather evidence. Maybe you just have a higher threshold for this than I do, and that's fine: sometimes I'll be too quick to judge, and sometimes you'll be too slow too. But I don't think OSC deserves to be let off the hook as simply as 2+2=4 simply because he states that he's not prejudiced.

/shrugs/ Idunnoman. Life and people are more complicated than that; worst part is some people legitimately don't know or realize they're prejudiced, and so are being 100% honest and sincere when they insist they're not. And then they still say gay people shouldn't adopt kids because it's bad for the kids/the fabric of society, despite all the evidence against that, and then falling back on "my particular interpretation of God said so" when they have nothing left.
