So, you're obviously a member of the rational community, right? "What do you think you know and how do you think you know it" and all that jazz should be familiar to you. Have you ever in good faith attempted to falsify your own beliefs? Have you ever looked into the historicity of the Book of Mormon?

There are a great many problems with the claims made by that book. It claims to document ancient Mesoamerican civilizations which did not exist. There was no such person as "Jared" and there was no such thing as the "Tower of Babel." There was never such a people as the "Nephites." There was never such a people as the "Lamanites," and Native Americans /definitely/ and /indisputably/ did /not/ descend from a few Middle Eastern Hebrew families. That book /definitely/ claims that ancient Jews migrated to +the US+ the Americas thousands of years ago, which is a thing that /definitely and indisputably did not happen in any capacity whatsoever./

Mormonism is less than half a step above Scientology on the scale of "most obviously fabricated/invented religions to have ever been fabricated/invented" (obviously /every single religion which has ever existed/ was fabricated/invented, but the con artists who fabricated/invented Scientology and Mormonism in particular left glaring paper trails documenting the fact that they just made it all up).

I've thought of you as a rational person up until this point. How can you believe in such an obviously fabricated/invented religion in the year 2019? That's literally more disturbing than believing in a flat earth.

I finished typing this comment like an hour ago and I've been debating whether or not to post it, but I just have to. How can you genuinely believe in a religion that was so obviously fabricated whole-cloth by a con artist?
