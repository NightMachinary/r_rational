How, exactly, do you plan to /look/ at what happened 3000 years ago?

Sure, there is an objective truth. But for such a long passage of time, without a specific known location, with multiple cultures arising and then completely collapsing, in a climate not well suited to preserving artifacts, and with so few historical "landmarks", shall we say, in the Book of Mormon text - you seem /remarkably/ convinced that you know exactly what happened and didn't happen.

My own view is that trying to prove either the truth or falsehood of the Book of Mormon by matching it up with historical records is a pointless endeavor. There are just not enough relevant data points.
