For what it's worth, the official view /has/ changed to attempt to fit evidence as it comes out. They'll insist that there's missing data, but the narrative has gone from "Lehi's family was the origin of all Native Americans both North and South" to "Lehi's family integrated with an existing population" and "the book of Mormon documents a limited geographical region", which is an effort to square the book with what archeology has eliminated. I bring this up to say that some of the specific claims you're refuting are out of date and no longer supported.
