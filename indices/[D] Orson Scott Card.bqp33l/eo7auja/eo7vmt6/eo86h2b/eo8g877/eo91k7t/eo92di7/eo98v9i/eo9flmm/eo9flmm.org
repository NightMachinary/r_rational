Historical details are extremely important to me; I'm a History teacher with a Masters in History and seek the truth in all things. /As do most people on this sub./ The way we care for History is a reflection of our relationship with the objective truth of our existence, the subjective impressions of people at the time, and with our relationship with the greater chain of our human existence in general. There is no differentiation between religious History and any other History facts are facts, and the rest is dross.

If religion is infallible, then you should follow it, but you should also make sure it actually is infallible. Especially when the Holy text literally shows scripture being quoted for evil. If religion is fallible, why should you follow it instead of ethics based on simple principles rather than narrative? I frankly don't think there's a good answer to this question. This is especially germane to the issues at hand, because if the practices and social mores are created by people; then what's the point of believing them rather than living a life based off of simple principles and their consequences? Furthermore, if they are wrong, and you neither speak out against nor examine such beliefs then you are complicit in them.

Here's what really bothers me though, you seem really comfortable with saying things are unknowable and stopping there. In the case of the treatment of Black people, this is not some distant ephemera, this is a longstanding policy that changed 40 years ago; i.e. well within living memory.
