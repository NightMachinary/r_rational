  I... seek the truth in all things. /As do most people on this sub./

Well:

#+begin_quote
  And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

That seems pretty incompatible with a rational worldview. We don't determine whether or not something is true by the warm fuzzy feeling we get when we ask our imaginary friends about whether or not it's true, we determine whether or not something is true by determining whether or not it's true. There are no intermediate steps. Either a thing is true or it isn't. Determining whether or not a thing is true can be difficult enough to take /years,/ but it's still just the one step.

It seems obvious to me that you don't determine whether or not there were Jews living in Honduras 3,000 years ago by asking your own imagination, you determine whether or not there were Jews living in Honduras 3,000 years ago by looking at whether or not there were Jews living in Honduras 3,000 years ago. There weren't, therefore there weren't. Pretty cut and dry if you ask me.
