Whether the claims are supported or not, it's still part of the religion. Christians say they accept that the earth is round, but that doesn't change the fact that the bible says it's flat. In determining whether or not to throw out the bible as the trash that it is, you go by what the bible itself says, not what its supporters say it says.
