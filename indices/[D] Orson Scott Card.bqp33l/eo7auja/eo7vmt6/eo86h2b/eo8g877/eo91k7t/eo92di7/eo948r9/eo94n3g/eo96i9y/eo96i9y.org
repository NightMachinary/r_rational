I'm saying some of those refutations are like trying to disprove the existence of the Rapture rather than the Flood. One type of claim is in the actual book, the other is an extrapolated addition by the readers (and in this case additions that have gone out of style to boot).

Better to leave out the attacks easily discarded as out of date straw men (separate Hebrew civs, ancestors of entire native American populous) and focus on just the more salient points that are more crucial to the actual source (the anachronisms, language/name influences, etc).
