There is just one portion of the Book of Mormon that gives a clear trail to follow, with a clearly defined starting point, precise compass directions, and descriptions of a number of landmarks that we might reasonably expect to find and recognise today. That portion is the initial journey from Jerusalem across Arabia. And it describes such a journey with remarkable accuracy and a level of detail that Joseph Smith, in 19th century backwoods New York, could not have known. It's not conclusive proof, but it would require extraordinarily lucky guessing. I can go into the details or provide references if you'd like.
