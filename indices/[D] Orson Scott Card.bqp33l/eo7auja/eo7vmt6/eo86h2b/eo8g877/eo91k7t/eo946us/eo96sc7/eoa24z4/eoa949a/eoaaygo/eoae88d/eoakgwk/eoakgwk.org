...there's nothing there but vague excuses and deflection?

I'm sorry if you originally offered to help people understand something and now feel like you have to defend your faith, but I'm not sure what you expected from this sub. If you have 0 interest in actually determining if your religion is true or not, just say so. If not, maybe go [[/r/AskHistorians]] like I suggested, or even [[/r/exmormon]] and see what convinced them to stop believing the apologia.

I mean at a fundamental level, you either recognize that you can't trust a religion to be unbiased about its own beliefs or you follow your faith regardless of reason. Sometimes I think that's the only choice that really matters, when it comes to religious belief, and all else flows from it.
