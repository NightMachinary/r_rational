I understand that, and I don't mean this in a mean way, but I'm honestly curious: what were you expecting as a question?

Like... the LDS church positions on things are pretty obvious. So are OSC's, he's written a lot about it.

The only thing you can really offer are /your/ perspectives on these things. And if you don't disagree in any way with either of them, and aren't willing to engage in why you believe what you do and the evidence against your beliefs, I'm just having trouble picturing what value you thought you would provide to this discussion.

I sound like an asshole. Sorry. Insofar as this is a hurtful thing to say, I honestly say it because I want to understand your prediction model of how this would go, and for you to take from this experience a better understanding why things went down this way.
