As this has clearly gone beyond the scope of the limited expertise that I cited up front, if you want to follow this line of questioning further, I suggest going to [[https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon#Archaeology_and_the_Book_of_Mormon][FairMormon.org]], which can likely give better answers than I can on specific historical issues.
