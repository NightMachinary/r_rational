I offered to answer questions related to your post about Orson Scott Card's attitudes and beliefs, from an LDS perspective, to allow a productive discussion and perhaps better understanding of how OSC might think. Whether that makes you like him more or dislike him more, accurate understanding is good.

However, this branch of (largely unrelated) questioning has ended up with clear statements that my answers are meaningless because I'm not a professional archaeologist or historian. So, if you have questions that need a different domain expert - you'll need to find one.
