  Do you follow the Church's pre-1970ish views of Black people. If not, why didn't God reveal the truth earlier and save a lot of racism and discrimination?

I think you'll find that /most/ members of the church still have no answers about the whys and wherefores of that. And those that do have answers, are probably just guessing.

What I can say is, there was never any scriptural mandate for restricting the priesthood by race, and it's not entirely clear how the policy came about. As far as I have been able to tell, it was largely due to Brigham Young's influence, and while he was the president of the church, he never claimed to be infallible and we don't believe he was. Beyond that, there's a lot of, "I really don't know." And it was all before my time.
