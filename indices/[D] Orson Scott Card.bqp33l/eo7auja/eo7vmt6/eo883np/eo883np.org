  How do you reconcile the Bible's non-violent version of Jesus with the Book of Mormon's one that burns and floods entire cities? If they're the same person, why are they worthy of worship rather than hatred for the act of destroying cities?

That's a very old question - "If God is good, why is there suffering?" - and not one I can properly address in a few sentences.

But what I can say is - have you read the following chapters, where Jesus talks about it? He did not rejoice in what had happened, but rather mourned. These people were /murderers/ many times over, capped by killing the prophets who came to call them out. They were killed because their body count piled up too high to let it continue. Their period of testing on Earth was over; they had failed abysmally, and would now go away to be thoroughly and fairly judged.
