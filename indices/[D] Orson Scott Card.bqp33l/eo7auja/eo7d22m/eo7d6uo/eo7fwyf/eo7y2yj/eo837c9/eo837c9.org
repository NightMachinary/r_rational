Sorry, I'm curious. As a thought experiment, say we get this:

[[https://www.wired.com/story/reverse-infertility/]] (Discusses IVG, in vitro gametogenesis - the creation of sperm cells and egg cells from adult cells (doesn't even require stem cells, cells can be taken from even just the skin off your arm))

And this:

[[https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15421734/artificial-womb-fetus-biobag-uterus-lamb-sheep-birth-premie-preterm-infant]] (Discusses advances in artificial womb technology)

Let's say we get those two things up and running and it's all safe and effective. Two lesbians can conceive a child who is biologically related to each parent in /exactly/ the same way that every other child is related to his/her parents, and two gay guys can do the same with the additional step of an artificial womb.

The fact that penetrative sex doesn't occur should have no relevance, because "test tube babies" are born all the time and no one bats an eye, I don't think people really even think of them as "test tube babies" anymore because that's just how fertility treatment is done. Disregarding any discussion of adopting/fostering, or the fact that there are already /way/ too many people and maybe reproduction /should/ be limited, we're maybe less than a decade out from the first homosexual couple producing biological offspring.

How does your perspective on homosexuality change in a world where homosexuality is /not/ a "dead end"?
