Maybe? Such a world has never existed before, so I can only speculate. I'm confident that /without/ the possibility of children belonging biologically to both parents, the church will never consider single-gender and mixed-gender relationships to have equal religious value. /With/ - well, time will tell.

Certainly our doctrine places a high value on children having the right to be raised by their parents, so if we do start seeing children born to two fathers or two mothers, there would need to be some kind of shift to accommodate that. I've not heard anything from the pulpit to define what that shift might be, though.
