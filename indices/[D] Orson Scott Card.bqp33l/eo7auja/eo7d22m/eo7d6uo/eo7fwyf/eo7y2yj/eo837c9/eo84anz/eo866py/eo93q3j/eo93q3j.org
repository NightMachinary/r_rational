FYI, "elders" are pretty much any adult male in the church, and "priests" are basically any male 16-18. Bishops are laymen and are not trained in religious matters; their day job may very well be something like Dentist or Construction Worker and have no requirement for theological or even doctrinal training. As a result, your mileage will vary greatly depending on who you talk to.
