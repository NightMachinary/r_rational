Haven't read Songmaster, but I'll chime in that some parts of /A Planet Called Treason/ are at least 763 milliVanyels worth of gaaaaaay. I'm pretty sure the male protagonist has sex with a man at one point, in a euphemistic 1970s way, and this is depicted entirely sympathetically. Which doesn't make the author gay, but seems hard to square with antigay. If there aren't antigay statements dating to around the same authorial era, we should probably consider there as being at least two distinct Cards worth analyzing.
