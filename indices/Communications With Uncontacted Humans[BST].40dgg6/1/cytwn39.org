  Well, you can prove you are intelligent with mathematical formulas and equations.

WRT scenarios 2 and 3, if a naked human showed up in my hometown, speaking a foreign language, and trying to get people to pay attention to the weird symbols they scratches in the dirt, no one's just going to take them to their leader, even /if/ they recognized that lame math stuff.

I'd prioritize being /interesting/. Instead of being crazy and homeless and easily ignored, be crazy and homeless and singing a song in an unheard genre. Cause a scene, draw a crowd, /then/ see if you can engage someone who appears to actually be paying attention, honestly trying to figure out where you come from.

Honestly still a crapshoot, but it's the best I've got this time of night.
