Well, you can prove you are intelligent with mathematical formulas and equations. At that point, the others will probably be interested in trying to establish contact. Learning a new language with no background is hard, but doable, and they'll probably have their best linguists trying to help. It's basically the same as your average alien contact scenario, except that since you're both human, you'll have similar neurology and frame of reference.

As for what I'd bring with me, a computer and discs packed with as much information about humanity as I can. We can always figure out how to adapt the power once we establish contact.
