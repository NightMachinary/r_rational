My first priority would be 1) observing to check whether the inhabitants of the place I've been dumped in are dangerous; then 2) showing them i'm not dangerous in whatever way possible (gestures/body language? dropping a stick in an exaggerated way? no idea); 3) attempting to establish contact with someone unthreatening and proving to them that I'm not just mentally ill, probably by showing them any artifacts of my culture (or just pictures on my phone, screenshots of websites, i don't know). singing a song could work, but that'd depend on their culture. 4) if anyone shows nonhostile interest in me, probably trying to explain how i got there and who i am using simple pictures

i guess that's a bad plan but it's the best i could come up with
