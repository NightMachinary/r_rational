In any scenario, I'd smile, exaggeratedly frown, and gesticulate as much as possible, using tones if not speech to assist in conveying intent and emotion. Drawing pictures will help when I finally get a conversation partner.

Discovered naked in the middle of a city:

- Assuming no buildings that appear religious, and no people whose job is to maintain order, I'd try to go in every building I could in order to try and find one that either offered alms or might have a person willing to offer help.

- Assuming I'm transported right after a workout, when I'm dirty, smelly, and grungy, I'd find a place to bathe then do the same, though with a focus on academies; without fresh and clean hair, getting alms becomes more difficult. I might instead rummage through garbage for cloth, then run around a bit, and try to engage someone in conversation through gesticulation or, if merely hailing someone doesn't work, becoming a public spectacle by means of feats of the body or Pun's method of singing. Once I have decent clothes, I can bathe, and go out searching for more alms, which would subsist me until I could find an academic type.

- Assuming a dystopian society, mime being unable to speak and the need to write something to whomever first gives you attention, then draw pictures.

In the wilderness, naked:

- Find a house and pretend to faint if I think it likely they noticed me, to increase the chances they'll come out and help rather than view me as a threat.
