I love and will second everything in [[/u/greencloakguy]]'s list of longer works.

I'll also plug [[/u/towercurator]]'s finished work Void Domain and ongoing project Vacant Throne.

The Wandering Inn by [[/u/pirateaba]] isn't strictly rational but it's several million words and counting of IMO great writing. The first book or two are rough but it gets a lot better and it's probably one of my top 3 web serials.
