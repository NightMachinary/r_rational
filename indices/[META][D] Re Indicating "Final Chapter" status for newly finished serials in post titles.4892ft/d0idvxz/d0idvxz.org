Since it appears the motion has passed, I recommend it's instituted by including one of the following, or something to its effect, in the blue information box that appears when creating a top level post, and perhaps the sidebar as well:

#+begin_quote

  - Is this a [C] completed work, or the [FC] final chapter of a web serial that's been posted to the subreddit before? Tag the post as appropriate to indicate to readers who only read completed works that now is the time to start reading. While in most cases including the [FC] tag will net more readers for the story, sometimes (like for a surprise ending of a serial), it's better to leave the post untagged, and later resubmit the entire story with the [C] tag.
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote

  - Some readers only read finished stories. Use the [C] tag to indicate to these readers the work is complete. If posting the final chapter of a web serial, you might want to consider the [FC] tag; while in most cases doing so will net the story more readers, sometimes (e.g. surprise endings), it's better to leave the post untagged, and later resubmit the entire story with the [C] tag.
