Honestly, Black Clover treatment would be worse. At least a failure as bad as Berserk gives you something to laugh at, and the poorness of the adaptation is so apparent it doesn't reflect badly on the original. There's nothing worse than an adaptation so generic and boring that people retroactively grow to dislike the source material.
