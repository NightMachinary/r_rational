Unlikely. It's pretty hard to do 1 damage, most hits won't even register before they do 3-10 (unless it's damage over time thing, like bleeding or poison). This is what I should have told the readers, but i sort of forgot (lol) so now it seems like Isaiah is just metagaming.

He's been fantasizing about this sort of thing his entire life. Discovering that he might be able to fulfill those fantasies might be messing with his decision making just a little.
