Yeah that's what I'm saying, he's metagaming. I just edited the chapter a little, adding this right before he tests his enforced arm.

"If I hadn't smacked into the waystone on my way here, this would be a questionable idea at best. While in Fresno I scraped my ankle, stepped on sharp objects, and of course ran into a large rock. None of them killed me, even though I was at one health. Either it's hard to inflict damage on yourself, or the small hits somehow don't even register at all. Either way, I'm confident this won't kill me."

Is that good enough, or does it feel like a cop-out?
