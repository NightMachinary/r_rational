As he is safe, and didn't heal with new level, his priority should be getting that 1 hp up. He could have died hurting his hand. He could die tripping on a stone.

His creation is up, he could just whip up some medicine or something.

Though, I admit, if I suddenly got magic abilities my priorities could shift too.
