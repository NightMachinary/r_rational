Quite enjoying the story. So far it's well written and far above the usual Royal Road fare overall.

I like the mentions of lucid dreaming, especially since it's clear that you've either practised it yourself or read about it. Hell - I've not lucid dreamed a lot, but I also found that having structure for lucid dreaming "magic" makes things a lot easier to do.
