Sunswift, from 'The Futurians' by Dave Cockrum, who , not incidentally, was the co-creator of Phoenix.

No Blue Beetle--Blue Sentinel was inspired by a specific vision of Hal Jordan as Green Lantern: There was a very brief cameo by him in I think the second Dark Knight series, where he has turned rather alien after losing everyone he really cared about on Earth.
