One thought I've been having:

The DM as he presents himself to Juniper is a simulationist. He has set things up, he's letting them run.

The DM as he must have been during Uther's time was narrativist as all get out, with Uther coming through literally hundreds of skin of his teeth situations.

The DM tells Juniper that Uther used to cheat on behalf of the players, and it totally undermined the game, if you knew he'd bail you out even on dumb risks, then pretty soon everything was dumb risks.

I think the DM is running the game for each of them in the manner that they DM'd. Juniper is living in a crazy world where naming the wrong actor may kill you, while Uther has endured decades of kafabe victories whose lack of real stakes drove him nuts.
