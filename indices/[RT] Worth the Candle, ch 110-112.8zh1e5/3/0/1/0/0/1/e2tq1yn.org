Maybe Aerb's creator-God, and “the DM”, are separate beings? I.e.

1. Aerb was created (and Joon thrown into it) by Some Jerk.

2. Said Jerk /also/ created a demiurge DM abstraction to sit there manipulating fate re: Narrative flow, in order to make the game more game-y.

3. Somehow the DM demiurge either gained sentience and decided to help Joon; or there is a strange loop where Joon eventually ascends in power enough to usurp the DM role (but not the creator-God role), and so can act backwards to help current Joon, but only through actions the DM demiurge was designed to perform.
