I suggested last time that the DM for Uther's "campaign" was (directly or indirectly) Joon during his dark period after Arthur's death, and that's a lot of why Aerb was such a hell for him. I've since done a reread of the story, I think the timeline for this checks out pretty well.

In particular most exclusions occurred during Uther's time on Aerb, many of the worst of them are from Joon post-Arthur, and Arthur's descriptions of Aerb rather line up with Joon's description of his DMing while lashing out at people.

If that's true, the big difference between the DM for Joon and the DM for Arthur is that Joon is no longer providing him with fuel for the campaign...
