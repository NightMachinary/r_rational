Yeah, the chronology isn't a smoking gun for sure, but it's canon that most of the exclusions happened during Uther's active time ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/33742929][Exclusion #16 happened while he was active]]) and that a lot of them came from Joon post-Arthur's death ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/34742762]["a frightening number" came from the Manxome Foe campaign]]).
