  and all I was doing was making up stories to make myself feel better, arguing positions that I was thinking up as they came to me, rather than what I'd actually felt or thought at the time

Hence the discussion maxim to give your true reasons rather than your best persuasions. I'm not always the best with that one.

This got lost in the discussion for narrative reasons, but i think it's worth some attention here. Just being in the exclusion zone (to-do: find boundaries) forces these considerations. The problem of an untrustworthy communication channel doesn't go away just because there wasn't anything wrong /at that moment/ after all. It wasn't obvious then.

I briefly toyed with the idea that Masters was spoofing the apparent race of the renacim and getting away with it as long as the soul-body consistency checked out. Maybe another time.

  “We'll probably all be dead before then,” said Fenn.

What brought /this/ on? Just the end-of-world prediction? Seems disproportionate.

Discussing the nature and profile of the Dungeon Master with untrusted parties in any capacity seems really difficult. It touches on several of the fourteen points and is hard to ground in any demonstration. /This/ is the lens through which the rising horrors won't go away by themselves without Juniper.
