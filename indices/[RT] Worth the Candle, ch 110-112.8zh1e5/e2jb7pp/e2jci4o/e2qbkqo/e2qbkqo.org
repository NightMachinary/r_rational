A) Kill the Chosen One = 50%(?) Chance of ultimate evils stopping in their tracks. 50%(?) Chance of no Chosen One being there when the ultimate evils stir.

I feel like the obvious objection is that you can't kill the Chosen One. Like, anyone who knew Uther should know that trying to "kill him in the cradle" just means that killing an assassin as a baby becomes part of his legend. Dude didn't lose, full stop.
