Well, yes, but belief isn't certainty.

Here are the options and their results.

A) Kill the Chosen One = 50%(?) Chance of ultimate evils stopping in their tracks. 50%(?) Chance of no Chosen One being there when the ultimate evils stir.

B) Don't kill Chosen One = Guaranteed ultimate evils arriving, but the Chosen One is there to help and he has a track record of always winning.

The rational choice is B since it offers better odds of survival. Millions dying as collateral damage is still better than all 17 billion dying.
