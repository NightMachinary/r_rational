When you frame it like that you could choose 0.00001% as the odds. But people don't actually operate on making every decision to minimise the chance of the world being destroyed, or even the very real chance in this world of being infinitely tortured (everyone should be committing suicide and having the soul immediately captured). You wouldn't be able to kill anyone on the off chance they might be the chosen one.

Your track record of always winning is just as much as belief as A. If you believe they'd always win then you must believe that it's their fault. So eliminating them is the right choice since then there are no more evils, or getting them to disappear ala Uther.
