Obviously 100% certainty is best when it comes to the fate of the world but if that's not a possible choice and it's 99.9999% survival and .00001 extinction, then refusal of the 99.9999% based on non zero chance at extinction isn't rational, that's suicidal insanity. But that's all hypothetical I suppose. The point is, in lieu of a certain survival choice, the best odds - keeping the chosen one alive - is preferable.

That isn't rational. My choice to have bacon rather than toast this morning may have had a non zero chance to end the world, but that obviously isn't a sensible conclusion. Refusal to act based on non zero extinction odds like your imaging is refusal to ever act, period.

Sample size of two. In 500 years, the only instance of a plausible chosen was Joon, the guy on the list. There has never been anyone else like Uther, ever, until now. Safe assumptions don't always require large sample size much like if you strike a match and produce flame, you don't need to do it a hundred times to confirm, once, maybe twice is enough. Also same point as my 2nd paragraph about non zeros and action.

Attempting to kill someone so uniquely powerful, righteous and heroic that they could be mistaken for the chosen one is a poor decision because if they aren't the chosen one, you are probably losing a lot of men and resources to kill someone who would oppose the Apocalypse in return for literally no gain. If he is the chosen one, you just die.
