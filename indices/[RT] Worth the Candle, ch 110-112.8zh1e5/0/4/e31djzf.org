  Also also, did anyone else feel sorry for Masters? He made the wrong approach, and i have no qualms with how Joon dealt with him

Eh, I do have qualms, that basically echo Mary's issue with how Fallatehr was handled (and Mary's complaint about how this was handled!), especially given that Joon considered behaving in the same sort of way towards Doris Finch. There seems to be a huge split in how he deal with companions and non-compansions, and this makes sense, except that he doesn't seem to view non-companions in a symmetric way. That is, he's open, honest, and trusting towards companions, and highly closed and manipulative towards non-companions, and then judges non-companions for not treating him like a companion. If he met a copy of himself, I expect it would fairly reliably end up with one of them killing the other rather than them cooperating.

(Like, imagine one of Uther's servants stumbling across Joon's doorstep, and saying "uh, I feel uncomfortable, how about I leave and we'll slowly coordinate some meeting on neutral ground?". Would Joon say "sure, seems reasonable, you seem scared and I don't want to scare you" or would Joon use the duress he's unwilling to respond to?)
