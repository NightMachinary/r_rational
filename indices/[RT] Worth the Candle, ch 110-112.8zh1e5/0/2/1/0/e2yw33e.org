I also got this thing where I've had to listen to religious mythology stated like facts so often that now I get a bit of a pavlovian "PU-LEASE!" every time it's mentioned, and this unfortunately had the side effect of making me scepticise to fiction that shares those same elements. I'm assessing it, but it's kinda bothersome.
