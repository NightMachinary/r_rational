Valencia's ability to eat them appears to have come about from a loophole in her non-anima status, caused by the Game system requiring she be a "real" person and rewriting reality to make that happen. As the Game is unique to Juniper and Uther and this was done by the Loyalty system (which has an extremely limited number of slots, to the point I doubt they even /could/ get another non-anima in there) it is very possible she's unique in this regard.

Of course, finding ways to improve her rate of consumption might be possible.
