I don't recall -- is there anything inherently bad about the hells themselves, or is it purely that there are devils/demons there and they torture people? If it's just non-human monsters torturing you, then that is a clearly solvable problem: Valencia is able to eat them, so there are almost certainly other ways to eat them. Find enough of those ways, combine them, eat all the bad guys. Voila, the hells aren't so bad anymore.

On the other hand, if the place is a lake of fire then there's not much to do.
