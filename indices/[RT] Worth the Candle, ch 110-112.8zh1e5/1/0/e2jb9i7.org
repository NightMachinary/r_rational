That part seems weird to me. How can someone who is 1200 years old act like a child. It seems to me that what makes a teenager immature is little to no meaningful responsibility and the lack of life experiences, good or bad. Raven was an enforcer of a giant empire which I assume makes you grow up fast. Maybe all it means is that she had the hormones of a teenager. Great chapter.
