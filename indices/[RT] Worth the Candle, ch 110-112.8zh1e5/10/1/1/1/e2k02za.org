Juniper wanting to pilot a cool flying device but being unable to do so has occurred two times so far - at the confrontation with the gold mage at the desert fortress, and at the fight against a few helicopters worth of enemies in the forest.

He think since his father is a helicopter pilot, and he can pilot one as well, that it ought to happen eventually. A Chekov's skill, basically.

So Makin- seems to think this is a running gag that will only be subverted in the climax. I'm not that sure about it, but it certainly makes sense.
