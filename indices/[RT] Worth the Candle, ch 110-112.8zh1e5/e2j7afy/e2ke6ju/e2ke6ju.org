Might be the time they almost all died fighting thaum-seekers. Or the time they almost all died fighting a gold mage. Or the time Fenn almost died fighting Amaryllis's cousin. Or the time one of them sort of died breaking a soul mage out of prison. Or the time they almost all became mind-controlled fighting a soul mage. Or the time they almost all died fighting an army of frog people. Or the time they almost all died breaking into a haunted house. Or the time they almost all died because Joon said the wrong name.
