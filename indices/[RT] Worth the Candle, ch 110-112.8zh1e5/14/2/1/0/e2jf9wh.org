hmm, this sound like something that makes more sense when you have familiarity with phrase being used instead of putting the literal definition of the words together. Because to me this would imply that the obligation is "shoot her if you want to shoot her" which isn't really an obligation. But its still metaphorically resonant in a way that makes me feel like it fits with the way the phrase is typically used (even if I've never seen it actually used before).

(Also, to be clear, there's enough context there that the meaning would still be clear even if "recognizance" was replaced with "sdfsdgjthtb").
