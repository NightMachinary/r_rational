Fenn's willingness to just shoot arrows at people is equal parts hilarious and disturbing.

Also, you know how the popcorn variety serial fiction takes every opportunity it can for the protagonist to blow everyones minds with there seemingly impossible awesomeness? You know, the 'A is clearly impossible! No one has ever done blah blah blah' /protagonist proceeds to do said impossiblity/ and then everyone's jaw drops? Well that sort of thing is so much more satisfying when it's used sparingly and it's why i love every moment of Devil Valencia speaking 'unknowable' truths, dissecting water-sack-tendril sign language and leaving everybody speechless.

Also also, did anyone else feel sorry for Masters? He made the wrong approach, and i have no qualms with how Joon dealt with him, but you can see the chain of reasoning that led to his choice of actions and the poor guys been spending the last 500 years living a lie, waiting for this moment, at least in part for altruistic reasons, and he completely fucks it up.
