My working assumption since before the DM-focused chapter was that the DM was a future (or current) Juniper trying to work through his psychological hangups (incl. e.g. residual anguish over Arthur's death) by simulating a game where he, as a self-insert, is undergoing the healing journey of maturity and self-discovery that is confronting a series of challenges tangential to the Arthur (and related) questlines.

It seems like something the Juniper of the story would do, given his love of DMing -- recognize his downward spiral, dissociate himself (from his character/representation of himself), and explore how that character would behave in all these different scenarios in order to better understand himself and his motivations.

Is it still Doylist if the story has multiple layers? (I guess DMing a campaign where you're the only player is just telling a story to yourself)? I guess a more Watsonian take is that it's not so much that the DM is some sort of future Juniper, but more that Juniper is the DM with his memories wiped.

Thus, there is no Arthur-DM and we instead have the omphalos hypothesis -- the world was instantiated when Juniper stepped foot in it (or maybe just before).
