I don't know about climax, but the usual game design trope for video-game RPGs, is that you'll never get a new mode of transportation that allows you to go more than three new places, because it ruins pacing. So you basically will only ever get unlimited free-travel using a Cool Ship, right when you've already just finished entirely exploring the surface of the world the Hard Way.
