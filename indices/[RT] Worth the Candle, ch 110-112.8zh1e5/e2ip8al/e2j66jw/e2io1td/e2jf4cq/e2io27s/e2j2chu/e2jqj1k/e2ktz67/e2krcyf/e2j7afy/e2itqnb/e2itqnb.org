Valencia is great. I like that she basically took out Masters solo, probably. Though I will not be 100.00% that she's not Masters in disguise until we get a POV section of her, to be honest.

So, they're in a ship that Juniper helped make the ideas for, right? So... maybe Juniper worked out how to pilot it for his game, and can apply that knowledge to steal their ship and get somewhere safer?

New characters! Neat!
