Sure. Imagine dividing a square into 9 smaller squares and writing down the first nine letters in each. To specify a square, you need to know if it's left/center/right and if it's top/middle/bottom. If you know those two things, that's a letter. To get 26 letters you imagine stacking these squares in groups of three, so that you also have front-inside-back. (9*3 = 27 > 26, so there is an extra square; don't worry about it.)

Now to turn movies into any of those three dimensions. A made up movie title is (let's arbitrarily say) left/top/front, a movie that they never watched but discussed is center/middle/inside, and a movie they saw is right/bottom/back. So if you agree that the first movie is the left-right axis, the second movie is the top-bottom axis, and the third movie is the front-back axis, you can uniquely specify one letter with three movies.

Now imagine you're Masters, and by tampering with the protocol you make someone rotate their imaginary square (so that the first movie is front-back, let's say). They'll get different letters from the same movie titles. They won't get words; they'll get garbage. But at least now they know there's an illusion.
