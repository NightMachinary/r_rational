I made that argument last thread and was tightly shot down. Masters knows Joon has an extra sense so from his perspective. Prior probability is it's an entad whose function masters doesn't know and therefore can't fake. He would need another leap of logic to specifically assume it reads the soul. So it's unlikely that masters is faking soul sight based only on the idea that Valencia is nonanima.
