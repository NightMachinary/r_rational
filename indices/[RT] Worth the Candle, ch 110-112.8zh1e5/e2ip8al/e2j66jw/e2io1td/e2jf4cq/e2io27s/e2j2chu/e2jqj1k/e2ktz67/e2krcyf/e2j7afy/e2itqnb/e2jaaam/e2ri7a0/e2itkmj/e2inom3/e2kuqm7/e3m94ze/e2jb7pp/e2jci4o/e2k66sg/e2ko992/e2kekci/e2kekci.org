Well I mean, whatever he might say he didn't kill Uther one, we haven't heard a single story of any other IRL characters being brought into the world and dying so it seems like he's more concerned with bringing him almost to death repeatedly.

If he dies permanently at a point that's not satisfying from the in-universe DM's narrative perspective I will be surprised.
