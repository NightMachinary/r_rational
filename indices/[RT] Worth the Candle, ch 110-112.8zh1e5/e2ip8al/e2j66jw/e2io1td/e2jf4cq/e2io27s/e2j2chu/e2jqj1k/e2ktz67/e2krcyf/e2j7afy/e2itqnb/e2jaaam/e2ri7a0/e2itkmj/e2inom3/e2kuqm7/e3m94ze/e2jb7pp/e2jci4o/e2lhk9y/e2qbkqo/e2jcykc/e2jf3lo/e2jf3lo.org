I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow your reasoning. What do you mean by .00001? If you mean if either circumstance has those odds, well then the answer becomes obvious since you now have near certainty in knowing what happens in either case and can choose correctly.

People don't base normal decisions on minimizing extinction because that isn't a factor in normal decisions. When the decision literally revolves entirely around extinction, all rational actors will choose to minimize those odds, the fact some people actually want to kill the next Uther is irrational I think.

The appearance of the chosen one is unique in the extreme, as in only Uther and the friends named in that list. The risk of accidental killing is basically non-existent and not a factor.

Well no, as was explained in the previous chapters, some people believed Uther was delivered in their hour of need and without him they would have all fallen, only some thought it was his fault.
