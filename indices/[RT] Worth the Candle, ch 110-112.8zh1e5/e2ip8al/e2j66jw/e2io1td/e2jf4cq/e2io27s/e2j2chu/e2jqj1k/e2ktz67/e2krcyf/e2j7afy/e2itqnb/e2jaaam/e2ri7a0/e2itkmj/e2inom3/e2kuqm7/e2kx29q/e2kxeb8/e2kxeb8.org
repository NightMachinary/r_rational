Now putting on my attacker hat. If Masters is /really good at this/ then there are some things he might notice. If someone uses a movie as a made-up word it probably is made up for everyone. And inversely, if someone has seen a movie then maybe others have at least discussed it. There is a penalty for repeating (non-)movies.
