Something that's bugging me is Arthur repeatedly shows some downright questionable views of women (makeup is a lie, categorizing girls instead of talking to them, the whole sims thing) and his time on Aerb seems to have taken all those bad tendencies and made them worse. It's starting to become a pattern that doesn't look coincidental. He starts believing that people on Aerb don't matter and growing numb to their pain; you see that in both the mirror and him going over Groundhog Day with Bethel.

The "City of 1000 brides" sounds suggestive of his disregard of women and growing callousness.
