"Your own recognizance" means "you are under some obligation or covenant, but trusted to fulfill it without outside compulsion." It's usually used in a legal context: "you are being released on your own recognizance until the trial." In this case it means "I trust you to decide whether or not to shoot him, without any outside input."
