  I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow your reasoning. What do you mean by .00001? If you mean if either circumstance has those odds, well then the answer becomes obvious since you now have near certainty in knowing what happens in either case and can choose correctly.
#+end_quote

Apologies for not being clear enough.

If you have a 99.9999% certainty that killing the chosen one does nothing, you still can't do it because the utility of the other side is infinite, if the alternative is that the world ends then that outweighs every decision.

  People don't base normal decisions on minimizing extinction because that isn't a factor in normal decisions. When the decision literally revolves entirely around extinction, all rational actors will choose to minimize those odds, the fact some people actually want to kill the next Uther is irrational I think.

Everything is a factor, the world is a web connected by countless strands. Every action you do has an effect, even through the butterfly effect of bumping atoms about. As long as there's a nonzero chance (which it is because it's easy for things to be infinitesimal) then all your decisions are dwarfed by the apocalypse.

  The appearance of the chosen one is unique in the extreme, as in only Uther and the friends named in that list. The risk of accidental killing is basically non-existent and not a factor.
#+end_quote

Well no, that's completely wrong since you have a single sample you can basically make zero assumptions. We have no idea who Julian was before hand, he could have been anyone. At the very least we know that Uther was someone completely ordinary prior to becoming the Chosen One. Regardless it might be basically non-existent but it isn't non-existent. We have no guarantee that Uther knows who the next Chosen One will be. Even if it's really small odds (and no one is a position to even guess what the odds are) that Uther is wrong then again you're up against the infinite value of extinction.

#+begin_quote
  Well no, as was explained in the previous chapters, some people believed Uther was delivered in their hour of need and without him they would have all fallen, only some thought it was his fault.
#+end_quote

If Uther was delivered by the hour of need and cannot fail then you should still attempt to kill the next chosen one. If you succeed then they weren't the chosen one and you've saved everyone confusion that could cost extinction, and indeed could be a ploy by various forces (ie when the big bad comes up and everyone just lets the Chosen One deal with it), and if you fail then what's the problem?
