  Obviously 100% certainty is best when it comes to the fate of the world but if that's not a possible choice and it's 99.9999% survival and .00001 extinction, then refusal of the 99.9999% based on non zero chance at extinction isn't rational, that's suicidal insanity.
#+end_quote

Is it? When the downside is extinction isn't any action or inaction to avoid extinction rational? No matter how unlikely it is. It's irrational to not weigh infinite values as infinite but that's how people actually function. See: Christians and heaven irl. Getting to heaven is an infinite positive but you don't see even people who believe in heaven acting like it. There's no one killing babies to make sure they go to heaven even though that's the most moral and self sacrificing action anyone could ever take.

It's like Pascal's Wager

  My choice to have bacon rather than toast this morning may have had a non zero chance to end the world, but that obviously isn't a sensible conclusion.
#+end_quote

Well no, if taking bacon instead of toast increased the odds of the world ending and you knew that I think you'd agree that that's irrational. The real scenario is that you wouldn't know whether it was toast or bacon that raised the chance.

  Refusal to act based on non zero extinction odds like your imaging is refusal to ever act, period.
#+end_quote

Isn't that a classic scenario with a lock up of purely rational actors? Entirely logical computer based sapient beings locking up due to some irreconcilable solution.

  Sample size of two. In 500 years, the only instance of a plausible chosen was Joon, the guy on the list. There has never been anyone else like Uther, ever, until now. Safe assumptions don't always require large sample size much like if you strike a match and produce flame, you don't need to do it a hundred times to confirm, once, maybe twice is enough. Also same point as my 2nd paragraph about non zeros and action.
#+end_quote

The thing about assumptions is that they are beliefs. You started this conversation by arguing that it was wrong to trust and make decisions from a belief. A belief with a much stronger sample size (the entire life of Uther versus the entire history of the world).

  Attempting to kill someone so uniquely powerful, righteous and heroic that they could be mistaken for the chosen one is a poor decision because if they aren't the chosen one, you are probably losing a lot of men and resources to kill someone who would oppose the Apocalypse in return for literally no gain. If he is the chosen one, you just die.

True.
