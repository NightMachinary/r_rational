Also I couldn't find a definition of "recognizance" online that made sense to me in the phrase “You're under your own recognizance to shoot her.” from ch. 110. edit: though to be clear I understood the sentence fine on first reading it (even without the follow up sentence which also made it absolutely explicitly clear).
