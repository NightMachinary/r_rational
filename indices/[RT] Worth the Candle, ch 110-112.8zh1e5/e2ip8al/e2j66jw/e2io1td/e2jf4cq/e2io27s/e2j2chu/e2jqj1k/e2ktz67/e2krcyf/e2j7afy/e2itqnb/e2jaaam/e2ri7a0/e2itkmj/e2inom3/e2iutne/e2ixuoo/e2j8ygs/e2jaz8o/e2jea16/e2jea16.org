Heh yeah, I guess Bethel is one of the few subjects that could make that a grammatically correct sentence, but given the context:

#+begin_quote
  Amaryllis glanced back at Grak, their resident expert on entads given that Bethel had stayed as home.
#+end_quote

And the fact that Bethel was back at home, and her entad expertise wouldn't be effected by the form she took, I'm pretty sure it was meant to be "at".
