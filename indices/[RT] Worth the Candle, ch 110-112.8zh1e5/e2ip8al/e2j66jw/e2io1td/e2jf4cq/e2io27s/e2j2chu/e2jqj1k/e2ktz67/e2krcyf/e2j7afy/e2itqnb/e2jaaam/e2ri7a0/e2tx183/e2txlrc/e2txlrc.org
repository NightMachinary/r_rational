Ah yes, the game layer would be treated with higher regard than the secondhand source of the book on the subject. It does seem to be a slight contradiction, or perhaps a poor wording, as it's also sourced that each doris has her own soul, which then implies that only a single doris can perform the duplication feat, since after duplicating herself, she wasn't a single person anymore was she eh?
