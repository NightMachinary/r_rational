So, that means things have more than doubled since April. Which is good growth. From the numbers, it takes about a year from here, consistently publishing (and reminding people of your Patreon [which this "thank you" does a great job of]) to get to the ~$3,000-$4,000 USD mark. Weirdly, support is currently dying off for authors at about the $5,000 USD mark. I don't know whether that is just the number of people reading right now, or what people do not feel comfortable giving above that amount (armchair speculation says it might be the amount people are comfortable with authors making from their work). In a few months you might want to do something interesting to encourage a few of us to level up into the ten dollar club.
