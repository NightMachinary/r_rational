I think when you see that an author is making ~$5k a month, you think "huh, they're doing ok for themselves; my $2 won't really make much difference" and then you are less inclined to donate. At least, that's the bias I think I have. I think the best solution to this is to have multiple channels of donations, with Patreon only serving as the consistent monthly donation.
