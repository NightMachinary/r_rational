If you want people to trust you then you can't betray that trust, Masters. You'd think someone that old would understand that, but I guess his desperation not to let June get away before he got his answers led to him doing the very things that ensured he wouldn't get his answers.

I suppose it's not all over, though. Masters is still alive, and the team could conceivably be willing to speak to him in the future if he was under their power instead of the other way around.
