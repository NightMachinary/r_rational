I really hope Joon doesn't back down on the democracy argument. Group voting is important, as is respecting vote outcomes, and I get that a big part of the story is going to be Joon overcoming some of these implicit biases toward dismissing his teammates but that vote was bullshit. There was no way to even know if what they were perceiving was accurate, and leaving a team member behind on the basis of a nebulous luck sense is inexcusable. It didn't really seem plausible even- Mary had to know that all of them leaving would have been an open-ended narrative risk. Walking away from a hot situation even for a minute while saying "She'll be fine" is A) /also/ dismissive, in a much more callous way, and B) just /asking/ for a kick in the ass.
