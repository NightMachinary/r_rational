You're right about the vote. Lots of pressure. Also consider the interplay when Juniper gave Valencia her measure of authority.

Juniper touched on why leaving and staying were both... /less-than-appealing/ ideas. No fair omitting one.

From his own position he has the best reason to stay, with the confidence that his allies are not trapped or presently being deluded. Splitting the party is bad, but it isn't infinitely bad, and sending one part away from trouble (while not a terribly common /outcome/ in games) has merit.

Mary exerted considerable power by picking two choices (everyone leaves/stays) for the vote. No time to discuss other options? What a coincidence!
