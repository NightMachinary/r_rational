Agreed.

  I kept thinking to myself that it was absolutely idiotic to stay in the face of whatever was happening, and I also kept thinking to myself that it would be an act of supreme cowardice and betrayal to leave Valencia behind. I thought that for the whole time the portal was closing, until it was so small that I couldn't possibly have fit through it.

This doesn't read as /self/-centered to me at all, nor thoughtless.

What sort of unconscious thoughts might drive this? Oh, I don't know, being the one with the extra sense? A game layer that tries to punish cowardice?

Or, from another angle, what sort of emotional strength would be needed to square all that away on a short time scale?

Based on the current set of chapters, it also seems like he didn't hear anything back through the portal from them. Maybe that was just from the emotional stun.
