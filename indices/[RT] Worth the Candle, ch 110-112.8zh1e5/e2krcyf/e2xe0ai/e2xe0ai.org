I really, really doubt it. Arthur clearly wasn't the greatest dude ever, but I get the impression that Fel Seed is a whole other level of horrible. I don't remember much of the specifics regarding him, but his domain is described as being "worse than the first 6000 hells", as I recall. Arthur/Uther did a lot of questionable things, but nothing that seems to be hinting at him being an evil of that magnitude.

The one thing that seems to point maybe in that direction is "you know his weakness", but I'm not sure Juniper DOES know Arthur's weakness except insofar as Juniper IS Arthur's weakness.

That said, even if Arthur ISN'T Fel Seed (I doubt he is), I do think there's a strong chance Juniper will be forced to kill Arthur when they meet.
