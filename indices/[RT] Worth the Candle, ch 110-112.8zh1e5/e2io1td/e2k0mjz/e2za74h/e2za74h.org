Patreon stats don't seem to suggest a plateau at about 3-4k.

Though I suspect that sluggish growth might be due partly to:

1. audience isolation: web serial authors rarely do marketing or promotions. Spreading awareness of a serial is limited to word-of-mouth (which can be quite limited depending on which communities the recommendations circulate in), aggregator websites (TopWebFiction, AO3) or forum discussion vectors (reddit, SpaceBattles, DLP, etc.). At some point, each community reaches diminishing returns, and combined with the fact that most of these audiences are used to free works, it's not surprising there aren't that many hugely financially successful web serials.

2. release incentive models: certain approaches are correlated with bigger growth spikes. Usually those models are intended to spur and funnel invested readers into higher priced tiers of Patreon (so-called whales) so they can satisfy their cliffhanger insanity. If you compare the three biggest web-serial earners, Wildbow seems to have much less growth spikes than puddles4263 or pirateaba. My guess is because a bonus chapter upon reaching a goal is much less incentivizing at the individual patron level than reading several updates ahead. Paywalling releases is a proven business model in the web-serial-adjacent community doing translations for Chinese web novels, where a translation team earns as much as $10-20k/month.
