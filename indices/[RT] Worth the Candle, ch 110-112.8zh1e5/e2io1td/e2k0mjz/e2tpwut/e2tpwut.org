  armchair speculation says it might be the amount people are comfortable with authors making from their work

Feels like there should be an option on Patreon et al to only show marginal month-over-month change in donation revenue, and hide absolute monthly donation revenue. (Sure, you could calculate it if you tracked the amount each month, but the point is that having the absolute number /right there/ beside the subscribe button seems to act as a deterrent, so less “right there” is better, even if it's still accessible.)
