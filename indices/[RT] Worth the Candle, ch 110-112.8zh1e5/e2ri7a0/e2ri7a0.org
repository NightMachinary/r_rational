Binge read the entire series over the last few days, and boy are my arms tired.

I've gotten pretty annoyed about how much terrible litrpg is being published lately. Shallow protagonists by authors who think that increasing stats equals character development, often just as shallow plot, lazy world building, often times terribly unbalanced or just bad game design it the stats thing is something everyone gets, or is terribly overpowered with no real stakes being far of macguffins of even more power/freedom. It's gotten to the point where I found a decent looking premise isekai book about a trio from Earth swapping places with the big bad demon of another world, but after a bland opening chapter where they get sperated, one gets turned into a wizard and saves a pirate boy from a mob, and then gets to see a character sheet, I just dropped the book there.

Meanwhile, worth the candle has deftly used all the overused tropes to make something fresh. This story is the Evangelion of litrpg, isekai, and arguably harem fantasy/comedy, decon/reconing pretty much every trope in the genres, and will hopefully live on in many hearts after the fad of giving hero protagonists character sheets dies off.

The only major logistics for of the world I see is the confusing nature of how the Pendrag family managed to acquire to many entads that can specifically only be passed down by blood inheritance. Entads are basically randomly dropped onto Aerb, with only a fraction of them being especially powerful with no major downside, so it's rather unfeasible to expect anyone to have more than one good entad that they could only bequeath to their child. With ten generations of a tightly knit court specifically marrying for entads, they would still have has to average an intake of several entads a year. Something just didn't add up to me.

Aerb's Cosmology is rather curious, a giant hex with opposite edges being adjacent makes a tiling plane, but it raises the questions of how the edges were determined, as without a clear border line, the effective edge of the hex could be anywhere. If the border is set by custom rather than evident cosmology, it raises the question of if it's even possible to prove there is only one hex. It could be that each tile is an independent but identical hex, or it could even be some form of the many worlds setup, with each hex different but only by so little that you would have to travel across unfathomable copies to find a difference that was noticable.

On a similar vein, the boundless depth is said to get wider as it gets deeper. This raises the question of how wide can it get, does it slow to a convergence, or get as wide as the hex itself, or somewhere even wider? Also, how deep of a column of air do you need for it to become opaque? I can't help but think that much sir being heated at noon each day would create a pretty brutal updraft.

When Joon made a checkers game in basic, it said that it didn't support kinging or bubblegum. Despite thorough searching, I can't find any reference to what the bubblegum in that sentence refers to, plz explain.

The exclusion zones are a fun, curious, and existentially terrifying phenomenon. One detail that I'm dreadfully curious about is, what shape are the zones? Spheres or 3d stadiums would be my first hunch, but If they're hexagons, that possibly offers an interesting insight into the overall nature of Aerb itself... For that matter, what skill has the label of excluded #1? Looking at the first few exclusions could offer some interesting theories on the principle. Gestalting skills was #4, I wonder what those first three are, possibly to do with world building? Exclusion magic being exclusion #0 would be quite amusing.

The exclusionary principle says that some zones have a set magic/physics that is excluded elsewhere, while others are also locked to a specific person as well. What evidence exists for this to be the case? What rules out the hypothesis that the only difference is that the second type is one the original causer decided to stay because they have mastery over the space?

On the nature of the exclusion zone borders, do they simply block the excluded magic from exiting, or do they at times act as more substantial walls? Eg. Can glass cross the glass fields border in either way, can a zombie cross the risen lands border (does it act like a wall, a vaporizer, or simply stop moving?), can those with a personal zone leave the zone at the cost of losing the unique magic (something that wouldn't be likely done volentarily, but it could be a humane way to deal with a zone), or are they locked in, perhaps by the same "wrap around to the other side" system the hex works on?

The Ice magic exclusion zone was from Arthur making Ice-9, wasn't it?

It's rather curious as to what exactly the exclusionary principle covers, instantly obviously threats to the entirety of Aerb make sense, but the more borderline ones raise the question of some of the equivalent threats that weren't excluded. Why [Redacted], but not the Actual Cannibal? Why Manifest and the goblin, but not the soulraping elf?

Sapient beings have souls, demons and devils are sapient. I can't help but think that the way to reach the magical singularity is to use soul magic to convert six billion demons into skill points.

And that's not even touching on the hinted yet totally untouched areas of questions about the gods.
