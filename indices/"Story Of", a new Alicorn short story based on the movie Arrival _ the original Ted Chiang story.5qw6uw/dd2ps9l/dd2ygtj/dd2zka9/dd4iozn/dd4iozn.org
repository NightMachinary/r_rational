Sure. The entire conceit which Ted Chiang's story examined was the idea that the physics we know does not specify that we should experience "Time" moment by moment. In fact, through the use of Hamiltonians/Lagrangians, you can formulate physics in a causally-global rather than local manner.

The standard example of this ambiguity is that the path a ray of light travels is always a local extremum. It is natural to humans to say "sure, but the /truth/ is that light follows that path because of things going on at every moment", to say that you can compute infinitismal time-slice to infinitismal time-slice where the light ray will move next. But the known physics is agnostic towards this.

So Ted Chiang considers a situation where the metaphysics governing conscious experience isn't tied to one perspective or the other. Humans have the viewpoint corresponding to what we consider straightforward/obvious/Newtonian physics, and then he introduces these other aliens that do not. From their viewpoint, physics is determined globally across time.

Is this sensible? What would it even be like? Does this in any way mesh with our experience of consciousness? What about free will? These are a portion of what gives Ted Chiang's story depth. His careful examination of this idea, melded with the pathos of the story itself, makes the story something special.

The movie missed all of this. For the local/global agnosticism to make sense, /it is not possible for the form of the experience to influence one's actions/. The physics is the same regardless of the perspective, therefore the outcomes are the same. From the outside, you can't tell what the metaphysical perspective is because the physics is the same either way. Ted Chiang makes this very clear in his story. His protagonist describes others experiencing things as she does as fellow actors/conspirators, always flawlessly rehearsing their lines. The lines that a normal human would speak had they not had this shift in conscious perspective.

The movie egregiously has the character taking actions based on future knowledge, meaning that in it the metaphysical perspective on the physics influences the outcome of the physics. Less egregious but still bad, it invents some bizarre reasoning when seemingly her present actions based on future knowledge cannot proceed until after some experience of the future has occurred, which is portrayed as taking real time, as though time is passing now while she experiences things in the future (I'm referring to the scene where she struggles to remember her future self hearing the general share his phone number). Okay, fine, there is nothing wrong with that as a model of someone's experience, except that jettisons everything Ted Chiang introduced to explore the co-existence of the two distinct modes of experience, so the movie is far far weaker than Ted Chiang's story.

tl;dr : Ted Chiang is very careful to examine how two different and completely distinct metaphysics could lead to two completely incomparable kinds of consciousness, where both of these metaphysics are possible compatible perspectives on our physics. The important point was that the physics is the same regardless of the perspective, so you cannot tell which is in effect. This was too deep for the screenwriter or maybe for the studio's perception of the audience's intellect, so instead they made the protagonist into a psychic with the ability to act on her psychic awareness of the future, which has nothing to do with the conceit which made Ted Chiang's story valuable.
