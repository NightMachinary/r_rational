I already agreed with you that deterministic loops are possible. The movie /could/ have been written with the same events but different internal narration in order to convey that Louise lacked free will. But it wasn't. It was written the way it actually was.

There's /zero/ indication that your "deterministic loops" interpretation is actually happening in the movie, and nearly every possible indication to the contrary. The movie also /could/ have been taking place entirely in Louise's imagination, but there's no evidence of that, so it's not a justifiable interpretation. The only way to see this movie as being about deterministic loops is to project your own extra details on top of it. If you just take the actual movie as it was actually written, you can clearly see that Louise is making choices /and that those choices are of narrative significance./ It's completely obvious that the folks involved in the production did /not/ have deterministic loops in mind.
