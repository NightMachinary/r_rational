Again, the explanation you're proposing is no different than proposing "The movie was all a dream" or "The movie takes place in a simulation." It could theoretically work, there's nothing that makes it /impossible,/ but to insist on that explanation is to miss the entire point of the story. You're trying to force the narrative to fit with your understanding of reality, instead of taking the reality of the story for what it is.
