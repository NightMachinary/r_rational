I really don't understand what you're trying to say. In the movie, the decision to have the child is clearly an actual decision, made by free will. The significance of the decision is that Louise /could/ have chosen otherwise, but decided to embark on that journey even though she knew how it would end. The whole ending is framed around Louise's decision and what it says about her.

I didn't /like/ it, but that's how the movie went. Arguing that she actually didn't have free will is reading something into the movie that wasn't there.
