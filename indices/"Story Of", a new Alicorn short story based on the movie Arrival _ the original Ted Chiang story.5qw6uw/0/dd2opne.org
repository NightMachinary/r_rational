It's a sweet little read, and although the tone is borrowed from the short story, it's very clearly based on the movie because Things Don't Work That Way in the story. It has all the problems of the movie, and adds more (e.g. now Louise can remember futures that /never happened/; if reverse causality is cheap in the movie, this is /absurd/!)
