The movie already ruined it, really. Since a major plot point involves Louise /using/ her knowledge of the future to influence the present, it can't be true (in the movie universe) that humans have no free will. The movie also framed Louise's decision to have her doomed child as an actual choice she made, rather than as her helplessly enacting the events she already remembers. I don't think there's anything about the movie that would rule out what happens in the fic.
