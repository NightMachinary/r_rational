The movie doesn't include anyone changing a future they foresaw, true, but in every other respect Louise is portrayed as having free will. There is nothing in the movie to contradict her having free will, and substantial circumstantial evidence to support that she does. It's /only/ in the original story that Louise explicitly lacks free will.
