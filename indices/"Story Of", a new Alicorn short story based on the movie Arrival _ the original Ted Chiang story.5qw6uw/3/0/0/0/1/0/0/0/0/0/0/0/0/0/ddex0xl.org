That doesn't happen in the movie because, in the movie, she's /not/ just playing a part. In the original story, Louise is going through the motions, aware of the future but unable to act on that knowledge. In the movie, her knowledge of the future is a tool, and she has free will.

But if you're trying to say we don't see into her thoughts /at all,/ that's absolutely false. Louise narrates the entire movie, just as she narrates the original story. Those are her thoughts. In her narration--her thoughts--she describes making a deliberate choice to have her child in spite of knowing that the child was doomed.
