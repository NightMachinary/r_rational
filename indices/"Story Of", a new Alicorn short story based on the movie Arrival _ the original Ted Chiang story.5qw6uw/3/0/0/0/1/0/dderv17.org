Sure, that could happen, but I think it's made clear in the movie that it's not a deterministic loop. The aliens describe the future-perception ability as a "tool" they're gifting to humanity in return for our help with some future crisis. It's definitely framed as something Louise can employ to gain foreknowledge and actively take advantage of it.
