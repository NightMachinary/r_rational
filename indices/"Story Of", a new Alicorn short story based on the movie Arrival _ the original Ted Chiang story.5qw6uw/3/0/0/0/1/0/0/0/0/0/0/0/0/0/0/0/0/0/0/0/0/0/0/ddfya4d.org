That's true of almost all movies portraying humanity. I can't think of many movies that are shown lacking free will.

All choices in all movies are narratively significant but it doesn't mean those movies have free will either. And most of those movies don't have 100% accurate future senses either. Yet those movies can be explained with determinism too.

Until the movie shows a clip of a future that hasn't happened the only explanation is that the illusion of free will is maintained and that's a difference between the book and movie.

Your explanation requires information not present and then has to justify how the information interacts while my explanation treats this movie just like all others

Also I'd just reiterate it makes no sense that she choose to see a vision of a future daughter she loved. If she had choice why didn't she see the future son if they fucked the next day instead etc etc
