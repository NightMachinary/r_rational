No, I don't have to explain that. It's not my job to make the movie make sense. Take it up with the scriptwriters.

If you want to argue that the movie contains flaws or inconsistencies, feel feel; I'm not claiming otherwise. I am not a fan of the movie. But I think it's dead obvious from watching it that the writers framed Louise's decision as a genuine one that she freely made, and that Louise having the freedom to make that choice was critical to the theme of the narrative. There was that whole scene about how the father left her because he thought she made "the wrong choice," and that whole internal monologue about prioritizing the journey over the destination. The story the creators of that movie were trying to tell was one about a woman freely choosing to have a child she knew would die young.

I don't know how you can have seen the movie and still argue otherwise. Do you really think the creators were trying to tell the story of a woman who thinks she's choosing to have a child, but actually it's just fate and she never had a choie? Because if that were the case, it would be pretty strange that the movie neglects to even address that possibility at any point, and instead continually harps on the theme that she made a meaningful choice.
