It sounds like you just think there isn't any free will, period, in reality or in any work of fiction ever. Which, fine, but /in the context of this movie/ the characters are clearly intended to have free will. It's a story about a woman gaining an extraordinary tool and deciding how to use it. It's /not/ a story about deterministic loops. Your "analysis" isn't interesting because it has nothing to do with the actual content of the movie; it's just a possibility you could raise about literally anything, much like "it could all be a dream/a simulation."

(She didn't choose to see a vision of the daughter, she chose to /have/ the daughter. Presumably the daughter-future was the "default" outcome if she had no knowledge of the future, and she ended up choosing to go along that path anyway.)
