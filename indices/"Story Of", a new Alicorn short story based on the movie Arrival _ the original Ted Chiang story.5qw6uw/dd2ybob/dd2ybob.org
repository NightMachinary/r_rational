I disagree with the complaints. In the original story, from the perspective of the main character, it seemed like a single timeline, and thus predestination and such exists. But did we ever see the main character test and push these limits? In the movie, there wasn't really time to show such, and thus we never saw for sure what the limits are. I haven't read the short story yet, but I don't think she pushed her limits in the story either. Thus, I find this fix-fic acceptably rational.
