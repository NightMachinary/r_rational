In the short story, it's made very explicit that she /cannot/ push her limits any more than I can jump into the air and fly, ignoring gravity. The entire point is that learning the future means you are /doomed to fulfill it/. I would heartily recommend the story. It's short enough to read inside an hour and easily available on the internet.

That said I do recommend buying the collection ("Story of your life and others") as Chiang writes amazing, rational science fiction. There's a story in that collection about the consequences of a world where angels visiting is a regular occurrance. The ending is extremely emotionally impactful.
