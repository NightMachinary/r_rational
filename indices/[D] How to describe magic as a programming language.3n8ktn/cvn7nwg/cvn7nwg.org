I haven't played them myself, but there are a few code-magic-spells video games around. For example, [[http://codespells.org/][Codespells]] just came out a few weeks ago, and [[http://codemancergame.com/][Codemancer]] is due out in a year. They strive to teach people who've never programmed how to code, so I reckon they'd be pretty broadly accessible. Their implementations might serve as inspiration.
