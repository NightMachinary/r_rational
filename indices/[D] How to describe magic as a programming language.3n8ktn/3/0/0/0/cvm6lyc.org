I do not see how [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming]] would make this work well. Not defining the function's arguments doesn't really make a better syllable-pronunciation? Since you're only invoking functions anyways.

I side with ArgentStonecutter, a stack-based low-level language would be rad for that. Alternatively, I'm not sure of the technical merits of Urbit [[http://urbit.org/preview/%7E2015.9.25/materials/whitepaper][http://urbit.org/preview/~2015.9.25/materials/whitepaper]] but they do sure have a concise way to pronounce their language.
