What level of language is someone using when they say "Abracadabra!" and a fireball comes out?

Go a level lower than that. There's got to be some kind of magical language someone used to program the universe to generate a fireball with a certain momentum when someone says "Abracadabra!" properly. How does that language work?

What's the lowest level? What's the /physical/ mechanism for magic, the equivalent of the science that makes computers run?
