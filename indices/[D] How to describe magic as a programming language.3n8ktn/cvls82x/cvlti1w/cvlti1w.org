I don't tend to find lowest levels fun. You could do it all in assembly, or you could build the logic into the transistors yourself, but if you don't have to do that why would you want to? Efficiency, I guess?

I tend to find lowest levels even /less/ fun in magic systems, both because there's hardly ever anything interesting there and because it takes away from the higher levels. A single deeper (but still somewhat abstract) level is my preference.

But at the very lowest levels, it's about as irrelevant to spellcasting as atomic physics is to warfare, until someone invents a nuke. And then your story is about nukes, which is fine if you want a story about nukes, but not great if you want it to be about anything else.
