I found links to the first two books on the internet archive ([[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100102041439/http://baen.com/library/0671878468/0671878468.htm][here]] and [[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100102041341/http://baen.com/library/0671698567/0671698567.htm][here]]), but I don't know how to get the rest of the series. Do I have to buy it or something?

The main character didn't start munchkining the magic system until the end of the first book, so I thought most of it was pretty boring.
