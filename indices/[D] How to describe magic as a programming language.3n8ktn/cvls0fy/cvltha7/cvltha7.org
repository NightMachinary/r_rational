Well, the /other/ part of the problem is figuring out which features to include in a hypothetical programming magic system, which I think depends on what sort of story you want. Conditionals? Probably yes. Math operations? Also probably yes. Loops? Maybe, but seems broken if you can do =while(true){ThrowFireball()}= so would need some limits. User defined data types? Interfaces? Global variables?
