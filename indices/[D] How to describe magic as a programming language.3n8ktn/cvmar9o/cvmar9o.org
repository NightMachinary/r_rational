You can be very blunt about it and allow computers to be used to draft magic spells, like AutoCAD, complete with simulation software for testing. Most people who will be interested in either science fiction or fantasy will understand the concept of using computers for design, and you can build from there.

Speech therapy classes might be a strict requirement for magicians, for pronunciation reasons. It may even be possible to identify a wizard by the manner of their speech. If you startle someone and they all of a sudden speak far more clearly with no verbal faults, you might be about to get a magic missile where the sun doesn't shine.

Going to the dentist would expose them to a great risk. They would be unable to defend themselves with mushmouth if they accepted painkillers, or have a very strong likelihood of fumbling a verbal component due to swelling or pain if they declined painkillers.

It would be conceivable for a wizard to learn something completely new by simply mispronouncing something, especially if MagiCAD was merely a tool. After they clean their shorts post-mistake, the wizard adds the new concept to MagiCAD, and then starts experimenting with the simulator.

Hrm. That could lead to an interesting whodunnit mystery, with a murdered researcher plotline.
