You could have a way to set sort of 'hot keys' for individual spells, so if you didn't want to spend 2 minutes chanting to get a complex effect, instead you can meditate/study/write out the spell and key it to a shorter phoneme. Make your "Abracadabra-mancychwynhafalsefyllfa defnyddiwracunfilltiriuncyfeiriad!" and map it to "yn hyn llosgi."
