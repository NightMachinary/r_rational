The levels of learning of a mage.

The basic level is mastering the more simple commands- fireball, teleport, invisibility, fly, melt. These are stylistic links to more complicated spells that do something like specify a ball of plasma of a certain size to move from in front of your hand in the direction your index finger is pointing at 100 km/h. In computer terms, running programs. Some programs require greater resources, some less, and this is the level most stop at. When a reception waves her hand and says a few words and a large arrow points you in the right direction, this is an app user.

The next level is use of variables. Perhaps while flying you want to go faster, or in another direction rather than wherever your index finger is pointing, or you want to fly whenever a fireball shoots at you. So you have to learn variables and types of variables. Many of the standard spells are set to accept certain variables.

So, you cast the trigger other spell fireball spell set with the boolean value of 1, then the flying spell and then a number (-400) and then when a fireball flies at you then you'll fly away from your index finger pointing direction at 400km/h.

The next step is learning to use arrays and for if statements.

So, your enemy is fleeing from your fireball at a huge speed. You need an array. You earlier cast a spell, located at distance, and melt. This located at distance has a table of different locations enemies can be at. It then detects them with a laser which reflects off them, and uses the array table to decide on what direction to fire the melt spell, a laser heating spell.

This spell has a for and an if spell in it. For a certain range of numbers it repeats the spell until a laser gets a result indicating an enemy. If it detects that sort of target it sets a boolean value of 1 in a value, and triggers the if spell and fires a laser to melt the target.

Suppose you're a target. You need some way of responding. The next level is functions.

You have a spell. This target is set to wait for a particular input, a laser above a certain amount of energy. If there is no laser the spell is set to loop. If a laser appears, it is set to trigger an invisibility spell. There are different invisibility spells for different wavelengths to defend the person.

And so on.

I'd make spells and lessons centered around real beginner program guides.
