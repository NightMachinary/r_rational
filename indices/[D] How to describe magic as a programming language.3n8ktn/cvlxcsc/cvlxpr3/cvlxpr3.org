That's a good idea. From a narrative-building perspective, I could do an [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue][Action Prologue]] with someone having to hastily construct a spell for some specific purpose which coincidentally gives the bare bones of exposition on how the magic works. (Though I've seen better authors than I am have trouble doing this right, so maybe not.)
