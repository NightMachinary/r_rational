While I generally agree, there are a couple of ways around it.

1. Get a bunch of people on the internet to simulate your small group of researchers.
2. Limit the population of people who can do magic so that there aren't many magical researchers.
3. Set the work of fiction prior to institutionalized research.
4. Set the work of fiction during the era of research.
5. Limit magic so that research is dangerous.
6. Make magic so good that there's not much incentive to expand horizons.
7. Make research difficult enough that progress would naturally be slow.

Then when someone thinks, "Oh, logically they would be able to do =x=!", either it's plausible that a small group of people would have missed it, they had other things they were trying, it would be dangerous, or it requires systems of thought that they don't have access to.

(Of the three stories I have in draft mode right now, /Robot, Vampire, Wizard/ uses 2,4,6, /The Four Methods/ uses 2,3,5,6, and /The Gift and the Burden/ uses 3,4,7.)
