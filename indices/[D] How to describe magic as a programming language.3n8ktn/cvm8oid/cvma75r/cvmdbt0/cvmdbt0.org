I use a lot of similar restrictions for my one of my own sort of programmingish magic systems.

1. Resource scarcity (e.g. spells requiring material components, power sources, etc). If different types of spells require different components this makes the restriction even more significant.
2. Parameters that restrict the degree to which spells can be customized. (E.g. you can only combine your fireball with two other parameters, only one of which can be a range parameter, etc.)
3. Cultural values that make specific types of magic taboo or illegal.
4. Cultural values that discourage the spread of information.

etc.
