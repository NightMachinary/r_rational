I feel like a core problem of magic-as-programming is that it feels impossible to set real limits or make the effects of those laws predictable to the reader. This is true of any mechanical theory of magic - any attempt to postulate an underlying set of mechanical laws by which magical forces interact. They all seem to run into the same problem in my mind, namely that it would take an /enormous/ amount of work to be at all realistic about what sort of spells could or would be built out of low-level lawful blocks.

That's why Brian Sanderson has exactly 14(?) kinds of magic you can use in Mistborn, each operating on clearly defined laws and most of them not industrially useful. Rather than, say, Sanderson giving a set of cellular-automaton rules you can use to craft spells. In theory, the latter system could be simpler and more lawful. In practice it's impossible for any of us to imagine what even a small society of magical researchers working for a few decades, would be able to craft using a magical cellular automaton. All we can do on our own is the first month of one person's research inside that magical system. So if the author alleges to you that magic has a programming language or any other mechanical set of interactions at the bottom, in literary practice you're left with a batch of spells that the author has just ruled into existence. There's no license for the reader to assume that anything they can think of doing with the automaton rules will thereby be doable in the story.

This is why Sam Hughes's Ra never spells out the programming language. It's why Rick Cook's Wizardry series never spells out the programming language. One author can't actually go from the low level to the high level - all they can do are tell you, "Here are the final spells." Does a magical researcher discover a way of combining the features of two spells? That insight had better not be a critical plot puzzle, because there was no way for the reader to guess that would be allowed.

Mistborn's magic is more suited to Fair Play Insight puzzles, because we know the characters aren't going to invent a new metal that acts like a combination of Pewter and Iron or whatever. A smart character can burn both Iron and Pewter at the same time and use a clever combination of effects, but the library of spell effects is strictly limited and packaged into solid blocks, thus presenting a fair puzzle in terms of what you can do by combining those effects.

One of the fictional setups I'm considering has magical races where each magical species can produce a small set of effects operating according to strict explicit rules. In this setup, there are no half-breeds. There are no ways to produce new magical species. There's a finite list of magical effects, and a human reader can know all of the rules governing them. We can call this "Mistbornlike magic." It doesn't require that magic be mechanical or mundane in its effects - some of the magic can revolve around thought and emotion. What it requires is that the library of magical effects be short enough for humans to read.
