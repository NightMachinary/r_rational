Don't underestimate the power of pre-scientific societies slowly advancing their tech!

I suspect the only reason we're not more impressed with the kind of stuff pre-scientific cultures in our world did with our "basic rules" is that it's all so familiar; and even then, you get stuff like the Pyramids that freak moderns out. The ancient world went through countless iterations of various kinds of arms race to bring you "basic" medieval-style tech, and it'd be odd if they hadn't done the same with magic.

Assuming magic is old, of course.
