I can imagine a series where magic /does/ run on a cellular automaton or other formalism, but it's the beginning of the Enlightenment and the scientific method has just been invented. Until now, sorcerors have used magic by sheer trial and error, and now they are actually getting to understand the structure. The main characters would be in the position of doing all that research from the ground up; given a short time frame on the book, this could fit within the author's ability to imagine.

Ideally this would be handled something like the /1632/ universe, where Flint set up the rules and then opened it to other authors so that the history would feel real. He keeps control over the broad strokes of things (e.g. there's a master list of uptimers and you're not allowed to make up more), but individual authors can go off in their own direction.
