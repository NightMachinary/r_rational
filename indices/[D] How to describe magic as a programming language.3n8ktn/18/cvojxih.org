  A large part of my difficulty here is that I don't know how much the average person with no knowledge of computer programming would be able to make the connections.

Are you familiar with Homestuck?

The protagonist is a kid who enjoys programming but is not very good at it. He has a magic item that is like a bag of holding that follows the rules of a stack data structure.

Watching him experiment with his "stack modus captchalogue" allows the reader to understand the rules of that magic item without being burdened with lots of exposition and without having to know a lot about data structures.
