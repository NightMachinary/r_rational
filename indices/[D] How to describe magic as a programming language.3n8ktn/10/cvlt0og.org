I like the concept of showing meditation or study of a spell or grimoire, and from there, you could show that the "abracadabra" is really just a mnemonic for that spell, possibly even showing some sort of alias spell for "saving" a new one.

If you want to show rather than tell, perhaps an equivalent to shaping exercises from Mother of Learning that shows the underlying spell "language", or to allow the reader to discover on their own, have spells work like some German words, where the spell for fireball is shown at the same time or after showing the spells for start campfire, push object, and protect self from heat.
