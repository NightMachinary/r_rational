Rick Cook did a great job of this in [[http://www.baenebooks.com/showproduct.aspx?ProductID=1632&SEName=the-wizardry-compiled][The Wizardry Compiled]].

This is a pretty good read on how a programmer could munchkin the hell out of a magic system. The whole series is worth reading. Each book builds well on the previous ones, the fantasy world has a credible economy and politics, and fucking up the magical economy has real consequences... and not just on the humans.
