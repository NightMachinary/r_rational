Limitations on magic systems are one of those things that you can calibrate in a lot of different ways. Mana is one of the most well-worn. The system I'm using for /The Four Methods/ setting (described in a link in the OP) uses something similar; depending on which school of magic you're using, you're getting poisoned, getting weakened, losing memories, or going insane. That's standard "magic has a cost" stuff.

But you can also add in things like "there's an =x= per minute chance for an IllegalThreadStateException to be thrown, causing a fatal caster error", or something like that.
