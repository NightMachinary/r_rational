Several series - serieses? serii? - have magic-as-language; you describe the effect, and Magic obeys your instructions.

Of course, the philosophy-of-language differs; Earthsea language is prescriptivist "true name" stuff, whereas Eragon magic can have multiple different spells from the word /fire/ based on context and intent.

So I'd do it like this:

#+begin_quote
  /Magic is not a human!/ Magic - spirits, runes, whatever - understands /only/ what is explained to it! It will not understand from context! It will not understand what you /meant/! The great Mages of old have exhaustively defined various words, like "fire", for Magic. Some concepts have /never/ been successfully defined!

  In this class, we'll be creating a simple "fireball" spell. We use Maxwell's system of Co-ordinates to tell magic where to create the fire - a foot to the left and three in front of my heart. We then specify the amount of fire, and it's dimensions, according to the True Names of the numbers; and invoke it all with the Word "/fire/". Finally, we tie the spell to be invoked by a word and a gesture ...

  Like so: /IFF-gesture1-THEN-create-elementFIRE-spec-input-hlfSbb-radius-qegbq-coord-vrjhjyrsj-atjanzana-ajnnarja-endspec-ENDIF/

  The spell executes thus:

  /snaps finger/ FOOM

  As you can see, the candle has been lit. Care must be taken to avoid specifying a flame of ten units rather than one or one-tenth of a unit, or mistakenly invoking the gesture of a spell - FOOM - you see? Now imagine if this were accidentally placed inside my head, or inside my hand ...
#+end_quote

And then just continue the story as normal, perhaps with the protagonists giving vaguely programmer-y partial explanations whenever they prepare their daily spells. I think reader will usually swallow a mentor or teacher giving a quick example, and you really just need a quick example of the spell "code" underlying a simple "program" and a hint that there's deeper "machine code" beneath.

Oh, also, if I was a wizard I'd make the programming language at least somewhat like English. Even if I had to write a new compiler for it. It's just common sense.
