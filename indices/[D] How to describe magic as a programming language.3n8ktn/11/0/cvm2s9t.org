  The thing is, I think the sexiness isn't in the fact that the wizard is using a programming language, but exactly what it means to be using a programming language at all.

Yup, this is something that I'm trying to keep in mind. It's the joy of going from a defined program with a bunch of built-in stuff and then cracking it open to change how it works internally. Or it's stitching two libraries together in order to get something novel up and running, like retooling that fireball into a flamethrower or an arc welder.
