It means my target audience is 9-14 year-olds. Middle Grade is the category for books that aren't for young children but not for Young Adults either. The first Harry Potter book is a Middle Grade book, for example. As are the Artemis Fowl series, and the Percy Jackson books. This book is more in line with Encyclopedia Brown though, a shorter story about kids in middle school doing interesting things.

In this case, it's my take on Mission Impossible (the TV series, not the films) with smart characters trying to accomplish incredible things just using logic and what resources they can put together. I wanted to do something that wasn't just another kids mystery novel, but the reverse - a kids heist story. There aren't many of those for young teens, and heist stories can be a lot of fun. (I did an extensive study of heist stories before I wrote it to make sure I had the tropes and key elements down.)

Let me know if I succeeded! It's free today as well.

Thanks for the question. :-)
