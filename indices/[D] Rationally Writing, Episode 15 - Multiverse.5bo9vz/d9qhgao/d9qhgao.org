A thought on an alternate approach: how about a theoretically unbounded multiverse balanced by a rigorously defined, limited mechanism for accessing different worlds? So instead of the tension from a character death being either "oh no, he was the only one" or "oh no, I arbitrarily care about him in particular because he's the version we've been following", it's "oh no, he's the only one for practical purposes because there's no obvious way to find a universe with another one of him". Essentially a compromise between "there's a finite number of universes" and "there's an infinite number of universes" - "there's an infinite number of universes but contacting them is hard".

One setting idea I've batted around a bit in my head is a world where some small number of people split the universe in two when they're born and live in them simultaneously, like Coil from Worm minus the ability to pick a universe and resplit. These people have advantages - they can pass scientific advances and artistic works between worlds - but also disadvantages - they suffer from varying forms of mental instability resulting from failure to mentally separate the two worlds in which they live. When they die in one universe, for any reason, they also naturally die in the other.
