That's the kind of distinction that makes a difference, yeah. Have you ever read The Talisman, by Stephen King and Peter Straub? Its "twinners" are similar to what you describe.

It's a great story, but it only uses the concept very lightly: I'd be interested in a story that really focuses on it more.
