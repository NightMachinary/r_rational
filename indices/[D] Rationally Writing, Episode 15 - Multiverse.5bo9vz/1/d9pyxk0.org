Welcome back everyone! Sorry it's late, some technical difficulties wiped out a couple hours of editing work, but I'm happy with how it came out. This week we explore the different types of Multiverse stories, and how to make them compelling and rational.

If anyone has an iTunes account and wants to leave us a review there, it would be much appreciated, and stay tuned after the outro music for my book recommendation!

Enjoy!
