If you haven't already read Worth the Candle, the most recent batch of chapters actually features an entire society of one woman who can clone herself at will (and so can her clones) kept quasi-controlled by the fact that they're all awful people and are constantly backstabbing each other.

Obviously this is only one small, small part in an enormous story, but even if you never planned on reading WtC (which you should, its really good) you might enjoy reading those few chapters as a kind of standalone.
