I've read them already, though I'm not a fan. They're a good example of the utopian literature genre that I mentioned, and so in that sense they're pedagogical. I'm familiar with most mainstream utopian fiction as it's something I've researched and read widely. I'd be curious about fiction in a more narrowly pedaggocial tradition, though if there's weird utopian stuff that I haven't heard of I'd take a look.

I'd say Rand is a good storyteller and rhetorician, and fiction is a good place to get across a worldfiew. The worldview in her case is just pretty limited.
