I'm looking for stories where the main character has a "tanky" build. This could be anything from being a tank class in a litrpg, or a guy with deadpool-like regeneration, or a mage with defense and healing oriented spells, etc. Basically, I'm looking to see how people with lots of self-healing ability use their powers well. Examples:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13067349/1/An-Exercise-in-Stupidity][An Exercise in Stupidity]] has a gamer mc that goes full tank/blood mage. Stupidly high health and regeneration, combined with some potent blood magic. Fun stuff.

- Defiance of the Fall on royalroad has a character whose highest stat ends up being endurance, which of course leads to lots of abuse on his body. Fun cultivation stuff.
