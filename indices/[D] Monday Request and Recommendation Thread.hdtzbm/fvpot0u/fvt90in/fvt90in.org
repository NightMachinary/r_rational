You might enjoy the [[https://www.amazon.com/Fimbulwinter-Daniel-Black-Book-1-ebook/dp/B00KZ41LHM][Daniel Black]] series.

The main character gets summoned to an alternate Europe on the verge of Ragnarok to serve as a protector for one of the last worshipers of one of the Greek gods, who had been defeated by the Norse pantheon many years ago. The process of being summoned across realities allows him to gain access to several powerful magics one of which is a healing power, and he often ends up needing it.

I will say though, that while the fights are good and the world-building is interesting the books have (what feels to me) like a gratuitous amount of sex scenes and the author is a bit of an edgelord with some not-so-great politics. It wasn't enough to ruin my enjoyment of the series, but it did have me rolling my eyes more than once.
