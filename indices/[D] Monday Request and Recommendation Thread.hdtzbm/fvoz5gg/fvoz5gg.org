The title is garbage but is a good read. Set in a different universe with different physics with a character from Earth and written by an author who actually knows physics(teaches it). Some fun alternate physics like objective meaning.

​

"When mysterious portals start opening up around the world at large events, swallowing everybody, you'd think that would warrant some kind of danger pay when you have to sell hotdogs at a Comic Con, right? ‘No, of course not; what are the odds of that happening here, out of all the big events in the world?'

Well, Emma was always pretty good at beating the odds when it came to shitty luck.

Now she's stuck in a strange dimension, where the normal rules don't seem to apply, together with a costumed crowd who seem strangely happy about this whole thing.

At least, until the first people start dying."
