The SI protagonist in the Naruto fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16017161/][Plasticity]] might qualify.

From the start of the fic, she is stuck in situations where her fate is controlled by people much stronger than her. She maintains her sanity through acts of petty rebellion (trolling) that sometimes have hilarious, snowball-effect repercussions. Her entire existence becomes an escalating con-game balanced on making her enemies believe that she is more useful than irksome.
