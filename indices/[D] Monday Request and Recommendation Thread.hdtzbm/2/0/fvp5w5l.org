Calvin from [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager][Wake of the Ravager]] is definitely non-Lawful-Good, and also a troll... sort of. He's really enjoyable in an authentic teenager sorta way, as in he makes terrible decisions that pan out in hilarious ways, while also being authentic to his character. I recommend it for the slapstick humor.
