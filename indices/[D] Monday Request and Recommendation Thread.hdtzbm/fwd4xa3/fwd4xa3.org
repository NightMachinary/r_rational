hi guys, I wanted to ask for some good fanfiction recommendations, as a general rule I can't stand people holding the idiot ball and I'm looking for a completed or regularly updating fiction of at least 500.000 words. I just recently started reading fanfiction because I used to find the idea of it unappealing but I started reading some Warhammer and GoT quests and that lead to me reading HPMOR, the aritmancer, fairy dance of death, etc and giving it an honest attempt, however navigating [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] to find anything interesting is impossible and fucking disgusting... unless I'm missing something.

edit: I want to add that I really didn't like worm so please no worm fanfic.
