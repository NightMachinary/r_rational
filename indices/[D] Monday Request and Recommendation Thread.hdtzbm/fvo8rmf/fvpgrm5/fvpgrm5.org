TPP is an interesting one, it's more of a memetic weapon than a book.

If you're a dev or IT worker and happen to agree with the message, buy a copy for your manager/teammates/team leader and it will do the hard work of dragging them towards your viewpoint.

It uses a whole bunch of tricks, like giving every type of reader a path to agreeing with it without having to admit more than a token amount of fault for their past actions.

It puts you in the shoes of lots of stakeholders, teaching you to empathise with them.

It tries to get you to stop think of departments as tribes, instead encouraging all the departments to form a super “us vs. the baddies” tribe.

It slams you over the head again and again with an Umbridge-esque villain who you definitely wouldn't want to think of yourself as being like, would you?

It keeps you in a constant state of anxiety, making you want to keep reading until things get better. Like the first Endbringer fight in Worm, but it's the whole book.

All of that plus like a dozen other tricks.
