I read Taint a while ago. In my opinion, it was pretty great in the beginning, before she rejoined the real world, but started to fall off pretty fast afterwards.

The "gimmick" of a character forgetting how to be a nice moral human as a result of centuries of isolation (and some biological change?) started to drag when she never really developed as a character (at least as far as I came before I dropped it, somewhere around Chapter 54 I guess).

She was a monster and acted like a monster, and the whole villain-protagonist shtick is difficult to get right. Light, from Death Note, is an entertaining one, but she wasn't imo. Maybe in part because Death Note framed Light as a villain from the start, while the story never really framed her as one, despite the monstrous acts she committed.
