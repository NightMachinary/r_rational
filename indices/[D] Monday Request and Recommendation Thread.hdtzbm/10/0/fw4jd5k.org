Read a few dozen chapters into the manga and dropped it. It falls into a few common pitfalls of uplift fics, and especially japanese uplift fics:\\
* MC manages to be incredibly productive as a child\\
* story focuses on the MC being a child, consequently dragging on without getting to a point where the MC can be really influential\\
* focuses on the sale of 'advanced' cosmetics; cosmetics become instantly popular without culture clash or going out of fashion\\
* (YMMV) love interest is a child the same physical age (but obviously not the same mental age) as the OC (it's no Mushoku Tensei, but still).

It's obviously wish fulfilment, which, fine, it's actually a bad thing, but if the novels are anything like the manga I wouldn't recommend it.
