I'd also reccomend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross-horror.831104/]] (SCP / Jumpchain), as part of a wider conclusion that Jumpchains don't really work with a helpful benefactor or a jumper that can pick their own jumps. Either one of them completely bleeds out almost all of the tension very fast, and actively resist ways to believably add it. With enough work you might be able to manage a slice of life or power fantasy where these two don't hold true, but nobody seems to try for the first and the second tends to just be disappointing ime.
