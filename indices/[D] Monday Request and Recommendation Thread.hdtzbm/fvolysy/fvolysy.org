I would like to recommend the only jumpchain fic that I liked apart from Companion Chronicles: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/as-a-consequence-of-your-action-jumpchain.845425/][As A Consequence Of Your Action]]

Author summary: /Most Jumpchains assume that your ROB is either absent or interested solely in their or your own entertainment. But what if a Jumper had a Benefactor with a... different agenda?/

It is currently on its second major arc and updating daily. The characters are three dimensional, the plot is moving at a decent pace and so far there are no idiot balls. The main twist of this jumpchain is that there are no companions and that one of ROBs goals seems to be the SI's emotional suffering. At least that is the SI's current rational conclusion based on the available data so far.

The setting of the first arc was Girl Genius. Currently the second arc is Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
