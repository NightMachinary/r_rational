Personally, I enjoyed the Girl Genius arc despite knowing nothing about the source material. I suspect that I missed a lot of nuance here and there and especially in the beginning many times new things were introduced that felt like they come out of nowhere, but all in all I feel that enough is explained to make a complete story.

Put another way, after finishing the whole arc and looking back, I have a feeling like I understand what has happened.

I cannot judge as to the second arc, because I am familiar with the BtVS fandom.
