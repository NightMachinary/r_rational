Is Taint any good? I read a few of the comments and it seems to be a cultivation/xianxia story.

I'd like to mention a few stories that have substantial amounts of wilderness survival/exploration, although they aren't primarily about that.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report][The Snake Report]] has the main character spend the first book trying (and succeeding hilariously) to survive. One of the earliest reincarnated-as-an-animal stories I've found that are written originally in English. Currently on hiatus, although I find that book 2 ends at a nice note.

- [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/12311119706248305/Paragon-of-Destruction][Paragon of Destruction]] doesn't start off with wilderness survival, but after a while the main character starts spending increasingly more time by himself exploring the wilderness. It's a generic xianxia story, but written well enough that the usual trappings of xianxia aren't present.

- Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is a light novel series where a group of b-tier adventurers try and struggle to survive after being transmigrated. There's a bunch of wilderness survival, and the characters do struggle a lot to even achieve decency at their craft. I wasn't able to stick to it after volume 13, but ymmv.
