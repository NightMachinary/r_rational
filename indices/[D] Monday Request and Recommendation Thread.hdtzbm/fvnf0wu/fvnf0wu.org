A while ago I asked for scifi/fantasy wilderness survival stories and got some suggestions. I've been looking around since then and I've found a few I'd like to mention:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20364/chimera][Chimera]]: A monster that is vaguely human eats other monsters to gain some of their strengths. The writing isn't bad enough to get in the way of the story but the story isn't updated currently and was moving away from wilderness survival anyway.

[[https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/][Taint]]: Girl gets trapped in a dungeon, spends several hundred years killing demons and forgetting social norms. Not really wilderness survival and also on hiatus.

[[http://intothemire.com/][Into the Mire]]: Absolutely my favorite in this list. Great characterization, great writing, interesting plot.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26734/eight][Eight]]: Isekai featuring an older protagonist in a child's body surviving in a wilderness populated by fire turkeys and ice deer. Decent writing but moving away from wilderness survival after the first arc.

In addition I also found a surprising amount of erotic literature in this genre, but nothing I would recommend. If you have nothing better to do and can stand the constant mentioning of ears and clunky prose while skipping half of the word count maybe you'll find something interesting but I've moved on in my search.

Aside from the above I'd love any additional wilderness survival or isolated protagonist recommendations!
