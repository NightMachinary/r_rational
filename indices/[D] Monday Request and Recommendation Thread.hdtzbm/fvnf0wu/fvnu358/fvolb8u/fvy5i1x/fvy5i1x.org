[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/4293/the-iron-teeth-a-goblins-tale][The Iron Teeth]]: A goblin got adopted by an old scout of a bandit tribe amidst unruly northern wilderness. Aside from the wilderness survival, my favorite aspect about it is how the mc is not at all concerned with being rational, being a simple goblin, which I suppose is an antithesis to this entire subreddit, but it makes for a good palette shift after you've read some particularly heavy things or just depressed.

It had plenty of contents, but while it is technically completed, it kinda drags a bit and the ending is rather disappointing so you might want to stop before then.
