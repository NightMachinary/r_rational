That's a good point. Thinking about it more, there's also the fact that most people would want to go to a relatively peaceful realm if they could get to choose. Like, what sort of person picks Warhammer 40k to live in over Star Trek? Apart from a slice of life or a power fantasy, the only alternative I can see is to have a protagonist who is insane/very deeply flawed i.e., one who constantly makes suboptimal choices
