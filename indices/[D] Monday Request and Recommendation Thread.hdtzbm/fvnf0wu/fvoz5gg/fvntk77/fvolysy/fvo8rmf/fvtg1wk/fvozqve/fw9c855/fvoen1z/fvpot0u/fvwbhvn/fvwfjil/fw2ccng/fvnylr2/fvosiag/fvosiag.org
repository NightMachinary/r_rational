I think you will be disappointed looking for stories like this, because there's very little story there that is accessible to our experience: The best explanation in this can be found in Iceman's cautions about writing from CelesteAI's perspective for optimalverse fanfiction. Some stories that might work, but without the HPMOR skin are: Accelerando which points in that direction, universal paperclips which has it as a plotpoint for it's infinite recursion, the last question, and Death's End (third book of three body problem), and the Causaul Angel. Pretty much all of these involve some fade to black, though there is some (very little) physics porn for the solutions in the last two.
