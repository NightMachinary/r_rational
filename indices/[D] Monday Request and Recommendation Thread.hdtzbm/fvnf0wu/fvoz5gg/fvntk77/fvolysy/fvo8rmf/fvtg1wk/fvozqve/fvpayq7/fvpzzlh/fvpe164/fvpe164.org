[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28049/tricksters-luck][Trickster's Luck]] is my favourite, and I don't /think/ it's in the top rankings? (Though it should be; in my opinion it's extremely underrated.) VR LitRPG, quite long already and only promises to be significantly more so. Very detailed and well-written, very well thought out, with likeable characters and some extremely compelling mysteries. Can't recommend it enough.
