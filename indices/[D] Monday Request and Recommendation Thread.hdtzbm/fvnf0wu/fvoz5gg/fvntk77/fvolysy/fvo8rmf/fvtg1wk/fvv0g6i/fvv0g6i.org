A dark setting where people, through heroic effort and great sacrifice, can make a difference? You've read [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], right? Teenage girl with bug powers wants to become a hero to help her city?

If you want an /actual/ grimdark setting, I'd have to recommend [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]. Alt-history 1920ies where the British Empire took over the Frankenstein experiments and conquered the world with zombie armies, told from the POV of one of their new experiments, a group of children trained as assassins and infiltrators.
