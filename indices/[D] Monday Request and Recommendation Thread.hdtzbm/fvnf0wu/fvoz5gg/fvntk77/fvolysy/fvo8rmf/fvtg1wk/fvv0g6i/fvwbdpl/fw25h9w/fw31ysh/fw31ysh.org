Actually, each trilogy in Lawrence's Broken Empire setting follows a similar arc: The main character starts out only motivated by self interest, but through trials and tribulations they grow to be a better, more 'heroic' person motivated to protect the people they care for. Ultimately, their actions massively change the world for the better.
