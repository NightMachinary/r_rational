You are mistaken then.. MC unifies the country he's in which leads to a technological renaissance after the story is over. Even though he only did it for his ambition. His actions end his worlds middle ages stasis.

His other book is not bleak at all, the MC saves her country and indirectly gets access to a terraforming tool that will extend the ability of her planet to sustain human life long enough for humans to regain the technology they lost and leave the doomed planet..

His ending are fairly good, maybe the best in fantasy, he does them well and makes them make a difference.
