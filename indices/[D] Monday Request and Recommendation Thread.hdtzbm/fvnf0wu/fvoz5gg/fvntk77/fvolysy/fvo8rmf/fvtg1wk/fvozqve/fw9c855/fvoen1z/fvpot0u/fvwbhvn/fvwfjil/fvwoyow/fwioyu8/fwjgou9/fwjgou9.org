When I read it, I had played all of the Mass Effect series but didn't know anything about XCOM.

In my opinion, the author covers all of the important worldbuilding details during the course of the story, so you don't need to have played either game beforehand. At most, it might be a good idea to look up some pictures of what each alien race looks like, but it's not necessary.
