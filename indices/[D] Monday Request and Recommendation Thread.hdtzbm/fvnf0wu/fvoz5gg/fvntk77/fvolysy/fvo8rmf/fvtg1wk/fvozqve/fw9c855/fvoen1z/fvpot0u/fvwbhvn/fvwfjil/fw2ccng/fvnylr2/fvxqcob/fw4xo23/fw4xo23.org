I read something called Super Minion which may not be that rational but is a rationalist work. The setting is broadly superheroish, clearly worm inspired but doesn't have the same themes. It's set in the future but might as well be an alternate world. Every few years an event called "Odd Summer" occurs, during the three or so months odd things happen with often world altering consequences, superpowers and mutations being the more reliable occurances. It follows an initially unnamed bioweapon prototype in a lab undergoing testing/training. It consists of a biomechanical core surrounded by nanite filled flesh, it's powerset could be described as being like Prototype but if Alex Mercer had to adhere roughly to the laws of physics and biology. The nanites aren't Von Newman machines by design and self destruct if disconnected from the core for more than half a second or so along with any cells. This weapon has a powerfull but very simple inteligence, over time it has reasoned from available information that since the tests have gone on for as long as it knows and show no sign of stopping that it will eventually die in one of the tests, it realizes something needs to change but that's the limit of it's capacity for abstract thought, it's incapable of coming up with entirely novel ideas like escape. With this in mind when it's contacted from an unknown source sending the file "human.exe" it accepts and runs it considering the high risk lower than the alternative not doing so and continuing as things are. I like how it justifies the MC's humanish behavior but simultaneously serves as a sort of deconstruction, it treats the brain as a tool of thought, an incredibly useful and powerful one but a tool nevertheless, for example at one point it has an impulse to tell someone trusted it's true nature but on the core level it decides against it as it's a purposeless risk and has no clear reasoning behind it to verify. I also like how it tries to generalize from known information and often reaches strange or flawed conclusions from limited information, such as spending much of the story modeling humans as a sort of eusocial insect. I also like the MC's endless confusion over the almost pathalogical obsession humanity seems to have with rectangles.
