The Naruto fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5207262/1/Indomitable][Indomitable]] has a lot of plot built around Naruto using both permanent and temporary clones to do a lot of things at once. It's by the same author as Time Braid, which some people justifiably don't like. It's not nearly as bad, but it still has some of the same themes. It's also frustratingly incomplete, but I think it's good enough to recommend anyway.
