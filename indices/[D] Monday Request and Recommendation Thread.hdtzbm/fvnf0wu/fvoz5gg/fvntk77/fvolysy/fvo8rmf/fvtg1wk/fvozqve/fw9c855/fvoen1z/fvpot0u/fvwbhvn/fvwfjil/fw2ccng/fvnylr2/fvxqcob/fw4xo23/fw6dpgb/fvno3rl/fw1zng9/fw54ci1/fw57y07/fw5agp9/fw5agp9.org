Ah. The only thing I've read close to that is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20243/the-demon-lords-lover][The Demon Lord's Lover]]. It's more a fluffy romantic comedy than say slice of life, but there is plenty of that too.

There's also The Daily Grind, although it's more action-y.

Other than that haven't really seen much polyamory done in fiction.
