As a counterpoint to the other poster, it has some really really interesting world-building and keeps the scale small, and if you enjoyed the anime, the books keep going with that quite well.

I also think the other poster is being..hmm. Like their expectation that the story would be about when Myne was grown up, that she can't have any real influence when a child, is twisting their view of whats going on. The shampoo and decorative hair clips being as popular as they are is a bit unrealistic, though there hasn't been time for them to even come into fashion really, let alone go out of fashion. Also, the MC is still a child, a weird knowledgeable, and obsessive child, but they aren't just an adult in a child's body. But maybe the manga is ahead of the English translation of the books.
