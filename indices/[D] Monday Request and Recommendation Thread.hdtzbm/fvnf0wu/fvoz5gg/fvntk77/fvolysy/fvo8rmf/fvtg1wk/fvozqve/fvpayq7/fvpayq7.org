I have a few webnovels that I've liked over my journeys across RR and various wordpress stories. There's a bunch of stuff here that's just meh, but there are a few good ones as well.

- Delve and Ar'Kendrythist are both about equally good imo. They're the best in litrpg I've found in RR. Both have great three dimensional characters and interesting, crunchy magic. Ar'Kendrythist is much longer, and has a bit more slice of life. They both start similarly but diverge wildly from there.

- Wake of the Ravager is sorta litrpg. Lots of comedy, makes me laugh most chapters. The use of magic is good too, and it's really interesting with the mutations.

- Infinite Realm: Monsters & Legends is a well done fusion of cultivation and litrpg. Follows multiple main characters, all of whom seem to be well written, although most people seem to like Ryun the most.

- [[https://chyoa.com/story/The-Gamer%2C-Chyoa-edition.12004][The Gamer]] on chyoa.com is an erotica inspired by the manwha of the same name. I recommend neo_kenka's route, since it's both long and tackles some interesting themes (for an erotica). I've recommended it before on this account [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fw0ar9/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fmnd23v/][here]].

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]] is a litrpg rwby AU, but it's so alternate that imo it's better off being an original series, because there's nothing similar to rwby here other than character names and some concepts. Completed at 1.1 million words.

- The Snake Report is one of the earlier original English raincarnated-as-a-monster novels in RR. Pretty good and funny, although on hiatus right now.

- The Scourged Earth has one of the most interesting system apocalypses. Currently on hiatus.

- Magik Online has some really cool magic, goes from street tier all the way to astronomical. On hiatus but ends at a nice note.

- Friendly Neighborhood Necromancer has the mc transmigrate to the world of the mmorpg he plays as his preferred class. Really chill slice of life, with the occasional murderhobo rampage. Currently on hiatus.

- Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash has a bunch of b-tier adventurers struggle to survive in a typical isekai world after being transmigrated. Sorta litrpg I guess? I didn't stick with it beyond volume 13, but it was decent.

- Change: New World is one of the earlier system apocalypse stories. Abandoned, I think.

- Reborn: Apocalypse is also a litrpg fused with cultivation. First two books are awesome, third book was equal parts awesome and a letdown (in terms of pacing, although stuff does happen). Sorta like Death Note in a xianxia setting.
