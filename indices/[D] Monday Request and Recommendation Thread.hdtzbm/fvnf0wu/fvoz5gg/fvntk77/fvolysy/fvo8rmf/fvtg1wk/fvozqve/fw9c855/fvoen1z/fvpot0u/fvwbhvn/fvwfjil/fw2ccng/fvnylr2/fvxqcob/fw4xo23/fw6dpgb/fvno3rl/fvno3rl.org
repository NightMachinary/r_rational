Do any of you have recommendations for some decent Planswalker fanfics that are either ongoing or have at least one major plotline completed? I don't expect anything fully rationalist, but something a fan of this subreddit would enjoy that lacks most of the pitfalls like idiot balls, lack of understanding or care for the settings used and so on would be appreciated.

I'll give one as well: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/that-first-step-si.5342/][That First Step]] (and subsequent books) by Hiver. An SI with a massive case of amnesia lands in the world of WarCraft. Slowly he finds out that his magic is very unusual.

I actually never read beyond the first couple of books and the plot goes relatively slowly, seeming like more of a slice of life story at first. I still enjoyed it and felt like it did what it tried to do well enough.
