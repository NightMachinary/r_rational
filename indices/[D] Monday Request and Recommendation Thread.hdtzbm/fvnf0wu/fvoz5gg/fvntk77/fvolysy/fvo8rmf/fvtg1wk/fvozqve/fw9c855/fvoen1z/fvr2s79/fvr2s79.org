Strong recommend, but I wouldn't oversell its maturity. It is relatively intelligent, but what LoGH excels at is inspiring characters and great conversations that are simply a pleasure to listen to. The quality of politics and strategy is inconsistent, though they do hit some notable highs that make it all worth it. Expect the occasional silly strategy and dumb politician to mar an otherwise great experience.

I wouldn't describe it as dry. After the slow start its one of those things that one binge watches because he can't resist after the end of an episode. I would recommend watching at least until around episode 25. Tragedy, boldness and smooth storytelling come together pretty well.
