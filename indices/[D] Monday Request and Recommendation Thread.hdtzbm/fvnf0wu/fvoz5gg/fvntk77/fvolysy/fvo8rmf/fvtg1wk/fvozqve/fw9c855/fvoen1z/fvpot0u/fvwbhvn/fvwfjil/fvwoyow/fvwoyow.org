You might enjoy [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psi-effect-me-xcom-thread-2-rise-of-the-party-boat.307972/][Psi Effect]]. It's a series of stories set in a Mass Effect/XCOM crossover universe.

The basic premise is that Humanity encountered Mass Effect's Citadel Races /after/ defeating the alien aggressors in the XCOM series. The storyline is mainly told from the perspective of the Citadel Races making first contact with a mysterious, possibly benevolent (but often terrifying) alien civilization - i.e. Humanity.

In my opinion the author has a flair for exploring the culture clashes between alien races on both the personal and the broader societal level. The story also does a great job of demonstrating the strategic thinking of each side.
