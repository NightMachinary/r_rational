What do you mean by poly slice of life exactly?

Spice and Wolf is an enjoyable but slow romance between a merchant and a pagan godess. Some artificial drama but it gets solved pretty quickly.

A long way to a small angry planet and its sequel are both mostly slice of life, and have minimal drama. It's more about how sapients across different species can be nice to one another.
