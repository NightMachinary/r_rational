I've read a few in my young and impressionable past. You don't need to read them, (maybe just the summaries), as long as you keep this in mind.

Rand's philosophy works when all actors are not dependent upon each other for survival, meaning that they all have independent access to necessary resources, and have limited means to screw over each other.

This environment exists in some approximation with online communities and games.

It does not exist in real life for a couple factors:

1. All actors are not highly intelligent, rational, and not crazy.
2. Shared environment, limited resources, "the tragedy of the commons", etc.

There are bunches of resources out there for a takedown of Rand's philosophy.
