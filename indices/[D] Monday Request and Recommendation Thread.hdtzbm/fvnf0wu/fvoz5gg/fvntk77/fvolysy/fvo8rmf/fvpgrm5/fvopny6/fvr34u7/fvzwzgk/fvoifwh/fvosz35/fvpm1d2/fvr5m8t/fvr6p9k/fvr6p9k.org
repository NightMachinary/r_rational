It's hard to find a summary that actually summarizes the books, because they're kinda fractally wrong from a moral, philosophical and rational level.

There's problems from the high level (who's picking strawberries in Galt's Gulch?) to the microscopic level (Dagny Taggart is a poster child for internalized misogyny).

A blogger over on patheos did an excruciatingly thorough series on Atlas Shrugged, and you can see a kind of overview in [[https://www.salon.com/2014/04/29/10_insane_things_i_learned_about_the_world_reading_ayn_rands_atlas_shrugged_partner/][this Salon article]].

But mostly I'd just recommend not getting in to it, or at least reading the books if you're going into the breach.
