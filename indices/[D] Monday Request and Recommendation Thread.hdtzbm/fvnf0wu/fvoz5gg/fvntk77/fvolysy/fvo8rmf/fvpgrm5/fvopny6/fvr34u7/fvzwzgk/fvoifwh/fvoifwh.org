Ayn Rand maybe ? In general just read non fiction that high performers read and say it's good, if your goal is learning useful skills and information. Non fiction works are still mostly 'stories' but those tend to be there as filler, examples and interesting things you can talk about at dinner, rather than being the main point of the books..
