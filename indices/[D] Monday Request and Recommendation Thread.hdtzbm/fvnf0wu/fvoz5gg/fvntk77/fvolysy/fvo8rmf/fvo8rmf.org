In the post on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/h7rkyi/considering_rational_stories_in_a_realistic/][rational stories in a realistic setting]] I mentioned [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel][The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement]]) as an example of non-genre or realistic rational fiction. Some people started reading it, so I thought I'd put a qualified recommendation in here.

The book is designed to teach some very specific considerations in engineering management and logistics, specifically giving attention to the bottleneck parts of systems. That seems sort of obvious, but the book does a good job of demonstrating situations in which one is easily distracted from attention to a bottleneck. I've occasionally found the model useful in my own, mostly unrelated work (managing technical pedagogy). It was written in the 80s and some of the social mores are dated, though I personally like reading books from that era because they're in an interesting uncanny valley, really similar to us but odd in surprising ways. But a consideration if the background misogyny in that period really bothers you.

[[https://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/][The Phoenix Project]] tries to be The Goal for software development, though I haven't yet read it. I'd be curious to hear about more fiction in this explicitly pedagogical tradition, as it seems pretty rare. In the future I'll do a rec post on utopian fiction, or fiction specifically associated with how society is structured. Thomas More's /Utopia/ is the obvious here but I think the sub would be interested in, for example, /Looking Backward: 2000--1887/, which is a utopian vision of how society could be organized from the beginning of the 20th century, and there's a ton in that genre that would be of interest to some here.
