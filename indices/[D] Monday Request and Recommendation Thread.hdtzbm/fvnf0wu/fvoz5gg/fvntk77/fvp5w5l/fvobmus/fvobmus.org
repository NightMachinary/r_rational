Takes until chapter 7/8 to really get interesting, but wow, it really is hard to match. Thanks for the indirect recommendation. What a lovably assholish main character.

Everyone... gamble responsibly! fucking got me, too.

EDIT: Caught up, there weren't that many chapters. It's pretty refreshing, though not immune to a few unironic harem tropes itself, which is very disappointing. There's still fanservice and Convenient Protagonist Obliviousness fairly often.
