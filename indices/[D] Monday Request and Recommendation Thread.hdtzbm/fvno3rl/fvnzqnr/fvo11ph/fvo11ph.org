From the description it doesn't sound like what I'm looking for. I am less interested in the power wank aspect and more in the disparate people dealing with the situation of being in a foreign universe and being confronted with inexplicable magical powers.

Also by planswalker I kind of meant specifically the MTG variety, though if the story is actually good I'm also okay with other stuff.
