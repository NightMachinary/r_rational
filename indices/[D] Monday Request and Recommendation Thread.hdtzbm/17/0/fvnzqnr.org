I almost hesitate to rec this because it's rough around the edges, almost explicitly irrational and often veers into [crackfic] territory, but it's enjoyable enough that I'm still following it, so here it is: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/][Kill Them All]], A Worm/The Gamer crossover - when E88 gang members kill her father, Taylor decides to use her LITRPG powers to kill all 800 of them in retribution.

The reason it matches your request is that she can absorb a weaker version of any capes power after she defeats them, and eventually she gets the ability to planeswalk to different universes and they come to feature prominently in the story. The universes she goes to are all fictional universes and include(in approximate order) Silent Hill, Resident Evil, The Road, Hellsing, Marvel Cinematic Universe, and finally (and currently)Star Trek. I like that the despite Taylor's power level rising steadily chapter by chapter and her being able to wipe the floor with various big bads from aforementioned universes, she's still no where near close enough to beat most of the big bads in the wormverse. I dislike how it's full of plot holes(she can read minds and she still doesn't know about cauldron and artificial powers?!) and not very internally consistent(thus: proto-crackfic powerwank).

Verdict: nothing special, but a decent enough power wank that updates 3k word chapters almost every day.
