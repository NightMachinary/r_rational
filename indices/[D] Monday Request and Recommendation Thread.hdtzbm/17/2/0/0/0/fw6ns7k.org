There are some high quality quests that through prose quality, world building or originality are worth a read even for non-participants. But most long going quests, even of interesting to read, aren't really comparable to an actual story that has stuff like plotting and foreshadowing and where most chapters have a reason to exist in the larger whole.

Which is why I asked instead of complaining. For all I know it's one of those quests with a great author.
