Birds of a Feather is a .solid. fic w/ Hermione in Tom's year. Tom is slightly softened as a result, but still definitely on the eviler end of neutral, but that's kinda necessarily a consequence of rational evil doers? If you run with the whole: evil is less I want everyone to suffer, and more, I don't care if people suffer in the pursuit of my goals, sorta thing.
