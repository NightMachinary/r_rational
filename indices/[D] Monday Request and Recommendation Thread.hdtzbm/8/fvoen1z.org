A while back I asked for recommendations regarding how societies fall apart and are put back together and someone recommended [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/475.Collapse][Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]. I finished it recently and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the environmental pressure points of how society functions. He does a great job of laying out five key factors that can contribute to collapse.

1. Natural Climate Change
2. Man-made climate disaster
3. Friendly neighbors
4. Unfriendly neighbors
5. The political ability of a society to diagnose and act to solve it's problems

It was really fascinating to see those factors play out in societies I'd never heard of before. From that perspective, it also wasn't a bad whirlwind history tour. As a final bonus, it was written in the early 2000s, so there is absolutely no discussion of modern politics.

On the flip side, I wanted to ask recommendations for/against [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu][Legend of the Galactic Heroes]]. I've heard it's one of the most impressive space politics anime out there, with intelligent characters and complicated moral positions. Most people who watch it seem to rave about it. On the other hand, it's very long, arguably dry, and somewhat hard to track down without sailing the high seas. Anyone want to say it is or is not worth watching?
