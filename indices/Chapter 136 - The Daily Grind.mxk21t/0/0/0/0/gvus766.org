That's a really unique and clever mechanism to drive behavior; show up on time, for the allotted time, to maximize your efficiency. Over-stay? Fine, whatever, but no disproportionately extra time benefits for you.

It certainly solves the 'just move literally everything into the time dilation room' problem that MoL skirted around.

I don't know if that's entirely unique to your story, but I haven't seen it used anywhere else.
