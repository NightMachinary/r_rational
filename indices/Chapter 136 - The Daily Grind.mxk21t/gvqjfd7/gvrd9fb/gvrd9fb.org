Time dilation? I thought the rescue mission back forever ago confirmed that time passed in halting linear steps, e.g. Door A opens / closes on Tuesday with an 8H dungeon experience over the course of 5 minutes real time; Door B opens on Wednesday for an 8H dungeon experience over the course of 5 minutes real time; entering both windows independently adds 16H-10Min to you, but staying in from the Tuesday entry to the Wednesday entry is net zero (plus any remaining window benefit) as 24H passes in-dungeon and in-real.

Because during that rescue mission when James & Co entered through the air duct, they popped back out a week or whatever later through the door entry. If the time dilation was in effect evenly, they would have been gone maybe an hour or two or had a much longer waiting period (weeks to months) for the door to open.
