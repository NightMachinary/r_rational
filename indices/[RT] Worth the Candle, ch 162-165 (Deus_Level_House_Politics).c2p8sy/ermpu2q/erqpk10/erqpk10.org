Bear in mind, Joon doesn't consciously think if it as "rape" either. He's just uncomfortable and afraid enough that it's obvious to the reader.

People do vary in their response to things like this, but there is an element of not knowing how you'll react until you actually go through something, too. I think a lot of people (maybe especially guys?) don't really expect the "freeze" response to danger or the intensity of fear and trauma afterward, and are surprised and upset/ashamed by their own reaction to danger.
