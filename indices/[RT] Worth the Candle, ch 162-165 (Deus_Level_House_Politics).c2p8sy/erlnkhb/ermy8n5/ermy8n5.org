  I've been planning to do some data analysis on the work for a while now, in honor of a million words written for this story. Expect that whenever I get around to it, but hopefully soon. Let me know if there are metrics/tools you think would be neat, especially those that can be somewhat easily graphed.
#+end_quote

- Number of occurrences of character names over time
- Monologue score: longest uninterrupted speeches, character with highest average (though the latter is somewhat difficult to automate)
- Size of numbers used in the text over time

Thank you for writing a great story!
