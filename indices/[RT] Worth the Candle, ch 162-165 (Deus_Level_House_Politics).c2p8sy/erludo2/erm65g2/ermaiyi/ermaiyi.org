Yeah, the fact that Juniper likely wouldn't call it rape is one of the most uncomfortable things about it. Like, he feels /guilty/ and is afraid to tell Amaryllis because he thinks it's /his fault/. The fact that he's fucking with his soul/spirit with that in mind is genuinely disturbing. He knows how fucked up it was, but he can't really process /why/ it was fucked up, and so he warps the fear and disgust that he can't properly process into guilt, which is something that he /can/ process but which /isn't/ actually the proper response to the situation. He then uses those warped emotions and explanation for those emotions as motivation to /alter his soul/ without telling anyone.

There are just layers and layers of disturbing and unsettling to this. It's like an onion, if that onion /also/ had a profoundly unhealthy reaction to being a victim of sexual violence.

As an aside, I'm... not happy, because it's fucking rape, but I'll say that it's /gratifying/ to see that for once there's a work of fiction wherein the teammate with violent impulses and no conscience or respect for the boundaries or wishes of others is actually causing problems for the people on her team thanks to those qualities. All too often, the "murderous" teammate is played for laughs, with little thought given to how poorly suited someone who habitually kills people would be to working with others. Like, the teammate who's supposed to be a "violent psychopath" usually just ends up being slightly grumpy with a particularly dark sense of humor (my brain goes to Jack in /Mass Effect/, though there are probably better examples). Bethel here is actually /completely fucking nuts/ and that is, naturally, hurting her team tremendously. Even if you ignore her mutilation of Raven, her repeated death threats towards Amaryllis, and the joy she seems to take in tormenting her teammates and violating their privacy, she's causing tremendous harm to Joon here, and it's not entirely clear if she's so broken that she doesn't realize that, or if she does realize it and just doesn't care.
