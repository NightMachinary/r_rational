Solace's anger feels unwarranted here. Juniper doesn't believe you can deliberately boost loyalty, and that's the only real step she recommended so he had a good reason not to be doing it. I think her anger is more from Grak encouraging or supporting her in general or some that a catastrophe, like what just occurred, could kill Juniper or the locus off prematurely.

I also think Juniper's mental drive to understand and dissect systems, along with his huge suite of observational and processing skills, makes him basically the hardest counter to druid's we know of. Far less methodical and skilled people killed the majority of them, 1 vs Juniper doesn't stand a chance.
