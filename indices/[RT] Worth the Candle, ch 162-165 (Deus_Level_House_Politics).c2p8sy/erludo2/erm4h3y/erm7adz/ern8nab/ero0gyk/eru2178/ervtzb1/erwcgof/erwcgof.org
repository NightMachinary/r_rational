  The castle in Glassy Fields is both warded and encased in razor-sharp shards of glass, with the vidrics sure to attack us on approach. It dates to just after Uther Penndraig's disappearance, which should make it of special interest to you. It was never considered worth the probable costs to retrieve whatever might be there. There's a reason that no one loots the Glassy Fields.

  - */Through the Lashing Glass/* - Far inside the Glassy Fields exclusion zone, the only place on Aerb where glass magic still works, lies a castle coated in shards. The treasures within are unknown to the world, but you could unearth them, if you dared.
