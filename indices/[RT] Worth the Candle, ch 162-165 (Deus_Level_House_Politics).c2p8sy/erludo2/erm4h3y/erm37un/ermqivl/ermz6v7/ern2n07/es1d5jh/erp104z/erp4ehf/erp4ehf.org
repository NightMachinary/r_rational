She's an alien intelligence that was sexually abused and had a very low IQ for most of her life. She has a huge bag of tricks but not the intuition, desire, or experience to apply them to most social situations let alone sexual ones. "He's aroused so he must want this" is something a lot of non-aliens believe, why not Bethel?

Add in that physical responses to fear and arousal are closely connected, pulse and hormones for example, so if you're looking for signs of arousal you could easily misconstrue fear as a sexual response.

Bethel is messed up, but houses don't rape people.
