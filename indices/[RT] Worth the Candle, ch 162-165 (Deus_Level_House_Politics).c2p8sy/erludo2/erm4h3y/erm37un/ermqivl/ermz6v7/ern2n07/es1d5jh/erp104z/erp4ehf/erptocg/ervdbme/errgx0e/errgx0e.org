  My personal opinion though, is that Bethel would have at least been given pause if she knew of Joon's reluctance. She ate Ropey, she's loyalty 18, and she's generally compliant with Joon.

I would not be surprised if Bethel thinks something along the lines of "If he /really/ does not want to, /really/ resist, I'll stop and not mutilate him/screw him by telling others."\\
But whether or not she would be lying to herself no matter more /so/ much now for, in the end, Joon did not resistÂ¹ (comprehensively, since the fear of bethel reacting badly/violently to the overt and forceful denial from Joon, in that situation, was not one without base).

1-Just making it clear that I'm *not* blaming the victim, but rather just stating a fact.
