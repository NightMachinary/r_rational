  My personal opinion though, is that Bethel would have at least been given pause if she knew of Joon's reluctance. She ate Ropey, she's loyalty 18, and she's generally compliant with Joon.

After some time thinking about the subject, I came up with some conclusions:

Bethel doesn't sees sexual abuse (the act, not the words) the same way we do. She does not feel violated by having to provide carnal pleasure to another, but she feels it when others try to forcibly tamper with her ego (by permanently adding entads to the house).\\
She pretty much admits in that 164 that that's the first time she's going to experience a sex act /actually/ involving her/emotionally engaging¹ for her. But she also implicitly admits this when she told him (and to the others) what Uther had her do with him and then told what the /his/ threats was, and then saying that she doesn't understand why they get disgusted/horrified with the /first/ (which she doesn't care about), but not with the /latter/ (which she pretty much /does/).

Bethel misinterpreted Joon's /motives/ to be feeling what he felt.²\\
She thought he /wanted/ it, but that his morals (all the "if I do, I'll be "cheating/betraying" all those people whom I have no real obligation to be faithful to" stuff) would not allow him to /willingly/ accept it, but that he would roll with it if the choice was taken away from him(like in "I had no choice; my hands were tied; etc").³

Combine those two, and I find it very likely that Bethel thought that forcing Joon to have sex with her was more like her being forced to temporarily serve as an airship/hospital/indoctrination center, rather than more like Uther forcefully adding new entads to her.\\
More like something that to be uncomfortable doing because it goes against your moral values, as opposed to something to have an abject dread of.\\
And we even saw the effect of her being loyalty 18 in her actions at the end of 164 (not in the motions, but in the /dialogue/), she expresses a (slight) concern for Joon when he finally speaks to her, tries to assure him that she will not tell to Mary or to anyone about the sex⁴, even attempted to dissociate him from trying to pursue a relationship with her⁵, and saying that, in the rare case of her attempting to have sex again, it would not be with /him/.⁶

With that said, something that no one seems to have commented yet: Valencia knows.\\
Even if we consider that she is keeping the promise of not using devils in same room that Joon unless it is /really/ necessary, even if we consider that Valencia and Joon had almost no interaction between 164 and 165, we still have an obvious moment in 165 where:\\
A) Valencia, Joon and Bethel are in the same room, and where;\\
B) we have evidence of that Valencia was using a devil.\\
That does not mean that she knows /everything/⁷, but she must have seen enough to be concerned about Joon, and to possibly self-justify some future use of devils in Joon to find out what is wrong.

1- "Engaging" like in "participating or becoming involved in".\\
2- And was later sufficiently fooled by Joon's self-preservation mechanism to continue to believe in her initial misinterpretation, or at least enought for not try to probe further about why joon sounded so strange at the end of 164.\\
3- When it really was "my body is betraying me and I really, /really/ do not want it, but I'm going to roll with it for fear of the possible and /violent/ consequences of denying you it."\\
4- And bearing in mind the alienness of the Bethel's mentality, and how she seems (dis)cosider sexual acts, I think it is more likely that she was /genuinely/ trying to reassure Joon that she will not tell about his "betrayal" to anyone (because she thinks that's why he's acting weird, that he's afraid others will find out that he "betrayed" them), rather than hiding a rape committed by her (since she does not consider it by what it is, for her it can be just casual, if hidden, sex).\\
5- Because Joon's self-mind&spirit-fuckery was making him seem, from outside, as if he was /actually/ considering becoming her lover.\\
6- Although this latter may also have been for somewhat more selfish reasons, besides her perhaps not wanting to put him again in a position morally difficult (for him).\\
7- Because, again, Joon's self-mind&spirit-fuckery, but too because Bethel has a mentality that may be atypical for /even/ the devils.
