Pretty sure that my strategy for that is just "whatever feels right at the time", which I don't think I'll be changing, especially since it's been like that through the whole work. If I had to put a defining difference between the two, it would be that lower case is more casual and generally refers to sociocultural uses, while uppercase is more formal and refers to the governance/bureaucracy aspects, but I don't think that I've stuck too closely to that.
