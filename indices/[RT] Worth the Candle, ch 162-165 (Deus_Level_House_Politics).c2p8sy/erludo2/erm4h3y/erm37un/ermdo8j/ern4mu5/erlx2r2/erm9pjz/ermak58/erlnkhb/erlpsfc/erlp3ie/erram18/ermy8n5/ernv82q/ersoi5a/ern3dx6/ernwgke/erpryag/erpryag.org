As this is official art, which I presume prospective readers might see in the future before reading the itself story and that might thus influence their decision whether to read the story (or continue reading the story after a chapter or two), I find it important to provide a honest data point and not pussy-foot around the issue.

This is commissioned work. And for me it does not cut it as marketing; especially as it is supposed to depict whom the protagonist considers the most beautiful woman possible.
