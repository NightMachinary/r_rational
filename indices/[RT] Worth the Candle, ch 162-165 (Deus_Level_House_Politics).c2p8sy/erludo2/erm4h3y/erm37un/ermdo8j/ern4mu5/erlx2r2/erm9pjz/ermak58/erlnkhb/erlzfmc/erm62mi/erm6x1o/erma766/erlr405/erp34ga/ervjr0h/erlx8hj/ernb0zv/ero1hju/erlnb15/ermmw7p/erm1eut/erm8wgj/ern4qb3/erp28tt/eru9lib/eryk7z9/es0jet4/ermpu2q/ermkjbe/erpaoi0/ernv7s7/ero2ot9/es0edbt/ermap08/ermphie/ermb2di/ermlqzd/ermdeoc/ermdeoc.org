That's the beauty of literature man, your interpretation is just as valid as the people saying it was rape.

I agree with you, I felt that if Juniper wanted to, he had enough power to force her off him, even with the threat of violence she had over him. He still has prince's invulnerability and is pretty much invincible, so he could've stopped it, if he really wanted to.

He /does/ like her, and really doesn't mind having sex with her, if not for all the other "petty morality" he subscribes to, as Bethel puts it. People just like to project what they believe onto characters, and again, that's the beauty of literature. Neither interpretation is totally wrong. Nor right.
