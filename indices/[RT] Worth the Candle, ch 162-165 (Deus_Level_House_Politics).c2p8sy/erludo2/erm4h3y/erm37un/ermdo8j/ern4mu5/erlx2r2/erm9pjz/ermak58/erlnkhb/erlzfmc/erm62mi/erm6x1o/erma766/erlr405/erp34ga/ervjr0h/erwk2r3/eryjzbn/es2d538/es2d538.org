  I blame a lot of polarizing discourse around sexual assault for this, but things like "it being a complicated mess" and "joon partly wanting it" are extremely common features of most rapes, I would even posit the majority of them. We have real difficulty with the idea of saying that some rapes are not as bad, or more messy, and so on than others, and in fact not all rapes and rapists are created equally. You can, in fact, become a rapist without meaning to, and with no malice. The real world is complicated.

I don't think it's possible for the same word to both refer to a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil][uniquely]] horrible act and something that can be committed without any mens rea. Barring an inconceivable rehabilitation of the word, it's realistically not something that should be used if there's any degree of nuance.

  However, none of that creates any ambiguity around the fact that ignoring someones repeated no's and climbing on top of them to pin them down is 0-ambiguity rape.

For some people, that's foreplay.

I'm not being glib - there is a sizable fraction of the population that genuinely enjoys playing games with consent. Bright lines are highly desirable from a legal standpoint (and a moral one, to a slightly lesser degree), but it's not tenable to proscribe sexual relations that specifically. The obvious patch is to say that such exceptions can be limited to established relationships... but now we're back to some level of qualitative ambiguity.

And as far as the text has told us, Juniper can definitely get off on that kind of play. And Bethel has an unparalleled level of insight into crude biomechanics, which she uses in lieu of more detailed interpersonal skills. It's entirely likely that she thinks she's acting out his fantasies - /and she's right/. But sometimes, that's not enough. Loyalty 18 is pretty damn high, and I find it /really/ hard to believe she would have acted as she did if she got an accurate read on how Juniper was reacting.

(And while she's undoubtably being unacceptably reckless with another person's volition, I've also known a happily s&M couple that legit did not know to have a safeword after being together for 3 years. Responsibility around this stuff does /not/ come naturally.)

  (Also it is fine and good that you and OP posted - we are here for discourse, and people can disagree on things like this, so no ill sentiment intended here)
