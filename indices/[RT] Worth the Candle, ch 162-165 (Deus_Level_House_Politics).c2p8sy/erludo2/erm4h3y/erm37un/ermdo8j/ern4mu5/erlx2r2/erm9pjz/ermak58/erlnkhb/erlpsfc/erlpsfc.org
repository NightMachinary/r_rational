Congratulations!

For me specifically, the art is somewhat mixed feelings. It's interesting to see the character the way you imagined it, but I've felt amaryllis to be somewhat of a <fill your own fantasy> sort of character (visually at least). As opposed to a vague description, seeing what she might looks like prevents me as a reader from mapping my own "dreamgirl" image onto the character personality.
