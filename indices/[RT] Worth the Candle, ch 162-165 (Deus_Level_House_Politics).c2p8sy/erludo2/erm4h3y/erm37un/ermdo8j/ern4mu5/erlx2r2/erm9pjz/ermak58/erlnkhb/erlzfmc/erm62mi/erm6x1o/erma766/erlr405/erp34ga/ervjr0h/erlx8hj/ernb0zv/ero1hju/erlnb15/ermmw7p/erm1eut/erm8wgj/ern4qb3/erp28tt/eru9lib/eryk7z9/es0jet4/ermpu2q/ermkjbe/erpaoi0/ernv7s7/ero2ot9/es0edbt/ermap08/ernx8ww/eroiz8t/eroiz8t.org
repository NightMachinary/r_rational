An explanation of why you think the handling is terrible.

If you would like the author to learn from and avoid making such (in your opinion) mistakes again then this is information you need to convey. As you can probably see from this thread, this is non-obvious, as a lot of people did not find issue with the handling. This doesn't invalidate your opinion, it just means the grounds for it aren't likely to be clear.

Telling the author 'this is bad and you should feel bad' isn't helpful and is a dick move as any (theoretical) failure on the authors part is almost certainly unintentional and not malicious.
