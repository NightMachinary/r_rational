I sometimes have that problem with TV shows, though a little less with novels, unless there's enough art out there that it can actually get a toehold in my mind. One of the things that I thought about doing was something like the Trapper's Daughter series of woodcut prints, which (almost) never show her face, instead having her constantly either covered with hair or looking away from the camera (examples [[https://imgur.com/a/Up2L2Nw][here]] and [[https://imgur.com/a/na40g4n][here]]). But part of the purpose of the art is to give people who have trouble filling in the blanks something to paint in their mind where words aren't doing it.
