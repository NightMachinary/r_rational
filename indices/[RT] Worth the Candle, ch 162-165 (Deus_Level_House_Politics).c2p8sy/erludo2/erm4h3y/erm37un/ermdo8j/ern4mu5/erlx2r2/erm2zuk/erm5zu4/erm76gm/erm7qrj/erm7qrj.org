Not needing to sleep isn't all that mysterious, the tattoos is just expensive. I agree with the rest though.

One thing that Satyr doesn't have the information for yet, but which could become relevant, is that Joon is a human who became a master still mage within hours if not minutes of leaving the Temple. In regards to the other magics he has, they could come up with explanations like him being a master soul mage who stopped his soul from decaying and also masked his age, or something like that. But unless he's a Renacim or Rhannu, there's no existing way for him to become so good at still magic within so short a period. That's scarier than any existing power he has, because he can gain new powers in such a short period of time. If you do some spying and find out all the magic he has available to him, will that information be relevant in a week? Maybe he gets substantially better at blood magic in that time, or he picks up velocity magic, or he's suddenly a really good gold mage. Who knows?

The obvious explanation is that he's the next Uther, but I don't think Uther ever escalated in skill so quickly. Add in that he can get a lot of entads from Uther's caches instead of needing to fight various groups for them to claim them in the first place, and his knights are extremely strong already...
