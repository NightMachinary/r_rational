Afterwards he /disassociates his mind to act like he thinks Bethel wants him to act/ because he is freaking out and is terrified that she is going to severely harm or torture him.

You know, like rape victims in relationships do all the time to avoid being killed by their violent rapist spouses.

He clearly indicates he does not want to do this. Arousal is not consent. Participation because you are worried the other party will harm you if you do not participate is also not consent.

I mean, fuck. Flip the genders. A man with effectively God like local power approaches a woman and says he wants to have sex with her, she says no, he lies to her that her crush is on with it, forcefully kisses her anyways and when she tries to say no again he won't listen, so she goes blank and let's him do whatever because she is terrified he will harm her.

In your mind this is not rape? It doesn't change just because the genders flip.
