When Juniper looks at the Locus' soul it's this giant sprawling picture. In the middle is a giant orgy which is creating soldiers to go fight (probably the second empire). Others go off in the wilderness. It's not implausible to think that the locus, as a being that seems connected to the abstract concept of life, is empowered through reproduction or sexual energy.
