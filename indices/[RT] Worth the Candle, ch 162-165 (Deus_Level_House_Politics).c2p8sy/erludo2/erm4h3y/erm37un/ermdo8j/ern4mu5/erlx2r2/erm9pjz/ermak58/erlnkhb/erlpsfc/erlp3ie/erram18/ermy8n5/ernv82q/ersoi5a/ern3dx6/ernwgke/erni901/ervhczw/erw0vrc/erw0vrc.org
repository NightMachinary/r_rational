I mean, I personally dislike basically the same things you noted, but people have drastically varying preferences when it comes to art, so I don't think most people will agree that those are technical mistakes.

I do also think that modern visual art almost certainly goes way beyond what's aesthetically pleasing, but that seems to be an opinion that's discouraged, so I suppose I /was/ hypocritically contributing to that? Regardless though, you could have made your initial comment less outright insulting and tempered it up front with the "I really believe people are going to be put off the story by this art".
