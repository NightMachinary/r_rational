Sleeping would trigger the loss of the temporary levels in Still Magic obtained by sacrificing levels with Essentialism, so this is not a repeatable, once a month thing.

Juniper has a strict timeline to eliminate sleep permanently, or faces losing all the sinergy between Essentialism and Still Magic. Also consider that after each level sacrifice it becomes harder and harder to level skills again.
