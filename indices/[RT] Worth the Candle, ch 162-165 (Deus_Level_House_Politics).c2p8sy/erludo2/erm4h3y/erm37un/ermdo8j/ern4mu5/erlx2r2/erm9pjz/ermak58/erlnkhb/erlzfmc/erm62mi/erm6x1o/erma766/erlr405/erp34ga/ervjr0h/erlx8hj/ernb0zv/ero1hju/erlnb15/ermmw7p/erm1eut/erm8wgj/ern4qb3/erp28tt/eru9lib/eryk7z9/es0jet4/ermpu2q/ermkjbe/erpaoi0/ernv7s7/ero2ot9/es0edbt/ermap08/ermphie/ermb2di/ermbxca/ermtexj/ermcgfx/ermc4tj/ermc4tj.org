I don't know how you're suggesting that the mental "no" doesn't go through, because Bethel replies to it in the very next paragraph. I absolutely don't follow how you're saying the text supports Bethel not hearing that 'No'.

And even before then, he's already said no - "Are we going to do this or not?" "Not". That's a no. Followed by attempts at more emphatic ones when Bethel doesn't back off.
