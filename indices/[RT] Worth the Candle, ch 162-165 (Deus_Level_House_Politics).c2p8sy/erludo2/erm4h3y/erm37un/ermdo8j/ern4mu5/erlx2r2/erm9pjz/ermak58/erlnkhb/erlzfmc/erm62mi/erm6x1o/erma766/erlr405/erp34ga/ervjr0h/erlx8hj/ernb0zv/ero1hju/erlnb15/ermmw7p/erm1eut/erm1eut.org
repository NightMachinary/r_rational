Edit: My previous post predicted Still Magic being the exclusion, not Skin Magic. I think this was potentially predictable in advance, as Skin Magic has been around and part of Juniper's repertoire for a long time, but has mostly just been a few tattoo gimmicks like Prince's Invulnerability. Kenner's Eye had been pointed out as the easiest way to break open the Still Magic virtue, and of Skin & Still Magic, Still is the one that just became part of Juniper's toolkit.
