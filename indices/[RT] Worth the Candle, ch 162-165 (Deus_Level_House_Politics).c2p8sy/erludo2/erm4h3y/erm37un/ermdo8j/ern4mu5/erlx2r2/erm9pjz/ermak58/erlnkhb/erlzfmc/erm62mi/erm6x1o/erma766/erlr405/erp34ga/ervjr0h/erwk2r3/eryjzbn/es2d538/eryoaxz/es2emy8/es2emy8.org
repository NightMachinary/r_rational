Responding to both posts here, for cleanliness' sake.

  Also, how do laws and social mores apply across species (Bethel being on the extreme sentient-entad end)?

I think the text is pretty clear that there's no line to draw - by Aerb law, Bethel is property, end of story. If there's any wrongdoing at all, my guess would be something like tortious negligence by Amaryllis.

  All the black and white framing and strong emotions running in the thread make me wonder what verdict a jury would pass on Bethel's actions.
#+end_quote

By Earth standards, there is very little chance of Bethel being convicted of anything as things currently stand. But if Juniper and Bethel were both determined to testify, you're looking at he-said-she-said with no physical evidence. My money's still on little chance of conviction.

  Yet despite strong gut reactions to it, rape - particularly male rape - is ironically and sadly underreported.

  You can say the same of murder, yet murder law tends to have quite a bit more variation. However there is a bigger burden of proof in intent for rape and you have two sides - like in Bethel's case.

Generally agreed. It's a legally inconvenient fact that rape is a crime that can occur entirely within the head of the victim. Without defensive wounds or the like there can often be zero physical evidence establishing a lack of consent, and there are strong reasons why those might not happen on both sides of the gender divide.

  If someone says no and the alleged rapist advances anyways and the victim seems to consensually engage without expressing continued resistance, is that still rape?

As per my above comment - some couples consider that a fun Friday night. By the bare facts, not enough to establish any level of wrongdoing.

  Is it the after-the-fact feelings of violation that determine the nature of the act? If there was an element of fearful coercion but the perpetrator was unaware of that being a factor at the time of the act, are they legally or ethically responsible for that?
#+end_quote

These are really interesting to consider together - if a crime could be committed by one's partner withdrawing consent during the act despite saying nothing, isn't /everyone/ bringing a legal weapon to /every/ sexual encounter?

A separate thread, but if we're talking about personal violation then it strikes me that a large fraction of Bethel's personal trauma comes from the fact that she was forced to become a tool of coercion against her will. Not directly relevant to the dynamics of Chapter 163, but a slanted parallel.
