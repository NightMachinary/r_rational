Thinking about the latest chapters, and I had two realizations.

1) They can probably fix the Locus through an orgy.

2) Amaryllis isn't worried about the sterilization pledge because she's already had a daughter. One who can live more or less eternally under the right set of circumstances. And doesn't care particularly about property or wealth.
