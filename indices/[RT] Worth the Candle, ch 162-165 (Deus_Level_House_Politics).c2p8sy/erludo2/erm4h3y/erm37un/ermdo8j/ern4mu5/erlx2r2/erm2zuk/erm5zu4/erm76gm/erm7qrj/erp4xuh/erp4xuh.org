Another connecting theory they could have is that he's the best soul mage ever and has been running around stealing mages powers/skills.

He's walked away from fighting mages with their powers a lot. Restrained by a tattoo mage? Gained his power and killed him. He literally broke the last known soul mage master out of prison to kill him for power/soul monopoly. Goes into the still mage school? Tons of them die and he becomes a master.

The more I think of this the funnier it is, it's a great conspiracy theory for governments to have about Juniper especially since soul magic is such a boogieman to most people.
