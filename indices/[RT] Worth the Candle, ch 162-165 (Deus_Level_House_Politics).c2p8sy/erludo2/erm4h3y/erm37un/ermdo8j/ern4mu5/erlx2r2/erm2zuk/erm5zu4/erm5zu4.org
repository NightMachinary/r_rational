Mr Satyr over there is going to be shitting his pants soon (if he isn't already) when he learns more about Joon and his organization.

Joon is completely absurd by the standards of the setting by any lay observation, much less by the resources available to Mr Satyr/OIDR

First of all:

-Joon has his own /mobile base/ that he used to deploy his own /private army/ for the clean up of the town. This is going to be the most obvious to Mr Satyr as it is probably what his day job consists of.

-Joon is immune to the anti-meme bullshit of the left over rats and other pests yet to be exterminated in the area.

-Joon fights the bullshit anti-meme rats and other pests ...

/publicly/

/as an obvious, master, multiage/

/while seeming invulnerable/

/who very obviously had the opportunity to soul-fuck thousands while he had those thousands in his way-bigger-on-the-inside, strategic-level weapons platform/

-and now he is interested in "rebuilding" the local polity and /oh/, the one public suggestion he had was /inviting in the rivals/ of the local mage population.

soon, Mr Satyr questions weather Joon sleeps at all.

Joon really is a heavy hitter by now.
