Ok, shared context then! ;)

I think the core of my thesis can be summarized by the prediction that 95% is a significant overestimate even among the community that cares the most about this issue, and puts the most work into getting it right. Not out of disagreement, in so much as they would approve if the question/scenario was put to them, but in that the praxis that would have been needed for a happier ending isn't in routine use.

I think this is something a large fraction of the population gets wrong with alarming regularity. Alternative lifestyle folks /need/ stricter standards (simply because they're the ones actively experimenting with boundaries) and the mutual consent framework is definitely close to an optimal solution for real-world humans, but I'm hesitant to hold people to it universally without allowing for context. If only because it's such a potent weapon, and one that will inevitably be used on the vulnerable.

  Most laws make it pretty clear that "person A a bit less drunk than person B sleeping with them" and "dragged someone out into a back alley and tied them up" are the same exact crime.

Mostly a tangent, but I don't believe that's true - it's my understanding that the level of intoxication that inhibits consent* is the level where the victim is incapacitated to the point that they physically can't make their wishes known. I blame the misconception on a mix of wishful thinking and exactly the polarizing obfuscatory language in contention.

*Legally! Morally is obviously a stricter standard! Can't stress that enough!

  Bethel's insights are a great example of it actually - she has far higher levels of "reading someone's intent" than most humans ever could obtain, and completely botches it, due to motivated reasoning, personal biases, and with some active deception on top. It puts paid the idea that you "knew they wanted it".

I think a lot of the problem is that she's a house. Or rather, that she's likely never had a romantic experience in her life (and even the *thought* is a novel thing!), and that these are the clumsy first steps of an adolescent, despite (exacerbated by) all her age and power. I'm absolutely prepared to revise my assessment depending on how the next chapters go, but my model of Bethel is one where "you raped Juniper, and he didn't resist because you made him fear for his life" is a crippling nightmare scenario.

--------------

Speaking of shared context, what are your thoughts on Juniper vis-Ã -vis the companion harem? I broadly subscribe to the idea that the Council of Arches really /was/ designed to reflect off of his psychological quirks/issues, and that the DM doing such for a committed monogamist is a cruel move that forces a tradeoff between emotional and romantic development. Separately, I think monogamy is ultimately untenable for someone who seriously intends to achieve immortality, and that jealousy is a /disastrous/ trait in a deity. Juniper as he currently is is *not ready* for omnipotence, not in the current context at least.
