I am happy that everyone here is treating the rape seriously. As a victim of rape I was scared that it might be swept under the rug as it was for me for a decade.

When it comes to characters... To me this puts Bethel past the moral event horizon. It would take an awful lot to redeem her in my eyes.

I certainly had an extreme emotional reaction to this part. Perhaps it is not rational for me to find rape more evil than murder. That said it happened to a protagonist, making this event somewhat comparable to if Bethel had murdered a party member for fun. The excuse of 'she didn't do it to us' doesn't fly is what I'm saying.

Finally, is it right for me to judge her when her values don't line up with a regular human's? Personally I feel ignorance is no excuse, she is dangerous. Dogs don't understand they have rabies but we put them down anyway.

I wish the author the best of luck in writing about this extremely contentious topic.
