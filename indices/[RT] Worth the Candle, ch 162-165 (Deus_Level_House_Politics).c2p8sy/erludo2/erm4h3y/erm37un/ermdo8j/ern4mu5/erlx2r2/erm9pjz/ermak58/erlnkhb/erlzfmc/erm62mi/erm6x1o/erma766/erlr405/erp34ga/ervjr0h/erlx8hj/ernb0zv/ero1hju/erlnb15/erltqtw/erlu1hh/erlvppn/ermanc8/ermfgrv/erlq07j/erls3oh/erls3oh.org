Not that it matters too much, but initially the momentum transfer effect is said to come from a set of bracers, and in Notes from a crown.

I commented on last thread about how in SFN2, Sander's bow is said to pause the arrow for 10 seconds, when in story it's 30 seconds.

Raven is said to have traveled to retrieve her father in Monty Haul, but no such entad is listed in her equipment section in SFN2.
