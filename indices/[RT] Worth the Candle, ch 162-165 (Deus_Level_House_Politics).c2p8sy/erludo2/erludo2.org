A lot of the things that happened in these chapters were largely things I expected to happen: a new exclusion, another conversation with the DM, things getting politically dicey for our fledgling republic, etc.

I did /not/ expect to watch Bethel rape Juniper, nor did I expect June to soulfuck away the trauma of it. This is... oof. I'm REALLY hoping that's not something that's just gonna linger in the background for 30+ chapters before being addressed again, because EVERYTHING about that situation is just... uncomfortable, to put it mildly. It's gonna be hard for me to focus on anything else while that's just quietly lurking there.
