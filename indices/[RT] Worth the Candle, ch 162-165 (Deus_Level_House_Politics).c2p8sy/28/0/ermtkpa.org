This doesnt deserve downvotes - Bethel totally raped Joon but however a person experiences such things is valid. I have known rape victims who considered their rapes no big deal and didnt care, its rare (and obv doesnt change the nature of the crime) but they exist and shaming them for how they feel can often be traumatizing in its own right. No Perfect Victim and all that.
