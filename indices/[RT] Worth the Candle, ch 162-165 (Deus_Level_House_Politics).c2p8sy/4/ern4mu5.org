I'm calling it now, future Joon is the DM.

Also that scene with Bethel seems like a clear case of rape intellectually, but on some level culturally and emotionally it partially feels to me like Juniper had consented, even though I know it shouldn't, which really disturbs me. In the gender reversed scenario it would probably be considered unambiguously rape by all the readers. And I mean, I'm not a woman, but if an attractive man forced me to have sex with him, a part of me feels like I would at least try to enjoy it to some extent even if I really didn't want it, just to make it a little less awful.

It really really disturbs me that any part of me sees this as "not rape", simply because the victim is male and the perpetrator is female. It's as if american cultural mores have sunk their teeth into my mind on some disturbingly deep level. And when I think about the reason it has sunk into me on that deep level, its maybe because if I didn't let it that could hurt my own reputation. On some deep level, american culture does not consider male victims of female-perpetrated sexual violence to be possible. A part of me is terrified of being falsely accused of rape, or of unintentionally pressuring someone into having sex with me, and so I overcompensate for that with a combination of paranoia and only having sex with people I would trust with my life (or in other words no one yet) and publicly condemning male human beings who commit acts of sexual violence as monsters, but not female ones. To side with a monster causes others to see you as one. In american culture, female rapists have more power than male ones, becuase no one really believes that a woman would be a rapist. If a man gets raped by a woman, the rapist can just accuse him of raping her. The only surefire way to avoid this no matter what is to avoid sex with women, or to simply be lucky enough to not get raped. Because if a man does get raped by a woman, he has no defense, our culture nigh universally will see it as his fault at least in part and on some level.

Professor Quirrel's quote from hpmor seems relevant here:

"You should know this to be true, boy, for you have made freer to speak ill of Dumbledore than you ever dared speak ill of me. Even in your own thoughts, I wager, for instinct runs deep. You knew that it might be to your cost to mock the strong and vengeful Professor Quirrell, but that there was no cost in disrespecting the weak and harmless Dumbledore."

I thought I was better than this. The fact that any part of my mind is assigning any blame whatsoever to a victim of sexual violence, when it wouldn't be doing that if the victim and perpetrator had different sexes/genders, even after everything I've read about the mens rights movement, even though the example here is fictional and even though my mind is only doing that out of self preservation, makes me feel horrible and dirty.

Also I will note there are strong parallels to what Joon did to Maddie and what Arthur did to Bethel.
