  I'm calling it now, future Joon is the DM.

I'm kind of in the same state I was the first time through HPMOR, that is, in a QQ-is-Voldemort sense, where I'm not sure whether the author is trying to make it obvious that Joon will become the DM in order to set up foreshadowing, or whether the author is trying to make it that obvious in order to misdirect me into thinking that Joon will become the DM when he won't, or whether the author is playing another level higher than that, and the misdirect is itself a misdirect, and future Joon is the DM all along.

The future-Joon-is-the-DM thing is foreshadowed so heavily that I'm frankly suspicious of it.
