So... If Juniper has enough points for Still Magic 100 and Spirit 100, he should have enough points for Still Magic 100 and Any Other (Unlocked?) Skill 100, meaning he should be able to find out the virtues for the other 31 skills (40 minus Soul, Spirit, Still, Tree, Fire, Water, Revision, Velocity, and Languages) - unless he's worried about another exclusion, of course (like Still Magic 100 + Soul Magic 80, since even if the current synergy between Soul and Still Magic is fine according to the DM, I don't know if he would let him get Soul Scaphism with Still Magic 100...)

Also, could he ask Oberlin about Uther? If Uther was embroiled in the civil war between the Endlings, maybe Oberlin was already alive back then... Although I'm wondering if he subsists on books, too, and what that looks like^^
