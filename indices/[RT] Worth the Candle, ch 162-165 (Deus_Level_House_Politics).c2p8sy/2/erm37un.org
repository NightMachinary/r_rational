I never know how to respond to rape scenes. There's a part of me that understands and appreciates that they're logical in their contexts sometimes and that they're a part of human experience. Even more so in fantasy settings or historical settings. But there's a much, much larger part of me that is overwhelmed with horror, disgust, and revulsion when reading them. At least it faded to black. I do envy Juniper his ability to turn down the trauma of it, though I suppose it'll function as an extremely distasteful Chekov's Gun in the future.
