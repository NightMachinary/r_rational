It's about a depressed, bitter writer afflicted with leprosy who (perhaps) gets transported to a fantasy world a la Alice in Wonderland. He doesn't believe in its reality at first, but is charged with countering Lord Foul, a demon of corruption/ entropy that seeks to wreck havoc on The Land.

There's a certain degree of similarity between it and WtC - the series can be somewhat polarizing, but on the whole I found it well worth reading.
