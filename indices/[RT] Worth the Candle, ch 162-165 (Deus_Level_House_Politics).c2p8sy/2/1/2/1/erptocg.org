Prior to this, Joon maxed out Spirit and put his extra points into Men. And, out of fear of pissing Bethel off and being... degloved... he faked it. Everything that was not 'Comply with Bethel' was put on a lower priority thread.

So I think it's worth acknowledging that Bethel may have been entirely ignorant and incorrect about Joon's qualms with what happened, given his recent increase in skills.

My personal opinion though, is that Bethel would have at least been given pause if she knew of Joon's reluctance. She ate Ropey, she's loyalty 18, and she's generally compliant with Joon.
