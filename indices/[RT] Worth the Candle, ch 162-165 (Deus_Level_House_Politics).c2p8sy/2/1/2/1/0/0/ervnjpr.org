  Combine those two, and I find it very likely that Bethel thought that forcing Joon to have sex with her was more like her being forced to temporarily serve as an airship/hospital/indoctrination center, rather than more like Uther forcefully adding new entads to her.

God damn that's insightful. I would genuinely appreciate this being canon.

I'm curious to see if / how well Joon's spirituality perks work to obfuscate his thoughts from people like Bethel and Valencia. Until the author specifies, I would argue that it's a up in the air as to who knows what in relation to Joon's mental state.
