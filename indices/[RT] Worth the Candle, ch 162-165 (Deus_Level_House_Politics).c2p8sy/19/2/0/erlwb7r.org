I'm pretty sure basal is correct. The most common use of the word is probably in "basal metabolic rate" or BMR. Not really sure why I chose basal over base, but I did, maybe because it seems more like an adjective (though I'm pretty sure that you can use both as nouns or adjectives).

Fixed reign/rein confusion, which I guess I'm just never going to learn.
