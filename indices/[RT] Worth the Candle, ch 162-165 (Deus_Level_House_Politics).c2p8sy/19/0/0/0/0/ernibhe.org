But I love alliterations! The fact that four of the athenaeums can be abbreviated as S&S is one of those little things that really pleases me, because it's /so/ ambiguous, but also the kind of thing that normal people will do because context is sufficient (and people who attend S&S rarely interact with people who attend any of the other S&Ses).
