I don't think so. The "sleep debt" you build up isn't a property of Kenner's Eye, it's a property of your body. If the effect of Kenner's Eye is suspended by exiting the exclusion zone when you have such a debt, you fall unconscious. This couldn't be backlash from the tattoo, because it isn't magical when it's outside the zone.

If you could still this "tiredness" buildup when you have Kenner's Eye, you could probably still it when you don't, so you wouldn't even need the tattoo.
