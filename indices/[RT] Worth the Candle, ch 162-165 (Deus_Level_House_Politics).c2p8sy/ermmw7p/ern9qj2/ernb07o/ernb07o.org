Wholly depends on the Kenner's wording. If it has an explicit duration, then it, too, can be stilled.

But it doesn't matter. Even if it's not, getting once Prince per month is not an insurmountable task, so with a time chamber to pay Kenner off once a month and a new Prince once a month, it's basically unlimited, /mostly/ uninterrupted invincibility in the common timeline.
