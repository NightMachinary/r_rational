A lot do, yeah, but a lot of items aren't locked to their inheritor. All the gear Amaryllis has invested in the party (except her personal equipment) is of the sort that can be purchased/rented. So are the smaller number of items they've straight-up been able to steal, like the teleport key (not exactly minor!)

It's not totally flawless sure, but I imagine they could get gear that is, if not strictly /better/ than whatever Amaryllis' family stored in the attic of their fifth bolt-hole, probably /better tailored/ to their builds. Imagine if Joon could dig up a dagger that stops you from sleeping, say.
