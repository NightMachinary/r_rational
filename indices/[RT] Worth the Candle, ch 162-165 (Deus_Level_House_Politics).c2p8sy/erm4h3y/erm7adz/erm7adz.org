You're right; it is rare (and thus, pleasantly surprising) to read free fiction in which the characters are true to themselves and not just the narrative. On the other hand, it can be incredibly exhausting to read. There's a certain vicarious, reflected tension that comes from these arguments being retread /ad nauseum/. At this point, I really just want to be done reading about whether the locus can be fixed.
