Alright, had a few days for a reread and thoughts on Chapter 164 to simmer. The biggest point I don't see anyone mentioning here is this passage:

#+begin_quote
  I wanted to say that I couldn't, that I didn't want to, that I cared about her but that it was still a bad idea for a fair number of reasons. And then I thought that we'd already gone so far, so fast, this would already need to be explained, or could be exploited by her if she really wanted to, and if I pushed her off and told her no, then if she really wanted to, she could overpower me, or kill me in a thousand gruesome ways, or just hurt me, even if I could heal back.

  And I liked it. On so many levels, I liked it, not just the purely physical, but the sense of the forbidden, the bad idea that I knew I would regret, giving in to basal impulses, the roughness and intimacy of it, the power she held over me, the fear and adrenaline, being her first, showing her what it was like ... the more it was happening, the less I was thinking, the list of pros and cons got washed away into a confusing river of emotion and sensation, all moving toward the same destination.

If I'm in the GM's shoes and committed to manifesting inner demons as love interests, that dichotomy right there is the reason Bethel exists. It's not a coincidence that Bethel basically acted out Juniper's fantasy of Amaryllis coming on to him, and it's really important to remember that Juniper responded exactly as she might've hoped.

It's just that Juniper /also/ has the brand-new ability to reach unforeseen levels of doublethink, to simultaneously give strong indication of consent while quietly having a panic attack. I'm not quite willing to chalk the timing up as another diabolus ex machina, but I have a hard time faulting Bethel for not taking into account a completely novel magic being used to hide the damage she's inflicting.

(There's also a perspective issue that we as readers have an inside view of Juniper's negative thoughts, but fade to black while the other half of the dichotomy is driving. For obvious reasons, sure, but it does bias the account of what happened.)

Another poster has made a comment about black and white framing not being useful in a nuanced situation, and I agree. I'm deeply uncomfortable calling this rape for a variety of reasons, mostly boiling down to the fact that the label distorts more here than it explains. Bethel's interest is as academic as it is purile, she doesn't put much emotional weight on sexuality in general, she wants to do something nice for Juniper, and she's calling in a favor. Juniper has incredibly conflicted feelings over his psychological quirks being expanded into independent sentient beings, is struggling with a heavy weight of cultural baggage, and is trapped between the fate of billions and preserving his own sanity. Both bring plenty of damage to the table. This wasn't a crime, it was a disaster.

And maybe it's time to earn the fact that I'm posting this on an alt account. The line "I hadn't actually decided that this was something that I wanted to do, and I felt a knot of fear forming" might use a literary trope, but it rings so damn true as someone who's been in that kind of situation before, multiple times. But I'm almost automatically dismissing the explicit justification as bullshit - the physical threat is never as paralyzing as the stuff in your head. When someone you care about, who cares about you, puts you in a situation like that it's easy to feel trapped but you always have plenty of options; and while it's going to hurt someone no matter what you do the only time I've /regretted/ is when I ran.

I doubt self-psychosurgery is a substitute for time and communication, but it's a damn sight better than fear.

(And to swing the mood completely: how the fuck did the acting not get Juniper skill progress in Romanceâ€½ Has AW just abandoned tracking that skill?)

(I have a complex take on A Key for Seven Locks I'm sitting on for another time, but right now I'm also extremely interested in knowing whether the update said 2/7 or 1/6.)
