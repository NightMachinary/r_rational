Yet despite strong gut reactions to it, rape - particularly male rape - is ironically and sadly underreported. Victim blaming cultures, socially learned discomfort with discussing rape, patriarchal societies and masculinity demanding hush hush all contribute to the mess. You can say the same of murder, yet murder law tends to have quite a bit more variation. However there is a bigger burden of proof in intent for rape and you have two sides - like in Bethel's case.

I wouldn't say it's zero ambiguity, except in the technical sense and maybe that's what's causing the dissent. If someone says no and the alleged rapist advances anyways and the victim seems to consensually engage without expressing continued resistance, is that still rape? Is it the after-the-fact feelings of violation that determine the nature of the act? If there was an element of fearful coercion but the perpetrator was unaware of that being a factor at the time of the act, are they legally or ethically responsible for that? Lots of relevant jurisprudence in similar situations like rape in marraige or implied consent in relationships with skewed power dynamics.
