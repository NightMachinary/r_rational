I blame a lot of polarizing discourse around sexual assault for this, but things like "it being a complicated mess" and "joon partly wanting it" are extremely common features of most rapes, I would even posit the majority of them. We have real difficulty with the idea of saying that some rapes are not as bad, or more messy, and so on than others, and in fact not all rapes and rapists are created equally. You can, in fact, become a rapist without meaning to, and with no malice. The real world is complicated.

​

However, none of that creates any ambiguity around the fact that ignoring someones repeated no's and climbing on top of them to pin them down is 0-ambiguity rape. The whole point of the entire consent framework is that, because of how messy sex and power and peer pressure can be, when a relationship is starting people need to communicate fairly explicitly to avoid a rabbit-holes of negative experiences. So i think a jury could well debate the punishment, just like the punishment between one thrown punch and a baseball bat to the face will receive different sentences, but the conviction is the same.

(Also it is fine and good that you and OP posted - we are here for discourse, and people can disagree on things like this, so no ill sentiment intended here)
