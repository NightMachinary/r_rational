All the black and white framing and strong emotions running in the thread make me wonder what verdict a jury would pass on Bethel's actions. The popular consensus seems to be that it falls under the technical definition of rape since Joon expresses his lack of consent several times and fears the threat of violence. However, Joon's internal monologue also suggests it's partly consensual and Bethel never actually threatens Joon - nor does she seem to intend to rape Joon, as she's advancing based on her reading of his arousal. It's just a complicated mess of "said no but nonverbal was projecting maybe and was partly thinking yes but meant to give a clear no if given more time to think clearly but gave up because everything was too fast and [passage]." Guilty verdict with mitigating factors? Hung jury?

Also, how do laws and social mores apply across species (Bethel being on the extreme sentient-entad end)?
