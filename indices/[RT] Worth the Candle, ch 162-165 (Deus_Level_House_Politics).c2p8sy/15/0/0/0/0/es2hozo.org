  I don't think it's possible for the same word to both refer to a uniquely horrible act and something that can be committed without any mens rea. Barring an inconceivable rehabilitation of the word, it's realistically not something that should be used if there's any degree of nuance.

It clearly does, whether we want it to or not. Most laws make it pretty clear that "person A a bit less drunk than person B sleeping with them" and "dragged someone out into a back alley and tied them up" are the same exact crime. I dont even think this is abnormal, its true for most crimes - we just have ~/discourse/~ telling us otherwise, but of course that obfuscates.

And you, uh, dont need to explain to a poly switch what kind of foreplay that could be ;). Which is why I feel confident stating how capital-R rape it is - those kind of power dynamics are things you play with in /established relationships/. It doesnt matter how Joon felt, because people's feelings are a hot mess. He clearly articulated his No, multiple times, which is the bedrock of the consent framework - because we have complicated feels, we have to put power in our will to determine the start of these kinds of things. I would be confident betting that 95% of people in the bdsm scene would label this as rape for precisely that reason.

Bethel's insights are a great example of it actually - she has far higher levels of "reading someone's intent" than most humans ever could obtain, and completely botches it, due to motivated reasoning, personal biases, and with some active deception on top. It puts paid the idea that you "knew they wanted it".
