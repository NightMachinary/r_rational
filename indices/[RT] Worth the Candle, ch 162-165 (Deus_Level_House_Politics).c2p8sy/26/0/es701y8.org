Replying to myself because I was poking around Bethel foreshadowing and ran into an unrelated thing:

  “Juniper,” I said, extending a hand to her.

  She looked me up and down. “Like the flower?”

  “It's a tree,” I said.

  “A tree with flowers,” she replied as she took my hand and shook it. “Lisi,” she said. Her hand was limp and a bit cold. “Are you?” she asked.

  “Am I what?” I asked, bewildered.

  “Anglecynn royalty?” she asked. Again, she seemed annoyed that I was confused.

  “No,” I replied. “You?”

Wonder how old the tradition of giving flower names to royal kids is. Maybe Uther started it:

  Uther was his character, the Best King Ever. I have a quest to find the Lost King. And he ... he planted a juniper tree beside astatue of a smith, and that was where he went when he wanted to think about me.
