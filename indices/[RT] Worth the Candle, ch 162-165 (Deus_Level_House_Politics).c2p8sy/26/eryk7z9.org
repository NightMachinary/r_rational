So Bethel is powerful enough to threaten and rape Juniper, who himself prompted an exclusion. Maybe giving all those rare magical items to the constantly-threatening jealous unstable sociopath with a well-documented history of murdering... I'm going to go with "thousands"... was a bad idea. The group has terrible odds in a fight (and between burrowing and the Egress, she can disengage trivially), and they can't boot her because she'd probably be unhappy enough to raze Anglecynn.

I guess either they have to let the newly-threatening Draconic Federation fight her or Juniper can try to "soulfuck" her into some amount of sanity. Not only would the latter (doylist narrative thinking) be a reversal of her attack, it's been (watsonian) built up to with Ellio and Hyacinth, and Juniper visiting her soul during the Infinite Library sidequest.

(As long as I'm writing, I really liked the Reimer chapter. It was fun to see the world from his perspective.)
