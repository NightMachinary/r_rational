To explain the second passage, he literally says it in the part you quoted. He used a skill to put all his thoughts of revulsion and trauma due to the rape to the side and creates a new strand that's acting like a lover. He specifically says that he's unable to just focus on the pros because they're so heavily outweighed by the reasons he didn't want to do this.

Then there's this passage

#+begin_quote
  pretending that we were lovers, that any intimacy between us hadn't been rent to shreds.
#+end_quote

and then while his isolated thought patterns are literally in a loop agonising over the traumatic experience when Bethel betrayed him and blaming himself, the other part that's (as Joon explicitly states) /pretending/ to be loving says the part you quoted.

He specifically says that one thread of his consciousness is acting, that it's not warm or pleasant due to what happened, and that he's saying it despite how sick he feels. And he says that in the part you quoted!
