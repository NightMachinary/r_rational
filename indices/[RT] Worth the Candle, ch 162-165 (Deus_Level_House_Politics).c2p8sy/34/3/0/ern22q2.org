On a side note, as Joon mentions in the story, Bethel could kill him easily.

The issue is, people are raped every day. It can happen in many different ways, and it can involve force or it can be completely without violence. Saying that it's not rape because the victim had the physical power to get away (which again, he didn't) is just an evolution of the biblical "the woman is as guilty as the rapist if she didn't cry out for help". You're telling rape victims that, if they were aroused by the sex and didn't fight hard enough against it, then they weren't raped. This is either fucking horrible or it's born from ignorance.

All you really need to know is this.

1. Joon specifically said he didn't want to.

2.While it was happening he thought about the ways she could kill him if she was displeased.

3.After it had happened he had to hide his revulsion and thought about how he would have never said yes if she hadn't forced him.

4.He literally had to use a skill to hide his hurt and revulsion afterwards and then had to manually alter his emotions to make sure he could be calm around Bethel. Even after *that* he still reacts negatively to just seeing Bethel.

I don't mean to be too hard on you, I have no doubt that you never intended to mean anything bad. With that said, this isn't just some fictional story about hells, soul editing, or something like that. This is someone not wanting to have sex, being forced to do it while fearing for their life, and then acting exactly like a trauma victim. This happens in the real world all the time and the reasons stated in this thread as to why it's not rape are the same things those rape victims get told.

Right now, at this second, odds are that someone is being raped by someone they might consider as a partner if not for "petty morality". Right now someone is being raped and isn't fighting back for various reasons. Right now there's someone who isn't telling anyone that they were raped and just pretends that everything is fine as they continue to interact with their rapist. Don't talk about the beauty of literature when we're discussing whether or not those people should blame themselves or not.
