A lot of people here are describing Bethel and Juniper as rape and that sounds insane.

1) As far as I can tell, Juniper never actually says no. He wants to say something but never does. The quotes are what he thinks to himself but never communicates.

2) Then he's presumably an active participant as he is "showing her what [sex] was like".

3) Afterwards he asks to do it again.

Have none of you ever had sex when you knew you shouldn't? Cheat, sleep with an ex, sleep with a girl who's in a relationship, even sleep someone you know you'll regret after you nut and sober up like a coworker or a fat chick.

It sounds like the exact same thought process.

Then the after-sex guilt and anxiety sounds pretty spot on to being an active participant in sex that you regret.
