  Now, I dont think it's super unreasonable that Bethel doesn't even know she's raped him, but that just shows that when you hold power over someone you should be careful and mindful not to tread over them.

This. Exactly this. I don't know how Bethel will react when she realizes she's done to Joon what Uther did to her, but it won't be good. And since she is violent and angry, there's a good chance she'll be angry AT Joon.

Editing his spirit threads and not telling are going to damage everyone involved, even more than the actual fact of what happened damaging everyone.
