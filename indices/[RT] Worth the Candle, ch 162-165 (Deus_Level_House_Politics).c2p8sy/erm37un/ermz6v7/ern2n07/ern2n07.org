I expect Amaryllis to find the modification to his priorities when she's checking his soul/spirit later and figuring it out after. Juniper is definitely the type to try to hide it with some hasty and flimsy justifications about group cohesion when really he wants it hidden so he won't seem/feel weak or out of control. I'm just hoping it doesn't go full CW and result in drama because of a misunderstanding when it comes out. I do hope it results in conflict, but I'd prefer that it be caused by people reacting to what actually happened.
