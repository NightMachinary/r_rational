Im pretty sure the soul-fuckery gets to us too - was pretty terrifying when it was happening to the team. Its just also so far removed from anything real people experience to elicit more visceral reactions, and also not happening to characters we care about outside of self-modification, which is of course far less problematic (not saying it isnt problematic)
