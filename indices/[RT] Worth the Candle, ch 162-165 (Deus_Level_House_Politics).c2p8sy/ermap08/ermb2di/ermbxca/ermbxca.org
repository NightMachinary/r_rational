What are you talking about?

He gets "quotes" but he never says it. Reread the passage. She's kissing him and he *tries* to say it, but doesn't actually say it. He's kissing her and doesn't stop kissing her to say anything.

Then he decides to *try* to say it on the mental channel, but again he doesn't. His <mental communication> gets the mental quote marks, never seems to go out to Bethel considering he still considers himself saying no as a hypothetical.

From Bethel's point of view, once she says that Mary would be fine with it, the only thing Juniper does is say "that's convenient" then makes out with her.
