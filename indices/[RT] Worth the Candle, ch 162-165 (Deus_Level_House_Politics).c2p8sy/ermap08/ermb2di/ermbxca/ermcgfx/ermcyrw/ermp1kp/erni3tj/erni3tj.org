I don't need to flip the genders. This situation has happened to me multiple times (obviously without the magic house). That's why I asked if anyone has actually lived this situation.

Theories about consent are all well and good, but saying 'no' eventually turns into an implicit yes when you just sit there and let them stroke your cock for long enough. Things feel different from inside the situation. When sex happens because you don't have the will to get up and leave and just kinda weakly say no, it's less like being raped and more like you're making a terrible mistake. I don't consider myself a rape victim.

The only unrealistic thing is that Bethel didn't imply that Juniper is gay for turning her down the first time.
