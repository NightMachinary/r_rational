First of all, I came across that article before today, which is why I knew to look it up.

Second, I'm not saying that what happened to you didn't happen, or that you didn't regard what happened to you as consensual, either at the time or afterwards. I'm saying that, due to a common, basic human reaction to trauma, "They didn't keep saying no" or "They didn't stop me from petting them" are /horrible/ ways to determine whether sex is consensual or not. And, as your anecdote doesn't pertain to how people react when in a state of terror, I fail to see how pertinent it is to refuting my statement that "Denial of consent doesn't magically become granted consent when you don't resist hard enough."

Finally, even if your anecdotal evidence /were/ pertinent, there were multiple scientific studies about how people react to trauma, and /specifically/ how tonic immobility often occurs during sexual assault, discussed in that article. And, if you think that your anecdotal evidence should be given greater weight than actual scientific data... I think you're in the wrong subreddit, neighbour.
