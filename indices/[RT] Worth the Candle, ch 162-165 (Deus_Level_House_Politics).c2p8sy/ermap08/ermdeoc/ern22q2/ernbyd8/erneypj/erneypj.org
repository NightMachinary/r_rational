Sure, people sometimes get aroused and orgasm when they're being raped. There are countless studies, stories from rape survivors, etc. to explain why it's still rape. There's a reason why any politician or authority figure who says "people who experience pleasure during rape weren't raped" are derided and shamed by human rights activists and such.

See, it's actually very very simple. He said he didn't want to, she pushed him. He said no, she didn't stop. Right there it's already rape and nothing else that happens changes that. In certain cases it can be complicated, there was a case in Sweden where a female politician who had a military position and a position of authority in a refugee camp raped a young male refugee. He could have fought her off, he could have tried harder to say no, and he experienced sexual pleasure in the act. He never had a choice because he was terrified that his life would be destroyed if he didn't do this. That was judged to be rape and she went to prison.

I'm sorry to say this, but you're acting on a mindset regarding rape that's decades out of touch. You should do some research because, while it might not seem that way to you, you're sounding like you're about to say "If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down." regarding rape and pregnancies.
