Obviously I'd pick rape over death, but that's not on the table. I reckon it's a 0% chance of death for too many reasons, and slight possibility of injury just because Bethel lied this chapter so that puts her confessions earlier in doubt.

Actually rereading the scene, it sounds more like Juniper just thinking through the possibilities rather than assigning them high confidence like I initially thought.
