He says no three times, and they are ignored. Also, the after-sex guilt doesn't sound just like regret from a bad decision. There are explicit feelings of violation. There's also explicit mention of going forward with the sex because she's dangerous and could hurt him, and not just in an exciting way.

Maybe the situation isn't perfectly black and white (reality rarely is), especially from Bethel's perspective, but I think saying that Joon doesn't feel like he's been abused is twisting what's in the text.

Now, I dont think it's super unreasonable that Bethel doesn't even know she's raped him, but that just shows that when you hold power over someone you should be careful and mindful not to tread over them.\\
(This idea that you can hurt someone, someone you care about, in such a way and not even realize it, and think you've done something /good/ is something I find deeply unsettling and terrifying)
