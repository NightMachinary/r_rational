wow uh that third chapter

Let's speculated on that DM convo instead. That sounds easier.

It seems the DM really wants Juniper to realize that the game is, in fact, /worth the candle/. I'm not sure why he wanted to redo the conversation at the end, though.

#+begin_quote
  even if you don't think the game is, well,” he moved his hand as if to tap at the book again, then looked down. “Dammit.” He looked back up at me. “How would you feel about wiping this conversation from your mind and doing it over?”
#+end_quote

It sounds to me like his heavy-handed attempts at telling Juniper that "the game is worth the candle" are not going as he planned and he wanted to reset? But he ended up not resetting, and I don't know why that is, either.

For reference, here was Juniper's original "prayer" way back when:

#+begin_quote
  “I don't want Fenn to change because her loyalty metric increased. I want her loyalty metric, if she's going to have one, to just be a reflection of how loyal she is, not an invisible lever controlling her. I want her to be a real person, or at least as real as I am. And ... I'm hesitant to want that for everyone else in Aerb, because sometimes existence is pain, but ... if they're not going to be real, or at least as real as I am, then I want them to be real enough that I can't tell the difference. I want that for the whole of Aerb, alright? I want to poke at the seams and find out that you thought of everything. And at the end of it, I want Arthur back. That's the only way that this game is ever going to be worth the candle.“
#+end_quote

This suggests that "the game is worth the candle" means that the people in Aerb are "real" in some sense.

So I think the whole point of the conversation is that the DM is trying to get Juniper to realize that Aerb is "real". Why? I have no idea. Especially since I feel like Juniper usually acts like it is, anyway.

So in conclusion, I don't really know why the DM is saying the things he's saying. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
