I was really, really thrown for a loop by the way Juniper reacted to the rape, but it strikes me that the dissonance fits with it being written retrospectively after he edited his soul to tamp down the trauma and guilt that he felt. (Which, well, is a thing. The trauma and guilt. Humans are weird and it can be awful.)
