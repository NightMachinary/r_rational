I think it'd be cool to see a token:type ratio, which is something you could interestingly graph by chapter to analyze over time. Plus you could get some [[http://nautil.us/issue/40/learning/alzheimers-early-tell][possible early warning in case you've got any dementia brewing]]?

I second suyjuris's suggestion that it would be fun to look at a graph of frequency of character names by chapter, too, as a way of reviewing plot arcs and big moments at a glance. I'd certainly love to see it!
