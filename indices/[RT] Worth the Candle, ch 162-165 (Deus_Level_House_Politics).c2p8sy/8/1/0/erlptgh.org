Gods, I could, but it would take a hell of a lot of work to compile. I /think/ the rate has been hovering steady at about one per thousand words once it's published, and /roughly/ the same caught by earlybirds since that system has been in place. So first order approximation for the total would be something like 2,000 typos.

Of course, what you'd really want to do is chart it in two different ways: chapter the typos were caught in, and when the typos were caught, which I guess you might as well do if you were going back through all the typos threads anyway. (Typo reports generally get split up between GDocs, Discord, typo threads on chapters, the occasional PM, and AO3, which is part of what would make it a nightmare to track down.)
