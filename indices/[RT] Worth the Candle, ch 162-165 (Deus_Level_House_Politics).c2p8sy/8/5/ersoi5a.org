Also, I think the art looks pretty sick, though maybe would agree that it's a bit unfittingly combat-focused for the character. I'm curious about how much it cost, if you're willing to share.

It doesn't match my head-canon much, either --- I always pictured Amaryllis as Lightning from FFXIII (and the rest of the cast as the canonical character models for Divinity: Original Sin 2). This puts me more in mind of Aloy from Horizon: Zero Dawn.
