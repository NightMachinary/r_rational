I'd be interested in seeing some charts depicting sliding window NLP stuff, with window and increment size determined experimentally. Or maybe just bin it by chapter or something. With metrics ranging from the easy (e.g. proportion of words of dialogue spoken, average readability) to moderate (e.g. words of dialogue spoken by particular characters, using context to parse it out? Maybe even just mentions of character names within dialogue?) to sophisticated (e.g. sentiment analysis). Maybe draw some vertical lines through the chart to depict major events (e.g. Fenn's death, new major character introductions) or arcs.
