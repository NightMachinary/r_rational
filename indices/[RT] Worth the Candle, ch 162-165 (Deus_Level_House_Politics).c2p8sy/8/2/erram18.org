That picture feels more like it came from /Warhammer 40,000/ than from /Worth the Candle/. Amaryllis looks ridiculous. Where is her helmet? Why is she holding a rifle and a sword at the same time?

I don't primarily think of Amaryllis as a warrior, anyway. She can fight, sure, but her biggest contributions to the team (apart from her entad collection) have always been her analytical and social abilities, combined with her relentless willpower and workaholic tendencies. It would be more true to her character to show her at the head of a meeting or representing the party in negotiations or something like that.
