I love how the characters live in their own world and don't just go along with the plot. It's easy to notice when a work has characters holding idiot balls and forgetting what drives them but WTC's characters don't give a shit what the plot wants to focus on, they react and behave in accordance with there motivations and values.

Oh shit, skin magic was excluded!? Well I know you want to dissect that and it's awful and everything but for Valencia that means she might be able to pass as a normal person for the first time in her entire life and that's more real to her than the exclusions long term ramifications.

The worlds in danger and Joon's the only one that can stop it and is currently dealing with major tragedy and political calamity? That's good and all but Solace cares about the Locus more than any of that and isn't afraid to push for joon's time and attention.

Ditto Bethel who isn't afraid to voice her complaints at being used to provide medical care for thousands of innocent civilians after an unexpected emergency because her self-identity and autonomy are more important.

Many stories will pay lip service to their casts differing perspectives and character but they'll fall right into line when the plot wants to focus on a specific conflict. Everything's streamlined because the plot's decided what's /really/ important. It's a more subtle facade than the standard faults you find in unrealistic character writing but the fact that WTC avoids it is one of the things I love most about it.
