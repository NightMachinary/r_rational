Loved the chapters, even if the third one was its own kind of horrifying. One thing I found myself wondering is if they're just going to let the empire take Mome Rath's corpse away without at least harvesting some bones? Seems a bit of a waste, given how powerful they were. Hell, even the Rats and Bats might be good to get.
