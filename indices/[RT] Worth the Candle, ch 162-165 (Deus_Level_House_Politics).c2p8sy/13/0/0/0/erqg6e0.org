Bones have to be "whole" bones. I don't think that this is explicitly in the text, but it makes no sense for bone mages to not just carry smallest-possible splinters around instead of whole bones, if that were possible. Of the two(?) bone mages in the text, both are dealing with entire bones, rather than bones that have been shaved down to a more ergonomic size. Similarly, Juniper remarks at some point that many of the remaining unicorn bones are too big and unwieldy for practical use, which wouldn't be an issue if you could just take a sliver of them.
