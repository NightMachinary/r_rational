  The problem I have with this is that Taetus already holds a power shard. Like, Link was extremely obviously on our side, so there was no real risk of betrayal, but I'm not convinced of the same with Taetus. As soon as we active mark Taetus, however, we essentially gain control of him.

I think he's a greater risk, absolutely, but that's the reason why I want to have time to vet his motives before we mark him.

This may be hyper-paranoid, but I'm not confident that getting a character's perspective actually means we can trust them. We're not seeing their thoughts and intentions at all times. There may also be mechanics within he setting (e.g. power fragments) that could mislead or subvert the effects of our mark. Illusion and subversion style magic exists within the Cosmere setting as a whole.

  This either doesn't matter (we can mark both) or it does matter (we can only mark one this update) in which case I argue we need insight and control over the last person holding a superweapon (before Shesan rolls around and gives him any funky ideas) sooner than two updates from now.

If I was confident that the mark would actually put him under our control, I'd agree, but I'm not actually confident in that.

  The other option is to mark Koja which gives us insight into her personality and, like, a hundred and fifty extra VP. I'm simply not sold that she's that important compared to Taetus...
#+end_quote

The other advantage of marking Koja is that if, say, Link gets terribly injured, we'll have a healer with near infinite mana to potentially help him (similar to what happened with Empowered Zelda at the start of the story). This is both applicable to potential ghost fighting and future encounters where Link is at risk.

I'd also like to see if other marked are capable of going through the Lightsworn barriers, or if that requires the egg. If other marked can go through, we could potentially have sheikah going and drinking the water back at the wind temple immediately and gaining a /lot/ of VP (and power ups). Maybe explore the alternate route in there that was magic focused, too.
