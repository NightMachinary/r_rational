  i think the core difference in our views here is that you think we'll get less out of marking taetus (as in, it potentially won't work as well) and that you think the ghost business is higher risk than I do
#+end_quote

Agreed, we're just assessing the risks differently.

  i'm not certain how to resolve this... the only comment i can make is that if our interface into the game world is compromised there's exactly fuckall we can do so it's almost worth removing that from our threat m odel so we're not hamstringing ourselves on something we can't fix even if it does happen, especially when we currently don't have any evidence that we've been compromised yet...

I don't think we've been compromised yet - I think that marking someone who has abilities like, say, Hemalurgy or a power fragment is a potential vulnerability to our interface.

Above and beyond magical forms of subversion, though, there's also just the fact that we're not seeing every bit of our character viewpoints nor controlling every decision that the characters make. (See: Zelda with the scepter in the temple, for example, or how emotionally she handles conversations.)

Having a limited perspective on someone who may be malevolent toward our other perspectives does not necessarily give us complete forewarning in case of emergencies. A sufficiently motivated marked antagonist might be able to eliminate our other marked, gain admin access, etc. without us being able to interfere in time.

Is that likely? No, I don't think the QMs would probably play that way. I just don't want us discounting it as a possibility.

  also, you're wanting us to travel back to the previous place a week out? we can mark another person then if we don't do it now for the actual experiment...
#+end_quote

To be clear, I don't want the whole group to backtrack for a week to test this. We could either a) test it with one person backtracking or b) test it at the next temple.

If we test it at the next temple and discover that any marked can go through the barriers, we have the opportunity to send any marked we want back to the wind temple to get the benefits of that place. A sheikah traveling with Link allows us to test this; Taetus and Zelda do not, unless they are traveling to temples, which they are not likely to do.

We absolutely could delay this kind of thing until we reach one of the temples, though; this is more of a future advantage to having multiple people in Link's group marked.
