Edit: I think I prefer Cariyaga's plan.

I'm fine with this, but I really prefer we mark Taetus over Koja if we can only choose one - he'll be more important long term, and we need a notably different perspective IMO

i'm not super convinced about the VP gains we'll see from Koja either.. although that said, I can't really see Taetus ever generating more than baseline amounts...
