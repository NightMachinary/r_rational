  Have a meeting with Taetus without Shesan present. Confirm that there wasn't anything else he was concealing besides the whole marriage thing. Talk with him about his long-term goals. If time (and writing space permits) inform him of Link's Lightsworn status and ask his opinion on how to best evangelize spread the good news. If he doesn't reveal anything truly alarming, offer to have him marked.

Go big or go home. Bring Laylith, tell her that we are about to interrogate Taetus, and that our decision based on what he says will be final.

Then whammy him, with something like "Obey all orders and answer all questions I ask you completely." If Laylith doesn't play nice, we kick her out.

If we are feeling vicious, at the end we kick her out anyway, and ask Taetus for his most damaging secret.

If the man manages to have us not hate him after a no holds barred interrogation with his worst enemy in the room, then we mark him.

He sounds like a hell of a guy. Honestly, if we weren't Zelda, I would be rooting for him. If we weren't in a war for existence, I would vote we help him make his changes more palatable to the nobles. But we are.

Also, this should scare the daylights out of Laylith. Be sure to invoke Hylia when doing it, or she might think we got it from Shesan.

We have the divine right to rule, and I want Taetus and Laylith both to think long and hard on what that actually means.
