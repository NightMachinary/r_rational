+I approve of this plan, but I want Koja to only be marked if... A) we decide to mark Taetus, do so, and find that it won't cost more to mark or B) we decide not to mark Taetus+

+In other words, Taetus has "priority" in my eyes as the more important mark - Koja has some benefits and will get us some VP gain.+

+note for QMs: "Find that it won't cost more to mark" means that we do the whole marking process, and at the end we've found that it's basically the same cost. i did read the thing about how Fi estimates 25% it'll cost more.+

I prefer Cariyaga's plan. I approve of this one, but my first choice is Cari's.
