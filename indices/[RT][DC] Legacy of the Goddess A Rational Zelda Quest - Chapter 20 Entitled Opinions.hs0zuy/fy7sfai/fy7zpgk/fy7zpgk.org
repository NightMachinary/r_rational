Pretty much exactly the same as The Chalice from the Palace for Link, with some extra meetings and marking Taetus for Zelda.

[Plan Por que no las dos?]

Zelda Actions

- Have a meeting with Taetus without Shesan present. Confirm that there wasn't anything else he was concealing besides the whole marriage thing. Talk with him about his long-term goals. If time (and writing space permits) inform him of Link's Lightsworn status and ask his opinion on how to best +evangelize+ spread the good news. If he doesn't reveal anything truly alarming, offer to have him marked. If he doesn't accept he better have a really good reason.
- Send for Lensa to come talk to us. Make it clear that you are not angry with her in the message. When she arrives, ask her about the "witch" she was talking about. If Fi has the means to do so safely, attempt to detect if Old Magic has been used on Lensa recently, e.g. something resembling Fi's Compel. This part of the plan can be held off for a different update if it takes too much time.
- Ask Shesan to clarify what she meant by the Niesis incident 'unsealing the fae'. Do this before meeting with Vestele.
- Arrange your intended meeting with Vestele. Apologize for putting the Faith in that awkward position. If Shesan clarified what she meant about fae being unsealed, communicate that. Also ask if the Seekers have more information on how Sacrifice was used to appease the fae and what boons they granted in exchange. Fi can potentially replicate the boons without the whole human sacrifice issue and Ganondorf may be using Sacrifice to attack Hyrule. Finally, are the Seekers are aware of other ancient evils that Ganondorf could potentially unleash?

Link Actions

- See if Link has improved green imbue/blast powers as a result of his spiritual changes. These could be relevant for ghost fighting.
- Go talk to ghosts. Be diplomatic if possible, defend selves as needed. Use the disc for more precise directions.

+Meta choice: Taetus should be the 3rd viewpoint character and Koja with a passive mark, if both are successfully marked.+

Edit: +Since Fi can't mark people simultaneously, marking Koja should start immediately. Marking Taetus would have to happen after it completes.+

Based on the QM answer removing marking Koja.
