Zelda is in Castletown pondering the vagaries of life while Link & co. are at the mountain pass and prepared to lay the dead to rest, one way or another.

*What do you do next?*

- No really, we want to mark Koja
- That's silly. Taetus is our man!
- Â¿Por que no los dos?
- Accept Taetus's's's' hand in marriage
- Have Taetus thrown into the deepest dungeon you can find and throw away the key
- Kick Shesan in the face
- Make Shesan marry Taetus if she likes him so much!
- Bust some ghosts
- Negotiate with some ghosts
- Liaise with the Zora
- Talk with Vestele about that whole co-opting the faith thing
- Spread Lightsworn propaganda and raise a cult with Link as its god
- Find some Fae, because that's gone super well thus far.
- BLIN DEATH CULT
- [X] Today we do SCIENCE
- Other (write-in)

--------------

Your previous VP total was 11079.

Fi spent:

- 76 VP on telepathic communications

- 200 VP on two ethereal avatars

- 100 VP on marking Koja

- 742 VP on charging the stone disk artifact at Link's request

Marking Koja was unsuccessful. Fi believes it will require between 1950 and 6550 additional VP to successfully mark her. Her estimate that "marking additional people requries more VP" has increased from 21.3% to 24.5%.

Chapter 20 spanned 1 day. During that time, you earned 42 VP from Zelda and 40 VP from Link.

You have earned an additional 150 VP per day (out of a possible 250) from the planning and discussion incentive bonus. Total: 150.

*You currently have 10193 VP.*
