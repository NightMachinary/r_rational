All plans involve speaking to Taetus, but there's one thing I'm missing: talking about how to keep running Hyrule efficiently or how to keep him as a regent with the least amount of pushback from the nobles. In other words, talk with him freely about wether the marriage is a good idea or not.

Maybe it's better to wait until we can see into his head, though.
