[PROTO PLAN - Divine Right]

[Action - Zelda]

- Test using compel on a imprisoned spy to get them to spill the beans.
- Call the most powerful people in the kingdom (Taetus a must) into a meeting.

  - Their should be at most 6 people in the room besides Zelda.
  - No talking, no objections, no questions.

- Compel everyone besides Zelda to spill their most damaging secrets, and profess loyalty.

  - Let them know that anyone but Zelda abusing these secrets is high treason. Not only will we execute you, we will liquidate portions of your estate and hand them out as we see fit.

- Announce that Lord Councilor is a temporary position, and will be dissolved after the crises has ended, and any decrees will be subject to royal review.

  - However, the crises is not over, and if anyone wants their powers back before it is, they need to prove they can do better than Taetus.

- Remind them that we are Zelda Hyrule. We rule by the will of our Father, the Blood in our Veins, and Divine Right.

  - Open the floor to questions.

The nobles don't like Taetus having power, and they are worried that it will become permanent, because they know we are weak and might not be able to stop him. This assures them that his power won't be permanent, and that we will be able to stop him (because we know all his secrets, and have freaky powers that none of them even guessed we might have.).

And, it enhances our power over them, so if they disagree, they can take a hike.
