[Plan - The Chalice from the Palace]

Super basic and action focused plan this time. I still want to get to research, but I think other things should be handled first.

[Action - Zelda]

- Speak to Taetus privately. Attempt to discern if the marriage thing is what he was hiding. Talk to him about his long-term goals. Explain that we are the ones that suggested him as an option for the power fragment and that we /do/ want to work with him.
- Send for Lensa to come talk to us. Make it clear that you are not angry with her in the message. When she arrives, ask her about the "witch" she was talking about. If Fi has the means to do so safely, attempt to detect if Old Magic has been used on Lensa recently, e.g. something resembling Fi's Compel. This part of the plan can be held off for a different update if it takes too much time.

[Action - Link]

- Continue the marking process.
- See if Link has improved green imbue/blast powers as a result of his spiritual changes. These could be relevant for ghost fighting.
- While heading toward the ghost gerudo area, activate the disc to detect for old magic periodically, especially in the area near where you sensed magic previously. Attempt to take enough readings to triangulate the source of old magic and find it. Spend up to 1000 VP on this.
- Go talk to ghosts. Be diplomatic if possible, defend selves as needed.

Edit: Removed Gerudo language part, it was unnecessary.

Edit 2: Added for Taetus convo: "Explain that we are the ones that suggested him as an option for the power fragment and that we /do/ want to work with him."
