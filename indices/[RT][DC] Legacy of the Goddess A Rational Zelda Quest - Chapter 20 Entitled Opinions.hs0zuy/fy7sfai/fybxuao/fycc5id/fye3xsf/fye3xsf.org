The problem I have with this is that /Taetus already holds a power shard./ like, Link was extremely obviously on our side, so there was no real risk of betrayal, but I'm not convinced of the same with Taetus. As soon as we active mark Taetus, however, we essentially gain control of him.

This either doesn't matter (we can mark both) or it does matter (we can only mark one this update) in which case I argue we need insight and control over the last person holding a superweapon (before Shesan rolls around and gives him any funky ideas) sooner than two updates from now.

The other option is to mark Koja which gives us insight into her personality and, like, a hundred and fifty extra VP. I'm simply not sold that she's that important compared to Taetus...
