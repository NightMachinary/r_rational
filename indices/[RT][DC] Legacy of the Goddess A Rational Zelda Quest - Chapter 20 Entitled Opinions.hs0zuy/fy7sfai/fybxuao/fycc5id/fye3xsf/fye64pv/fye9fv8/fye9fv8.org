i think the core difference in our views here is that you think we'll get less out of marking taetus (as in, it potentially won't work as well) and that you think the ghost business is higher risk than I do

i'm not certain how to resolve this... the only comment i can make is that if our interface into the game world is compromised there's exactly fuckall we can do so it's almost worth removing that from our threat model so we're not hamstringing ourselves on something we can't fix even if it does happen, especially when we currently don't have any evidence that we've been compromised yet...

  I'd also like to see if other marked are capable of going through the Lightsworn barriers, or if that requires the egg. If other marked can go through, we could potentially have sheikah going and drinking the water back at the wind temple immediately and gaining a lot of VP (and power ups). Maybe explore the alternate route in there that was magic focused, too.

this really feels like a gamble and i don't feel like it's gonna pay off... also, you're wanting us to travel back to the previous place a week out? we can mark another person then if we don't do it now for the actual experiment...
