I don't think Zelda has the right personality to use this style of confrontation effectively. She's not a master political schemer, and even if she was, this has huge potential to backfire.

Broken down another way, we stand to gain the following through this kind of strategy:

- Secrets we can use against people.
- If someone is overtly planning against us, we may be able to get rid of them immediately.
- A demonstration of this kind of power could be intimidating.

Downsides include:

- We alienate everyone we do this to, potentially permanently.
- We motivate everyone present who has a sufficiently terrible secret to get rid of both us and everyone else present in the room.
- We expend a potentially tremendous amount of our resources on something that may have no immediate benefits.
- Our intimidation comes from the usage of a power we have barely tested. It could fail to work the way we intend, for example expiring almost immediately or being countered by sufficient willpower, targets with sufficient mana, etc.
- Making powerful people aware we have this means they can plan around it in the future.
- Using this tool now means it is no longer a surprise tool for true emergencies.
- Using this as our tool to inflict fear when we do not have the VP to use it consistently means that we are putting ourselves in a position where we may be put in a position where we are expected to use this and cannot utilize it.

The single most important factor here, in my opinion, is that Compel has not been tested adequately to attempt to deploy it against more than one person at a time. If we want to try to use Compel aggressively, we need to have a much better understanding of it's capabilities and limits first, in my opinion.

If we want to try Compelling someone to spill their secrets, we should test it on one person - perhaps one of the "traitor" sheikah. If we've managed to capture any of Ganondorf's agents, they'd be even better potential targets for testing.

We could also try testing with a trusted ally in order to get feedback on how it feels to them, an accurate idea of how long it lasts, if it can be resisted, etc.
