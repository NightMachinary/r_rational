My point of view, is that I think its worth it. Yes, it is a nigh ruinous cost, but it should button up our political and administrative problems for the foreseeable future. Some of the nobles might very well be scheming against the crown in dangerous ways. This might get us some immediately actionable intel.

But also, the cost is 100-1000. Are all humans at 1000? This plan might be cheaper than the staggering 7k worst case. Perhaps as small as 4k, which would still make it the most expensive thing we've ever done.

I guess, the game as we've seen it at the moment is split in three. There is "what the f is going on, really?", "Dungeon crawling", and "stop Hyrule from falling apart". This /wins/ a third of the game, and spending most of our VP seems like an acceptable price to pay. We will get more eventually. Judging by the number of Tri Force shards still out there, we are fairly early on, and 7k might not be that much in the grand scheme of things.

Its not a fully polished idea, I don't even name anyone specific besides Taestus. But I think everything else shown here is a half measure, or one that makes our allies think they need to go behind our back to get things accomplished, and makes them believe that they /can/ go behind our back.

/We need to go for the throat/. Demise is pulling moves like "Collapse a neighboring kingdom overnight", "Send a wholly expendable species to fight to the last man", "Kill their goddess before they even know the fight is on", and these are his opening moves. We do not have time to play nice or leave openings. In the long term, this will damage our relationships with everyone, and thats fine, because in the short term it will make everyone too terrified to start shit, /and/ it will stop whatever shit they currently have going dead in its tracks.
