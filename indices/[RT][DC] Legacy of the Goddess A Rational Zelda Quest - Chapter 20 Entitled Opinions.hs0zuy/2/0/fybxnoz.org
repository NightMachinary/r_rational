approve of this plan, but I want Koja to only be marked if... A) we decide to mark Taetus, do so, and find that it won't cost more to mark or B) we decide not to mark Taetus

In other words, Taetus has "priority" in my eyes as the more important mark - Koja has some benefits and will get us some VP gain.
