Modification of Mathematicae's modification of Salaris' plan. This one adjusts some wording (Notably, not leaving Taetus the option to refuse the mark), and adds in pursuit of Blin test subjects for more dangerous void magic.

[Plan - Sacrifices and Servants]

Zelda Actions

- Have a meeting with Taetus without Shesan present. Confirm that there wasn't anything else he was concealing besides the whole marriage thing. Talk with him about his long-term goals. If time (and writing space permits) inform him of Link's Lightsworn status and ask his opinion on how to best evangelize spread the good news. If he doesn't reveal anything truly alarming, inform him that he will be accepting the mark of the Goddess' agent, Fi.

- Send for Lensa to come talk to us. Make it clear that you are not angry with her in the message. When she arrives, ask her about the "witch" she was talking about. If Fi has the means to do so safely, attempt to detect if Old Magic has been used on Lensa recently, e.g. something resembling Fi's Compel. This part of the plan can be held off for a different update if it takes too much time.

- Ask Shesan to clarify what she meant by the Niesis incident 'unsealing the fae'. Do this before meeting with Vestele.

- Arrange your intended meeting with Vestele. Apologize for putting the Faith in that awkward position. If Shesan clarified what she meant about fae being unsealed, communicate that. Also ask if the Seekers have more information on how Sacrifice was used to appease the fae and what boons they granted in exchange. Fi can potentially replicate the boons without the whole human sacrifice issue and Ganondorf may be using Sacrifice to attack Hyrule. Finally, are the Seekers are aware of other ancient evils that Ganondorf could potentially unleash?

- Arrange for the capture and containment of Blin, who may serve as test subjects for more dangerous magical experimentation.

Link Actions

- Mark Koja iff it won't cost significantly more than Taetus, or we decide against marking Taetus.

- See if Link has improved green imbue/blast powers as a result of his spiritual changes. These could be relevant for ghost fighting.

- Continue testing the disc's void magic detection and attempting to improve it. See if you can find the source of magic you detected in the ghost area. Spend up to 1000 VP on this.

- Go talk to ghosts. Be diplomatic if possible, defend selves as needed; do not be afraid to draw back and reengage later.
