*Rules Announcement: Fi Admin Privileges*

With the elimination of "Legacy" as an entity in the quest, a gap has been opened up to explain where [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fzscpf/rtdc_legacy_of_the_goddess_a_rational_zelda_quest/fn9mztr/][Fi's SOP]] comes from, as well as how to resolve conflicts between Marked.

As of now we are codifying that Zelda is the primary authority on Fi's behavior. She defines Fi's SOP and what Fi will or will not do. If, for instance, Zelda didn't want to allow Link to be able to use Fi's MP reserves, then she would have the power to forbid it.

Admin privileges can be assigned to other Marked via ᏪᏅᏮ'ᏡᏨᏨᎲ' ᏇᎤᏫᏬ'ᏇᏅᏍ' ᎹᎺᏅᏅᎤᏈ [voting]. Death or permanent incapacity of the current admin will trigger an immediate ᎣᏫᏮ'ᏨᏅᏨᏭ ᎲᏫᏅᏅᎤᎾᏫᏯ ᎹᎺᏅᏅᎤᏡᏨᏨᏨ~ᏈᏨ [vote].

*Second Announcement (less ruley):*

We have decided to expand the points system a bit more. For a range from 20-200 points (specifics depending upon complexity of request) you can get the QMs to give an "If I were in your shoes" type answer to the question at hand.

Disclaimer: Obviously sans-QM knowledge, absolutely /not/ guaranteed to be a magic answer to your question that leaves you super satisfied.

Amount of effort scales roughly linearly from "honest answer after thinking about it for 5 minutes" to "very serious answer, at minimum meeting Vecht's standard of 'serious.'"
