Fun fact: I always write my stories while listening to music, and I often spend hours just looking for the right piece to set the mood before I even begin writing. Once I find it, I just listen to the same clip over and over for hours on end, until it almost puts me in a kind of meditative trance.

For this one, I used Killmonger's suite from Black Panther: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piBe3D4-mqc]]

It's funny. I've noticed that no matter what emotions I try to generate with my writing, the readers will almost always feel what I myself felt as I writing it. And if I didn't feel any strong emotions during the writing process, then the whole thing tends to fall flat. Hence why I spend so much time trying to put myself in the right mood.

Of course, with some characters it's just easier to write than with others. Scar is evocative to the point where I can basically just start writing and be happy with the result, while with someone like Ushari I really have to put in effort to try and get the reader to care. And even then, it still isn't the same thing.

For a long time, I wasn't at all sure who the final antagonist of this story would be. But I think I made the right choice.
