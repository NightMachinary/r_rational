I think it's very important to take the magic and strength system into account in this question. Can magic be prevented by tools? Can an ungeared prisoner break shackles? Are there shackles that cannot be broken barehanded that are cheap?

Typically in mmos, other players can't affect others stats or actions aside from debuffs and similar, i.e you might need wardens to constantly update the debuffs, whether with spells/skills or poisons and similar. If they are also to be productive, making use of the prisoners skills (like blacksmithing, mining) could be a way to earn money, if such things exist. I assume resurrection is possible in a VR game. Then the prisoners could have their gear taken, but returned eventually along with their release, if they cooperate. Can they be visually scarred or modified without a cheap way to turn them back? Threaten with disfigurement. Prisoners can commit suicide - I think in a resurrecting scenario, best one can do is take their gear but show that it can be returned. Bore them, befriend them, give them things to do.

Edit: didn't notice the "death game" in OP, probably implies death has heavy penalty and suicide is low prio. Still, game system has to be known to design a prison
