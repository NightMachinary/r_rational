Oh, I think I read your question wrong at first. You mean the prison is not only built inside the VRMMO, but also /by/ players of the same MMO and /for/ other players of it, right?

  How would a prison be best implemented

Anyway, the answer would greatly depend on the game mechanics of this VRMMO, including its magical system and player interaction capabilities. Other important prerequisite questions: why can't \ won't the wardens just kill the prisoners instead of bothering with their incarceration, and why won't the players just quit the game once they've been imprisoned?
