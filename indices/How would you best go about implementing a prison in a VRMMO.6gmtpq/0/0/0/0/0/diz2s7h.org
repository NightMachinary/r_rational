What I mean by overdone is that it used so much in literature that it sort of loses it's individual meaning, and is just sort of something everyone does. When you see a fantasy book and the main character starts off as a farm-boy discovering magic, it's not wrong, but the reader will know the trope in-depth and it's much harder to /add/ anything to the trope that hasn't been done. People go into a book with a farm-boy main character with certain expectations, not because the book tells you this, but because you've read books like this. You expect the farm-boy to go to a big city, you expect them to be gullible, you expect them to be a good-person at heart, maybe fighting some sort of ancient evil. This doesn't mean that the farm-boy can't be conniving, jaded, and solely out for his own profit, it just means that when you have a farm-boy as your main character, a lot of people will but your book in this little group of "farm-boy main character" category, and now they are expecting something from your book that you didn't state.

Similarily, bomb-collars are done quite a lot. That doesn't mean it's wrong, they can work great, it's just good to be aware that when you enter this territory of bomb-collars, people will have certain expectations of how it works. There will usually be, for example, that one person who runs away, or is some demonstration of how the collar works in the very beginning, and their head will be blown off and everyone will be "Golly, this sure is serious."

Plus, people get tired of the same idea/setting/power, and can unfairly put criticism on it because of other media like that. They'll see that element, for example magic schools, and go "Oh god, not another story about an awkward teen going through magic school, it's just a Harry Potter rip-off."

So yes, I think that bomb-collars do work, they're an interesting idea that puts constant pressure on the character, and adds a lot of limitations that the character will have a hard time working around. But it does have a history in fiction, some people would consider it over-used, and there are tropes associated with it. So it's fine to write about it, it's fine to write about it while ignoring everything I said, you can still write a great book, but acknowledging that it might have some difficulties inherent with it will make it a lot easier to write about.

And ultimately, instead of dealing with that, sometimes it's just easier to make up something new.
