Depends, I suppose, on whether there's a functioning government, or just a collection of local factions.

If the latter, and ethics aren't a problem, you could have them in a basic locked cell, plus or minus teleport jammers or mana drainers, if such things exist and are needed.

If you'd like to have slaves, you could have them do tedious tasks which, if repeated a lot, give out moderate resources. Having them do basic farming/fishing/mining minigames to get the basic resources of production are good, since it can be run by anyone regardless of level and can be overseen by a guard with the only weapons/mana availible.

A few well-behaved prisoners could be given early level blades and put in parties with a well-armored guard to farm pig-skins from level 1 boars.

If you have control over the only entrance and exit to some dungeon/instance, you send in a few lesser-liked prisoners to farm for mid-level gear, with some higher-level guards on the outside to prevent any funny business.

Those last two do leave the danger of an inmate leveling too high for safety, but if you can see stats in some way that's controllable.
