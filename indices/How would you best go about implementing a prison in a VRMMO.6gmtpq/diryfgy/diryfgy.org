Why am I in a death game? And can I talk to the outside?

One possibility is that we opted-in to a season of Ironman-mode RPG. So, 'death' is just perma-removal. In this case, I'm OK killing my fellow PCs. It's a valid tactic, and I'm not going to get punished after we all escape.

In that case, factions can just tell someone that they're confined to their room for the next 3 days. If the person tries to escape, just stab them and don't feel bad about it.

Another possibility is that we're playing Sword Art Online. Everyone's forced into the game. We want to escape. The real world government can probably watch us.

In this case, killing is morally hard *and* means that I could get tried for murder when I get out of the game. So I really, really don't want to kill anyone outside of immediate self-defense.

In this case, my thought is that I don't really need a prison (in the sense of a physical locale). I just need a way to punish people, and to keep them from hurting anyone else for a while.

One option might be to exploit the way RPGs have so much exponential leveling and dependence on gear.

Anti-Social Bob is annoying. The guild decides to sanction him. So we strip him of his gear and drop him into the middle of an absurdly high-level town. Bob is too low-level to hurt any of the PCs, and he can't meaningfully leave without getting eaten by monsters.
