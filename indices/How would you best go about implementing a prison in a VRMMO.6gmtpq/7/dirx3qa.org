Make a procedurally generated continent and exile people to it. Why not? Land may be expensive in the real world, but in a virtual one there's no inherent reason why you have to economize on real estate for prisoners, or build walls with barbed wire when you can just use sufficiently large oceans.

This may not apply to your setting -- like, your players may not be able to make changes to the map -- but in general it's worth thinking about ways that VRMMOs can be different from the real world.
