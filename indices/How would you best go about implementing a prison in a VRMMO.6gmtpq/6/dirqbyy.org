Depending on the game system, getting prisoners to comply could actually be more difficult than you might think. Most MMOs today have a "/kill" command that causes the player to commit suicide. Even if your game doesn't, players can probably kill themselves/eachother by other means. As a result, the inconvenience associated with being in prison can't be higher than the cost of dying, otherwise the inmates will choose the death.

Of course, the wardens can take other actions to impose costs on inmates who escape like this. For example, they could take some of the prisoner's items and only return them when the sentence is over, but then you have to answer the question "why don't the wardens just keep the items?" since doing so is almost always going to be more profitable than forcing the inmates to work to get them back (can you see why this is the case?).

If it's a large government doing the imprisoning, then things become a bit easier because the govt can declare escapees 'enemies of the state' and impose serious costs on them.
