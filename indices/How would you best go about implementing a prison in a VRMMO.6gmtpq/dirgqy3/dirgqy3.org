So, cheap incarceration methods?

The first thing that comes to mind is the bomb collar. Leave the perimeter, attack somebody, cast a spell, try anything funny, your head is blown off. A system that errs on the side of prison integrity might generate false positives, creating a tenous and cruel existence, at relatively little cost to the incarcerators.
