If I'm understanding you correctly, different factions would have different prisons? Sounds like you have a lot of room to explore if you want it. I like [[/u/fljared]]'s suggestion of using a world dungeon(if such things exist/could be built) best.

To expand, a small group of prisoners is camped near/inside the entrance of a small dungeon. The entrance is protected from the outside by a guard house/warden barracks/cell door depending on how much resources the faction wants to spend. The guards give the prisoners a quota, x health potions/rat skulls/what ever and some rudimentary weapons. Maybe the prisoners have to capture their own food so the guards don't have to bother feeding them.
