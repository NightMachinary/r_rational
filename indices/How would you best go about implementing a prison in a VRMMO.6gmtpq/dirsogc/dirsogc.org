Is there any reason why you can't just dig a pit somewhere and throw the criminals in? If hunger is an actual issue, you could just throw food in every now and then, simple enough. If they can use magic to fly out, line the walls with anti magic stone. If they can climb, cover the pit with a hard lid and a stupidly heavy rock, with only a small hole to throw in food.

For added security, you could make the prison in right next to a raid boss that takes way more people to kill than the number of criminals in the prison. That way if they get out, the raid boss kills them.

If you want profits, you could hold a death game within the death game. Make the prisoners play games with their lives at stake, and sell tickets to watch. Or well, regular gladiator style fights and betting works too.

Alternatively, with the world being a death game and all, there's plenty of uses for guinea pigs, sending criminals into dangerous areas first to check if they are safe. Lease out your criminals for profits if you don't care about their lives.
