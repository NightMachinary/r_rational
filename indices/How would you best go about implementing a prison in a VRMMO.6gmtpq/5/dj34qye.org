"How would a prison be best implemented, knowing that magic exists and player factions would be hesitant to spend much resources, in wealth or manpower, on the issue?"

I believe that your fundamental premise is incorrect.

Prisons in a "death is real" anything goes, PvP, sandbox game would be extremely valuable for a player faction, and I believe that people would be willing to spend lots of resources on them.

BUT, you could add on some sort of prison labor system. Maybe there is a crafting system that requires lots of repetitive, and time heavy labor. Or maybe players generate mana over time, and you can harvest that mana from the prisoners.
