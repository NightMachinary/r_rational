(First thing that comes to mind: drop players into a room through a hatch with no other (normally-usable) exits. If killing each other or digging a hole through the walls with fingernails is a concern, immobilise them (with chains or similar) before dropping them in. If no food/water causes death, then perhaps immobilised players in a row and one person dropping food/water into their mouths at a set time (or force-feeding). Assuming that use of magic can be reliably prevented when desired (lack of reagents/sealing hand signs/cutting out or otherwise doing something to the tongue). If others can't be fed, then can't prevent suicide-by-thirst, but could take prisoners one by one to a 'feeding room' where they could eat before being rebound. More guards necessary if so. Oh, depending on the scope of the magic system (and any real-brain limitations), keeping prisoners constantly asleep/unconscious through magic might be convenient, though it would probably have terrible effects on a living brain's health (if even possible--that said, the tedium would also have bad effects).)
