  So we strip him of his gear and drop him into the middle of an absurdly high-level town. Bob is too low-level to hurt any of the PCs, and he can't meaningfully leave without getting eaten by monsters.

This is the kind of thinking that makes rational fiction great. Excellent thinking outside the box; it would be really interesting to see the social effects of this kind of partitioning played out in a story, not just as a prison system. There are so many ways you could take this. Off the top of my head, black-market transportation, social hierarchies causing segregation, power monopolies and isolation, the effects on trade and how the extreme first-mover advantage affects the kinds of people in each group. Then you'd need an identity system for this to even work as a prison system, and putting that in place brings up a whole other section to explore.
