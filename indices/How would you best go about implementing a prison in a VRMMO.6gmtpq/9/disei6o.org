normally a mmo prison would be a small zone where everything is null as long as you are labeled as a prisoner. so all of your skills and stats are basically 0, without that then it's pointless.

You really can't force someone not to log out (that seems gamebreaking if it's player imposed) but you can set a duration as to how long they need to stay in the prison. Set like 1 week IRL of unable to use your character. If time magic exist, maybe create a zone where there is time dilation.

If there's no mechanism to establish a null zone, then what about implementing mechanics that impose debuffs on the "prisoner" that achieve the same thing.

is it a vrmmo? if so then it's kinda easier to implement a no log out feature in a area but like I said it's kinda gamebreaking since it would mean bypassing whatever safety features has been implemented. if it's not then vrmmo then the player can just get off their chair and do whatever and wait it out.
