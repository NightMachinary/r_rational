You mean next on April 23rd? :)

  Note that the phrase the “very gold Asian box” is changed into the “Very Asian Box” by Achilles. Why does this happen?
#+end_quote

I can't think of a reason other than it belongs to the post-ending ending and therefore contains typos (Golbach Conjecture, p.404), double spaces (your__outstanding generosity, p.404) and maybe this swap? Or is there more to it? I have to admit I didn't really notice it while reading (Good catch :) ).

***** Chapter 12

1. Can someone think of an answer to DRH's question [p. 373]?

***** Dialogue
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: dialogue
      :END:
The dialogue was very entertaining (again):

1. At the beginning the Count calls for a composer to entertain him because he is not able to sleep <=> Achilles does the same with the Tortoise
2. The count gives 100 Louis d'or to Goldberg, the Tortoise also gets 100 Louis d'or
3. "wondrous numbers" actually refer to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture][Collatz Conjecture]]
4. There are some puns involving copper silver and gold:

   - Kupfergödel, Silberescher, Goldbach
   - Copper, Silver, Gold: An Indestructible Metallic Alloy <=> Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid
   - The /cop/s (copper) named silva (silver) and gould (gold)

5. I am not sure what the deal is with the giraffe/elephants/baboons title suggestions on p. 402 other than the first letter matches gödel/escher/bach, maybe someone else can think of something?
