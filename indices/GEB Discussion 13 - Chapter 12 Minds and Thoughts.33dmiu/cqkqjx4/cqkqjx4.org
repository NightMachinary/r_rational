I like Goldbach's conjecture. It's easy to understand, but evidently very difficult to prove.

One of the many variations is Lagrange's four-square theorem, a proof that every natural number is the sum of four squares. It's pretty entertaining to play around with, to try and puzzle out each number's four square addends.

- Hint: they follow a pattern roughly reminiscent of counting in binary.

- Double Hint: it's possible to express certain numbers in more than one way. Can you find the rule for predicting these numbers?

I firmly believe GEB cannot and will not ever exist in any other form or language besides straightforward text. Maybe a pdf would work? Still. It's just so clever.
