There's no /upper/ limit. The 2nd level spell /enlarge/ increases the height and weight of the object by 10% per caster level. For a hurled object, velocity, not momentum is conserved- A rock that is doubled in size by a level 10 wizard hits twice as hard. The only limit is that the object cannot be more than 10 ft^{3} in volume.
