It's hard to quantify, because acceleration typically isn't mentioned in spell descriptions. Accelerating 5lb to three miles per hour, then decelerating it in time to stop on the limits of mage hand at is orders of magnitude less expensive than accelerating it to mach 10 and then subsequently decelerating it. And for prestidigitation, while combusting oxygen is fairly easy, there's technically nothing that tells you that you can't use something absolutely ridiculous for an oxydizer, like, I don't know, osmium.
