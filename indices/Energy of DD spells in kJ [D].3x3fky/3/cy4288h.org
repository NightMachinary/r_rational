This kind of thing with matter creation spells is why I decided that in my to be started fantasy setting magic actually has infinite energy. It's just most people who use it are not directly controlling it and those that are have to be super precise and take a long time 'spooling' out the structure their making if they want anything more complicated then raw grand unified force in an incoherent burst.
