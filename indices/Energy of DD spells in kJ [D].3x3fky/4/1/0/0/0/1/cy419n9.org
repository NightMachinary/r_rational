You could try doing it between a pair of mirrors or something. Although even 700J is far more than enough for a photon to pass through any mirror. You could use it on all the photons in that area, but at best it will just get to the point of melting the mirrors. You could also use it while moving really fast, which has the added bonus of letting you use it longer (assuming relativity is a thing, which is not a given). You could probably find another spell or magic item to get this to work, but then it's not like you're just using a cantrip to get tons of energy.
