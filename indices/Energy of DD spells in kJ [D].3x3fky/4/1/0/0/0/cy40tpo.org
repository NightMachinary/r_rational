Anybody knows how far an average atom will tunnel at 80 GJ?

Mage Hand has a range of 25 ft = 8 meters. If an object leaves that range, the effect ends, so your maximum energy is of the order of 16m x 10lbf x4.5N/lbf = 700J, comparable to modern handguns.

(However, the wizard needs to point, so probably the lightest you can go with any accuracy is about 1lb, which reaches 100 miles-per-hour in a bit under a second. Wizards shooting arrow canister round (5/per reaches 230 ft/s: shortbow territory) are scary good at ambushes, but only a dumb beast would let you line up that shot in a pitched battle...)
