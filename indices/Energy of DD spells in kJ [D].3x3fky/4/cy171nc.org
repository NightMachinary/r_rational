Here's my analysis of 5e cantrips. Hope it helps!

- /Acid splash/, or for that matter any other conjuration spell, packs a frankly insane amount of energy if you assume it involves /conjuring matter from nothing/. If that's not what's actually happening, such spells are rather hard to analyze.
- /Mage hand/ can exert 10 lb of force in this edition.
- /Prestidigitation/ - "You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour." You can probably exploit this relentlessly by selecting very dense / high specific heat materials, but to a first approximation, warming up 1 cubic foot of water from room temperature to the temperature of hot tea is about 6 megajoules.
- /Shocking grasp/ delivers enough lightning damage to kill your average commoner (the average commoner has 4 (1d8) hit points). A defibrillator in hostile hands seems like it could have roughly the same effect, and the internet tells me the average defibrillator delivers around 500 J at full charge ([[http://www.aerovox.com/Products/DefibrillatorCapacitors.aspx][citation]]).
- /Thunderclap/ creates a sound loud enough to seriously cripple or possibly kill the average commoner standing 5 feet away from the caster. I don't know enough to try to convert that to energy units.
- /Gust/ can move a 5 lb object 10 ft, with wind.
- /Frostbite/ - back of the envelope calculation says that slightly lowering the body temperature of a human is on the order of 300 kJ.
- /Mold Earth/ - moving a 5 ft cube of earth 5 feet takes roughly 85 kJ. This is slightly more energy than /shape water/ accomplishing the same effect with water.
