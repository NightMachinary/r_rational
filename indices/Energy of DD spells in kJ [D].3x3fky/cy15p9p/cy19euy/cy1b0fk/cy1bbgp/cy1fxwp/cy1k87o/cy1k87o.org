It's a magic trick accomplished with the assistance of "magic" (i.e. laws of physics we don't have), but not by using any particular formed spell. In /Mother of Learning/ terms, it's using "basic shaping" to do something interesting. D&D wizardry is all about /arcana/---knowledge others don't have about the nature of the world. Whereas /Prestidigitation/ could be learned by a Rogue who happens to have some natural magical ability, but no arcane knowledge whatsoever.

Imagine a card trick where you're moving the cards around while shuffling them with weak telekinesis, or tagging certain cards with a bit of light only you can see. The trick is still, fundamentally, a /trick/; it just relies on physics that only MUs have access to.

In this case, with the soiling thing, I imagine the "trick" is basically to create a force-field [[https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Jarate][jarate]] jar, fill it up (no magic required), and then splash it on the thing.
