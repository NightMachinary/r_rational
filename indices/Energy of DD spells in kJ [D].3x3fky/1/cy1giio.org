Matter-creation spells are, of course, totally bonkers in terms of energy, if they're actually creating matter. Common ways around this are to use nearby matter as feedstock (e.g. making a hat by stealing molecules from the walls, or condensing water out of the air to summon water), summoning it from somewhere else in the world (summon water from a random lake, or summon a randomly selected hat in the world - this explains why sometimes you lose your hat even when you put it down just a moment ago), or summoning it from an otherworldly plane (in this case, the plane of hats).
