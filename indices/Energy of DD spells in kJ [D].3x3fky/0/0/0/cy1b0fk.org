We'd need to have access to a D&D laboratory to know for sure.

While I'd accept your judgement if you were my DM, /Prestidigitation/ isn't actually in the Conjuration school (it's Universal), so we're not necessarily following those guidelines. Notably, a wizard who has chosen Conjuration as a prohibited school can still create an object via /Prestidigitation/. After all, the spell allows you to soil something and that ends up being permanent. Can you soil something while standing in clean room? If so, you have to be creating matter, and if /Prestidigitation/ can do that, then I don't see why it couldn't create a crude, fragile object (which is clearly something that magic in general can do).

The lowest level creation spell that demonstrably makes matter is /Create Water/, but that's not available to wizards and I guess you could argue that it's /really/ coming from the Elemental Plane of Water, even though the spell description doesn't say it does.
