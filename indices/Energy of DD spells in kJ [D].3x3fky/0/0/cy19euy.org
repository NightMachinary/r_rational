I'd say that since Prestidigitation's Conjuration effects can be ended by a dispel and the results are very brittle, the magic doesn't create an object but a semblance of one, which would explain why the duration of the object is limited, and why the objects can only withstand a small force: The Newtonian reaction that withstands external forces is supplied directly by the magic. Imagine Prestidigitation's telekinesis effect turned around, affecting not an object but everything that would interact with the space the "object" is simulated into. (Including some crude interaction with photons that only serves to produce an artificial look.)

To find the energy-matter-conversion factor, you'd have to look at spells like True Creation.
