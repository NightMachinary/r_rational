[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy)][Wikipedia's table on orders of magnitude is quite helpful.]] There's also [[https://rochefortwrites.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/on-the-orders-of-magnitude-of-energy-and-why-classical-wizards-are-idiots/][this article on relative energy levels]] though I don't think it gives you quite what you want.

If we're just looking at [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spellLists/sorcererWizardSpells.htm#zeroLevelSorcererWizardSpells][0-level wizards spells]] then /Light/ is a decent baseline. If we assume that it's roughly equivalent to an incandescent light bulb, then that's 60W over 10 minutes at level 1, which is 36kJ (multiply that by level if above level 1).

/Prestidigitation/'s most powerful effect is the creation of an object, which presumably is a real object and has actual mass. The energy required per gram of matter is 9×10^{13} J, or 90 billion kJ. It's not clear to me whether the object sticks around; the spell only specifies /alterations/ to an object revert back and I don't know whether creation is the same as alteration. There are other spells with similar effects though. Also, there's probably something hinky going on with pulling in matter from an alternate dimension, which is how the Decanter of Endless Water and some similar items function.

  It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.

This really depends on what we mean by "warm" in terms of heat, and what the specific heat of the nonliving material is, and whether our ability to warm that object is dependent on its properties. It's 3.3×10^{2} J (0.3 kJ) to melt one gram of ice, but we'd need specific quantities and some experiments to know more.

Generally speaking, D&D makes light and movement expensive, heat cheap, and matter creation /really/ cheap, relative to each other in spell levels.

Edit: /Mage Hand/ can propel a 5lb object 15 ft. in "any direction", with the worst (most energy-intense) being upward. The kinetic energy produced by 100 grams falling 1 meter against Earth's gravity is 1 joule, which means that the potential energy generated by lifting 100 grams 1 meter is the same. 15 feet is 4.572 meters, 5 pounds rounds to 2268 grams, so that's 126 J of potential energy generated.

Edit 2: /Ghost Sound/ can produce as much volume as four normal humans per level. It includes shouting, so we can assume four humans screaming at the top of their lungs. Wikipedia gives a person [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#cite_note-Shure-15][a maximum of 135 decibels]], which converts to [[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-soundpower.htm][158 dB(SWL)]] assuming 1 inch from the screaming person, which converts to [[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-soundvalues.htm][6.3 kJ]]. Multiply that by four, because we have four people, gives total energy of 25.2 kJ at level one.
