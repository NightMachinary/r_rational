It's one of those spells that requires a lot of interpretation on the part of the players and the DM. I've seen it used to soil a lawyer's shirt to make him appear like a slob. I've also seen it used to soil goods in order to haggle for a lower price from a vendor ("This fruit has some shit on it, can I get it for half price?").

Mostly it's a spell that exists for the same reason that people find threads like "You have the ability to summon a nickel into your hand" fun. It's not that it's there for a /reason/, it's just a minor effect that you can find your own uses for (especially when you're out of spells).
