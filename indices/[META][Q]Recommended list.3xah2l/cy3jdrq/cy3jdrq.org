I've written a few stories for the challenge threads. All short stories, can be found [[https://kishoto.wordpress.com/][here:]]

I only use that blog for posting for the contest, so it's pure content (not the best formatting though, the search bar is your friend!) I'm not a very experienced author, but you're free to take a look and decide if you like my style, although it's not very rationalist in some cases.

Particularly, I think my favorite ones up there are Clark, Requests and Cryonics with Claptrap.
