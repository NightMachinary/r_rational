Unseen mastery bias. It's hard to understand just how extremely difficult it is to be /good/ at certain things, let alone great. It's why the average person thinks that writing is easy, when even mediocre writing can be pretty difficult. Why so many people think that they can--with zero experience--seclude themselves with a typewriter and a box of cigars and "write the next great american romance".
