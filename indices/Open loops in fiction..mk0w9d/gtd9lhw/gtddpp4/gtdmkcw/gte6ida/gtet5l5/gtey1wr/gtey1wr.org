I did a study on my own about just this when I was trying to figure out how to write better dialog. The big one-sentence zigger answer is: You want the reader to know who's saying what, without ever noticing /how/ they knew. There's a recurring pattern that all the big authors use and it can be boiled down to a priority list like this:

1. Best case is that you don't need /anything/. If a character is unique from others, just the way they talk or think is enough for the reader to know who's saying what.
2. Plan B would be action tags. I always thought these were a little nebulous to understand until I realized its dirt simple: Putting *any* sort of sentence that involves a character, followed by the dialog right after, the reader will automatically attribute the speech to that character without being conscious of it. Can work backwards too on some cases. Could be as tiny as a two-word sentence like 'Remona giggled. "That treat was quite excellent."' Or even a sentence that has nothing to do with talking. 'Remona fiddled with the contraption in vain. "Blasted thing isn't working right."'
3. Plan C is to use Said, Asked, Replied, and other dirt simple words. But the goal of these is to be read like punctuation. You only use as little as possible to jumpstart the dialog and leave the reader alone after. If the reader ever notices one of these, it's failed its duty.

That's it. That's the bread and butter of dialog from what I found out. If you're using complicated words to replace said, that be a paddlin'

Only exceptions are words that convey things nothing else could. Like volume level.
