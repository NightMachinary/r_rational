Something that was pointed out to me is how much amateur fiction uses epithets. It's very common to see someone referred to as 'The brunette said' in one sentence and then 'the blue-eyed girl smiled' the next and on and on. It's especially notable in gay stories where just pronouns don't cut it, so the author shuffles back and forth between epithets for each of the characters in a scene even when they're completely irrelevant to the scene.

Meanwhile professional writers just use character names.
