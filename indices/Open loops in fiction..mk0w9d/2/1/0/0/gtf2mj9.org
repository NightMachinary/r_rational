Ever wonder why significant characters in light novels seem to often have some sort of verbal tick, and poorly translated LNs occasionally confuse who's saying what?

IIUC it's for this reason - light novel authors in the original Japanese tend to skip the "said <so and so>" part of dialogue, and make up for it by having people speak distinctively (which is apparently a lot easier in Japanese).

Also happens a lot in manga and comics, so you can tell who's saying what when it's hard to indicate (e.g, Naruto's "dattebayo").
