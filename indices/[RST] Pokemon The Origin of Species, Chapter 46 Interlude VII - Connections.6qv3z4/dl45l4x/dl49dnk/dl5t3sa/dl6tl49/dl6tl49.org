Actually the Tangela in Kanto from HG/SS can learn it, and since that's the most modern version of Kanto that exists, that's my baseline for adaptation :)

That aside though, a lot of that nonsensical stuff they added in for the later generations to justify why the pokemon introduced earlier didn't evolve are clearly game conceits that I'm okay with dropping if they don't make sense, but I'll be making the decisions on an individual basis for the most part.

Like, I don't care what the canon games say, Eevee evolutions all work off stones. There's literally a type of evolutionary stone for every Eevee type. If there are alternative ways to evolve them, great, but the stones are going to work too (especially since they won't work as just "touch them with a stone" like in the games and anime)
