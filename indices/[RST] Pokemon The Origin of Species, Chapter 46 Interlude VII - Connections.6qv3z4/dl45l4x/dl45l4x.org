So, a Tangela? I was under the impression that Pokemon like Growlithe, Houndour, Luxio, and other canine Pokemon would be better suited for guarding and self-defense, specially with the access to stuff like Howl, Intimidate, Thunder Wave, Roar, and whatnot, but I guess a grass type offers more non-lethal firepower in the Powders, and Tangela does have access to Wrap.
