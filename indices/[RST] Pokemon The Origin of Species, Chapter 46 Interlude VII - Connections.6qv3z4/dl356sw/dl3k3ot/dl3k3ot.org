That would be cool! Might be worth making a post in Friday's off-topic thread, since few people might read this comment now that the post's a few days old :)

I'm glad you enjoyed the interlude overall, but yeah I'm hoping people aren't getting too impatient with how separated most of them still are from the trio's plot. And yeah I actually cut a scene with Dom and just summarized it because it felt like it was slowing the chapter down too much, but maybe I can edit some form of it back in later.
