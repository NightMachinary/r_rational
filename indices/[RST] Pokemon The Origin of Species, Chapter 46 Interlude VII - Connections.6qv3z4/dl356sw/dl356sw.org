If there are any readers who would be interested in guest reading Laura's' interludes for the podcast version (interlude 1 and this one) send me a message! I'd enjoy getting a couple other voices involved.

This Laura chapter is a nice continuation of her general goals that were outlined back in the first interlude. It makes Silph as an antagonist much more opposong seeing one of the more competent people in her field be pushed down that hard. She made a lot of moves to protect herself both physically and legally that would be enough for most situations, but not quite enough. I'll be interested in seeing how much she pushes her moral bountdries and they depth of what Silphms goals are.

Janine's is a pretty scary character, and I'm glad she's primarily being displayed externally. I get this vibe she's a good meaning young protagonist type, similar to Worm's Taylor. By seeing her decisions externally help highlight that she finds these risks to be acceptable and necessary to face down these people.

These inturludes are generally a lot more packed of conflict than the primary plot. I've been feeling a degree of disconnect that the ongoing conflicts not been that tied back yet, so I hope it won't be too odd when Red, Blue, and Leaf are finally fully clued in, or too much time is spent in dramatic irony limbo.

For how much he was used this chapter, I feel that there was a bit too much backstory exposition for Dom. I feel that the description of his appartment and how he interacts with, as well as a more brief description of what he does/did would make it a bit smoother. The feeling I get out of him for the moment is "helpful trustworthy NPC."

Thanks again for the great chapter!
