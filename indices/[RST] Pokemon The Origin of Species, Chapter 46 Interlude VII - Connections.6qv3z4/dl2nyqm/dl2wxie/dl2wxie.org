Yeah, after the scene with Leaf talking to Aiko's dad last chapter, I think the themes really hit home for me. When I was walking home, I had a really strong sense of empathy with DaystarEld because I think the trio of Red/Blue/Leaf personalities and motivations map to different aspects of myself (and presumably him).

- Red is the part that's most inwardly focused. He values intellect, reason, and self-discipline. He's most concerned about building and maintaining an accurate model of the world.
- Blue is the part that's most presentation focused. He's ambitious and values composure. He wants to make an impact on the world around him in a way that can scale. I really like how he intentionally pursues developing his leadership skills.
- Leaf is the part that's the most outwardly focused. She has a strong moral compass and sense of personal integrity. She does her best to understand the motivations of others and help those around her.

Also, my current fan theory is that Leaf will become a ghost-type trainer.

- Red is the psychic-trainer. He has a pair of abra. As a psychic, he's best equipped to train them. Thematically, his quest for science revolves around the rational/intellectual part of the mind.
- Blue is the dark-trainer. He's dark. He has a shiftry. Thematically, he's maintains an unreadable, unflinching composure under pressure and isn't afraid to make hard choices.
- We have some hints that the psychic/ghost-type split is along the lines of conscious thought vs emotional intelligence (or, take your pick: INT vs WIS, IQ vs EQ, Sp.Atk vs Atk). This lines up well with Leaf's character.
- The current chapter lays a lot the groundwork. Leaf can use her freedom of action, relative anonymity, and developing journalism powers to help Laura out of her predicament with Silph Co.
- Canon heavily associates ghosts with Lavender Town. The same city where Laura sent one of her assistants to look into a missing scientist working on some secret Silph project...
- In canon, ghost-types can't be perceived until the protagonist acquires a newly invented Silph Co. device (the Silph Scope).
- A pretty universal (including in canon) theme of ghosts is calming a vengeful spirit to put it to rest. Leaf is well equipped to create that kind of deep, healing emotional connections with pokemon.
- Think of all the ways Leaf can munchkin ghost-type pokemon to help her journalism! (Or, at least, help her counter the psychic-types that Giovanni likes to use).
