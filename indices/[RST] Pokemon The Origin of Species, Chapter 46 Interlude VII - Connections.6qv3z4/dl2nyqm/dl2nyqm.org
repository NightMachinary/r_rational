I'm really appreciating how the science/battling/journalism focus among the three main characters isn't just a way to differentiate their goals, but three prongs of the shit that is currently going down in the Pokemon world.

Science = Mewtwo (PSYCHIC science, no less!) Battling = the legendary birds (also... you know, possible criminal activity in Celadon/Saffron/Viridian) Journalism = the Silph conspiracy, which is evidently being majorly fleshed out from the games. Can't wait to see what's actually going on. Surely it has to be bigger than development of the Master Ball?

Anyway, people have probably noticed this already, but it only really clicked for me this chapter as I saw the journalism theme really take off and become its own thing separate from Leaf so... well done!
