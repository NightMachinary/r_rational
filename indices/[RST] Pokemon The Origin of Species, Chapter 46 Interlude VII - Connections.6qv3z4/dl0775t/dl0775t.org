Hey everyone, welcome back! For those that missed it, I've added [[http://daystareld.com/pokemon/pokemon-goal-factoring/][Red's Goal Factoring sheet]] to my site, if you want to check out a (realistically sloppy) example of one of the ways goal factoring can look. If you have any questions about it, feel free to ask!

Next month I'm headed to London to teach a few classes at the European Summer Program in Rationality, which is very exciting. It's also very time consuming, as I'm leaving on August 14th and my return flight is on September 1st. As a result, be prepared for the next chapter to be published either a little earlier than usual if I manage to get it done ahead of schedule, or a little later if I manage to spend my whole birthday unconscious or in the air.

Hope you enjoy the chapter, and all feedback welcome as usual! Also quick shout out to [[/u/MarsFilms]], who has continued to make [[https://soundcloud.com/user-598992923][audio episodes]] of the story on Soundcloud!
