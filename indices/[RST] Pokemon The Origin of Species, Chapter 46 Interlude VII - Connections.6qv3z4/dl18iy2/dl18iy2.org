Its minor, and possibly authorial intent, but when Laura contemplated that someone was able to sneak into her apartment despite previous belief that this was not possible, concluded the place might be bugged, and then further decided her cellphone was safe because it was with her on the night of the breakin my immediate reaction was to say, "No, that's not necessarily right."

There's zero reason to conclude that this is the first time someone snuck into her apartment (bear in mind this wasn't a break in, they could easily have left without leaving obvious evidence behind if that had been their intent). I mean, I guess with the obvious caveat of, "Unless Laura is constantly inside her apartment at all other times," but that seems unlikely (less unlikely is that she never leaves her phone behind when she leaves, but that's not the thought she had that I'm criticizing). Sure, there's no evidence that they did sneak in before now, but given the extremely cloak and dagger nature of the informant, if you're going to be paranoid about them bugging you there's no reason not to go all the way and assign some probability that they pre-bugged the place, and therefore possibly the phone as well. After all, they may have wanted to listen in and confirm as well as possible that Laura really is what they think she is, and that's if you assume they're as benign as they seem (which to be clear, isn't really all that benign in the first place).
