Since it seems unlikely that Laura is preternaturally psychic without training, the psychic who's giving Laura advance warning (by way of emotional hints) of Silph's plans /could/ be Mewtwo, or Janine, or a transcendental intellect ascended from Red's future psyche projecting itself back in time to prevent a catastrophe. But probably not the last one.
