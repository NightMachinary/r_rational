So my options on this were basically to either retcon canon (games, manga, and shows) and make all trainers in the world 18+, or try to rationalize the world as presented, despite upgrading its dangers to a realistic level.

I ultimately decided on the latter for a couple reasons: first, because I think it adds a lot to the themes of the story to make the pokemon journey one of childhood ambition and adventure, and second because I think that the pokemon world has sufficient history to justify their children being different from our own.

I go over this a bit in the FAQ on my site, but the short version is that I think 12 year olds in the pokemon world are going to be, on average, at least a standard deviation more intelligent and mature than those in our world, and /certainly/ more than those raised in a modern, developed country. Red and his friends are gifted youngsters even by their own world's standards, which is why they got their trainer licenses so young, and they still travel in a group to help increase safety. On top of that, CoRRNet is such a universal presence to help improve safety further.

At the end of the day, the in-universe reason for why kids are allowed to train monsters is that in-universe they /need/ kids to, and /expect/ kids to. Their world went through thousands of years of dark ages where humanity survived by the skin of its teeth against these monsters, and over time learned to domesticate and train them. Their history is full of stories of heroes who, at a young age, managed to capture and raise dangerous pokemon that they then used for their villages/towns/tribes' safety.

With the advance of the world's technology, both in capturing pokemon and in training them, I don't see why they would shift to suddenly having lower expectations of their children. In a sense that's what we've done in our world, but that's because we don't have pressures on society not to. Their world is still one of an existential struggle against monsters, and they need as many soldiers ready to defend against them as they can get, as quickly as they can get them.

Does that make sense?
