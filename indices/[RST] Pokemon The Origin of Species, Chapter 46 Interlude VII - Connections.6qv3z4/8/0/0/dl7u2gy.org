For what it's worth, maybe it's just because I'm the sort of reader who's happy for an adventure to just go on forever (I still kinda think HPMoR could have been just fine as a perpetual series with the core message just being "let's learn about rationality in a fun way!"), but I like the way Red, Blue, and Leaf's Pok√©mon adventure is the primary focus with interludes mostly giving us a picture of plot things to come. I can't help but think that if all the people complaining about the pace got their way and each city or route was just summarized in a chapter I'd enjoy this a lot less!
