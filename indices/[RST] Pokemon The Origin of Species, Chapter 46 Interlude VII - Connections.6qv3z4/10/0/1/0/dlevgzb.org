Yep. If we ignore the author confirmation, the story could, technically... still pivot towards a big reveal where Mewtwo has multiple fake personas that it has either stolen or constructed, and it's on a crusade of justice after which the plot shifts to having Mewtwo play the Atlas-Shrugged role and R/B/L have to take down a self-aggrandizing, ideologically pure Mewtwo using only reason and good sense.

(^ ... or possibly a side story (omake) or writing prompt)
