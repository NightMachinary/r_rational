Wait, tangrowth is known in OoS universe? You have to level up a tangela that knows Ancient Power to evolve it. If they didn't know that Gyarados was Flying-type, do they know about Ancient Power evolution? In the games, Tangela from Kanto can't learn Ancient Power.

What brings up the question, what about the trade evolutions, the item trade evolutions, and evolutions that require specific locations, such as Magnezone, and Leafeon? Do they exist and function exactly like in game? People know that they exist? What about Nincada? Shiny pokemon? That weird slowpoke anime evolution that requires a shellder?

Ugh, Too many questions.
