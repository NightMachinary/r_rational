Summary:

"Had Marc Antony changed any aspect of how the last day had happened, he would be alive. But, as things tend to do, the day happened the way it happened, and Marc died.

He woke up in class earlier that day, and unbeknownst to him, set events in motion beyond any scale that he could imagine."
