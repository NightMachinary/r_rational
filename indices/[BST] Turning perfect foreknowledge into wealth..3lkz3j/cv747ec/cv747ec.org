"Which publicly traded stock or fund will see the greatest rise in value between now and <future>?", with <future> replaced with however far ahead you can rely on the foreknowledge to be reliable.

Eventually you may run into trouble with your trades distorting the market in which you're trading, and I'm not sure how your system would handle that, but you'd have to have gotten to the point of having /considerable/ wealth to move the market single-handed. Especially if you start restricting the question to highly liquid large-cap stocks, so that there can't be any tricky business with a penny stock being predicted to massively jump in value /because/ you're going to buy into it.

Not sure how to route around the "mild chance for disaster" without knowing what form that disaster takes, but even if it gives you catastrophically bad advice 3 times in 27 you can mitigate the risk by not betting the whole pot on every trade; 24 good picks in every 27 would be easily enough of a success ratio to do very well.
