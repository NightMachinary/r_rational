There were no limitations on the way you ask, so you can join many questions into one, so that (and the 1/9 chance) is not a restriction really.

The most restricting is the "few days ahead" limit, but with lottery it's easy to get rich anyway.

But it would bring attention, so I think much better way is to ask for the address of a bank with anonymous account with the most money on it, and all the required credentials to get that money, and who to hire to get the money for me so (s)he won't betray me and will naturaly die a few hours later anyway (with unverse-wide google you don't even need to be evil, you can just parasite on the natural catastrophes).
