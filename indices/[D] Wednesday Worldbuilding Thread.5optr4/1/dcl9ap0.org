Kung Fu Battle Wizard setting:

Humans aren't the top of the foodchain. Rather, humanity is forced to huddle in heavily fortified settlements while are surrounded on all sides by all manners of scary chakra beasts.

Kung Fu Battle Wizards in this setting are heavily movement and parkour focused, their effort is focused on outrunning and outsmarting monsters.

There are three classes of KBW in this setting:

Scouts - Free ranging explorers. They look for opportunities and dangers. This may be looking for resources, or looking for creatures which may endanger supply lines.

Runners - Couriers who runs on known fixed routes. They carry packages in pocket dimensions and are the crucial supply lines between settlements.

Heavy combat - Their job is to defend settlements, resource extraction locations, outposts, convoy, and VIPs.

I haven't decided that it'll be a post-apocalyptic setting, but ideally, the environment will be very 3D with terrains that doesn't have lot of flat geometry.
