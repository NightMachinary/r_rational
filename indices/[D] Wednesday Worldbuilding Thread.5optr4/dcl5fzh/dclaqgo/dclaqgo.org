It turns out that the less time you spend in the afterlife between reincarnations, the more you remember of your previous life. If you spend less than a minute, you remember everything.

When the afterlife is nearly empty, anyone who dies comes back practically instantly. After a few years of childhood, they can pick up their lives where they left off. This is a very useful state of affairs, particularly if you were rich or skilled or just don't want to forget who you are. Or if you want to get rid of an incurable disease of injury. So people start committing suicide to skip to their next reincarnation.

But of course, if too many people die at once then they could be stuck in the afterlife for a while and lose track of themselves. And if the afterlife goes completely empty and someone is born without an existing soul, that's a missed opportunity. So people who are dying wait for the perfect moment, watching something very like a stock market ticker, trying to kill themselves when the number of souls in limbo is as close to zero as possible.
