Some sort of Outside influence watches the people count and starts engineering wars/disease/natural disasters to cull the herd a bit?

Or if the soul pool is already exhausted, just have every new child be born dead or permanently comatose until a vacancy opens up. That wouldn't be /nice/, but it would make for an interesting premise. Would people kill others to try to make sure their child got to live? Would there be a black market of people willing to sell their life?
