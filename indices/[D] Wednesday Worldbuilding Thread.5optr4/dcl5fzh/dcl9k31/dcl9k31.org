The souls start looping back in time to incarnate into different people at the same time. By "remembering" your past lives, you can gain limited precognition by remembering the life of someone that exists in the present.

Souls evolved as a calorie saving mechanism to let people remember complex concepts without as much caloric exertion by the neurons involved.. The people that don't get souls tend to get low blood sugar from thinking too hard. Otherwise, their isn't much of a difference.
