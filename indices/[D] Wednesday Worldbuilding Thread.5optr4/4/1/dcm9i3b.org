It seems plausible enough to not break my suspension-of-disbelief in a sci-fi story.

"Worst case scenario" is a tough question. Imagine if everyone over the age of 10 died in the plague (and everyone younger was immune, but still vulnerable to starvation etc.). Populations could /probably/ rebuild themselves to stone age levels within a couple of generations, but almost all culture would be lost.
