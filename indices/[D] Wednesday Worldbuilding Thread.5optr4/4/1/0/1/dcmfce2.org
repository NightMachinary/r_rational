  Killing "everyone over ten, and everyone younger is immune" doesn't sound likely to me

Does "killing everyone who's passed through puberty" sound more reasonable? That's at least a firm biological difference. Or "massively increasing the effects of aging, so people die of old age in their early twenties, with almost no immunity"?
