If you're limiting yourself to biologically plausible explanations, then the best bet would be to have something linked to genetics make some percentage of the population immune.

This would almost necessarily run in families, and may or may not be more prevalent among different ethnic groups (or phenotypic groups of any kind) and also may or may not impact men and women differently.

"Worst case scenario" is still difficult to pin down, because technically one person surviving isn't "human extinction" and two people surviving is better than one, so it falls to a question of classification.
