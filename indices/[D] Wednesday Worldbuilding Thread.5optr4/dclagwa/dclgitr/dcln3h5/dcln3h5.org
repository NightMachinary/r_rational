So it's a series of CYOA, so I can intentionally leave a large portion up to the readers imagination, giving a very broad idea of what is happening to make up the background, and then providing the precise details necessary for each set of choices/adventures.

So the initial set of really potent artifacts was handed out seemingly at random and in very small numbers (113 so far). The superpowers created with one of the artifacts were granted out randomly via a YouTube video, before the video got taken down and something messed with every single back up of the video simultaneously. The power creating artifact will still work in person and the video creator could probably make a new one and several people have that same artifact. Another artifact allows for creation of magical gear. Additionally, all over the world people are also developing really minor random super powers as a result of exposure to magic. Finally, a year or two after the artifacts were handed out, people have started to figure out and systematize magic, although it is weaker than the stronger superpowers and definitely weaker than the artifacts.
