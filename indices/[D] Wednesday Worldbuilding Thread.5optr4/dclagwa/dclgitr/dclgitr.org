  The overall premise is that "magic" is returning to the world after being completely gone for centuries and only at trace levels for over a millennia

Are you me :P ? I've been wanting to write something similar for a while.

Some notes, for if you ever decide to write something long-form about this.

- the scope of any story would end up being /massive/. Try figuring out some way to limit it to a geographical area, at least initially, instead of diving straight into the deep end. Perhaps this ties into "How would they try to preserve their power?"

- whether this magic system is pay to play (significant investment just to get started, either monetarily or being some sort of lottert, but then it's all skill/intelligence/effort based), freemium (easy to get into, but financial/genetic advantages translate directly into power), or a true free-for-all will have significant effects on politics.
