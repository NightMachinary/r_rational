  How would various super powered/magically gifted nigh-immortal people in a prehistorical era react to their power gradually fading.
#+end_quote

Some might have chosen to wait events out (suspended animation). Others might have searched for alternate power sources... Can lifeforce/electricity/souls/etc be converted to units of magic? How bad is the exchange ratio? Maybe that's why Aztecs/Mayans/Death Cultists/etc favoured so many blood sacrifices?

  Same questions, for random, rare people from ancient civillizations, although they aren't quite as immortal and they are rare enough that they likely never meet another empowered person in their lifetime.
#+end_quote

Likely the loss of magic would have turned into legends. Non-immortal magic users or commoners from the magical era would have little choice but to suffer through the events. However, historical hindsight would twist the tales.

  How quickly could governments get laws/rules/regulations in place in response to super powers? How would the initial court ruling influence precedent.
#+end_quote

It seems that unless magic was extremely common (anyone can do it) that governments would end up being ruled by magic-users, who would create a 2-tier caste and judicial system, one for magic users (the elites) and one for everyone else. If you have magic super-powers, /you/ individually might try be the good guy, but it would only take 1 nefarious magic-user to topple a commoner-led government. Alternatively, if magic is commonplace, elite strike forces would exist (see: Aurors in HPMOR) to assail wrongdoers.

  Can anyone think of any exceptions to this where a superhero "scene" might actually get established or where lone individuals might actually manage to keep the "super-hero" role going successfully?
#+end_quote

I think super-hero's powered by magic seem unlikely... It's just a poor use of their time. They would have to have no better alternative uses of their time. Superhero's are a creation of the events and forces around them, often pressed into service or created by some design, they don't arise naturally. However, in this unlikely event, the most sustainable super-hero's would probably try to architect a religion/personality-cult around themselves. This gives them a support network, while discouraging anyone from joining them.
