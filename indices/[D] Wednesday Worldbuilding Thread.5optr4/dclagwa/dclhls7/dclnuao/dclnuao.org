  Some might have chosen to wait events out (suspended animation)

Got a mission planned around this idea already.

#+begin_quote
  Can lifeforce/electricity/souls/etc be converted to units of magic? How bad is the exchange ratio? Maybe that's why Aztecs/Mayans/Death Cultists/etc favoured so many blood sacrifices?
#+end_quote

And you have given me another idea for a mission.

#+begin_quote
  unless magic was extremely common
#+end_quote

I am leaning towards this direction, but less magic and more minor random powers unique to personality and formative life events.

#+begin_quote
  elite strike forces would exist (see: Aurors in HPMOR) to assail wrongdoers.
#+end_quote

This is one of the few roles I see "superhero" teams, the superhero part a fig leaf covering for the fact that often the teams are employed against target with kill orders.

#+begin_quote
  However, in this unlikely event, the most sustainable super-hero's would probably try to architect a religion/personality-cult around themselves
#+end_quote

I like this idea, I'll probably steal it as well.
