If we play off the idea that souls are the /spark of the divine/, then the soul-less people born might end up a second-class tier of citizens, barely above animals. Animals don't have souls, and are otherwise okay, but soul-less humans might be recognizable by their lack of reverence for religion/god, less curiosity, and a more drab external appearance.

Soulless humans would likely end up as a servant/slave caste. A story told from their perspective, rage against heaven plot, etc might be interesting.
