I made a series of CYOAs [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5o21uv/ring_of_power_cyoa_v2_the_return_of_magic_oc/][Rings of Power]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5o22fg/travelers_artifacts_cyoa_return_of_magic_setting/][Traveler's Artifacts]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5og8ga/random_hypnosis_super_powers_cyoa_return_of_magic/][Random Hypnosis Superpowers]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5ogbpb/spilt_bag_of_holding_cyoa_return_of_magic_oc/][Spilt Bag of Holding]]

The overall premise is that "magic" is returning to the world after being completely gone for centuries and only at trace levels for over a millennia. Seeking to leverage this, a mysterious entities (I have some plans about this entity although they are spoilers) gifts out various artifacts, which in turn spread super powers and abilities, setting up the introductions to the first 4 CYOAs and also setting off the conditions for several of the first missions CYOA (which I plan on posting tonight).

Some questions I am still pondering:

- How would various super powered/magically gifted nigh-immortal people in a prehistorical era react to their power gradually fading. How would they try to preserve their power? What would they try to leave behind? (Right now I assumed they sealed themselves off in alternate pocket realities were their power functions properly and that many of them are the bases of various mythological races)

- Same questions, for random, rare people from ancient civillizations, although they aren't quite as immortal and they are rare enough that they likely never meet another empowered person in their lifetime.

- In the rare cases in ancient times where enough empowered people meet up and can form small societies, how might different cultures meet and blend? (A common ability magic often allows is rapid communicate via astral travel and with creativity their are a lot of ways to travel quickly using magic, so I assume magic users from all over the world meet if they were motivated)

- How quickly could governments get laws/rules/regulations in place in response to super powers? How would the initial court ruling influence precedent.

- Right now I am assuming various people initially attempt to play at superhero only for the limits of their powers to cause various problems with this. To give an example I replied to someone with.

  To be Batman in real-life... you would be need to be able to find criminals (super-detective powers/skills) and/or find crimes in progress (clairvoyant super powers) and be able to fight criminals non-lethally (some type of martial arts ability or nonlethal take-down powers) while surviving bullets (bullet proof and/or bullet dodging powers) and whatever else criminals cooked up (flame proof/acid proof/choking proof/bomb proof powers) while also avoiding the police (stealth powers). So depending on your motivations (note the options I gave to heroes) and lucky choices, you might be able to get a decent fraction of that, but you would still need a lot of skill and/or resources to play at being Batman and it would probably be more practical to make anonymous tips to the police a good portion of the time (intervening only if they are slow to show up).

Can anyone think of any exceptions to this where a superhero "scene" might actually get established or where lone individuals might actually manage to keep the "super-hero" role going successfully?

- How quickly can law-enforcement/military adjust to super powers? Either incorporating uses for them and/or learning to counter them?
