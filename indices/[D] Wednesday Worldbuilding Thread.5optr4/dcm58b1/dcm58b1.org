Would it be plausible for an althistory 1990s to face a sharp population bottleneck due to a lethal and easily transmitted pandemic? In the worst case (barring human extinction and barring the use of nuclear weapons), how little of pre-disaster culture and history is preserved for the survivors' descendants?

The scenario I intend for my main plot is that a tribe from the first post-plague generation forms a mythology largely based on pre-plague pop culture artifacts and the recounted memories of plague survivors. I don't think this is particularly ridiculous, but would like other opinions.
