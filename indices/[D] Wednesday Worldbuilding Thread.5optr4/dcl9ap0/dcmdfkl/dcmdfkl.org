In the interest of throwing ideas at the wall, here's some ideas for worlds or environments.

A world with many rapidly flowing streams which constantly change course, creating a labyrinth of tunnels and canyons

A world of high winds and earthquakes causing mountains of varying heights and weathering to exist in many places

A world where a humans have conquered and exterminated a giant structure building species (think giant ants or bees) and claimed the tunnels and/or hives for their own

A world where there are passive, largely non-edible, flying monsters that all or most life lives on.
