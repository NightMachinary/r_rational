More than half of the stuff we discuss here is fanfiction.

You can always look at the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/top/][top by all time]] sort as a good place to see the sort of things we tend to upvote.

I personally really like the stuff by [[/u/alexanderwales]] especially [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]] (superman) and his ongoing work with the Shadows of the Limelight which he has a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowsOfTheLimelight/][subreddit]] for.

Scott Alexander's fiction, [[http://slatestarcodex.com/tag/fiction/][on his blog]], is almost all really weird but really really good, and also short/self contained.

There tends to be a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction, because one of the works that inspired the creation of the subreddit in the first place - Eliezer Yudkowsky's [[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]. HPMoR tends to be extremely polarizing (people either love it or hate it, almost never feel ambivalent) so it's worth a shot. If you liked the HPMoR idea of a genius going to Hogwarts but felt that HPMoR was too mean-spirited and Harry in it was unlikeable, I'd recommend out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy][Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy]]. The single funniest thing that's been posted to the subreddit so far is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]["Seventh Horcrux"]] by EmeraldAshes.
