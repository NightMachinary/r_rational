I'd like to note when I shared Seventh Horcrux, it was in an attempt to win some kind of argument about good vs rational I think. It's the kind of fanfiction I use as a counterexample when people say "wait, by rational fiction do you just mean good fiction?" because it's the best Harry Potter fanfiction, but also clearly irrational.
