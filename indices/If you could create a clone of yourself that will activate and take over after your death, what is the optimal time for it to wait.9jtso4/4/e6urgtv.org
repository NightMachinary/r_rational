At the very least you want a Google news alert for your obituary. The law has a system to decalre the missing "legally dead" but that also goes wrong sometimes. There's no real way to guarantee that you're dead without your body, and if you're limiting commands to your personal check-in and a timer, which is essentially how the law does it, then you are going to run the risk.

I just want to have it barge in halfway through my funeral. "I object!"
