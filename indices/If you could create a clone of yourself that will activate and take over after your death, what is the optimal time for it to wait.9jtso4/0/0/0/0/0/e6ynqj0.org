I don't understand the question. There is no meaningful difference between you and your clone, and both of you know that. Whomever decides will arrive at the same decision, what with having the same information at their disposal and the same patterns of thinking.

Unless there is a practical difference between you and the clone a-la Simulacra in MoL, in which case again, both of you know the clone is more expendable and both would be okay with it.
