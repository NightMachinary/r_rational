Definitely a valid answer, depending on how trusting of yourself you are. Although, it wouldn't be "yourself" in the sense of what they are going to do, would it? We trust ourselves at least in part because we have control of ourselves, but you don't have control over a clone. They just naturally act the way you would.

Problems arise when you would act in a way that is incompatible with having a clone, thus creating a conflict. Example: you have a wife, and you only ever want a monogamous relationship. The clone also remembers having that, and wants the same things you do.

Even if the wife would be okay with polygamy, there's still a conflict between you and your clone, since you both want her for yourself. Either one or both of you must go without. This can obviously be extrapolated into much more lethal situations as well.
