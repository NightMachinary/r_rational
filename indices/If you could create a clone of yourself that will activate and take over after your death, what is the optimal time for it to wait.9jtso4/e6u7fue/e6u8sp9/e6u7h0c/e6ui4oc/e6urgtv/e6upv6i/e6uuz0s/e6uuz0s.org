Depends on the situation. Are you a villain who is a big enough threat that the entire world will unite against you? Wait a few generations. Are you a hero who needs to be constantly saving the world? Wait a day at most, you can't afford to be gone too long even if it means forking yourself.

The best solution is probably to get someone you trust to activate the clone when /they/ think you're dead. After all, they can react to a fluid situation better than an algorithm.
