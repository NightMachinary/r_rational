Right. Personally, I'd rather deal with the clone situation than die. The clone is just there to ensure my interests will be attended to if I DO die. My friends and family won't be too badly off, the things I care about enough to act on them will still be acted upon, etc.

I suppose, however, that if I can create clones and transfer memories I can probably mind control them into thinking of me as senior in the chain of command or whatever. But, I'd rather not subject myself to a sub-me existence, so I'd only have this active in circumstances I would judge it necessary, i.e. no clone slaves, only for resolving false alarm wake ups.
