In this example, if they're clones of someone like you, then obviously the clones would get along fine.

But our lives are obviously ruled by much more than just our own perspective. Philosophically, sure, you're the same person (at least at the start), but socially? I would wager in a society where clones aren't widespread (like ours, and most superhero fiction), people would not think of you and your clone as the same person in all ways.

Would your wife and kids really be okay with having two dads? Since you selected/raised them, quite possibly, but it's no guarantee.

Perhaps a way to try understanding this way of thinking is that there is only so much "social space" in relationships. Most people just aren't going to be able to think of both of you as one person. There's only enough space in their conception of "you" for one individual, not two individuals who are the same. They will treat you and the clone differently, and thus socially you will basically be different people. Obviously not everyone will act in this way, but I would say definitely enough people to make an impact would.
