If in the future I changed the definition for my identity, the person I am now would consider that future person someone else. You could call this death insofar as after that change, there may not exist anyone alive Now-Me would consider to be Me. Whether that changed future person agrees is entirely about whatever criteria that future person used.

As to what "counts as" sufficient to share my identity, they have to believe they share my individual personhood. It's not like a true-name magic word; if they actually agree we're the same person then we are.
