Again, correct. If Crazy Dave happened to know, understand and accept my self-definition then Dave and "Crazy Dave" are just Daves separated by space and experience.

In the same way that if Dave's mind gets uploaded into a time-traveling robot and goes to the past during a time when Dave had amnesia, both amnesia-Dave and robot-Dave are still ultimately Dave.

If my name wasn't Dave, I'm not sure I'd believe he was me if he insisted on calling himself "Crazy Dave" though.
