My explanation was more in general for why having a clone isn't always good, but to answer your question:

It could be that he /didn't/ have the clone be made voluntarily. Perhaps made as a scheme by an enemy, and it's all he can do to delay the clone from being released. Also, if the clone's location is also hidden, he can't destroy it.

If you've read Worm, it could be a clone that has been altered to hate his progenitor and everything they stand for. Said clone also has the original's memories, which means he can easily come up with ways to ruin their lives.
