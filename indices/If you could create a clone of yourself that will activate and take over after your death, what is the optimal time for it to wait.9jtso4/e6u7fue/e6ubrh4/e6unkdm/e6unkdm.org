So change your views on polygamy until you are fine with sharing with a copy of yourself and don't miss on a times two (can you make more clones? Potentially times many more) efficiency multiplier on everything you do. Defecting on a literal copy of yourself for any reason seems like a really dumb idea to me. At worst, you can always flip a coin and let random chance decide which one of you copies is going to do a thing.
