Because myself or a clone are both going to act differently than usual when both exist, but when only one does there is no problem.

I trust it to make the same decisions I would make and not be evil (if it's actually a proper clone), but I know that I would see a clone as a potential threat, and thus I might decide it needs to be dealt with. From the clone's perspective, I'm the clone, and it works the same way.
