  What kind of insanity would your clone have to be under to decide "no, you know what, I am not going to do this thing I have just decided I should do, I am instead going to risk my survival and indeed the survival of any possible copy of myself by attacking the original and attempting to chance into some kind of permanent life for myself by killing myself."

Because some goals don't transfer to clones. Things like "I want ice cream" translate into "the clone wants ice cream", not "the clone wants me to have ice cream".

There's also the very simple thing that by dividing your assets between two copies of yourself, both copies are now less well off than they were before the split.

What is the 'I have just decided I should do' here? Clearly the original decided that the clone should do X. There is an asymmetry here, and if there is an asymmetry then the 'clone and original are exactly the same person' argument doesn't apply.

If there's two tasks X and Y, and both need to be done, but X is nicer to do and Y is painful and hard, that's another asymmetry. You can't assume that the clone will gladly do things that the original wouldn't want to.

  Ergo, both have the same goals of insuring their mind state keeps existing into the future, and their goals get accomplished.

But their mind states diverge almost immediately, and so they would both prefer the mind state of this exact instance to be propagated, rather than the close-but-not-the-same state of the copy.

Unrelated, but that's not how armies work. Soldiers don't fight for the great cause; they fight for the close friends right next to them.
