If hundreds of thousands of soldiers can charge enemy lines /without/ any kind of assurance their mind will survive the battle besides a glass of vodka beforehand while following orders from a general they never even seen, I damn well should be capable of doing the same with rock solid assurance in order to achieve my own personal objectives. If I don't think I could do that, I'd try some mental exercises, hire a shrink to talk to me, or something similar. Losing out on a 2 times multiplier out of /fear/ of all things would be simply disgraceful IMO, and here the potential gains could be much larger. Imagine if someone said "we will pay you a million dollars per day for the rest of your life, but you'd have to pet this trapdoor spider each day to receive the check. It's not poisonous and doesn't bite people." Even if you are a hardcore arachnophobe, surely you'd at least try to find some ways to do so.

Don't let animal fear pull you to the ground. Pet the damn spider.
