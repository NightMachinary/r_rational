  This is a big assumption that needs to be shown.

What is there to show? Same memories, same personality, same ideals, same goals, same everything except position in space. You'd probably make an interference pattern if someone threw you through a double slit experiment for people. What's the meaningful difference here?

I genuinely don't understand this. Clone knows the same things you know. If a third party knocked you and the clone out at the moment of cloning, and then put you in a room together without either of you knowing (both have only memories up til the moment of cloning, and wake up in the same room but on opposite sides) which one is the "original", there would be no way for either of you to tell which one was the "original" without analysing the body composition. Ergo, both have the same goals of insuring their mind state keeps existing into the future, and their goals get accomplished. That can be accomplished by sending the clone into danger while keeping the squishy original holed up in a bunker, because original is necessary to make clones in the future. What kind of insanity would your clone have to be under to decide "no, you know what, I am not going to do this thing I have just decided I should do, I am instead going to risk my survival and indeed the survival of any possible copy of myself by attacking the original and attempting to chance into some kind of permanent life for myself by killing myself."

As for emotional impact of death, I frankly consider myself to be emotionally stable enough to not freak out in this situation, and be capable of braving mortal danger when I have physical proof that some copy of me will stay undamaged. If hundreds of thousands of soldiers can charge enemy lines /without/ any kind of assurance besides a glass of vodka beforehand and following orders from a general they never even seen, I damn well should be capable of doing the same /with/ rock solid assurance in order to achieve my own personal objectives.
