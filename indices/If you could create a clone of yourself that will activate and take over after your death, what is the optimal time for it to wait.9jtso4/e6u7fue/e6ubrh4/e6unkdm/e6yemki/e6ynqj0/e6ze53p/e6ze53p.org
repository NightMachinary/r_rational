  There is no meaningful difference between you and your clone, and both of you know that
#+end_quote

This is a big assumption that needs to be shown.

#+begin_quote
  Unless there is a practical difference between you and the clone a-la Simulacra in MoL, in which case again, both of you know the clone is more expendable and both would be okay with it.
#+end_quote

Being 'more expendable' doesn't necessarily mean you are okay with it. In fact an 'expendable' clone has a lot of incentive to find other ways to survive, which puts it at odds with the original.
