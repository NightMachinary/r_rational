It depends on what you expect the clone to do. If you want it to take on next monthly mortal danger lest you fall, then the answer is rather trivial. Less than a month, and while you are alive you check up on it daily.

In fact, it is better to have a cascade of clones, set to irregular intervals after the first one, preferably violating the 'no doubles' rule. For your nemeses it looks like this. 1 - you are killed. 2 - ~2 weeks later a clone arrives and tries to finish them off and resume the normal routine. If it fails, 17 weeks later five clones arrive, and take on the danger with overwhelming force. You are dead, let /those five shmucks/ deal with the inconvenience of copies of themselves 'interfering with their life'.
