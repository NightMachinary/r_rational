Have a wearable or implantable device which continuously monitors your vitals. Device & device communications should be secure. Device continuously sends out a signal to let it be known that you are alive. In the event that /all/ your vitals flatline, the device sends out a signal to state that you are dead. In the event that the device does not send a signal for x days (depending on whether you are Superman, fighting across worlds, or Batman, fighting within the city) the clone activates and investigates your disappearance. Need to consider the event where your device sends out signals indicating incapacitation but not death, for y days without improvement. Solution is contingent on the device bring tougher than your body.
