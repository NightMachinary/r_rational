There are so many different arguments that are more or less equally valid that I think the best answer is whatever makes the story most interesting.

Personally, I'd check up on the clone as often as possible and have something like a week before it wakes up. Wherever it's located I'd have a computer or something on which I could archive what was happening in my life. Something I could email with updates even if I wasn't able to visit. Ideally I'd have somebody I trust doing the same thing whether I'm alive or not.

If the clone waking up when I'm still alive is that much of a problem I'd have to establish some network of allies who could rescue me from situations who would be on a similar but smaller deadman switch. If the clone wakes, not only have I died but the other options have failed.

They can be on a short timer, because the consequences of having my friends go out looking for me aren't as disastrous as if my clone wakes, right? Five days should be enough time for them to resolve most non-James Bond situations.
