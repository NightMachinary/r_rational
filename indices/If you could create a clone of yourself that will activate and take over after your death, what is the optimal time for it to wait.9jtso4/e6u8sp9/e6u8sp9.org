The distrust of what is essentially a copy of yourself is really bizarre to me. That said, I'm willing to take the scenario at face value.

My answer is that the ideal set-up allows for early check-ins. If your "adventures" mostly stay in the same city and threats are likewise local: I'd use a four week wake-up timer that I reset every week. If your threats are likely to use planes, I'd double the length; and double again for fantastic-four style interdimensional/interplanetary shenanigans.
