  Person A and Person B are the same person; they both have the same wife, child, family, friends, job, and passport. This single person just happens to occupy two places at the same time and can't remember half of his life as of the instant of divergence.

What are your criteria for being 'the same person', then? It can't be memory, or the clone would diverge into its own person after some time. I doubt it's DNA, or truly identical twins would count as one person with a very odd case of amnesia.

So what are your criteria?
