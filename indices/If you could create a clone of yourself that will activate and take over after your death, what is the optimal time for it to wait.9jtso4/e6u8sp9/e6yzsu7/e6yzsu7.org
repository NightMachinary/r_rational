It is not necessarily distrust. If forking is possible, I would expect there to very shortly to be very severe penalties for doing it. Up to and including "We are going to shoot you on sight until we are sure there is at most one copy of you, and we will not be making /that/ much of an effort to make sure we do not get the count wrong".

Because unrestricted forking has predictable horrible outcomes on a society wide level.
