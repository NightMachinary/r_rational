I would agree, if you could function as one mind in two bodies if you woke the clone up before dying. Otherwise, there's the opportunity to do things with the guarantee you have one more life. This /isn't/ true if both of you are in the same vehicle - one accident and you're both toast.

If your clone is aging, by all means wake it up, if not - you don't have to sign up for cryonics.
