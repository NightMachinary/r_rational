  The distrust of what is essentially a copy of yourself is really bizarre to me.

This really depends who you are. Let's take Person A as an example.

A is a really selfish fellow. That isn't to say that he's rude or mean - he can compromise on the small things that he doesn't care about. But if it's something he /really/ wants? The rest of the world can go burn itself.

Now lets bring in his clone, Person B. He has the exact same selfishness as Person A. Unlike A, he doesn't have a wife, a child, a family and friends. He doesn't have a job, a passport - all those are in the possession of Person A.

But he has memories of having them.

So how can B "regain" his life? How can he get back all that was stolen from him?

Well, the answer is simple - remove A from the picture and replace him.

Mother of Learning uses this in a similar fashion - selfish people are incapable of using simulacrums, not because they can't cast the spell, but because the simulacrum of selfish people tend to work against the caster, for their own goals. Remember, they have the same personality as the person who created them, so someone hateful will have a clone that is also hateful.
