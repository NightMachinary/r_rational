I do find myself wondering why she's going with the Dead King instead of with Bonfire. The only reason she didn't go Bonfire originally was because it would render her a pariah, but alliance with the Dead King will do at least as much or worse.

Were it me, I'd go one step beyond Bonfire. Thief can apparently hold as much as she likes in her pocket dimension. Two Named on a flying horse move way faster than an army. Cat loads Thief up with every scrap of goblinfire they have and gates into Procer. Fly over a city, drop enough goblinfire to burn it to the ground, drop some leaflets that say "This is happening because Cordelia refused to accept my help in waging war against Praes and refused to let me renounce Evil and become a member of Procer." Gate to the next city, repeat.

I get that Procer is big, but how many of their major production center can they afford to lose? How many of their people can they lose?

And, of course, you need to tell the Proceran levies back in Callow about what's happening, and allow them to verify it by scrying. They'll want to go home and care for relatives and homes. They'll also be furious with Cordelia as much as with Cat.

Additionally, Juniper is still in Callow with the army to keep an eye on things.
