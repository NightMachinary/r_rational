/shivers and deep exhalations/ that chapter had me on edge the whole time, watching Cat plead for the sovereignty of her people was agonizing, and Hasenbach's 'holier than thou' bullshit was nonsense, the fact that Catherine has a Villain Name at all can currently be called into question, and it isn't that the alliance would dissolve if Callow was ruled by a Villain, it's that it will dissolve if Hasenbach can't bribe it's members with the spoils of Callow after the war.

Other than that it's just so /sad/ Catherine is really a very innocent person, all of these people determined to see her as the villain and force her into a situation where she will either die or lose everything she cares for is the only thing that drives her to further evil, and watching these people do that is tragic. Cat has given up almost any semblance of long term contentment for her goals, she will /always/ hate herself for the things she has done and the mistakes she has made, while the Good side asshats like Hasenbacg can absolve them selves of guilt simply by saying "the gods wanted it and it was for the greater good, woe is me for this sacrifice I must make of my soul, and thanks for your stuff and land by the way."
