Exactly, she has gone out of her way to not /personally/ kill anyone that she doesn't think would have deserved it, and most of her killing is done on the battlefield, which is a morally grey area even in our world.

The reason I call her innocent is because she is still fighting towards her noble goals, she still believes she can win, I don't think she is /wrong/, just innocent, each time she thinks that this will be just one step closer without realising that she will be fighting forever if what she wants is peace in Callow, because the story seems to have decided it's time for callow to die, and I don't think it will ever stop trying to kill it.
