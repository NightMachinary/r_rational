I knew they'd have to go to Keter, because Story.

That being said, this part just utterly rubs your nose in how downright despicable Good is in that world.

The First Prince /could/ have told Cat the "plan", but didn't. I like how the Pilgrim was up front about it. Knowing that, you can read the first half again and see why she was totally unwilling to make any sort of compromise at all. If it didn't fit her plan exactly, she wasn't going to let it happen.

"Good" is an absolute *The Ends Justify The Means* faction. Tens of thousands die, all so we can get the goal we want? No problem--especially if its innocent people in another place and not ours. What, that country used to be Good until we failed em? No worries, they aren't now, feel free to murder them in heaps until we force them to swtich back. Disgusting.

I hope she manages to make a deal with the Dead King that lets him wreak havoc on their lands, to show them what it's like when someone /else/ is setting the terms. And I hope Black gets to do a lot of wreaking, too, before he has to fall back.
