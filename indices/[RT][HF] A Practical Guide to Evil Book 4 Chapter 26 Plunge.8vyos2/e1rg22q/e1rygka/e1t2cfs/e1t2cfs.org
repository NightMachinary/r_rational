I think you are exactly correct.

I was actually playing with the idea that the Gods Above and Below are Both the "Rule over them" Gods. Mostly because Demons and the hells, that does not sound like the Gods Below are interested in guidance.

I was thinking that maybe the Bet has already been mostly settled with the Rule Gods winning and forcing the current stalemate on the world. And the Guidance Gods are mostly the ones that work in the shadows just giving neutral names and maybe influencing betterment in some way.

Maybe the bet was settled the other way, with the Guidance Gods winning and Calernia is the last stronghold of the Rule Gods. We know that Calernia is a very small part of the world. What if the kingdom ruled by a Hero and Villain is already part of the Guidance Gods. Same with the Country where Elves and Humans live together. Maybe the Gnomes as well. Maybe the gnomes where the first to get out of the Rule Gods game. They got really advanced technologically and they only deliver red letters on Calernia. Since Calernia is the only place that still listens to the Rule Gods maybe the gnomes want to make sure that those gods don't get their hands on stuff like bio weapons or nukes.

I think that second part is mostly wrong because of the Bard. She seemed to talk about the Elf/Human Country with fondness. And she also does not seem to talk about any of those other places as if they were lost to the gods above. Also she seems to think that there is a very big difference between the Gods above and Below. She might just be a blind servant of the gods, just doing what she is told. But she seems to me like she knows exactly what is happening, so i doubt the gods above and below are working together and she doesn't know.
