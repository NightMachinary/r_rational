The problem is that the First Prince's hold on power is tenuous at best. She keeps a lot of other princes together because she has promised them that they could have a piece of Callow to rule after the war. Which is why she is uncompromising in the removal of Catherine as queen. Not in 10 years, not even in 5, /now/. Or else her promises to the other princes can't be fulfilled, and they will have 5 years of time to fester a rebellion.
