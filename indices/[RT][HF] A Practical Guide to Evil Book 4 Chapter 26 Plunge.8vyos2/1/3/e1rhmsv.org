Maybe I'm placing too much on this arbitrary label, but Cat is definitally not qualified to rule a country, and accepting her peoce at the cost of the collapse of the grand alliance would be a horrible deal for them. Cat can say whatever she likes about pushing an inch too far, but her demands are way over that line themselves; the only reason it doesnt look that way is because she's successfully shifted the overton window to an enourmous degree.
