I would note that no one is qualified to rule a country--good governance requires infrastructure and administration, and is not the job of an individual. You're right that Cat isn't an ideal head of state, but fortunately she's also /intimately aware of that/, and eager to pass on the reins. /Un/fortunately, there are several obstacles to a peaceful succession:

- Callow's population is mostly poor and uneducated. Cat seems to have their tentative approval for the moment, but they're likely to rebel against any significant upset. A successor must not only be competent, but recognizable and popular.
- Cat is intent on decentralizing power to prevent its abuse. To that end, she must either find a competent, publicly acceptable successor who shares her vision, or implement her reforms prior to her abdication.
- Most of the candidates competent enough to establish a functional administration come from aristocracy, intent on preserving the feudal power structure of Callow. Her only other pool of educated candidates is her military, which is currently /very/ occupied with the nation's defense, and also unacceptably foreign to the average Callowan citizen.
- Callow is in an open war with its western neighbor, Procer, and in a cold war with its eastern neighbor, Praes. Since the end goal is Callowan independence, a viable successor must be capable of negotiating peace or otherwise leading the nation in war, and must not become a puppet under foreign pressure.
- The most educated and experienced members of Callow's current military are from Praes. While they have demonstrated loyalty to Cat, they may feel conflicted about open war with their homeland. That feeling would be exacerbated if their figurehead were removed. Orcs and goblins, in particular, would feel concern over their status in Callow, in the face of lingering Callowan racism. Any significant upset in the core of the Army of Callow in its current state would cripple it.

Now let's discuss Cat's "terms for peace". It's important to remember that she's not waging a war to achieve her goals--she's fighting against a hostile foreign power intent on expanding into her nation, so far without taking any military action outside Callowan borders. Her only terms are that Procer /stops invading/ and pays war reparations, but, as we're privy to her thoughts, we also know she /doesn't even expect the reparations/. Not only that, she's offering to /help/ this currently hostile power with their primary stated goal of "eliminate the potential for more evil superweapons". Cat's ultimate goal of implementing the Liesse Accords isn't even at play here.

Granted, it would be bad for the members of the Grand Alliance if it collapsed. Why is that even a concern, though? Peace with Callow could only spare lives and free the Alliance's forces to deal with Praes. Cat's terms go beyond, offering to bolster their armies with her own and transport them at supernatural speeds. It seems like they only stand to benefit from accepting her terms. No, the Alliance is at risk entirely because the First Prince of Procer is the linchpin of the entire affair, and Cordelia's rule is too fragile to survive Proceran unrest after a failed attempt to expand into Callow. The hypocrisy is telling, considering Cordelia rebuffed Cat's peace by criticizing /Cat's/ ability to rule. It's also important to note that should Procer successfully expand into Callow, the Grand Alliance would /still/ collapse, and it would /still/ be Procer's fault, because the Dominion of Levant is likely to bail the moment Procer starts expanding again.
