The problem is, if Cordelia agrees to a truce but keeps digging the tunnel, there's nothing stopping her once the tunnel is done from going "Well, truce is over, back to invading you!". Digging that tunnel is essentially an act of war, and Cordelia is well aware of that.

What she's doing is essentially saying "I'll agree to your deal, but first I'm altering it. Pray I don't alter it any further."
