Your specific plan would have high chances to fail because it's more vulnerable to manipulations by the gods and interventions by Named (eg the Augur tells the Saint of Swords where to go to ambush Cat).

I'm guessing there's a logistical reason Cat still isn't going with Bonfire. Maybe they're still worrying it would be Evil enough to attract heavenly retribution; or maybe they're worried that the crusaders will dedicate a part of their army to pillaging and slaughtering Callowan cities as retribution.
