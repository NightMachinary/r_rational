First, Callowan stocks of goblin munitions are pretty much depleted after the Battle of the Camps, and Cat currently has no way to acquire more. Maybe Thief could thieve her way into the Grey Eyries thiefily, but banking on your ability to out-stealth the goblins on their home turf sounds like a /horrible/ idea.

Second, just burning down an entire city is the kind of stupid evil that gets villains killed by a band of heroes who just happen to be visiting the third city to be targetted. Unless I'm horribly misremembering it, Bonfire was more about decapitating the Proceran leadership and crippling their ability to wage war. Even if successful, Bonfire is NOT a plan that ends in a peace treaty with Procer.
