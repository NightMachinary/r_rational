In the prologue of book 1 it gave us the full spiel of how the gods having a disagreement, one side believing that mortals should be *guided* to greatness, the other believing they should be *ruled* directly.

Now in the context of our morality the latter would be Evil, as it is the definition of tyranny, right? Yes. But not in Calernia, the ones that wanted to rule became the /Good/ gods (gods above) and imposed direct and absolute morality on mortals. That makes the ones who believed they should be guided as the /Evil/ gods (gods below), their current nature and form is likely not what they started out as, they became as they are as direct opposition to the gods above.

This gives us a very different perspective to look at this world, all the evil gods want from their Names is to make someone *more* of what they already are, Cat's initial squire aspects are a perfect example, *Learn, Struggle, Seek,* these things are what she already was, just more.

On the flip side the gods above make someone into what they want them to be, the Lone swordsman is a perfect example of this, they showed up to him, told him he was terrible and that he needed to do what they say to make anything better, because he is of course never going to makeup for his /sins/ alone, his aspects were *Rise, Swing, Triumph,* these have nothing to do with who he was, they were commands branded to his soul to control him, and the more he leaned into them, accepting his Role (and their control) the more powerful he would be.

This is how I have come to understand the morality of the forces at play in this series, I'm honestly not experienced or diefic enough to really say whether either of these ways is good or evil, but that is how I see them being portrayed so far.
