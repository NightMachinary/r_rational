Their goals aren't to prevent people from dying, that would be "stupid good", letting the alliance fall apart and go back to the status quo where good fights back evil and then goes back to fighting each other. A permanent alliance would mean a unified front against Keter and the rats.

The "practical" part comes from them skipping the fanatical good part to instead fulfil their dreams of a weakened evil and an alliance of good nations that won't declare war on each other. Just like how Black and Malicia skipped the fanatical evil part to instead fulfil their dreams.
