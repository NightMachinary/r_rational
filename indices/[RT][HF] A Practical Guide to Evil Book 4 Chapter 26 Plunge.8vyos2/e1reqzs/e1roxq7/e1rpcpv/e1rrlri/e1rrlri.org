Cordelia believes that without a victory in Callow the princes and other allies will see her as weak and the coalition will collapse. And allowing a villain to remain in power in exchange for promises of good behavior isnt going to satisfy them. Unless Cat can give her some other way to bind the alliance together she doesn't have a choice

edit: remember that even if cordelia trusts her to keep her word that doesnt mean the others will. From their point of view she would be making peace with a literal embodiment of teh ontological concept of evil, and a worshipper of the dark gods, who has just slaughtered their armies. Imagine if the nazis offering peace in 1943 in exchange for hitler promising to resign in a few years
