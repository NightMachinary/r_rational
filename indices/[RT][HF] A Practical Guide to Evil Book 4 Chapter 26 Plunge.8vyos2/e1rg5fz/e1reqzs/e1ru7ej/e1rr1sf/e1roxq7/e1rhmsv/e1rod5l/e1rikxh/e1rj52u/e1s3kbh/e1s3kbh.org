Basically, Cordelia is arrogant and thinks she can pull off her plan without losing all her plans for the future so she ignores the high chance of peace that risks her plans for the future. Pilgrim can override that decision and stop the bloodshed immediately, but that would definitely destroy Cordelias rule.

It's a mix of arrogance, sunk cost fallacy, and the fact that Catherine is actually an abomination empowered by otherworldly forces and the powers of hell.
