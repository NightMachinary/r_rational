Allying with Callow costs the lives of thousands, on the long term. The alliance needs a decisive victory to be cemented as useful, otherwise it will be discarded as a useless treaty and the Good nations are back to infighting forever. Bartering a compromise with this generation's most noteworthy Villain is pretty damn far from a decisive victory.

Simply put, the goal of the Tenth Crusade is to utterly and completely annihilate Evil everywhere east of Procer, using their corpses as the foundation of a Good powerblock that can win against Keter. Breaking the Woe and everything they've built is as important as bringing down the Tower, the crusaders won't settle for one at the price of the other.
