I think this chapter made it clear the Pilgrim and Cordelia are "practical Good" types.

When Cat starts a war in Callow to gain power to get in a position to protect Callow, she gets labeled a warlord and gets shit on for being Evil.

When the First Prince starts a war in Callow to solidify her position and to get in position to protect half of Calernia, she gets the thumb up from the heavens and has a great reputation because she is Good.

Yeah, I can see why Cat is pissed.
