I think "killed a lot of people" is kind of a misleading label of what she did. Almost all the people she killed were foreign invaders, Fae, criminals, war criminals, or some combination therein of, and she offered most of them a chance to surrender.

She's pretty close to innocent, compared to people like Black or Cordelia, who did far more brutal acts for more tenuous reasons.
