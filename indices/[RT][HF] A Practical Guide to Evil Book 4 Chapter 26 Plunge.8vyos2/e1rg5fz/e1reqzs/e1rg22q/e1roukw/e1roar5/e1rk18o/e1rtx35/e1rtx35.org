A random smattering of thoughts:

#+begin_quote
  “It has not gone unnoticed,” Hasenbach conceded, to my surprise. “You must understand, however, that you are a *villain*. Deception is the trade of your kind."

  “You are being deliberately obtuse,” Hasenbach said. “I have already informed you that a *villain* ruling Callow is not an acceptable outcome for this crusade.”
#+end_quote

"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."

Cat still thinks of herself as a villain. Hasenbach and GP do as well. But villain is the opposite of hero when it comes to /Names/. Cat has barely the tatters of a Name (if she even has that any more), and Squire was a Name that could go either way. She brings up her willingness to lean into redemption with GP, but why doesn't she with Hasenbach? Rather than abdication, why not have called Hasenbach's bluff?

"Fine. I renounce the Gods Below, and will pledge Callow to uphold Good. I will even work with GP to change my Name, if rejecting my alignment to Evil isn't enough to do so."

End result: Callow is no longer led by a villain, has turned to Good, and can become a member of the Grand Alliance.

It sounds ridiculously oversimplified, but I don't see how Hasenbach could do anything but accept it. If she refuses to do so, then Cat can break the Crusade by pointing out that it is now attacking a Good country which has an honest intention to join up to fight Evil. Bring in Hanno to pass judgment (or y'know, maybe someone a little less chance-based) on her sincerity. Even if GP refused to speak up on Cat's behalf, the Gods Above would overrule him. And what does that do to the Crusade? It's immediately split - the common levies buying into the narrative of a just and Good Crusade would see that it's just political machinations and revolt; the arriving forces of the Levant would find themselves in the middle of a Procer just revealed to only be interested in expansionism (which is a historical wedge between the two); and the heroes would scatter, either staying with GP to support Procer despite its deception, joining Hanno (and potentially Saint - Gods, THAT would be a hilarious turn around) to defend Good Callow against the corrupt Princes of Procer, or likely just washing their hands of everything and going home like I bet Witch of the Wilds would do.

Obviously there are a lot of unknowns and risks to this, of course:

- The first that comes to mind is whether Cat can even change her alignment; if redemption is even possible for her. She might not have (much of) a Name right now, but she's the Queen of Winter. If Creation is the 2.0 version of Arcadia, and Evil is the 2.0 version of Winter, is Cat stuck in her alignment no matter what? Or could you have a Queen of Winter who is also a Hero? It sounds like an inherent contradiction, but [[https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/open-uri20160812-3094-11p2kds_940c7497.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1024%2C320][I swear I've seen stories like that...]]
- Next up is what the practical (heh) effect of this would be on Cat herself. As the chapter points out from the start, the Gods Above demand obedience. By saving Callow for now, would Cat necessarily bind it to the existing narrative of an eternal battle of Good versus Evil, exactly what Black has been trying to break for decades? Is there any way that Good can be practical too and work on breaking the meta game? My gut says no... but if Cat truly believed that, why would she even float the redemption idea to GP? She wouldn't do so if she truly believed it would screw Callow later. So either she's not actually being honest with GP (which is unlikely, since he can tell truth from lies), or she thinks she can wiggle out of the obedience clause.
- Then there's the Woe. This actually isn't as big an issue as you might first think. Archer and Thief are already grey Names. Adjutant is, I believe, a new Name and doesn't seem intrinsically Evil except for it only coming into being around other villains. The toughest one is Hierophant, because "vivisector of miracles" sounds like something the Gods Above might frown upon... but it's a priestly Name, and I don't necessarily think thirst for knowledge needs to be Evil. As for the people behind the Names, again Masego is likely the toughest nut to crack, as making an alignment change means going against his father and uncle. But the others? Vivienne would be all for the idea, Indrani would probably grouse and moan but go along with it, and Hakram would support Cat. I think Masego could be persuaded if it came down to it.
- And then there are the obvious political ramifications. Even if Cat is honest and changes her alignment, Callow hosts a bunch of orcs, a nest of goblins, and thousands of Praesi former-Legion troops. I could see the change sparking a revolt among the Praesi troops, as well as outrage among the Grand Alliance. Orcs I think can be, at best, neutral... though there are obviously some examples of [[http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Thrall][Good orcs]]. Goblins are a MUCH harder sell, as greed, hunger, and violence are bred into the species and they actively use a demon to make their munitions. I think that, short of maybe having Pickler start a neutral nest (as much as possible), goblins might have no place in a Good Callow :-(

Whew. Ok, so there's my crazy idea for what Cat could have - and probably should have - brought up. EE, want to write another Fourfold Crossing alternate path?

Onto other thoughts:

  “You are a warlord, Catherine Foundling,” she said, pronunciation excruciatingly precise. “Your reign was built on catastrophe and butchery, and has been maintained by the same.
#+end_quote

I know Cat got upset by Hasenbach's insults, but this part right here is /absolutely correct/. Cat's own orcish troops literally called her "warlord." But even more ridiculous is the rest of her diatribe, which literally describes her own rule as well. She too built her reign on butchery and is even engaging in it now! I feel like this is one of those cases of a person screaming into a mirror "I'm nothing like you!" Ugh, Hasenbach is the worst.

  “Appeals to emotion,” she said, not unkindly, “are the last resort of one without argument.”
#+end_quote

"... have you /met/ the Grey Pilgrim? The guy does nothing but use appeals to emotion. Well, that and BS divine powers."

#+begin_quote
  “You're trying to shove redemption down my throat, and don't bother denying it. Fine. I'll fucking lean in, even if it'll probably get me killed. Just /act/. I'll kiss the hem, quote the Book. All you need to speak up and thousands don't have to die.”

  “It would smother in the crib,” the Grey Pilgrim said sadly, “what is perhaps the last chance for peace in our time.”
#+end_quote

If this wasn't a death flag for GP, it should have been. Not because he's wrong - pragmatically he isn't - but because when one of the highest champions of Good spurns the honest opportunity to redeem one of the most infamous villains of the age, he's acting like a villain, not a hero. This should be a death flag because acting against your Role weakens your powers (like Cat faced books ago).
