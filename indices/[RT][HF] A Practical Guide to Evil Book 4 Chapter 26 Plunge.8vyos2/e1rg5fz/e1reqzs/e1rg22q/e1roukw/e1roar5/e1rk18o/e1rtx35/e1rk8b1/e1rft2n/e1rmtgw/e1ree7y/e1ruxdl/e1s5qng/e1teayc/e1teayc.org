Cat, I don't think you can complain about people not trusting you, and then go out to make a deal with the biggest, most unambiguously evil monster on the continent while planning to backstab every nation you can get your hands on.

And I'm not sure that trying to negotiate with the Dead King after /failing/ to negotiate with Cordelia is a particularly great idea anyway. Diplomacy is not your strongest suit.
