Yeah, because it seems that Cat has finally realized that she can't make peace and coexist with the other side since they won't honor any sort of deal with her at all, so she's now free to go all out. She probably can't be blatantly destructive like with Bonfire since that would attract too much negative attention, but she has shifted from "bloody Cordelia's nose so that they can negotiate as equals" to "destroy and/or unseat Cordelia and maybe install a puppet or just let Procer tear itself apart in civil war".
