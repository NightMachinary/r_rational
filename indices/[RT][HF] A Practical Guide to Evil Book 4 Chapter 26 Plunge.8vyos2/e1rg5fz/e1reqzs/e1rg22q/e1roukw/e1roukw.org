What makes this discussion so beautifully tragic is that both sides really are tryin to do what is best from their position.

For Cordelia and Pilgrim, the preservation of the alliance is the most important thing by a wide margin. Ending the constant wars between the nations of calernia is worth a huge amount, saving lives, promoting stability, etc. They, pretty reasonably, believe that if Cordelia is seen to lose this early then it all collapses, wars resume, more people die. So they need to either have Cat make a big enouh concession they can spin it as victory, or continue the war. To unite their people they need this conflict, and if that means Callow has to burn then so be it.

For Catherine she won't allow he nation to burn, even if its for the greater good. She can't abdicate or surrender because she, quite reasonably, thinks Callow would fall apart the moment she does. Even if it was only symbolic her people would not accept becoming vassals of procer. So concession is impossible.

So both sides will continue to play rationally and everyone will lose.
