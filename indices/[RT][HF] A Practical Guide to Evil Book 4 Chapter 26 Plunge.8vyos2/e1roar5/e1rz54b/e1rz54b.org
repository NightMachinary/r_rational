My biggest problem with Hasenbach is how /hypocritical/ that monologue is, she says that the only claim that Cat has to royalty is steel, when she herself need to use the superior force of arms and military discipline of her native princepate to quell the other before they let her rule them. Does she think that because she is a noble them she has more right to be a ruler than Cat, *FUCK HER* that is the most base form of entitlement and is the /exact/ same problem that the truebloods had in Praes, just with less Demon summoning, god I hate her after that speech, which is fantastic, cause I always loved her as a counterpoint to Malicia.

She is going to get a ride awakening from Cat though, if Malicia thinks she is losing, she will sit back and think about her next move, Cat will just flip the game board and slug you in the face, she knows she isn't as clever, so she plays to her strengths, hoping that in the end at least her intentions are purer that the other.
