I just don't think "innocent" is the right term. You can have noble goals without being "innocent," you can be a decent person without being "innocent," you can opt for the lesser evil without being "innocent."

I generally think of an innocent as either someone who is naive about the shittier aspects of other people/the world, or as someone who genuinely has no blood on their hands. If you give someone a chance to surrender and then kill them when they refuse, then you may be justified, but that's not the same as being innocent. There are almost no important characters in this story that I would consider innocent.

I mean, she might be innocent compared to /Black,/ but that's setting an unreasonably low bar. There are a ton of nameless civilians in this world who haven't killed anyone or had anyone killed, and probably plenty who still wouldn't if they had the power. If we're establishing relative innocence tiers, it's no more arbitrary to compare Catherine to some warm-hearted farmgirl who's friends with the songbirds than it is to compare her to Black.
