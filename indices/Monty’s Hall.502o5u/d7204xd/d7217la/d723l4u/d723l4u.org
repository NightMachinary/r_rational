Here's a more Bayesian way to think of it: If you pick goblet 1, and then you observe goblet 2 being revealed as empty, you know that you are in one of two universes. Either a) the coin is in goblet 3, or b) the coin is in goblet 1.

Now, in advance (before goblet 2 was revealed), each universe was equally likely (assuming we truly picked the initial goblet at random). But which of those two universes is more likely to have produced the observed result of goblet 2 being revealed as empty?

In universe 'a', goblet 2 was the only choice. That universe would reveal goblet 2 with 100% probability.

In universe 'b', either goblet 2 or goblet 3 could have been revealed. That universe would reveal goblet 2 with only 50% probability.

Thus we can conclude that universe 'a' is twice as likely as universe 'b'.
