Yeah, I've always found it helpful when trying to comprehend the Monty Hall problem to demonstrate it with a /huge/ number of doors.

Example:

[1] [2] [3] [4] *[X]* [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]

You choose the third.

[1] [2] *[3]* [4] *[X]* [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]

All doors except for the third and the fifth (where the XXX is) are revealed, leaving these:

=[3] [XXX]=

Question: Should you switch? When presented in this manner, I think it's obvious what you should do.

Excellent story.
