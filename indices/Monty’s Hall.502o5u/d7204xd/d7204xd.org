  Uncovering an empty goblet wouldn't reveal anything, since Forwin would always uncover an empty goblet no matter what the corporal chose at first. The corporal couldn't know whether the coin was under his first choice or under the other uncovered goblet. The odds didn't change, right?

Thought this meant Forwin would precommit to revealing one of the two empty goblets regardless of the corporal's choice, meaning that the corporal's choice and Forwin's precommitment could coincide in the same goblet.

There's also a confounding factor left unaddressed. If the goblet Forwin chooses to remove is replaced on the tray, the corporal may be able to hear or see which goblet conceals the coin based on the sound or movement of the tray or goblet. You should specify that the removed goblet stays off the tray.

How did the wizard's demonstration help Forwin? How does removing one of six shot glasses inform which of the remaining four don't contain the coin? Does it not, but was contrived by the wizard to trigger Forwin's leap to understanding?
