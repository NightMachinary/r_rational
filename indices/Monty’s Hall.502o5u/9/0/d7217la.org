Forwin is only obliged to reveal whichever goblet happens to be empty out of the two remaining goblets that are not part of the corporal's tentative pick. He is not precommitted to a specific goblet. Sorry if that was unclear. The story assumes a familiarity with the Monty Hall problem.

Many people (myself included), were absolutely convinced that the odds don't change by revealing the empty goblet, until the Bayesian reasoning is explained. The Wizard's demonstration is my own version of understanding the Bayesian explanation. The key, as I see it, is to understand that the probability of the initial pick being correct is low. The coin is more likely to be in one of the unselected goblets. Revealing the empty goblet, guides the corporal to the most likely pick. This is much more obvious when considering many more goblets. Yes, the Wizard was trying to trigger Forwin's leap of understanding.
