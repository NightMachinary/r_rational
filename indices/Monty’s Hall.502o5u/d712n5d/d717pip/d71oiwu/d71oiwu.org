It's 14.5% for best out of 9 (or first to 5), and 12.2% for best out of 11 (or first to 6).

7.7% is the chance of losing 6 or more out of 10 rounds. There is also a 13.7% chance of a 5-5 tie, which could count as a push where no one loses or could be broken by playing one more round (which makes the game equivalent to best out of 11 or first to 6).
