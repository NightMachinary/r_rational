I've always thought that "best of X" was a strange way to specify the format. "First to (X+1)/2 victories" seems way more obvious. Best-or-three becomes "first to reach two victories", best-of-five "first to three" and so on. It's functionally closer to how the games are usually played as well. Most of the time a "best of X" series doesn't actually involve X games, but rather goes on until one side accumulates enough victories.
