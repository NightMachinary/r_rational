I'll preface this by saying that I love Modesitt- I have every one of his (68!) books, even his first out-of-print near-future political thriller (/The Green Progression/). And he /does/ experiment more with his sci-fi books- they sometimes get a bit preachier, but /Timegod/, /Flash/, /Octagonal Raven/, etc. are much more memorable and try different things. But yeah, his fantasy... it's fun. I like it, and I like that he does a lot of world-building for each series and thinks a lot about the sociopolitical consequences of everything. There's a lot of rationality to it. But yes, every protagonist is the same- "cerebral", as I saw in a review once, notably smarter than pretty much anyone else (except the phoned-in love interest with whom they never seriously disagree), end up solving their/their society's problems, at least in the near-future, through copious amounts of one-vs-army violence + assassinations that they feel just /terrible/ about. It does make them run together if you read too many in a row.

Modesitt absolutely refuses to recognize that, by the way- he's mentioned on his blog that he finds it baffling that people think his protagonists are similar- after all, they range from teenagers to post-middle age, with a wide variety of backgrounds! They fact that they all think in similar patterns and approach problems similarly doesn't seem to occur to him.
