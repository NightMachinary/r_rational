L E Modesitt Jr has a particularly comfortable writing style to read, but it doesn't come off as particularly rational.

On one hand, he does spend a lot of time on world building and an above average amount on the nuances of his magic system for the Recluse setting, so there is perhaps enough there that he can appeal to Sanderson's law and resolve conflicts with magic, always at great cost, always with the protagonist going blind or whatever for a time, or whatever, without it being too much of a /deus ex machina/.

On the other, his stories are more or less paint-by-numbers or Mad Libs. Let's take Recluse:

<name> from <place> really wanted to be a <profession> with a secret love of <hobby>. <he/she> drinks <some red juice stuff | tea | beer> and wields a <staff|sword|cudgel> made of <black oak|white oak|cupridium>. People whisper behind their back about how impressive <some misunderstood feat> was. They wind up becoming a secret <white|black|grey> mage by reading some book from a mentor that they obtained before they were <exiled|forced to join the army|...>.

The protagonist almost always pulls off some great feat of magic in the end that then raises the bar for the next book. In his defense the author usually at least hints in the direction of that feat throughout the book, but it is invariably a "new" power or power breakthrough, which makes it rather unsatisfying.

Three books in this mold is setting a sort of cadence or melody. Ten or however many he's up to by now more than a little redundant. There is a structure to the narrative that is always very comfortable, and in which the protagonist is allowed to be level 1 intelligent, but rarely much more. =(

And going beyond rational to rationalist? No matter what you learn of order or chaos within his world, it doesn't really equip you with any tools for working in the real world.
