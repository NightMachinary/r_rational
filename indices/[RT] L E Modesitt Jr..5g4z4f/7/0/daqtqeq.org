The first few Recluce books were more YA-ish than his other output. However, Modesitt really likes to write in bildungsroman that essentially feel a little YA-ish in plot structure in his fantasy novels especially - the fantasy novels almost always essentially follow the life of protagonists, sometimes from childhood to finding their place as adults, sometimes from teenage years to adulthood, it varies a little. The science fiction is more likely to start with characters who are already adults and tends to be less 'YA-ish', but The Forever Hero feels YA-ish at the start in this respect.

In terms of tackling 'mature' or 'dark' substance - Modesitt never goes for explicit sex, torture, or other such stuff. Lots of violence, war, etc, but sexual stuff tends to be elided around or euphemized.

There are tons of books out there, and if Modesitt is not your thing then I don't blame you for not spending more time on his books - they tend to be similar enough that if you don't like The Recluce Saga's books 1-4 you probably should stop reading it because you won't like any of the rest either. This review above is not 100% praise as I'm sure you've noticed - I don't think Modesitt will be everyone's cup of tea, but I thought I'd put together an overview anyways because so much of his stuff fits within the subreddit's bailiwick.
