Hmm. In some ways closer than I thought it might be, though I can't say that it sounds much like the reality. Note the use of the word "fringe". If a group practises self-mutilation and burns traitors at the stake, that doesn't make it "space Catholicism", and it probably wouldn't feel much like the actual lived experience of being Catholic.

Most especially, in this case, the strong military focus, to the exclusion of other technology and to the detriment of the planet(s) - that doesn't sound familiar at all.
