Hmm. I've come across and read the second Spellsong War book. Didn't mind it, although the occasional strong language did grate a bit. The moral decisions (Should I one-sidedly massacre the evil guy and cement his allies' crusade against me, or let him live and keep working against me?) kept it thought-provoking.

I'm unclear on what Space Mormonism means, though. I'm guessing that you're not talking about our actual doctrines, but rather a perception of us as secretive/exclusive, actively proselyting, etc? Can you elaborate?
