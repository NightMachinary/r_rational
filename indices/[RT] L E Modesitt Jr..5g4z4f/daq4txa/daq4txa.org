Thank you so much for writing this post, I completely forgot about this author until now! You seem to be pretty accurate about him, I can barely remember the details about any of the half dozen or so books I read about Recluce. Except for that one that was the earliest chronologically, with the aliens crash landing. That was pretty entertaining. I really liked that it was sort of like a better thought out Force on one planet though.
