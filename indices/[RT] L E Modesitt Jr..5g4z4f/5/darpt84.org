L.E. Modesitt has made some appearances on the Writing Excuses podcast that serve as good instructive pieces that I think many of the people on [[/r/rational]] would appreciate.

From [[http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/05/30/writing-excuses-4-21-writing-practical-fantasy/]["Writing Practical Fantasy"]]:

  I got really ticked off many, many years ago when I read a fantasy that had 10,000 armed knights running around on each side. Because being an economist, and having been trained in semi-practical stuff, I realized that when it takes 12 hundred acres to support one armed knight, you don't have a country that you can hold together with horses if you've got 10,000 on each side of a war. And likewise, I always wonder about all these people running off on crusades with no money. The only time that ever happened in history was the Children's Crusade and they all got killed or enslaved. Yet these were fantasy tropes that people were using. I thought, "You know, in this writing business, you really ought to stick close to at least some what I would call human practicality -- the way people actually operate if they're at all human."

Also check out the more recent podcast about [[http://www.writingexcuses.com/2016/04/10/11-15-the-environment-with-l-e-modessit-jr/]["The Environment"]], and the [[http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/06/06/writing-excuses-4-22-qa-with-l-e-modesitt-jr/][Q&A episode]] which covers a variety of topics, which includes this wonderful bit where Lee speaks from is own experience as a military vet:

  There a number of things people get wrong about writing the military. One of which is most people understate the element of discipline in the military. There are far too many insubordinate rankers and noncommissioned officers in most military fiction. There is an element of insubordination in the military, but unless you're career or have had time in the military, you'll never recognize it. It's very insidious. It's a polite, "Yes, sir" with the overtone of "you're a complete idiot, sir, but I will do exactly what you say, and we will see the disastrous results of following your ill-advised order." Or sometimes they will say, "Sir?" With a comment which basically says, "Ask me a question. Any question, because I really don't want to do it that way, because we're gonna all get killed." Or if they're really desperate, they'll say, "Sir, uh, what exactly did you mean by that?" Or words to that effect. But nobody will say, "Sir, you're a complete asshole." They may say it by tone, but every word will officially be polite.
