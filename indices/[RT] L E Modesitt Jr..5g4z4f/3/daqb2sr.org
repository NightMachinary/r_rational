Thanks for the great write-up! To recommend another author in a similar vein: Lawrence Watt-Evans does a great job of building rich worlds with fantastic potential, and populating them with sympathetic characters who are about as intelligent and only slightly luckier than everyone else. The plots are sometimes underwhelming and sometimes go in almost entirely unforeseen directions because something weird happened.

I'm a fan, but it basically reads like a good DnD campaign without the bookkeeping. To recommend a book in particular, /The Wizard Lord/ is set in an elegantly constructed universe with a strong plot arc.
