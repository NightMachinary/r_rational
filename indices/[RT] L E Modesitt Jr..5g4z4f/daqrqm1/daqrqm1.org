I have but one question: does it get more mature than the saga of the recluce ?

It felt like something old fashioned but written well. Problem is it felt like a childrens/"young adult" book... To it's detriment in my view.

Stopped reading him after a few books. Will consider something else but I'm not sure if it's worth it, not my thing...
