With about half an hour's preparation and a bit of charisma, you can throw together a 'magic show' that'll have professional magicians wondering how you do it. This can net you a fair amount of money in a reasonable time without compromising anonymity.

Alternatively, with the help of a confederate as a "trainer", you can put on a show as (say) a trained hyena.

You might not be able to fly as a bird, but can you swim as a dolphin?
