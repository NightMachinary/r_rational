My first thought was to buy a set of (small) lockpicks and practice with them until decently skilled. After that, the ideas started getting weirder.

Small amounts of chemicals that react with each other so you can blow holes in things, melt through things, etc. Preferably things that don't react with water or the oils on your skin though, as that would suck:

Really my most interesting and sort of out there idea was having medicine/drugs. Your stomach technically qualifies as being enclosed by your body, so you can pretty much always dose yourself with whatever you need.

In a worst-case scenario, where you've been captured by someone who knows about your power and has made a reasonable amount of effort to restrain you, keep your mouth open at all times, etc probably isn't able to keep you from dosing yourself with whatever fits in your stomach or, absolute worst case scenario, your veins.
