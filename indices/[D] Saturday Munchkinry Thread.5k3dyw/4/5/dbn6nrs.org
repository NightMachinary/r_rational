Hmmm. If I can rearrange atoms in a "Copy This" kind of way, then I should be able to instantly recharge batteries (given one fully charged battery as a template).

Minor, but useful.

Hmmm... the ability to instantly copy anything I can cup within my hands has a number of other minor-but-useful benefits as well. I'll never be without a working pen or pencil and some paper, for example. (Forging coins or banknotes is also, of course, possible).

I wonder if I can instantly create small pieces of origami?

Hmmmm... if I put some paint in my subspace pocket, can I create an instant artwork (e.g. a view of the scene in front of me) like a mildly eccentric but virtually undetectable camera?

...if I really wanted to ruin a nearby farmer's day, can I turn one locust into a swarm of the same?
