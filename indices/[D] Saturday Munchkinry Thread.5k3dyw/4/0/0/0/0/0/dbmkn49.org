Ok first off requiring containers be made of primarily living flesh is not going to stop a dedicated munchkin. It's more difficult but you could take a bunch of skin and use it to grow more skin, then connect that whole skin containers to a blood supply or use some other means, though this would require a lab.

As for building an army, keep in mind these would be altered clones of one's self. There's a great deal of uses for totally loyal genius clones of oneself, hell making money via intellectual work comes to mind.
