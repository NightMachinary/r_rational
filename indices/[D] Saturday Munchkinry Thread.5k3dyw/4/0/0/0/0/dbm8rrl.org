Given some of the nearby comments, I conclude that the interdimensional entity is going to want to limit the munchkinability of that particular strategy, to try to reduce the number of interdimensional-equivalents of Unfriendly AI. So the entity is probably going to tweak the rules for most versions of the experiment to require the user's living body to be the only such container possible. ... If a pocket-holder wants to arrange to turn themselves into a snake the size of a cargo-container, or related silliness :) , then the entity would probably be willing to see how that plays out.

The pocket-holder's built-in macros only have a limited sample-set of data to draw on; going straight for an intelligence explosion would probably require the holder to explicitly specify the necessary neurological hardware. (And thus might need to apply a wealth-generation trick to fund research into the field.)

Okay, so you've arranged to turn yourself into something large enough to cough up adult humans, and have turned the local wildlife into various variants of yourself; what do you plan on /doing/ with this gang?
