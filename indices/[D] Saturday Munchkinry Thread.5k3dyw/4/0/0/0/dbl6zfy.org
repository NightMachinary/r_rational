Ah so it kind of sounds like it can only build stuff by copying qualities it's either seen before or that are easily imagined/already existent in the user. A user can easily make any possible humanoids because their psychology is pretty identical to their own in space of possible minds. Plus they can make things with the minds of animals by copying a existing animal mind, with the degree of change from the template being probably limited by similarity to the user and sample size.

Given the obvious first thing to do is build containers to allow you to bring through larger objects. The users who are competent will probably quickly begin creating lots of copies of themselves. Which raises the question, how do they get their powers? If it's due to any intrinsic quality, then once they start copying themselves they can have exponential clone growth. Of course given the powers seem to have granted by an alien god it may be a one off thing.

Still even if only one fork gets powers once you have a container, you can probably create multiple clones every minute, quickly amassing an army. However if you can tamper with what kind of humanoid body and mind you make then you can probably do better by creating clones that are improvements on yourself.\\
Assuming you're limited by the narrow range of human minds and humanoid forms, you would still do quite well. You could just max out every attribute creating an army of totally loyal super charismatic, genius, super soldiers. Hell once you've made the first genius it would make sense for them to actually be in charge since they're more competent, you would then spend all your time just making what the smarter people told you to make.
