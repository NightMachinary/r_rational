There's a lot of question to be had here about how the manipulation works on the user's side. For instance they can presumably not just create grey goo preloaded with a GAI in the pocket dimension, so they presumably need a lot of details about how they're manipulating the matter. The problem is there's no clear place to draw the line here because pretty much everything is too complicated to actually hold the pattern in one's mind, so you /have/ to allow quite a lot of vagueness but it's hard to say how much.

As for the part about the transfer area needing to be enclosed, since it works with the imperfect seal of cupped hands (and the seal is formed by the outer layer of the skin which is dead cells) it ought to work if you weaved your hair into fabric then made larger structures with that.\\
A more detailed solution would probably involve using dead skin, hair, and maybe even blood cells; made into a plastic, then weaved into something like nylon.
