I don't know if it's munchkinry exactly, but I've been stuck on my limited teleportation plot and wondering - how would you game real world institutions so that you could reveal a superpower without ending up dissected or held by Secret Government Organisation TM? My protagonist can only teleport limited distances, so would be easy to imprison on a remote island or similar, and I've set her up so she can't just go home and hide, but maybe I've made it too hard for her cos now I''m stuck. Could you find a non-government scientist to convince? Or the European parliament or the UN? And in her position what would you be aiming for in the long run?
