How limited is the distance, how much can the teleporter carry, how often can the teleportation be performed, and does it require any specific equipment at the destination?

Goals:

- Public visibility. The more view the public has of your character, the harder it would be to disappear.
- Public credibility. You want to be having interviews with major newspapers, not tabloids. It needs to be something the becomes part of the background of how the world works, not something surprising.
- Socially acceptable role. You want the public to care about your character. Having a public that clamors for investigation would be the worst-case scenario. People accept what is normal, so you would want to choose a job that already exists. Courier jobs are accepted. Bank robberies, not so much.
- Detectability. The more detectable you are, the better. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, but you want your presence to be able to be excluded from crimes, or else your PR goes awful. If anybody on their cell phone can detect when you teleport (radio waves?) then it becomes easy to have anybody know that you weren't involved. If you do get imprisoned on a remote island, the public would still be able to find you. Last, it makes you useless for black ops, where plausible deniability would be key.

A good way to start would be with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Million_Dollar_Paranormal_Challenge][Paranormal Challenge]], for an immediate $1 million. This would be spread wildly enough that you'd start to get publicity and credibility, and could start having interviews with larger publications.

From here, you want to transition to being essential to some community. For example, if your average speed is high enough, being a courier. Delivering radioisotopes to hospitals would be a steady job, and gives a good PR boost for fighting cancer. Alternatively, with a sufficiently high carrying capacity, you could be the drive mechanism for a power plant. Lifting 1 ton of water by 100 meters provides 1 MJ of energy. Do this 500 times per day, and you have lifted enough water to run a small town's power plant, at a fraction of the cost of coal.
