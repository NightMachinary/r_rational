I'm assuming the Guardian does a certain amount of covering major political events; speeches and suchlike? If not, they certainly have contacts in major media houses who do.

The teleporter could try turning up in the audience of some political speech (or other event where news media will be present), and teleporting from one end of the crowd to the other in the background - while a news team is filming, of course. She can then provide evidence by asking the reporter to look at the original footage of that incident, and pointing out where and when the teleportation occurred.

This way, the camera handling and post-processing are all in the hands of people who have no motive to edit or manipulate the footage, and are likely known (at least by reputation, being in a similar field) to the reporter(s) she's trying to persuade.
