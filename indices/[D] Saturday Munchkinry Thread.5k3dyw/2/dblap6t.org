You discover that you can read the minds of the heads of state of the five permanent Security Council members; currently these people are Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Francois Hollande, and Elizabeth II. Once any of them cease to be head of state of their respective countries, you cease to be able to read that individual's mind, and start being able to read the mind of his or her successor. Your mindreading ability includes ability to see what they are currently thinking, the ability to examine their declarative memories (e.g. examine their recollection of what happened at their tenth birthday party, or what they saw in the memo they read an hour ago), and the ability to understand things or use skills they have via their implicit memories (e.g. the ability to speak their native language or any other languages they know, the ability to drive a car or ride a bicycle if they can drive a car or ride a bicycle, et cetera. Your ability to do these procedural memory-type things starts off at a somewhat lesser level of skill than the individual you're pulling the skill from, to reflect the fact that you're piggybacking off of their skill, although practice will allow you to develop your own independent skill at the thing in question.)

What do you do?
