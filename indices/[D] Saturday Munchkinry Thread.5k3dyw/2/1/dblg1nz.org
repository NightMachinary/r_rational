The most obvious leap would be to leak documents to gain favour with governments of your choice. The proof here would be in the veracity of the leaked documents, rather than being a crank claiming to have some odd ability.

But this is also pretty risky. It might be better to preserve autonomy, have lower personal risk and retain the ability to, eg., make documents public anonymously.

However, the most interesting actions would depend on what knowledge you can gleam that I don't already know the general shape of. The ability to preempt plots by the heads of state would matter a lot if it was beneficial to do so. But to make these decisions I'd need to know what plots those might be! I don't really care if it's just economic policy :P.

Obviously I'd also research into the cause, limits and manner of this ability. I'd get, at minimum, a CT scan, measures of fields (EM, gravity, etc.) around myself, an X-Ray, measures of latency of communication, and tests if anything blocks this ability, either physically or mentally (eg. tiredness, drugs). Given the question this probably won't be particularly revealing, but I wouldn't know that ahead of time.
