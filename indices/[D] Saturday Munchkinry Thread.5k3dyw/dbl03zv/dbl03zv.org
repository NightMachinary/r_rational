How to defeat a rational hivemind that can hijack the body of anyone it's ever touched? Victims cannot remember anything they do while hijacked, may be hijacked indefinitely, and may always be hijacked once compromised. A compromised person only compromises others by touching them if they are currently hijacked. The only tell that someone is hijacked is that they lack their real self's episodic memories. You do not know where on the planet the hivemind is, only that it exists. The hivemind knows that you exist, too, and also doesn't know where you are. The hivemind is only aware of the world through hijacked people; it can't see through the eyes of people who are merely compromised, though it knows whether they're still alive. The hivemind can only die if there are no living compromised or hijacked people.
