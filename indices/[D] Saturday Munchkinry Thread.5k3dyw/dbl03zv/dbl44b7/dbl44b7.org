I'm not really sure there's any way to prove to people in power that this a real threat without already being in power yourself, it would just be too hard to get anyone to take this seriously. Provided the hivemind doesn't do too many stupid things I don't see it being beatable, but having the non-episodic memories of hundreds or thousands makes incompetence unlikely.

Given I don't see you stopping this your best bet is probably to attempt to get into a dialogue with it given there's probably not to many competent people for it to communicate with who actually know the situation. Maybe try to figure out it's goals and make sure it takes over the world in the best possible way, without just hijacking everyone in the world.\\
There are after all a great deal of considerable utilitarian benefits to consolidating the world through world domination, provided you can actually effectively control things and aren't incompetent and/or malicious.
