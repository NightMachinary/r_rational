What is the role of the player in this scenario? Is the person an average joe, the absolute ruler of a country, or somewhere in-between?

How much general knowledge is there of the hivemind? Would an individual recognize a slight memory loss or unexpected physical contact as signs of infection? Seeing this on a scale from "unknown power with a population who believes it to be impossible" to "previously fought a war against the hivemind, and every schoolchild worldwide is given detailed instructions on how to respond".

Does the intellect of the hivemind increase with the number of people hijacked/compromised? Alternatively, is there a maximum number of people who could be hijacked simultaneously?

Are the goals of the hivemind known?

Is it required that at least one individual be hijacked for the hivemind to remain conscious? Phrased differently, if the hivemind no longer contains hijacked individuals, only compromised individuals, is the hivemind in an effectively comatose state, and are there any conditions that could "wake" it again?
