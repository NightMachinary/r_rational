The player is average and has no notable social power. The player is also the only person aware of the hivemind's existence. The hivemind's goals are unknown, but it's psychologically human, aside from its increased ability to multitask scaling with multiple hijacked bodies (reminiscent of Taylor in Worm).

If the hivemind only contains compromised individuals, and no hijacked individuals, it's still conscious, but it effectively has to "go in blind" - it has no new sensory data with which to decide which available people would be an optimal choice to hijack.
