This doesn't seem too hard, actually. The odds of victory are definitely stacked against us, but that just makes it interesting.

The biggest hurdle is the lack of general knowledge of the hivemind threat. For the first phase, this can, however, be ignored. The hivemind needs touch in order to spread, so the goal is to make physical contact taboo. I would do this by starting a plague. Get people to wear gloves, masks, etc, while in public, and close down those places where large groups of people gather. Perhaps even convince the public that this highly contagious illness causes memory loss as well.

The next step is to expose the hivemind. This requires laboratory examination of compromised specimens. Through random sampling, we can place people in scenarios where they have been instructed to behave contrary to the nature of the scenario. If the hivemind hijacks such an individual, it should become immediately obvious, and research can proceed from there in the normal manner. Of course, much of this is impossible without working with a trained team, and telling team members what we're doing risks informing the hivemind. We may be able to use compartmentalization to reduce the risk of the hivemind figuring out what we're up to. Even if the hivemind figures out what we're doing, it might not be able to stop us from exposing it anyways.

Once the hivemind is exposed and the touching taboo established, we're in a typical puppet masters scenario, and can proceed accordingly.
