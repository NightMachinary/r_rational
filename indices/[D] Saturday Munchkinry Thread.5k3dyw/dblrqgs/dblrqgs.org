Three abilities:

1. The ability to swap places with any object within 60 yards that weighs within 30lbs of you.

2. The ability to "transform" into any object/animal you have seen/can visualize and is your size or smaller. This specific transformation doesn't changes only your shape and appearance. (Turn into a sheet of steel, and you'll still be as vulnerable as a person.) The transformation ends as soon as someone hits you hard enough to bruise you badly. (Transforming into a bird doesn't let you fly because you'd weigh the same as when you originally transformed)

3. The ability to make up to 50 insubstantial clones of yourself. As soon as they get touched they disappear.

I'm looking for ways to make money, ways to fight, ways to get around. Anything advantageous.
