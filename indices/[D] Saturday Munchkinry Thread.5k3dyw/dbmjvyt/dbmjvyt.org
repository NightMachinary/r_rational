You have an unquantifiable amount of rocks.

They're contained in an infinite Bag of Holding that can't be taken from you without your consent, and have no effect on reality whatsoever while in the bag. No other items can fit in the Bag of Holding since it is already full of an unquantifiable amount of rocks. Nothing else magical exists in this setting, just an unquantifiable amount of rocks.
