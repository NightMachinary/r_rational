How does gravity work in such a scenario? Is the gravity inside the bag normalized to the surrounding gravity, or is it normalized to earth's gravity? If the latter, things will get pretty hairy pretty quickly, because the outward flow rate will probably be /huge/. If the former, the bag will probably go into a permanent supernovae (perhaps stopping when the sun is destroyed, I dunno). FYI, that is a VERY bad thing.

The rocks, of course, would not remain rocks. They would turn into superheated plasma. But then what? Does energy escape into the bag? If so the thermodynamics will be pretty damn odd. If not, how does the local sun physics react to a bunch of cold things spilling out?

OTOH, it's feasible that the bag would just float on the outer layer of the sun, because as a whole it's less dense than the rest of the sun. That might be the saving grace.
