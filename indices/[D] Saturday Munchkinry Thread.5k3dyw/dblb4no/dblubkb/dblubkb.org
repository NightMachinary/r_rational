Using a trusted confederate willing to slum it in an animal body, I make a ton of money performing feats that would be impossible for any actual animal.

From there, I can /probably/ get in touch with someone rich, who I can get under the hat at gunpoint. I put them into the body of some kind of animal (probably a tortoise because they live a long time, can't easily kill themselves, and can't escape simple enclosures) and put either myself or my trusted confederate into their body. I bleed them of money in untraceable ways that I presumably have time to learn about, then have them invite over a close friend of theirs who we can repeat the process with.

At some point I have enough money to keep my rich people in "treatment"; it's actually some docile animal in that person's body whose care and feeding is dealt with by hospital staff. The animals are kept at a different facility, where they're fed and cared for through some automated system that I can service myself.

The more I think about it, the really hard part of taking over the world is probably getting the world under the control of a small cabal of people, which is beyond the scope of this reply.
