Some nice ideas here, but I think you're skipping some steps. Bleeding significant amounts of money probably takes time, during which you need to somehow avoid suspicion on your stolen bodies. Not remembering any names, events or passwords will probably raise some alarms, even if the sudden change of personality did not.

Further, even a rich person probably can't get the president to wear a dangerous looking hat without the bodyguards getting grumpy. It doesn't seem particularly risk free to go about things this way, especially as the president-in-rich-guy's-body will probably need to be incapacitated. I assume, of course, that you are targeting him, because I'd think you'd need a /lot/ of rich people if you didn't have a position of direct power.
