  "Brains" refers to biological clusters of neurons that biologists (of our world, uncoerced) consider to be brains.

Transplant rejection issues?

  A brain may swap with itself, which does nothing.

What about a brain swapped with nothing?

#+begin_quote
  The process takes about 5 seconds, during which the swapped minds are effectively incapacitated. If the process is interrupted, both minds die.

For instances <5 seconds: "Fear isn't the mind killer, my Swapinator is!"

Presumably, a chain of deals gambit to get into the "best" body is the primary goal of the device namer. However, the supervillain "Brain Drain" has found their new favorite toy, using it to root out the corruption of the Academic Elites! Politely doffing your hat has never been so threatening!

Gasp! <Enter local hero's name here>, the Dean has eaten all the University's cheese, and there's a threatening note about lab rats, mazes and experimental ethics! Help us!

(There. That's the "Cut Lex Luthor a Check" option out of the way.)

edit: Also, you have technology that swaps "specific substance inside of another substance", can you generalize it? Heart surgery, for example? Or, maybe mining operations by swapping a small bit of gold in a rock with a gold vein in a mountain? Also, what happens when two things are vastly different sizes? Can fit massive brains into tiny skulls? Like, a whale and a hummingbird. Does this functions equivalent to teleportation technology? Maybe use bigger receivers and longer cable to swap people or cargo? If so, is the 5 seconds a feature of the length of the cable, or could a longer than 5 light second cable allow FTL signalling?
