Swapping with nothing is equivalent to an immediate interrupt: death.

Swapping seems to be entirely non-physical, and you don't actually remember how you came to acquire this device, so it's probably not possible for you yourself to reverse engineer it. You're pretty sure you've never heard of anyone else having one, though.

Brain size is entirely ignored here. Any mind can fit in any brain.

You don't know why it takes about 5 seconds, but it's pretty odd to assume it's breaking the speed of light without, you know, having proof. If you want to build a 1.5 billion metre wire to find out, go ahead, but it seems like a lot of work for little immediate reward.

I'm not sure what you're saying here.
