You have the Swappinator, a steampunk device with two bronze hat-like appendages, each connected to the main, rabbit-sized unit by thick coiled wires each about half a metre long.

Should you flip the lever on the main unit, the two largest brains under each of the hats swap their collective minds. How do you take over the world?

- "Brains" refers to biological clusters of neurons that biologists (of our world, uncoerced) consider to be brains.

- "Under" roughly encompases a 20cm diameter sphere below the hats. A brain does not need to be fully inside this sphere; as long as it touches, it counts.

- A brain may swap with itself, which does nothing.

- The process takes about 5 seconds, during which the swapped minds are effectively incapacitated. If the process is interrupted, both minds die.

- A mind can handle being transferred to any body, and its sensory input, to the extent that the original mind could. Your intelligence, memories and mental state are otherwise unchanged (though you may be weirded out). Physical restrictions on thought are bypassed; a human can swap with an insect, for example.

- Any physical damage to the brain you had before transferral no longer affects you, and any damage to the transferred-to brain now affects you, but lost memories and skills are not returned.
