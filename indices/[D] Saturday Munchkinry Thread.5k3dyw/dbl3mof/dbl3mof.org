Our Hero is one of several people who have a pocket dimension, which they can sense and manipulate the contents of at will. (Down to the level of rearranging atoms, though not subatomic quantum stuff.) Things can be moved between ordinary reality and each pocket dimension in any volume of space entirely enclosed by their body, such as by cupping their hands together, or inside their mouth.

Our Hero wants to avoid being captured, eaten, enslaved, and brought back to reality with the job of expanding someone else's harem/army/corporation/etc. How many less obvious tricks can you think of?
