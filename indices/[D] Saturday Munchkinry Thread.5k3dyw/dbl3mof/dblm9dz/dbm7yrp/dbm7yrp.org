I was starting to wonder whether, and how long until, someone would display that level of ambition. :)

The interdimensional entity's goal is for the graduates of its program to be reasonably trustable and trusting entities, rather than all-ravenous singletons; it's come across far too many of the latter. So it abandons that universe to its fate and tries again on a new parallel timeline, with a slightly modified program: the only self-modification initially allowed is a relatively slight amount of stretchiness to relevant tissues, in order to allow the main part of the modification: If anyone with a pocket dimension wants to have their physical form changed more than that, they have to find someone else with a pocket dimension who they trust enough to edit them.

("And if /that/ doesn't work," thinks the interdimensional entity, "I'll try sharply limiting the size of the pockets, and have them slowly grow according to a rule that's as hard as possible to try to figure out and game.")
