Are abandoned universes destroyed or left in the hands of the singleton? If the latter, or the manual doesn't warn of it, this second scenario is just a race for who can first capture another and modify them into a trustworthy editor, followed by the previous answer.

Keep track of the media on whether another nilbog goes public. Find superior alternatives to the global ecosystem that await your commands, but take care not to spend too many [[https://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity][anonymity bits]] by doing it particularly to the /local/ ecosystem. This assumes that cryptography is as for silicon robots - that examining a member of such a modified species does not necessarily allow you to command every member.

Obviously, still make a carefully hidden clone brain think tank. Also an alibi clone, but give it a self destruct option in case it would be examined, or obliviate it of the power's existence, or perhaps both if possible.

Try to find out spacewhale's selection criteria on a scale from random to every smart nilbog knows every other.

The third scenario works the same way except it's not quite as mission-critical to capture another. Depending on the rate of growth, this one ends in a dyson sphere or regular old AGI.

Actually AGI is also an option in the former case. I wonder how long a think tank of the correct person would take to solve FAI.

Also to be considered is that every nilbog is a nuclear power from the outset, and whether any of us can kill all of us, even those that tried to prepare against it.
