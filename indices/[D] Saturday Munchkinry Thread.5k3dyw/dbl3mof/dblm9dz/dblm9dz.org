What counts as your body? Can you regenerate, say, an arm, by taking the contents of your stomach to swell your shoulder until the tumor's large enough to be replaced (except for its outer skin) by a folded up arm?

So the obvious strategy is to turn air into explosives and mine into the Earth, growing until brute force is irrelevant, with my brain in the pocket dimension, and copies of that brain that I'll assume not to have the power thinking about how to defend against non-bruteforce angles.

Actually asap I need to also go for space travel so the competition can't get access to mass there, but there ain't no stealth in space so that might need to wait for the endgame. Figure out whether having the monopoly on the Earth's inside gives me space superiority, by being able to shoot down anyone that tries to launch. Too bad that contingency reveals me.

Do all these people get the power at the same time? This is a hard takeoff scenario, and whether there's a difference of a few minutes-hours determines whether all this competition stuff even needs to be thought about.

Edit: After a few minutes I also thought of the win condition: Assuming that no one went for space, burst out of the ground and mini-dyson-sphere the Earth, proceeding to replace the local laws of physics with my will.
