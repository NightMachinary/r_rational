The pocket dimension is my domain and the brain won't die if I don't tell it to, at least that's how I understood that. Of course there's going to be some careful experimentation first if the power doesn't come with a manual for that, but in a pinch I can envelop each brain in a body and either send nerve signals directly across the dimensional barrier or put >=1 decoy brains in charge of prime material plane operations.
