  how the manipulation works

A loose translation of the source material that inspired this SMT: "An interdimensional entity wants to create new entities it can relate to, so it put together a basic training program to start some simple three-dimensional life-forms on the path to learning how to edit realities, starting with a reasonable set of simple-to-use macros in small training spaces. Which allow for making catgirls, because apparently catgirls are an interdimensional constant."

So if Our Hero were to eat a mouse and sent it to their pocket dimension, along with sufficient random biomass, they could give a mental command to turn it into a catgirl, and end up with a catgirl with the memories, skills, and personality of a mouse. ... Be a bit hard to get it back to reality without turning it back into a mouse, though, without further trickery.

Mostly human organisms edited to have feline-like ears and tails, yes; computers with software that hasn't already been written, no.
