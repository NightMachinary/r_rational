What's left after you move an object to the pocket dimension? Is it just a vacuum?

Presumably your can also teleport /yourself/ to the pocket dimension, though you probably can't get back without help. At the least, this lets you escape pretty much any predicament if you're conscious, and doesn't require actual suicide. If there's another person elsewhere to get you out, this is basically a teleport out of danger. Plus, any trip there-and-back basically implies perfect healthcare. The same can be done for others.
