  What's left after you move an object to the pocket dimension? Is it just a vacuum?
#+end_quote

The process is safe enough for us three-dimensional matter-based beings - no sudden pressure-changes that would collapse important organs. Possibly the interdimensional entity was kind enough to fill the pockets with local atmosphere, and until the pocket-holders come up with tricks, sending something to the pocket simply swaps it with air from there.

  Presumably your can also teleport yourself to the pocket dimension
#+end_quote

True, but each individual's pocket is independent, so it's a one-way trip. Admittedly, it's a one-way trip to a universe where you're effectively omnipotent, but it's a relatively tiny place to spend eternity in.

  Plus, any trip there-and-back basically implies perfect healthcare. The same can be done for others.

Yep; that one's a perfectly legitimate trick. (For anyone you can either convince or force to hold still long enough to be engulfed by you.)
