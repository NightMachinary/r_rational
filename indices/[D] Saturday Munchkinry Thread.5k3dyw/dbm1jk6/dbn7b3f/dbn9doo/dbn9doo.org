Nice idea. Broomstick combat just makes it harder to aim for both sides, resulting in dice rolls. Being able to cast 3 spells for 2 in this regard is an advantage.

If I can steal a broomstick, I'll try it. (Diagon Alley has been suffering from a zombie outbreak for at least since 2007, so can't buy it there.)
