There is a Harry Potter-inspired text RPG I play. Not English, so can't link the ruleset here.

GM will reward me with XP for each three new features of a spell or a potion I discover. Only positive knowledge (what it can do) counts, not negative (what it can't do).

Here's one that looks promising:

Potion of Levitation

Properties: violet liquid, tastes like apple-carrot juice with garlic

Effect: the character can levitate for 10 turns. In combat, he gets +1 action because of the acceleration.

Duration: 10 turns, starting from the turn when potion was drunk.

Counteraction: slowing spells (Impedimenta, Fatigo, Immobulus) stop levitation and the character has 2 actions per turn. (Two of those spells by default do -1 action, resulting in only 1 allowed action).

Brewing details: skipped

Side effect: -5 health-stamina (for scale, lvl 1 has 25, and a lvl3 like me -- which is the average -- has 45) for the duration. If the character has drunk a potion before the combat and it's effects are still active, you cannot drink this potion.

It's incompatible with water breathing potion, results in poisoning.

For context: in combat, each turn consists or two actions.[[#s][Unnecessary combat system details]]

The question: design the experimental set. My char has some money, I have 2 of the potions and I guess can get 5 or so before DM will say that the shop is out of stock for me.

And before you ask: yes, there is a height limitation -- tested already. It's not even that high, but enough to get out of physical reach - however, ranged physical attacks are a thing.
