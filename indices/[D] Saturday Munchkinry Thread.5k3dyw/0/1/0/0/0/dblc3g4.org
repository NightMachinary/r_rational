This is exactly what I would do as the hivemind.

It might be more fair if the player gets some special power and/or gadgets which allow them to

1: identify whether someone is compromised regardless of whether they're currently hijacked

2: uncompromise someone without having to murder them

Even then, in a world with billions of people in it, there's no realistic way to find everyone. There needs to be some sort of limitations, like maybe there is only one town or city where it can use its power and it has some goal there it's trying to accomplish.
