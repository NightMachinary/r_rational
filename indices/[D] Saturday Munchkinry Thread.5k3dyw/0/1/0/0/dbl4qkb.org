In this case, I'm not sure if there would be any way to stop it. No matter what the goal of the hivemind, flexibility and number of compromised individuals would be an asset.

- Remain blind the majority of the time.
- Briefly hijack a person to see their surroundings. Nobody remembers everything they are doing at every moment, and so this would not be noticed even if somebody has knowledge of the hivemind.
- If another person is near them, hijack again, then compromise by touching them. Otherwise, repeat again in an hour.
- Once a sufficient percent of the population has been taken over, hijack everybody and forcibly touch everybody remaining.

The hivemind would effectively be modeling itself as an infectious disease with no cure, next to no symptoms, and a very high infection rate. The only way to prevent this would be with a short-term goal, which would require the hivemind to reveal itself.
