The hivemind wins (by controlling over 90% of people) within three months, no matter what you do.

Losing episodic memory is only obvious to people who have some reason to know you, and you generally wouldn't stop them from touching you.

Let's say that the hovemind starts as one person in rural China. Hour 1 has their entire family hijacked. They visit neighbors and get everyone in the village by the end of the first day. Since they are all the hivemind, they act "normal" again despite being hijacked. A few go to each of the neighboring cities over the course of a week, infect a couple ticket handlers or something, and hijack them the next shift. They then infect and hijack busfuls or planefuls of people, who infect entire offices/schools/airports.

Once they are in every airport (including hijacking the employees) they take over cities in the same way, including the media. With no outcry or publicity (except for a few crazies who are quickly silenced) they take over the main functions of society, and then take over towns, farms, etc. very quickly.

You're pretty much screwed.
