/(Other important things to ask would be: 1. how long is this hivemind's lifespan, 2. can it reproduce, etc. For instance, if it can live from centuries to millennia then it doesn't even have to switch to possession mode only for short periods to not be discovered --- it can start compromising babies, and keep them hijacked right until they die from old age; compromising all the new babies it comes in contact with in process as well. Eventually it will have agents in pretty much most, if not all, important governmental positions.)/

Well, depending on the information I have regarding this hivemind's personality and the behaviour it displays, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_for_Lya_%28novella%29][I may actually decide to aid it at conquering the world]] (or just not act against it, if it doesn't need my help). It would likely be in its own interests to be a benevolent dictator, and a benevolent and wise dictator would likely do much less harm to this planet's ecosystem and human civilisation in general compared to regular modern governments.

If I /have/ to somehow defeat it for some reason, however, I think I'd choose doing some of these:

- /(how much do I know about this hive mind, its current activities, its origin, etc? How do I know all this stuff?)/ Sell most of the property I own, anonymously hire a ghost writer and a PR agent, and weave all my unique knowledge about this creature into the produced book series. Some fans will go investigating its existence for fun and may accidentally discover some of its agents. And even if they don't, the story will still be useful to the general population once the hivemind /does/ eventually come out of the bag.
- 1. share my knowledge about this creature with someone crazy enough to believe it and clever enough to fight against it if I end up dead. 2. Try to make contact with it and establish myself as its supporter → gain its trust → 2.1. gain definite evidence about its existence and capabilities → simultaneously send that information to as many relevant representatives of different governments as possible, 2.2. find out where its core is located → try destroying it.
- try figuring out how it's communicating with its puppets, detect the signal, and triangulate its location.
- try hiring a group of hackers\software engineers to steal and analyse CCTV footage. Maybe hijacked bodies walk funny or behave funny, and that helps us find them. This will either show us where they are more prevalent or just help us find some individual compromised\hijacked people for surveillance, data mining, and research.
- if the hivemind is psychologically human, then maybe once it /was/ a regular human, and somehow managed to gain these new transformative abilities. In which case I'll try investigating how that was possible and replicate the effect on myself. One hivemind v.s. another would be a more adventageous battle to me, especially if the other hivemind doesn't know yet about my existence.
- start a cult of believers in its existence, write a Bible-like manual that's listing how to avoid getting compromised yourself (e.g. no personal contact with other people, staying away from places of high population density, a bunch of security measures, as much anonimity as possible, cell/chain-of-command structure, conspiracy of our own, etc). Though if all other options fail, this will be one miserable walkthrough by the time the hivemind takes over the majority of the world. This could be used for one of those crappy “prologue” chapters for time travel stories though.
