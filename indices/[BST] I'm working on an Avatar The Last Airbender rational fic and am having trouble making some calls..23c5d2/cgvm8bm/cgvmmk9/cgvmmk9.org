  Perhaps the focus of their scientific development could primarily be philosophy oriented cognitive sciences? And maybe some advances in aerodynamics, to complement their bending. It wouldn't be too much of a deviation and be very believable coming from their society.

Basically what I was thinking. They like passive and largely introspective sciences like cog sci (also I'm majoring in it, so it's kind of an area of expertise for me). I was toying with the idea of Air Nomad aerodynamics giving the Fire Nation some form of gun, but I don't know about that one. I know that the lack of guns in the original series is just to duck under ratings for violence, but there's something otherworldly about the lack of firearms. Even if this is going to be hard fantasy, I want it to be hard /high/ fantasy.

  I love this idea. Perhaps instead of genocide he integrated the small proportion of surviving air nomads -- like the very young and disabled (limbs broken -- no bending), into Fire Nation itself? They are a resource which would not make sense to permanently lose. You could make a whole exploration on their lives in captivity - forced to work for the Fire Nation industry and researchers, being useful enough that they can have semblance of as normal of a life they can in an existence at the bottom of the pyramid.

That's gross and horrible and I love it.

  I say, make her a runaway like in the show. But change her reasons for running away -- to escape, disgusted of the mindless life of tradition. Some major conflict that sets her on the course of her path as a rationalist. But do make her a very different kind of rationalist than Aang. Maybe also something about her blindness leading her to gaining insight on the truer nature of bending thrown in.

I like that idea. It works well in compliment with the idea I posted elsewhere in this thread about her being a notorious theif instead of a pro wrestler. She's just an anarchist trying to fuck up the system because she lacks the insight to see (no pun intended) beyond the dichotomy of things working as they are and thinks breaking. Until Aang and friends show up.

  As for the others, it might be best to model Katara similar to Korra in writingathing's work. Cut off from the world at its edge, meeting Aang setting off the spark for a burning desire to understand the world. Sokka could be something of a budding engineer. A lifetime of hunting giving him uncanny insights as a tactician.
#+end_quote

I like that thinking. It works well with how they fit into the discourse scheme I'm setting up with Sokka as the cynic and representative of wartime mentality, and Katara as the compassionate post-enlightenment thinker.

#+begin_quote
  So looking forward to the first chapter -- what is your progress writing wise so far?
#+end_quote

I have about eight pages rough. The trouble is that I have to set up characters /and/ set up the world /and/ settle into a writing style /and/ make it entertaining. Also, I'm writing the first three chapters (equivalent to the first three episodes) before I start posting them, although I'm going to post the first chapter for some peer review as soon as I have all the gaps filled in.

  Edit: Please, please let the spirits be extra-dimensional alien entities that can manipulate matter on a fundamental level, following different laws of physics.. And change their behavior and interactions accordingly D:
#+end_quote

Sorry, doesn't jive with the way I've set up the universe. The Spirit World is a parallel universe made out of a fundamentally different type of matter with fundamentally different laws of physics. If you've read Dr. McNinja, it's a bit like the difference between McNinja's world and the Radical Lands. One is just a more exaggerated version of what the other is relative to us. That is, the changes in physics between this universe and the Material World of the Avatar universe are comparable to those between the Material World and Spirit World. The Spirit World's weird physics, however, alter the Material World in a way that makes bending possible.
