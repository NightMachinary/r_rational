Yes! Yes! Yesss! We can never have enough of Avatar fanfiction -- much less a rational/dc one :D

Off the top of my head, what I can see..

#+begin_quote
  "The most basic change I'm making is to the Air Nomads. In canon, they're all about spirituality. I'm going to change that to science."
#+end_quote

Perhaps the focus of their scientific development could primarily be philosophy oriented cognitive sciences? And maybe some advances in aerodynamics, to complement their bending. It wouldn't be too much of a deviation and be very believable coming from their society.

#+begin_quote
  "In canon, Sozin destroyed the Air Nomads totally, and let their culture die with them. His descendants were responsible for industrializing the Fire Nation in order to fuel their war machine." "..My Sozin has the advantage of conquering an Air Nomad population which is very knowledgable. He is able to take this knowledge, much of which the Air Nomads had been reluctant to share with the world, and integrate it into the Fire Nation."
#+end_quote

I love this idea. Perhaps instead of genocide he integrated the small proportion of surviving air nomads -- like the very young and disabled (limbs broken -- no bending), into Fire Nation itself? They are a resource which would not make sense to permanently lose. You could make a whole exploration on their lives in captivity - forced to work for the Fire Nation industry and researchers, being useful enough that they can have semblance of as normal of a life they can in an existence at the bottom of the pyramid.

  “And my third problem, for those of you who have watched the show, what the fuck am I going to do with Toph?”
#+end_quote

I say, make her a runaway like in the show. But change her reasons for running away -- to escape, disgusted of the mindless life of tradition. Some major conflict that sets her on the course of her path as a rationalist. But do make her a very different kind of rationalist than Aang. Maybe also something about her blindness leading her to gaining insight on the truer nature of bending thrown in.

As for the others, it might be best to model Katara similar to Korra in writingathing's work. Cut off from the world at its edge, meeting Aang setting off the spark for a burning desire to understand the world. Sokka could be something of a budding engineer. A lifetime of hunting giving him uncanny insights as a tactician.

So looking forward to the first chapter -- what is your progress writing wise so far?

Edit: Please, please let the spirits be extra-dimensional alien entities that can manipulate matter on a fundamental level, following different laws of physics.. And change their behavior and interactions accordingly D:
