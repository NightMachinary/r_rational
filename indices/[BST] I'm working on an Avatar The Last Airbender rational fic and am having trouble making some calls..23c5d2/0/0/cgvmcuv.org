I accidentally closed this tab while I was typing up my response, so I'm going to summarize a bit.

Aang is more or less the same person as in canon, but with better critical thinking ability (he still has spiritual depth, since that is a hugely practical skill in his world) and instead of having a false image of himself as some nature-child who the beasts of the Earth naturally flock to, he has a false image of himself as an Ender Wiggins archetype.

Sokka is the cynic and wartime-mentality representative of the group to Katara's post-enlightenment feminists and Aang's critical utilitarian. Aang and Sokka, and Katara and Sokka butt heads a lot over the proper use of violence. Since Aang is essentially his universe's Ghandi, and Sokka is his universe's Che Guevara, it is to be expected.

Iroh and Pathik are going to both be heavily rationalized, with Iroh being the "soft rationalist", someone who is rational and uses that to go about a pleasant life and help people when possible, and Guru Pathik being the "hard rationalist", someone who dedicates all of their time to optimizing what they believe to be the ultimate utility function. Also Iroh is wrapped up in multiple layers of false personas in order to play the game of thrones in the Fire Nation.

The rest of the White Lotus I don't know about. Pakku definitely isn't that rational, but I have time to figure that one out. He seems like an oddball anyway, since the other Lotus members are about as rational as one could expect. And of course there are various other characters who are highly intelligent, with various motivations and desires which might not be in line with those of our heroes.

As for Toph, she is never really a moral entity in the show. While everyone else's motivations are very clearly explored, she's just kind of there. Is she doing it out of loyalty to the Earth Kingdom? Personal attachment to her friends? Vendettas against her enemies? Is she trying to prover herself? Is she trying to help people? Does she want moral justification to engage in violence for pleasure? It's really never explained. Even in the episode in which she joins up, it is left ambiguous as to whether she is motivated by a desire for freedom, a debt to Aang and co., or a moral decision. And from that point onward it's just kind of assumed she's one of the good guys.

If I'm writing what will essentially be a book series (if I ever get through the whole thing) about moral dilemmas, how do I deal with a major character without an explicit moral identity?

Edit: I should probably mention a few of the ideas I had for Toph. I think I'm going to have to give her some specific moral identity, but I'm unsure about the one I'm thinking of. Basically, fuck the professional wrestling. That is not what my story needs. I'm playing up the double identity she has. The Blind Bandit is an infamous earthbending thief in the Gaoling region. She seems to be a small child and wears a mask which covers her eyes completely. She targets high-profile caravans carrying large amounts of valuable materials. These caravans are heavily guarded, but she specializes in incapacitating large groups. As savvy readers may have suspected, she primarily targets the wealthy Beifong family, which controls more than three quarters of the wealth in the area.

(For those of you unfamiliar with the show, Toph is a wealthy heiress of the Beifong family. In canon, the Blind Bandit is her underground fighting alter-ego, but I'm making her a career criminal because it's more interesting.)

I also want to play up that she is used to living the lap of luxury. It never struck me quite right that she leaves home and she's just constantly this badass. I know she ran away a lot, but it's unrealistic that she never misses being rich at all, even if it's just due to homesickness.
