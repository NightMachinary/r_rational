May I suggest that you include a bit of class privilege in her morality? Aang is used to living as a Nomad, and Sokka and katara are both from a water tribe that has had very little during the time they lived there. Toph can come from a place of ignorance where wealth and social constructs are concerned. It's not that she is a bad rationalist; it's just that she is not aware of the huge influence of class on a very fundamental level. That said, she has to deal with privilege in another way too; where nobody really understands what it is like to be blind.

She could also be a moral perfectionist, not taking into account the practical sides in moral dilemmas because she is not used to families lacking resources (time and money) to solve these problems.
