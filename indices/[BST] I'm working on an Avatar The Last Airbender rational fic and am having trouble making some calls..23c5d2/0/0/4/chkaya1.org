Couple of ideas/suggestions: I would see Toph as more of the empiricist/pragmatist/utilitarian and aang as more of the pakku type oddball, that is making decisions based on some utility function he believes to be globally optimal, but making mistakes sometimes in practical cases leading him to lose.

As for the moral dilemmas and arguments about them, I would expect katara to play the devils advocate more often than not.. While sokka being the quickest to find flaws in a plan/argument..

Iroh/pathik roles seem to fit what you have decided on writing. I also wonder what or how you're planning to incorporate his firebending masters/skill acquistion.. I tend to think of a zen-esque enlightenment story, perhaps one with less speech/thought , but a set of actions and reactions.

Clearly the Hama/blood bender would fit in nicely with some Dark rationality techniques. and a lesson against the dangers they create.

I can't think of how to fit that firebending master aang tried to learn but was turned away though..

Please post the chapters as soon as you write :-) .. would love to read.. happy to proofread too. :)
