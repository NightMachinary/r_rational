  I'm playing up the double identity she has. The Blind Bandit is an infamous earthbending thief in the Gaoling region. She seems to be a small child and wears a mask which covers her eyes completely.

This doesn't particularly make sense to me: the Bandit being so obviously blind would make the "Double identity" kind of flimsy, and no matter how aloof or clumsy she might act at home, there can only be so many blind earthbending girls in the area.

I do like the idea of a "robin hood" Toph though, exploring ideas of social justice: just not sure how she can live that double life without making it obvious who she is.

More discussion of how to handle Toph here:
