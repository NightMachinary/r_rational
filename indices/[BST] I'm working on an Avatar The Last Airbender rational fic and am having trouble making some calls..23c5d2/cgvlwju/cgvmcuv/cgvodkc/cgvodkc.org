I don't really know a lot about writing but I love reading so my input might not be all that useful. It sounds like a good plan for your charachters and it's all going to be an AU story anyway so changing Toph works as long as you make her believable as a charachter.

I've heard that the thing to do is to plan charachter out ahead so you know what they would do in a given situation, that's probably a pretty basic technique but hopefully useful. Making the Blind bandit an actual bandit sounds really appropriate, I like it. I think the show could have made a bigger deal about her wanting to be accepted for who she really is, something to work with perhaps?
