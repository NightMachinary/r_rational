This sounds really interesting and I would love to read it. I'm just wondering if Aang will have the same playfull nature from the show. Will he use rational methods for playing pranks on people or something? In the show Sokka was the skeptic and (when the writers felt like it) the voice of reason, sometimes even to cynical of certain things. The interaction between him and Aang would be pretty different if they start with similar mindsets from the get go.

The conversion from spiritual lessons to critical thinking lessons could be more of a blend where the wise old men have some good ideas but Aang has to sift through spiritual woo in order to learn something useful maybe even teach the teacher something new.

BTW what's the problem with Toph?
