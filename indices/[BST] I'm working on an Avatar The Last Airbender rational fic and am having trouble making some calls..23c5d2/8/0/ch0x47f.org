(Upon review of what I just wrote: this post ended up being just a touch longer than I planned.)

That sounds interesting and I think I'll give it a read. At the same time, I already have a lot of the cultural background figured out, and it's a bit different than that. Primarily, the four nations are less homogenous.

The Earth Kingdom, for example, spend millennia as a continent of feudal city states, and is traditional enough that, although it federated under Ba Sing Se over a thousand years ago, each state or tribe of the Earth Kingdom retains its traditional values. This is extremely visible while traveling the Earth Kingdom, with the notable exception of the parts of the west coast that have been conquered by the Fire Nation for long enough that their culture is becoming predominantly Fire Nation.

Other than that, we have Omashu, which is an insular and proud city which is powerful enough to retain more independence than any other state under Ba Sing Se. It is filled with scholarship and high culture, and prides itself on the eccentricities of its social order and government, much like ancient Athens.

The southern Earth Kingdom is far from the war, and tends to be far from all but the furthest reaching wars. Even during the feudal period of the Earth Kingdom, not much fighting tended to happen down there. As a result of this safety and of the fertile plains of the region, there exists a highly mercantile and agrarian way of life. The aristocracy here is not those who could best defend the land, but those who control most of it though trade. The gap between the rich and poor is higher here than anywhere in the Earth Kingdom other than Ba Sing Se itself.

The northwestern EK, on the other hand, is highly cooperative and egalitarian. This is largely a result of Taku, the city which historically controlled the region. Taku was a highly spiritual and highly cosmopolitan city which enticed the surrounding area with its great prosperity, having an ideal location for commerce. Its culture of faith and cooperation spread quickly and now, even though Taku was destroyed early in the war, those areas are colored by that spirit.

There was once a highly spiritual and scholarly civilization in the southeast, but it was destroyed some centuries ago by one of the few wars to reach that remote and isolated area. The already scarce population of the Si Wong desert and surrounding areas was further depleted by the economic havoc wreaked by the war. Now all that's left there are the fringes of society. Scavengers, bandits, bounty hunters, vagabonds, and the like.

Before Ba Sing Se, the plains of the northeastern EK were largely farmland. Walls and moats were not the way to go militaristically in this region, as a result of the flat land. The militaristic strategy that prevailed time and time again was mobility. As a result, shock troops and raiders on ostrich-horseback came to control the region, raiding any invading parties dry before they could reach populated areas. This came to an end when the walls of Ba Sing Se were risen.

Being briefer, the Water Tribes are more one culture. The Northern Water Tribe believes in tradition and in spirituality. They like slotting people into roles in society, and view themselves as "God's chosen people" in a sense (they are, of course, not monotheistic, or theistic at all). They are highly dismissive of outsiders' points of view, but their society is highly adaptable, and they can make themselves traders or conquerers or self-sufficient and isolated.

The Southern Water Tribe was a more progressive and cosmopolitan version of the NWT, largely as a result of their greater interaction with the rest of the world. The Southern Water Tribe is a colony of its northern sister, which is essentially independent, but is one nation in name. About fifty years into the war, the SWT was all but destroyed, leaving only some small villages. They maintain their status as a sister to the Northerner tribe, but, again, in name only.

The Fire Nation's culture is very different now than it was before Sozin's rule. It is an academic culture, based around an aristocracy that is educated, moneyed, and powerful, and the lower classes upon which that aristocracy sits. The aristocrats value personal greatness above all else, while the lower classes have the more traditional values of the Fire Nation.
