As for the latter, what I mean is that the canon story already engages in many of the principles of rational storytelling. Generally the primary conflict of a story will be mental, challenging the hero to either outthink the villain or to determine the right thing to do. Their physical power comes into play, but only as a means of executing their ideas. Much of the show consists of a discourse about various topics, ranging from morality (especially to what degree the ends justify the means), to social issues, to dealing with one's own psychology. Also, no one ever hands the hero the answer. They have to figure it out for themselves, even if there is another agent pushing them in the right direction.

Basically one could approximate rational fiction by substituting the wishy-washy terminology used in the original with something that means the same thing but is less ambiguous. I don't want to do that, though. I want to tell a different story that is fully rational, which, to me, means that I have to change a lot of it and make it significantly /more/ about those intellectual discourses. A the same time, the original was very real, and concerned itself with real problems that exist and that many people deal with. I want to make sure I do this as well, both addressing personal internal struggles, and larger social conflicts, rather than keeping my discussions to lofty philosophical ideas.
