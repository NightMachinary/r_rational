Regarding Toph I have, since typing up the OP last night, been considering her being the outsider and devil's advocate, playing into her distaste for the values of her society. If she starts from a position of rejecting society and doing what she can to break it, she can then move into a position of rejecting society in its current form and doing what she can to change it and resist it. The sheer difference in the way she experiences the world can be another aspect of her outsider identity. There are very few people who will ever come close to having similar sensory capabilities to her, and she will never have the sensory capabilities the rest of the world takes for granted. So even when the situation isn't about social values she is always going to be in a different position from everyone else.

As for her maintaining a secret identity as the Blind Bandit, it's helped by several elements. First, no one has seen both the Blind Bandit and Toph Beifong, since the Blind Bandit only interacts with mercenaries and merchants, the likes of which would never be allowed beyond the public rooms of the Beifong household (where Toph never goes). Second, it's not known whether the Blind Bandit is /actually/ blind. She wears a blindfold, but that might just be a ruse, and most people think it is, since the Blind Bandit is a much better fighter than it is reasonable to expect a blind child to be. Of course the real reason Toph wears a blindfold is to hide her extremely recognizable deformed eyes. Basically both of these things play up the fact that anyone describing the Blind Bandit would say "she was very small, wore mud-caked clothes and a blindfold, and kicked our asses", to which no one in their right mind would respond "hey Lao, that sounds like your sick kid; she's small and can't see either".

Which brings me to the third element that hides Toph's identity: something I'm going to call the Superman principle. So Superman and Clark Kent look exactly the same, plus or minus rumpled clothes, some hair-gel, and a pair of inch-thick glasses. Why does no one point that out? Well, I have a professor who looks kind of like Mark Ruffalo, but no one would every suggest that he's secretly a movie star on the weekends. There's no reason to suspect that Superman is anyone but Superman and that the resemblance between him and Kent is anything but a random coincidence.

Similarly, to the people in her world, who do not have "masked adventurers" as a cultural staple, the Blind Bandit is /just/ the blind bandit. None of them would suspect that she secretly lives among the aristocracy when she's not holding up caravans. She looks like she lives in the woods, there are loads of orphans and other homeless children living in the woods, so she's some homeless kid living in the woods. Even if she is blind, it's not like blindness is that rare. There are plenty of blind children, and it's more likely that this homeless-looking master earthbender is someone other than the coincidentally also blind but frail and unskilled Beifong heiress. Heck, it's more likely she has some way to see through the blindfold and isn't actually blind at all than that it's Toph.
