  There are very few people who will ever come close to having similar sensory capabilities to her, and she will never have the sensory capabilities the rest of the world takes for granted. So even when the situation isn't about social values she is always going to be in a different position from everyone else.

Right: it's the perfect niche for her to fill.

  Well, I have a professor who looks kind of like Mark Ruffalo, but no one would every suggest that he's secretly a movie star on the weekends. There's no reason to suspect that Superman is anyone but Superman and that the resemblance between him and Kent is anything but a random coincidence.

That's probably because "looks kind of like" and "looks exactly like" are two different things :) Generally speaking, identical twins are very rare, but they do happen, and it's accepted because we understand genetics. For two complete strangers to look exactly alike, the suspensions of disbelief is under much larger strain.

That said, this only really applies to Lois Lane, who gets to regularly see both Clark and Superman up close. The average person would have no reason to suspect that they're one, which is why this:

  First, no one has seen both the Blind Bandit and Toph Beifong, since the Blind Bandit only interacts with mercenaries and merchants, the likes of which would never be allowed beyond the public rooms of the Beifong household (where Toph never goes).

Is a much better argument.

I would say that the best way to really drive this home is simply not have anyone but the immediate family KNOW that she's an earthbender at all. If most people just know her as "she's just their sick daughter," that goes a long way toward helping keep her secret identity, even before this:

  Second, it's not known whether the Blind Bandit is actually blind... Heck, it's more likely she has some way to see through the blindfold and isn't actually blind at all than that it's Toph.
#+end_quote

Which is another good argument.

As originally framed, it seemed like too much to ask that the blind earthbending daughter of a rich family wouldn't be suspected to be the same person as the blind earthbending girl burglarizing her family's caravans, but you're right, it can be done with the following points established:

1) It's not quite clear that the blind bandit is blind (better to just call her the "bandanna bandit," as it would seem she's just wearing it to cover her face), or even a girl at that

And

2) Virtually no one outside of Toph's immediate family sees her, let alone knows she's an earthbender.

There being a large presence of young orphan earthbender streetrats works well too, and serves as a good place for Toph to have learned her "rougher" mannerisms.
