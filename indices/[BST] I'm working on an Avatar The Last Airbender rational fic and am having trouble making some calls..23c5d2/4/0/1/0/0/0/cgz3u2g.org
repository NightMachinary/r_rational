First, I am glad that people are bringing these problems up because it forces me to come up with solutions, either by removing elements, adding elements, or clarifying the reason why something would or wouldn't happen. It's important to think about these things in such a critical manner when writing realistically like this because the real world is much better at ferreting out problems with a plan than people brainstorming are. The one thing you have to be careful of, though, is that often the characters have not put so much thought into their actions, so it is realistic for someone to use a flawed plan, as long as the consequences are realistic.

As for age and how they will react to things, they are all prepared to experience violence by their various backgrounds, but those backgrounds will also cause behaviors that are unlike those of children in a society like ours. They will still behave in similar ways most of the time, but their reactions violence and war and hardship will be vastly, and sometimes shockingly, different. This, I think, is fairly realistic, and is also convenient for me as a writer. The real issue comes up when the characters, for the first time, are responsible for a problem. That is, when they are turned to to solve a dilemma but they are unable and people are hurt because of it, the problems will begin.
