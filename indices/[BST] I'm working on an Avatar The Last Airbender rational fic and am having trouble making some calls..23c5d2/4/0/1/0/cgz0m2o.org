Firstly you're assuming that Toph intentionally constructed this persona. I haven't decided yet, but it's very possible that she didn't put any planning into it. Heck, she might have even initiated her first heist in a heat-of-passion type event. Even if she did plan it all out, she might not have given herself that alias. How would she know people would name her if she didn't name herself?

As for the voice thing, once again, no one who has seen Toph would ever see the Blind Bandit. Toph can count all of the humans she's met in person out-of-costume on her fingers and toes, and is entirely capable of making sure she doesn't meet them as the Bandit. In addition, this is a time without audio recording, so no problem there. Also, attitude has a big effect (and /is/ a big affect, haha psychology puns), especially in a society so wrapped up in social roles and how you should act to different people. Toph is almost always demure and hushed. The Blind Bandit is almost always angry and dominating.

Also, regarding Superman: I am aware that his secret identity has plot armor, but why would the writers not think to give him a better disguise that that originally? It's because, at the time it was written, no one knew about secret identities. Now "superhero" and "secret identify" are inextricably linked, but then, in Superman's world and this one, they were not.
