  Which brings me to the third element that hides Toph's identity: something I'm going to call the Superman principle. So Superman and Clark Kent look exactly the same, plus or minus rumpled clothes, some hair-gel, and a pair of inch-thick glasses. Why does no one point that out?

I feel obliged to point out that the actual reason is that it would be inconvenient for him to be recognized, so the writers assert that he isn't. Whether the excuse for why that happens is believable or not is another matter entirely. Personally, I think it isn't believable.

I think it might be a good idea for you to change the alias so that it doesn't even mention blindness. Why take an alias that exposes one of your weaknesses, even if you believe no one will consider it to be an actual weakness? Why take the unnecessary risk?

Edit: Also, I find it hard to take seriously disguises that don't take into account disguising the voice somehow. It's possible to recognize people by voice alone, so how would a costume prevent that? Sure, Toph could rely upon no one who she interacts with out of disguise to hear her speak as the Bandit persona, but that seems risky. Maybe she could pretend to be mute, or at least unwilling to speak, rather than blind?
