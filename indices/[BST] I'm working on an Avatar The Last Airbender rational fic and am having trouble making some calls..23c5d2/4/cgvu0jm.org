I'm really excited about this: the way you describe the changes you have in mind sound great. Avatar was actually one of my top considerations for what to write a rationalfic about before I ultimately decided on Pokemon: if you have any additional questions you want to discuss in more depth, feel free to shoot me a PM whenever.

As to your questions:

  what the fuck am I going to do with Toph?

In my Pokemon rational!fic, I want every major protagonist to bring some aspect of rationality to the world: they may not all start there, but their perspectives are based off of rational principles.

For example, Red is the "learned rationalist," who has studied extensively and thought critically about ideas, even if he's not as prepared to put those ideas into practice right away.

Blue is all about "experimentation" (even if he doesn't call it that) and values observation and results, though without a rationalist foundation he's going to initially be prone to biases and errors.

Leaf is the outside perspective, the character most suited to questioning everything and approaching a problem from a virtually unbiased perspective. She will serve as a great devil's advocate for any idea, and is best suited to ask the questions that others wouldn't think to ask.

So, back to your fic: what you do with Toph has a lot to do with what you do with the other characters. In another post you detailed these, and they look pretty good so far.

Personal recommendation for a niche Toph can fill: Toph's blindness makes her unique in regards to what it means to "prove" something. The common adage, "seeing is believing," doesn't apply to her the way it does everyone else, because she has her own way of sensing things: the idea of deducing the existence of something she can't sense is paramount when you're missing something as central to people's daily lives as sight.

For example, she knows better than anyone that there are some things that exist even if she can't detect them: facial expressions, for one thing. A bird flying overhead. The passage of time: it might get cooler if she's outdoors, but if she's inside, it's not like she can look out the window and notice daylight fading. And the whole idea of clouds and stars and the moon, to her, are as alien of concepts as anything: they're purely visual phenomenon to us here on earth, so how does she conceive of them and accept their existence without simply trusting the masses that tell her they exist? The masses might also tell her X god exists, that doesn't necessarily mean they do.

  the biggest problem I foresee is that conversion of the tradition-oriented, highly spiritualistic, fortune-cookie-esque ideals of the original show into the critical-thought-oriented, highly humanist, university undergrad circlejerk-esque ideals that I'm looking for. Ultimately they are similar ideas, but I don't want them to be too similar, or else I'm just rewriting the show with some science flavor instead of making it fundamentally rational at the core.

Could you expand on this, maybe give an example of what you mean? I'm not sure what you mean by them being similar.
