A few good quotes from the Embers author's notes. Basically he's incredibly observant of things that are things and things that are not things. I'm tired. Quotes.

  Even so, even when a group is hated, it takes a lot to start a genocide. There is one common theme in real-life genocides: the perpetrators believe they are the victims. No matter how evil and all-powerful Sozin was, in order to make canon events match up with what we know from real life, certain things had to happen. Events had to work out such that the vast majority of the Fire Nation believed that 1) they'd been horribly betrayed, 2) the Air Nomads were responsible, and 3) unless they did something drastic, it would happen again.

  Given Zuko's usual paranoia, I imagine the first thing he thought on seeing just one teenager to guard a village hosting the Avatar was, "trap". Obviously, Sokka was a decoy to get him into position for someone (or several someones) much, much more dangerous. And given Zuko's experience with Li and Lo - yes, Gran-Gran does look like a viable threat.

  And in a sense, she may have been much more damaging than anyone realized. According to "The Puppetmaster", Hama's best friend was Kanna. And Hama's idea of proper behavior (admittedly, after breaking out of years of abuse in a Fire Nation prison) is to use her waterbending to torture, and - it's implied, at least - murder innocent Fire Nation civilians. So, if she thinks that's okay... what are the odds Kanna shares some of that attitude? Especially toward the people who took away every waterbender in her adoptive tribe, and murdered her daughter-in-law? Put that together with what Gran-Gran says in the second episode, which ties Katara bringing her hope to her being a waterbender and destined to help the Avatar, not because of Katara herself... Houston, we have a problem.
