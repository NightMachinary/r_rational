Have you read Embers? It has a lot of good analysis on the different cultures and ethical systems in ATLA and how they deal with bad people and vengeance and other things like that. The Fire Nation is the most progressive with womens' rights and is focused on individuals/families, Earth nation is all about keeping your word and doing your duty to your home, and so on. None of them is "just plain good" or "just plain evil". The Water Nation culture seems the nicest at first, but they don't mind the reasoning of "a fire nation soldier hurt my family, so I should retaliate against the entire fire nation".

It also has some neat stuff about spirits.

I wouldn't call it rational, but it's a very good read.
