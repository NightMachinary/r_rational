That kind of stuff is exactly the reason I picked this series. It's already extremely intelligent both in moral themes and in conflict, so it doesn't take much to take it up to a fully rational story. There are several things that I feel the writers were holding back on to avoid making them /too/ scary, and the Dai Li was one of them. Rest assured, I'm going to push the envelope with them.
