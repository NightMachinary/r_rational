I have not decided how it ends, but I have decided not to hand the heroes Deus Ex Machinas like the original does. Lots of people complain about the lion turtle since it solves Aang's problem out of nowhere, but throughout the series people are rewarded for making morally good decisions and punished for making morally bad ones. The Avatar World is, unlike ours, naturally just. Bad things happen, but just being the good guy is enough to pull a win in the end.

This is alright for a high fantasy children's show, of course, but it's not what I'm aiming for. My thing is going to be a little darker by the very nature of being a rational story in a world where horrible things are already happening with about the same frequency as they do in the real world.

I don't know how it will end, but if it does come to it, Aang will have to decide if he ought to kill Ozai or not.
