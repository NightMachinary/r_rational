I'm pro-rational fanfiction, but I think they're more engaging when the story is retelling comes from the point of view of a supporting character from the original series.

I think Sokka would make a really disarming choice for the rational protagonist. He's always incidental to the spirtual themes of every story, so you'd have less to rewrite, and the irony of the original series' idiot becoming the intelligent voice of reason is also appealing.

In the original Sokka was the perpetual outsider to the storyline, and he was used mainly to provide comic relief. This puts him in the perfect position to be supplanted by a rational character, with minimal collateral damage to the storyline, though I appreciate you may have done a lot of the work integrating rational Aang already.

Fanfiction from the point of view of the antagonist is also very effective. Would you consider a rational fire lord? Waging a war of aggression to genuinely benefit the world.

Sorry that I'm not answering your question and suggesting dramatic changes. I read a /lot/ of fanfiction and supporting characters -> protagonist and antagonist -> protagonist are very effective. Like, they add +50 readability to any given fanfic.
