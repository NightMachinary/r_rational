Sokka may have been the butt monkey, but he wasn't the idiot. On the contrary, he was organized, creative and inventive. That's why he came up with the group's plans, decided their schedule, handled the maps, and so on. Sokka's the obvious choice for the "rational" character because he always had to solve his problems with creativity and smarts rather than bending power.
