Actually, the way I've been writing it, there really isn't a "protagonist". The story largely centers around Aang, but all of the 'Gaang' are about equal focuses of the plot, as are Zuko and Iroh and the other characters that get incorporated eventually. Aang is central since he is the Frodo, in a sense, the reason for this adventure to be happening, but by the sixth chapter basically half-a-dozen characters are on equal ground as the focus of the story, and a dozen more are minor characters who have had perspective (I'm doing that Ice and Fire thing where the story is broken up into 3rd person limited segments for each character).

As for Ozai as a good guy, definitely not. I think the show did a really good job of representing imperialism and the problems therein, and without fundamentally changing the world, I don't think I can justify a protagonist Ozai without it just being that wanky "I'm making my hero do bad guy things to be edgy". I like him as a rational villain though. A person who totally understands the world, but has goals which are at odds with the morality of the heroes.
