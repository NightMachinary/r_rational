Hmm... Well, you make good points. I guess as long as you're thinking about these things and address them plausibly somehow, I'll be happy :)

But if I were writing something like this, I'd tread on the side of caution when thinking if something constitutes a good disguise or not. I'm thinking that it's too easy to fall into the temptation to wave away real issues by using flimsy rationale.

Anyway, brainstorming is not supposed to be about arguing about issues, and I think I've done my job by voicing my concerns :)

My other concern is the age of the characters. How are you going to handle kids Aang's age in this more adult world? Do you think the characters will fit this world, the story you'll write, that they will be able to handle the moral dilemmas you've been contemplating about throwing at them? The Gaang worked in the canon because the show was geared towards kids, but I think they'd fit a more realistic world worse. I guess that's why you're making all these changes to them, but are you thinking at all about maybe also bumping their age up a bit or something?

I mean, don't get me wrong, it's doable without this, but I think you'd make your life a lot easier. I guess all the characters have some excuse to be more adult than the usual kids their age -- Aang's the Avatar and an airbender from an apparently progressive airbender society, Katara and Sokka are a chief's kids who oversaw a whole village by themselves, and Toph is apparently now a criminal mastermind. But the thing that always niggled me a bit about even HPMOR is its portrayal of children, which I think it doesn't do them quite right at times, and I think it'll be just as hard to do them justice in your story. You might either have kids that are too serious for kids, or kids that are too carefree for the world around them.
