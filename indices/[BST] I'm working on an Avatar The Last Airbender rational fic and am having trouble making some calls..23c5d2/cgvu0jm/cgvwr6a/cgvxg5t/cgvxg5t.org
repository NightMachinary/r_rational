Makes sense. My suggestion then is to take the simplified ideas of the episodes and expand them. I hate to use the word "gritty," but ground them in a more realistic framework.

For example, the episodes where the GAang helps the earthbenders find their courage and fight back against the oppressing fire nation troops: explore what happens when the tables are turned, because if Avatar wasn't a kids' show, you know those troops are getting executed afterward (those that aren't crushed to death in the conflict itself, that is). Go into how one treats the people oppressing them when liberation is earned, especially if most are "just following orders," and the implications of that, the psychology behind that (Milgram experiments) and the way roles influence behavior (Zimbardo experiments). Humanize the Fire Nation much earlier than the show does.

Related to this, I actually have an issue with the way Avatar: The Last Airbender ends, because I saw "Spirit bending" as a deus-ex-machina that saved Aang from having to kill someone that really, really needed killing (matters of "deserve" aside) and circumvented the character development of his conversations with his past selves, especially the previous air nomad who explained that as the Avatar, his spiritual needs are put second to his duties to the world.

But yeah, a lot of the morals were couched in circumstances that still kept the show kid-friendly: take the gloves off and I think you'll find the stakes up the ante quite a bit, both on what's required to solve problems and on the philosophy explored.
