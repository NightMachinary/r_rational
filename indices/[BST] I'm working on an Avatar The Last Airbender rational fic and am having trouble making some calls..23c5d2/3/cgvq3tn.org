You might want to ask the people at [[/r/worldbuilding]] about worldbuilding.

It's also worth noting that the two best rationalist fanfictions I've read (HPMOR and /The Great Alicorn Hunt/) don't update the world along rationalist or scientific lines but simply drop relatively rational characters into the insane canon world.

In any case, what will make the fic worth reading or not is whether the story, characters, and plot are gripping and enjoyable. HPMOR gets a lot better when the writing loosens up and begins telling a story rather that simply setting up scenarios for HJPEV to lecture people about science.
