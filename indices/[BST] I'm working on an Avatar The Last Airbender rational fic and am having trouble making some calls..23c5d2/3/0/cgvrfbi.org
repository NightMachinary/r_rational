It's certainly something I considered, but ultimately I think the original world is /too/ rational for that to work. Sokka and Katara are each about a third of the way there to being rationalists, the world is filled with super-intelligent geriatrics who, for the most part, behave not only rationally but highly subtly and tactically,and the main villains of the show are schemers whose schemes always work in a probable way. Even when people do behave irrationally, it's almost always a villain with irrational motivations who Aang has to fight and has no means for reasoning with anyway.

If I just make Aang rational (and said that he learned it from some small school of airbender thought, maybe that Gyatso was a part of), it would just make him over-powered for the world he was in without changing much of the story.
