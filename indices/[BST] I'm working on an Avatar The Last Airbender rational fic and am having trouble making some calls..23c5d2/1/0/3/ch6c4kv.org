  I love this idea. Perhaps instead of genocide he integrated the small proportion of surviving air nomads -- like the very young and disabled (limbs broken -- no bending), into Fire Nation itself? They are a resource which would not make sense to permanently lose. You could make a whole exploration on their lives in captivity - forced to work for the Fire Nation industry and researchers, being useful enough that they can have semblance of as normal of a life they can in an existence at the bottom of the pyramid.

  That's gross and horrible and I love it.

Quick note that the genocide of the air nomads has a purpose. On the one hand, it is an attempt to keep the next avatar from being reborn (keeping a huge asset out of your enemies' hands). On the other, it shows the world that the Fire Nation really means business. It shows the world that they will take all other benders and are willing to exterminate them if they do not submit.

That said, neither of those purposes require the complete and total destruction of the air nomads. The first only requires that most of the air benders get killed. Since the avatar will be born as an air bender once every four rebirths, and it is possible to groom children to get them sympathetic to your cause, the Fire Nation can double the amount of time they have an avatar at their disposal by capturing a small group of air nomads.

The second reason... in order for people to get the message, they only have to think all the air nomads were killed. It doesn't actually have to happen.
