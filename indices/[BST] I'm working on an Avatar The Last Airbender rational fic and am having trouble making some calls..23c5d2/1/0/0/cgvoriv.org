  “..instead of having a false image of himself as some nature-child who the beasts of the Earth naturally flock to, he has a false image of himself as an Ender Wiggins archetype.” “Since Aang is essentially his universe's Ghandi, and Sokka is his universe's Che Guevara..”

I.. think I'm falling in love with your brain.

  “Basically, fuck the professional wrestling. That is not what my story needs. I'm playing up the double identity she has. The Blind Bandit is an infamous earthbending thief in the Gaoling region.” “..She's just an anarchist trying to fuck up the system because she lacks the insight to see (no pun intended) beyond the dichotomy of things working as they are and thinks breaking. Until Aang and friends show up.”
#+end_quote

That sounds absolutely fantastic. It would add so much depth and sense of purpose to her character.. I can't wait to see interactions between Ender!Aang and a Toph like this.

  “I was toying with the idea of Air Nomad aerodynamics giving the Fire Nation some form of gun, but I don't know about that one.”

Doesn't have to be a gun.. How about a, I dunno a device (breathing horn? wrist gauntlet? cannon/ballista/turret thing?) that would help control the spread and intensity of the flames? Makes it easier to control the flames, increase the range etc. Something like that would contribute to combat a lot -- and helps you show, in well a direct way examples of how knowledge from the Air Nomads made technological leaps that made the Fire Nation a military power house.

  “That is, the changes in physics between this universe and the Material World of the Avatar universe are comparable to those between the Material World and Spirit World. The Spirit World's weird physics, however, alter the Material World in a way that makes bending possible.”

Scratch the alien theory -- parallel connected universes sounds so much more interesting. A good explanation for bending too, the benders changing this world's reality by tapping into their connection with the other one.

Oh - and the Air Nomads could have also engaged in research trying to understand the Spirit World and their connection with it -- totally fits in with canon! You could make Pathik as a specialist in this field, traveling the world researching areas with strong anomalies due to breach between the worlds..

And, you know the parallel world thing does sort of make the spirits aliens - in a way :P

Also, how do you feel about elevating the Avatar state from a power boost to something more like the Bene Gesserit's genetic memory from the Dune series? Lost in a thousand lifetimes, their voices and muscle memory coming to him from across the ages..

Gives something of a cost in accessing the Avatar State -- mental strain, a double aged sword. Much as I love Aang, I think he would be much more interesting this way like a messiah figure -- more avatarish?

Heck, with this you could make each access to the Avatar State significant and interesting -- an excuse to write a mini interlude on a long dead avatar's memories related to the current scenario.
