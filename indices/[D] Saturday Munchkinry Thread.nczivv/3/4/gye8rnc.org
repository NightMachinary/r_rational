Let's say you got shot. You can remove all tissue around the foreign object embedded in your body, remove the object, then replace the tissue. Similar tricks may work with reassembling broken bones.

Depending on whether lost blood is recreated or teleported it may be possible to be a nearly infinite blood donor.

If you see an impact coming and if the injury power works supernaturlly fast you can possibly create a cocoon around yourself made of blood clots.

That's all I see being useful about this power which hasn't been mentioned.
