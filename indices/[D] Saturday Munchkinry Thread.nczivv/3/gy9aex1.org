You have the power to consciously inflict and undo structural damage on your body. If you will yourself to get a papercut on your thumb, you'll instantly get one. You can choose to undo the damage of the papercut, healing your body just as instantly to the point where the injury didn't happen. Even if the papercut is naturally healed, it'll still reverse whatever disturbance was done.

This applies to all other forms of trauma on all parts of your body, only limited to harm that you can consciously conceive of and could be caused by physical force/strain. You can scratch your corneas, break bones, tear muscles, give yourself concussions, get a gunshot wound, make your arms sore, and so on and so forth. Of course, plenty of caveats apply:

- This power won't work with fluids, tissues, organs, or bodies that don't originally belong to you, including unborn children. Your power doesn't extend to prosthesis and can't affect body parts that have been removed from your body, unless you inflicted and are now reversing the removal.

- If you lose consciousness, all injuries you have at that point can't be reversed. If you lose the ability to be reasonably aware of your inflicted injuries and choose to reverse them, they can't be reversed. This applies to the mental consequences of brain damage, forgetting that injuries were done by your power, and other failures to be mindful. Death is permanent.

- The ability to reverse injuries only applies to injuries inflicted by this power. Additional damage you get as a consequence of powered harm isn't guaranteed to be healed, the deciding factor being the, "natural-ness", occurring on a spectrum. For example, if you chop off a finger, someone breaks the detached finger, and you reverse the chop, the fracture will remain, so will acquired foreign bodies/organisms. However, the decay caused by the limb being detached from your body will be reversed, and you'll get the majority of lost blood back.

- The presence of foreign toxins, non-human parasites, additional body parts, or the presence of extra matter/energy can't be willed. Nor can this power make matter vanish from your body. At best it may displace objects based on the context. If you will yourself, say, a stab wound, no stabbing device is actually materialized in any way, it just creates the effect instantaneously. If you apply injuries such as frostbite that require the removal of energy, the temperature of your flesh won't be changed, it'll just receive the damage.

- What you fail to consciously specify about injuries will become random. If you will, "a cut on my hand" everything else about this cut, which hand it appears on, where on the hand it's located, the severity, etc. will effectively be a roll of the dice. This power is under no obligation to preserve your dignity or life. Willing, "a head injury" could give you a mild concussion, it could give you the Phineas Gage treatment, or your skull might just pop like a balloon. Needless to say, it's in your self-interest to be precise with your intent.

How would you Munchkin this power?
