- A useful skill whenever using this power will be to sever nerves from their connections in affected body parts. Can also be used as a general anesthetic during battles or totrures.

- Displace a bone from your body, and have it explode. Different sized shrapnel can create effects ranging from a smoke screen or a grenade. In the case where the resulting shrapnel can effect you, use a shield or other form of protection.

- Learn about neuroscience, and figure out if there's any cool tricks you can do by severing connections in your brain which are too risky for normal procedures. Anything from increasing focus or motivation to releasing high amounts of adrenaline at will. Such techniques may also be helpful for staying conscious under blood loss or trauma, though I'm uncertain about how doable this is.

- Calluses are injuries which can be caused by repeated force on an area of the body. See if power accepts this reasoning, and create callused armor over your body. Allows for grabbing of sharp objects, absorption of blows, and creation of brass knuckles in cases where actual brass knuckles or armor are unavailable. Plausibly better than man-made armor? Idk much about the tensile properties of calluses.

- It should be possible to increase your muscle mass over time without having to lift weights by applying whatever stress those weights put on your muscles to your muscles using this power. Using this technique you could become very very strong without having to expend much time or willpower.

- Use to hide potentially useful objects throughout your body, such as guns in your hips (insulated so as not to leech toxins), a lockpicking set in your arm, knives, bombs, etc. Get them out/in by surgically cutting & healing yourself in the relevant locations.

- I can imagine a scene where the person with this power & an enemy are fighting, and the cutting of an artery is used to blind the enemy long enough to get in a critical strike.

Edit: I really like this power. It has a lot of applications for the creation of very disturbing fighting tactics.
