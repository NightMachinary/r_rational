I think hard mode might be unwinnable so going easy mode (without subconsciously letting meta-knowledge about the setting slip in). Too much background knowledge is needed just to get the information to make the plans to make the plans without at least one defector.So initial information gathering stage:

- Get a more general feel about Wizard capabilities from our defector. Then get a specific list of tricks. Focus on stuff related to the memory manipulation, as any sort of mind-stuff is enough to completely require a restructuring of plans.

- Assuming from above we learn the following: the existence of veritaserum and legimens but that they can be unreliable. The existence of various mind-control and mind alteration means beyond memory charms. The general technological ignorance of wizards, especially in the older generations and institutions. The ability to rapidly teleport. The ability to make large areas unnoticeable and spatially folded away. The typical attitudes among wizards. The trace as well (so we know that the presence of an underage wand is used as a key element of tracking magical use on a small scale).- We have our defector purchase the following: major texts that all wizards read in school grades, a selection of general purpose wizarding references, a selection of magical newspapers stretching backs. A few extra historical texts and with at least one focusing on recent history in as much detail as possible. Various extremely minor but clearly magical toys/items (for the purpose of more rapidly persuading people that the whole thing isn't an elaborate prank).

- We have our defector have their parents network with other parents of muggle borns in a PTA group as well as get that information to us. Ideally, this parents network should be encouraged to stay low key with no official government contacts and not even aware that I know anything. If the parents are caught by the Wizard government, well that is pretty innocuous. Actually, it would be good if they could get a Wizard teacher or two on their side, also kept unaware of things.

Next comes the compartmentalization stage:

- Having learned that wizards have a huge array of mind reading, alteration, and manipulation, with arbitrary distinctions between what is acceptable and not and nearly arbitrarily capabilities so long as a wizard can find you can point a wand at you we need to break up our plans and avoid a single layer.

- So from now on, we are totally understanding of the Wizarding Governments position and willing to do whatever they ask and if they ask about various things I might have been planning... at most I was only planning to setup some muggle institutes to help the Wizard government track the dark wizards, not anything more nope. Veritaserum is unreliable, so I think double think is a worthwhile investment.

- Wanting to keep the Wizards as secret as possible of course, when I ask a trusted member of my government and a few key top military officials for help, well of course I don't want to be told all the details because talking about the details might upset the secrecy the wizards care so much about... and really they should do the same, only recruit a few trusted people each. I also setup an anonymous delivery of information to a government official telling them about the PTA group and suggesting some back-channel connections with one of the more reliable parents in the group.

- Wizards seem bad at technology... so we leverage that: automatic email reminders and data caches set up on cloud services with servers in other nations. A lot of these reminders should be set very spaced out. So if I get my memory erased, a email reminder might eventually clue me in. Also, anonymous IRCs and one-time pads and all the cryptographic goodies. Ideally, this encrypted technological communication should be the only regular point of contact between conspiracy members not in the same cells. For members in the same cells... rare in person meetings might actually be a good idea, just to give the wizards something to track so they don't try inventing any more advanced spells to use on the problem. Actually... we could make sure that various pairs meet in person or through dead-drops but that the overall graph of cells isn't connected except through technological links.
