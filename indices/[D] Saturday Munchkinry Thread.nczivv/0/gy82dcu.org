*Harry Potter Reverse Munchkin Scenario*

You have just begun your term as the Prime Minister of the UK. One morning, as you're alone, a few strangely robed people claiming to be "wizards" suddenly appear in your office, and reveal the existence of the Magical Society of Britian. As was the tradition with your predecessors, they give you a quick and cautionary briefing, before vanishing in a flash.

You learn that:

- Magic is real, and a small, isolationist wizarding society exists, spread throughout the country. You don't know their exact numbers, but based on the descriptions it's probably in the low tens of thousands. Similar communities likely exist worldwide.

- Amongst these wizards, magic is widespread and casually employed in daily life, apparently capable of pretty crazy feats that violate known physical laws. Exact mechanics and limitations are unknown to you, although you can make some vague guesses based on their descriptions. (Assume information equivalent to watching a mashup 1 minute clip of a random person's day-to-day)

- Yourself and other non-magical humans are referred to as "muggles", and generally disregarded by the wizards as uninteresting and inferior.

- There's a strict statue of secrecy imposed by the wizards to prevent the general muggle population from learning about the existence of magic, they callously reveal that they enforce this through field agents with memory erasure and modification abilities.

- The wizards expect little from you, except to stay out of their way. But they also proudly declare they will not speak to or cooperate with any muggle government, including your administration.

- They have their own independent government, economy, laws and way of life which generally do not intersect with the daily lives of mundane humans.

- They claim to have their own magical school, though none exist on official maps and documents.

- All the British Prime Ministers before you have been similarly informed of their existence, but presumably few other non-wizards know. Your official records reveal nothing.

- One notable exception are the muggle parents of any magical child, who are allowed to keep their memories as long as they stay in line, but are otherwise similarly shunned by the magical community.

*You consider your options:*

You'd like to designate these "wizards" as a potentially dangerous supremacist terrorist group with unknown paranormal capabilities and blatant disregard for the justice system.

You, being a world leader, have considerable access to your country's resources (within reason), adequate political capital should you need to pull some strings, and availability of modern tech up to the present day (2021 not 1997).

How would you go about assembling a covert team or agency to secretly investigate, monitor and, if necessary, shut down the operations of these "wizards"? What techniques/protocols could they employ, and how can they avoid detection and compromise?

(Hard mode: As above)

(Easier mode: You also have the loyalty of a defector, a young wizard who claims to be a third year student in "Hogwarts". They're willing to cooperate with whatever you plan, and will truthfully share everything they personally know about magical society and it's capabilities.)
