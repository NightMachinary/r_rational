The general attitude wizards have towards H. Sapiens is that of snobbish disdain, the kind of attitude you'd have towards a seagull. We could exterminate them in droves, but we don't particularly care to, and sometimes it's fun watching them fight over some french fries.

You'd almost certainly be unable to secure cooperation with the wizards.
