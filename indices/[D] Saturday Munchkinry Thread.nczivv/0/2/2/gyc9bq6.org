With the scenario as stated... you wouldn't actually know about all the capabilities of the teleporters. Your third year student may not grasp that transfiguration makes bombs/white phorphorus/napalm/nukes/whatever "easy". And come to think of it... it is only in HPMOR canon that these things are easy, in canon, we don't see enough of transfiguration to know its real limits. For instance, in HPMOR, the students learn free transfiguration as a foundational step which has a bunch of hazards and needs very clear visualization, but is basically open-ended, while in canon, there seems to be more specific spells for transfiguration.

The teleporting is a big problem, but from the perspective of a third year, they may not realize how easy/hard apparation actually is. It should be one of the first things you try to figure out the limits of. And given the need for a clear mental picture of the destination, the risk of splinching, the range limits, and other possible unknown limits you shouldn't automatically give up.

I'll agree that antagonizing the teleporters is a bad idea, and indeed a "winning option" for the Muggles is probably a renegotiated treaty with a bit more muggle oversight and just enough implicit threat to get the wizards to cooperate but not enough to antagonize them... but just giving up because of hypothetical capabilities seems premature.
