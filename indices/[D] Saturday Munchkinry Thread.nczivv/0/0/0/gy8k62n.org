  each come up with their own security measures that I don't know about
#+end_quote

I think the problem/trick with this is that some security measures implemented poorly might be worse than no security measures. So have some general guidelines/rules on security measures developed by an expert (with access to the Wizard books) that all the teams use, and then tell them to come up with their own insofar as they don't violate the general guidelines/security rules without really good specific reasons.
