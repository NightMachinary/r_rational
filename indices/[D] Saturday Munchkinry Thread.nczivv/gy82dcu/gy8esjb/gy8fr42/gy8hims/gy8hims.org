This is absolutely brilliant and well thought through.

I'd imagine adding an autonomous layer between the operator and operation would be a good SOP, an autonomous drone pre-programmed to fly over a specific area and do something has no intent and can't be fooled by illusions, won't register as a living thing by magical wards, and reduces traceability back to your operations since there's nobody to interrogate.
