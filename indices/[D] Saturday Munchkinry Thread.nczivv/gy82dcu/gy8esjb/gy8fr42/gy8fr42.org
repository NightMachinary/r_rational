Continued because comment was too long:

Various to-do tasks of the various officials now involved in the conspiracy. Keep in mind that at this point I the prime minster no longer have control or knowledge over it, I have to trust my people to work it out. My only task now is to act as a node in the cell network of conspirators and to continue serving as a contact to our defector (who I regularly imply is a disgruntled squib to my conspirators)

- For the PTA contact... they should gradually figure out what "legitimate" channels for protest and change within the Wizard government is.

- For the military cells: set up exercises comparing purely automatic means of surveillance with human driven means, along with exercises designed to develop means of counteracting above-top secret zero-days that redirect cameras and counteracting spycraft, social-engineering, and psychological techniques of redirecting attention. The end goal of this is to independently find major and minor wizard locations, both for the purpose of knowing them, and to check them against the defectors knowledge to verify that the methods work. Set up exercise to counteract extreme chain of command failures, presenting it as a counter to top-secret subtle long-term mind altering drugs developed by terrorists. The real purpose: to develop chains of command that will work even as Wizards target top generals to mind-control.

- For an IT cells, maintain our anonymous means of contact, harden them against individual people being mind-controlled, and develop even more paranoid means that can beat spells designed for remote tracking and manipulation. For example, if a tracing spell designed to track an anonymous chat message from sender to physical destination... what happens if the chat is displayed/posted randomly on various anonymous message board unrelated to the Wizard conspiracy to distract it? Or a time delay? Or bouncing the message around the world. If any of these might plausibly work against a tracking spell, then how easily can they be implemented and used.

- For a science cells... first thing to try is all the easy conventional stuff on the various wizard toys and trinkets that would be super low hanging fruit if it worked: can EM radiation, sonar, vibrations, magnets, recordings of sounds, or any other common easily mass produced thing sense, counter, disrupt interact with Wizard magic. I would hope at minimum, that since Hogwarts disrupts electronics, the science teams could find some type of detectable EM interference they can develop into magic sensors.

- For an internal government cell: develop outlines of treaties they could possibly remotely have a chance on selling both the Wizard government and the mundane public. Also, figure out how the possible breaking of secrecy might affect things politically.

- For myself... whenever I meet with my defector we primarily only talk about a few things: legitimate means of persuading the Wizard government, Wizard activity that is illegal under the Wizard governments owns laws, latest mundane Wizard news, and various small magical toys/trinkets that I pay ridiculously for (that we could plausibly imply I only use secretly and privately). We primarily talk in indirect terms through technological means in oblique terms. The only people I have any contact with is a representative of the PTA cell and of the internal government cell as I can pretend to lose and play these off if the Wizards learn about them.

- Once the defector is of age in a few years... then I start talking about reversible memory charms and getting them done on myself and a few other exposed, overly connected members of the conspiracy so that veritaserum and legimens on a few members can't blow the whole things open. We also repeat the science test things, looking for any easy hacks, counters, or detectors to Wizard magic as it used.

Finally is the de-compartmentalization stage. Any ideas that worked should now be spread back through the network and people allowed to sacrifice compartmentalization to get better collaboration.

- Any tricks the science cells found should be passed to the military cells

- Have the defector work directly with the science cells.

- Any sympathetic Wizards the PTA cell developed should be put in contact with my internal government cell (which will also know to present as sympathetic a face of the conspiracy as possible).

- Start planning an end-game: Support internal wizard reform; a secret agency completely hardened against Wizard interference (through technological means or through more defectors) to act as leverage in negotiations towards a treaty, secret agency that will just extra-judicially punish abusive Wizards without necessarily a negotiations, pot-boiling gradual change, etc? The end-game is difficult to predicate even given canon knowledge as we don't have a good enough sense of the Wizarding world I think...

Hard mode mostly comes out the same... the initial information stages take even longer and must be done even more carefully... just finding one person I can trust to get Wizards books and minor Wizards toys is what I am going for. I would also try to have anonymous IRCs and automatic email reminders setup just in case they work (I know about the memory charms, but not about the Luddite nature of the Wizarding world). Once I have the initial set of books/toys and a magical contact, the plans would mostly go the same as easy mode.
