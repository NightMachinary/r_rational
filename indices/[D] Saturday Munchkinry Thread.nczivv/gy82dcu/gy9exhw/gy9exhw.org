I would suggest very very much to not antagonize the teleporters ever.

Modern society is terribly ill-equipped to handle the attacks of a teleporter. All the teleporter has to do is make a bunch of bombs/white phorphorus/napalm/nukes/whatever (which transfiguration makes damn easy to do), then rapidly teleport above all important locations and drop the stuff.

ONE hostile wizard is enough to collapse the entire muggle world if they are competently trained and care enough about muggles to try. */ONE/*. 1!

And your defectors won't be enough. After all, they can only set up so many anti-teleportation wards, so the hostile wizards can just teleport even higher up to drop their stuff.

​

The only conceivable way in which the muggles take Earth from the wizards is if they first build up a super nuclear bunker with total self-sufficiency, deep deep underground and hidden away and kept secret from just about everyone else except for a small population of muggles that will move in.

Then glass the earth. Nuke everything everywhere. Wizards don't have anti nuclear reaction wards (because they currently don't know what a nuclear reaction is), and they don't have separate dimension spells. They have hide location spells, but nukes hitting everywhere will AoE them anyway.

That really isn't worth it though.

​

The much much better plan is to abandon the Earth. Make spaceships and flee, flee for your lives! Flee while you still can, before the wizards start giving a damn about you! They can't teleport to you if they don't know that you even exist! Set up secret human colonies in star systems that are far far away from all this wizarding madness.
