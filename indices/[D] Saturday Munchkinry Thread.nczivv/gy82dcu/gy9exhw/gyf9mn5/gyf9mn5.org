I think you're overstating the power of teleporters. From what I remember canonically, the single-individual instant teleport is only available to skilled wizards and requires things like knowledge of their destination. We only ever see really powerful magic users popping around randomly while most rely on more cumbersome teleportation methods like the floo-network or portkeys. If only 10% of wizards are truly good at teleportation, that leaves your group of potential magical terrorists quite small.

Also, wizards aren't that bright canonically, especially when it comes to muggle matters. I mean, do they even know what a nuke is? Sure, someone who's versed in potions can probably whip up an explosive, but keep in mind that despite literal magic powers, most wizards somehow aren't fabulously wealthy and living in a post-scarcity society.

Also, even if a magical terrorist somehow managed to kill the government or a bunch of people in charge, there are millions upon millions of other humans to step up. Millions of people who have /guns/.
