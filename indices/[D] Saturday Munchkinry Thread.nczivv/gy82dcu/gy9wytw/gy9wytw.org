- My first thought is to inform the Queen. My second thought is that the idea of informing the Queen must have occurred to most of my predecessors. So, my first step is to go and talk to Her Majesty.

If she does not remember about magic, then I'm going to assume that wizards wiped her memory (probably multiple times). This would be a high treason, but probably unpunishable, given the circumstances. I also talk to the previous Prime Minister to see if his memory was also wiped.

If either of them still remember about magic, then I'm going to ask them about any steps they have made about the situation and go from there. They had much more time to think about it, after all.

- Given wizards' abilities they should have been able to take over governments worldwide and rule over the enslaved muggle population. Since this is not the case, they must not be the evil supremacists I imagined and they can be reasoned with.

So, diplomatic approach. I request an audience with the Minister of magic and ask him all sorts of questions. "Ok, we must keep magic a secret, but it does not mean we cannot help each other. Let us discuss our trading situation..." My ultimate goal is to learn about wizarding society, and then influence wizards through soft power.
