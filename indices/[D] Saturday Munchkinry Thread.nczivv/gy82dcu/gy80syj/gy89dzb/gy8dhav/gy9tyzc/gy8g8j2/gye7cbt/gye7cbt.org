How common are these stones? IP piracy either just got unstoppable for just a short while until the stones became a collectors item or nothing changes because the wealthy rulers of the world club already have means to send arbitrarily large encrypted messages to each other and this just makes it cheaper by an insignificant amount.

As the stones are magical they may not be easy to reproduce, thus making them a useful object as a currency. The inability to subdivide them (i assume you can't just break them in half and have them still work to prove their authenticity) would eventually limit their usefulness to very large transactions only.

These stones would be very useful to someone interested in the preservation of data (librarians). If a monastic of Ancient rome era were to pass the entire works of Paul the second one through the stone we wouldn't have to guess at half the content so long as at least one intact copy of the key survived. If it did not, the data can still be recovered using brute force methods with many borrowed stones. Of course that would be meaningless to an extent as I'm sure some upstart from a later era is going to upload their own version of events and try to pass it off as the original and there'd be little we could do to tell them apart unless a timestamp were automatically included. It doesn't have to be bible verses either. I'm sure the entire works of many authors will be uploaded to preserve them for all time. Lots of morse code art of cat photos and porn too.
