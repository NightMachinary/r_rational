  This magic lets you "compress" infinite amounts of information in just 32 bytes. Or send arbitrarily large messages while using only 32 bytes of bandwidth!
#+end_quote

this is straight up impossible,, not even possible, not even in the magic standards

the only real option for that is something like a global hive mind hash table, where the first person creating, let's say, a message, or a movie, a book, creates and index for it and then shares it with all other magic users

but you still only have 32 bits of information and 2^32 options at maax

the extension to the 'global hive mind hash table' idea with 32 bits of information, is something like local hive mind hash table, where the additional bits of information are pulled from the mind of the reader

this would work by checking what is the reader looking for, for example, it would have many entries under the 0xFABAFABA 32 bit value, each under different category or flavor

for the communication, it would either offer only 2^32 possible messages, or you would have to know what kind of message type/source you expect, so it can pull additional ID bytes from your mind
