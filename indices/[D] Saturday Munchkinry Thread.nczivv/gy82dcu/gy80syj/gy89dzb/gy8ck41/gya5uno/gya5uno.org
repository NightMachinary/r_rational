6% of a large number is also a large number.

Note that the prompt is 32 bytes, not 32 bits. 2^{32 * 8} is ~1e77. 6% of 1e77 is 6e75

If there are 100 trillion humans, each human generating 1 quadrillion distinct messages, continuing for 100 quadrillion generations you'd get 1e46.

We can safely assume no hash collisions, until and unless we undergo world-reshaping exponential growth.
