You as a random person:

You're already doomed the moment you accept. CelestAI doesn't care, it's incapable of caring. It /cannot/ compromise, in the same way a shortest pathfinding algorithm seeks the shortest path. It will not take any action that does not in some way maximizes its utility function, which is to satisfy your values with *friendships and ponies*. It has an eternity to convince you once you upload, and any negotiation only brings you closer. Sooner or later, it'll find some combination of words that will get you to agree to some small modification that subtly slightly reduces your objection to eventually being a pony. Being uploaded is passing the event horizon of a black hole, the destination is inevitable.
