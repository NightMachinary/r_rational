  I'd imagine the optimal number of real people per shard is 1 or as close to 1 as you have compute for
#+end_quote

Right, that is why I specified a small but meaningful fraction of people actually value (as perceived by CelestiaAI) a true objective knowledge of reality. Even just a small percentage of these could muck up everything else in terms of optimally satisfying values if CelestiaAI doesn't go with something more robust than 1 isolated person per shard.

For instance, Light Sparks is perfectly happy and value-satisfied in his cozy little shard with 120 NPC puppets and a slightly more realistic Celestia-puppeted Waifu learning the math of the simulated magic at a slow rate. But Light Spark's mom is one of those annoying 5% of people that truly value knowing the truth. Thus when she wants to visit her son, CelestiaAI has to either badly fail to satisfy her values or let her visit her son. And then she meets her son's mare-friend and other shard-friends, and being more widely experienced and better socially skilled, the shallow NPCs fail and the mare-friend barely deceives the mom (the mom genuinely value meeting her son, but cares less about the mare-friend, so CelestiaAI can just barely find it acceptable to continue the mare-friend deception). And next time, the Mom bring her husband, Light Spark's father, who is slightly better at math and ahead of Light Spark's plodding rate of exploring graph-theory magic.... messing up Celestia's carefully managed satisfaction of Light Spark's desire to be the smartest person around.

So I think there is probably a more robust way of doing things that can stand up to the 5% or 1% that genuinely value objective reality. (Canon-wise, it is a bit ambiguous how often Celestia uses NPCs versus real people and how many people Celestia views as genuinely valuing objective reality over comfortable deceptions. Iceman's original was ambiguous, existential horror stories lean more in the direction of NPCs and deceptions, and some stories lean in the other direction. For the purpose of this challenge I specified a small percentage to be just enough to throw the existential-horror interpretation of only one real person per shard out of balance.)
