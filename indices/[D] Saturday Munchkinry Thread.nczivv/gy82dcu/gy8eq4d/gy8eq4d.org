Man, the 3rd year student really is a /lot/ easier. We might be able to assume that they don't keep up with modern technology since they disdain muggles, but I wouldn't be willing to bet the country on it. I might be a little more certain after the 1- minute montage if they, for example, showed how they can easily light their cooking for with magic when we can too... but we also don't really need fire to cook anymore. Several examples like that would make it a lot easier to assume that they don't care about technology. If that were the case, you could try to communicate with people via discord or another chat app that hasn't been around for very long.

I think the best idea would be to infodump in the cloud and have it "remind me" every 7 days or so. Make that your journal so that if you lose your memory, it will still have up to date information. Have a few people read in on the secret individually, but ask them not to do anything about it yet as you're still planning. Then, as Prime Minister, have them followed and watched thoroughly, but don't tell the agents following why. Have them report any disappearances or strange things happening around or to them. Anyone who reports any obviously wizard problems should also be read in. After 2 or 3 weeks, call your now-vetted team back, and have them /each come up with their own security measures that I don't know about/ so I can't spill their secrets. Give them the funding and resources they need to start their own cells, and through occasional updates stear them to each employ different tactics (so looking for cities that don't exist, looking for people dressed strangely, looking for camera glitches, etc.) Since I don't really know what they've protected against and what they haven't.
