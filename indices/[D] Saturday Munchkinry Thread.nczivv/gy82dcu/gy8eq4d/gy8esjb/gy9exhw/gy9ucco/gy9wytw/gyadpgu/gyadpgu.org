I'm thinking long term for hard mode.

Extreme surveillance would be helpful in detecting and tracking wizards. People coming out of buildings they never went in or vice versa, mentions of any wizard-specific words like muggle, units of their currency, or known spells. This sort of thing works on normal people, and from the brief impression I'd have it wouldn't seem that they're particularly paranoid, if they have to use memory editing often.

Enacting policies to make it easier to track where children go to school and similar measures so that muggleborn wizards can possibly be detected.

This would presumably all be restricted to muggle world surveillance at first and thus wouldn't be particularly effective, but it'd get results eventually. The real benefits kick in when wizard children who spend a lot of time in the muggle world (probably muggleborns, but that's not a requirement) are tracked down. From there, we radicalize them against the wizard community and recruit them to be spies. This would also be a way of acquiring magic items.

I'm assuming radicalizing young wizards would be fairly easy, it's an isolating community so they're vulnerable. Could be radicalizing them against the community, or making them believe and push for integration with muggles. Both serve the goals of the UK and would sow discord. One way to make initial contact would be to have someone claim to be a fellow wizard and then demonstrate it with mundane but flashy tech, or drugs. Surveillance bugs would technically be possible but I'd expect a very low rate of success.

Genetic samples would be acquired in order to start work to find the magic gene, which probably exists. Could be accelerated by purchasing magical animals. Ultimate goal there would be screening during pregnancy and isolating the child from the wizard community in order to starve it out long term, as well as the development of genetically engineered wizards loyal to the UK for the purpose of being able to take on the wizards on a level playing field far in the future.

Information found would be shared with other nations on a reciprocal basis, and would primarily consist of the nature of wizard culture, known abilities, and known wizards. If the magic gene is found it probably wouldn't be shared, given that it's basically the new Manhattan Project.

Infosec tactics as described in other comments would be used. Leaking all information to the general public could possibly be a deadman's switch. That might be too dangerous though.

TL;DR: create a surveillance state to find some wizard children, radicalize them into willing spies, learn more about wizards and create a database of known wizards, make our own wizards.
