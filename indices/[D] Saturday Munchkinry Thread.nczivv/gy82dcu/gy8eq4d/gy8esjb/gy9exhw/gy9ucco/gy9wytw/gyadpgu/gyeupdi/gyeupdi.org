Hard mode:

1. Create dead-drops. Loads of them, on many different platforms, in many different formats. Get some of the government's spooks in on it, say it's something you're keeping close to the chest for now so they help you without asking for explanations or looking at the contents of those dead drops, which will be links to, copies of, or directions to find, a set of updated files on everything you know so far. You might only be able to hand-write passwords to some encrypted versions in a few of the dead drops, but could have some completely printed out copies stored in random safety deposit boxes as well. Of course, you can't know for sure the wizards can't cast "erasus everythingus," but you can assume that with the effort they claim put into the Statute of Secrecy, there isn't something so convenient and plan-breaking. Set the dead-drops to notify you of their existence through various means every so often.

2. Find muggleborns. Have your spooks look for children going to schools that don't seem to exist. You don't know Hogwarts is a boarding school, but you might make the connection that these are aristocratic types, so you might also look for children who seem to periodically just vanish with no apparent distress on the part of their parents as well. Once you find some people you suspect to have a muggleborn child...

3. Find a pretext to pump them for information and feed it directly into the dead drop network. Start up a series of charity events where you invite random citizens, or, given that parents like the Grangers exist, find parents sufficiently highly placed in society that their being invited to high-class events as experts is not too strange. Of course you don't know the Grangers exist, but it isn't a terrible assumption that there will be a few parents of muggleborns who won't rouse suspicion if you or your agents get even an hour alone with them.

4. From this you learn /very/ useful information. For one, that muggleborns aren't treated well by the larger magical community, and are thus prime targets for subversion against it. You learn that Hogwarts, for all its vaunted safety, was in the middle of a warzone not too long ago, and that many people might still be dissatisfied as a result. That they used literal demons to torture prisoners just under two decades ago. And that the Wizarding World is /not/ omniscient or omnipotent, merely very powerful and well-connected. This allows you to take further actions.

5. You know the wizards aren't able to read hard drives, so you can safely begin having your spooks backdoor things into various places. If you can peel off some muggleborn children or their parents, begin collecting proof of their abilities and sincerity which would allow you to shatter the Statute, storing it all on various backups.

6. Break the Statute. You know their mind-erasing capacities are limited to the workforce of a large town at best. You might know about the thing in Fantastic Creatures where they erased the memories of an entire city if that's covered in the muggleborn's history lessons, but you'll also know that requires a thunderbird and a rainy day. Release everything on every possible outlet, worldwide, simultaneously, on the sunniest day you can manage.
