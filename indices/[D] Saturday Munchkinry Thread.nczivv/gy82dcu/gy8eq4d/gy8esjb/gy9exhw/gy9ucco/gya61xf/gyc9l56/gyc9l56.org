The policy not to negotiate with terrorists is premised on the idea that it encourages terrorism... but if the Wizards are going to do what they are going to do regardless of you negotiating with them or not, not negotiating isn't incentivizing or dis-incentivizing anything so there is not harm in trying (so long as you can get your political allies and rivals and the media from labeling the Wizards as uniformly terrorists).
