  It would take a pretty unhinged dark wizard to nuke the Muggle world even strategically.
#+end_quote

So Voldemort, if he gave a damn about Muggles. It would have been so so easy for Voldemort to transfigure nukes and nuke all his enemies to dust, if he had only just bothered to use the muggle wikipedia to learn how.

(And Voldemort probably could survive the nuclear fallout, he has a bunch of horcruxes after all.)

But the real problem is that Voldemort is hardly the only unhinged person. Lots of people are mad. They are just mad without power, instead of mad with power, so we only see these mad people launch attacks on the level of a single city block, or a single city at best. But every wizard with a high school level education (Hogwarts) is literally one step away from getting enough power to end civilization singlehandedly, with that one step being opening up Wikipedia's page on nukes.

And then no one can stop them. Not the muggles. Not the good wizards. There is absolutely no way to stop a teleporting nuke wizard.

To put things in perspective, imagine if a randomly selected 0.01% of US citizens are allowed free remote access to the nuclear briefcase as long as they just pass some minor high school level knowledge tests. How long do you think we would have before nuclear war?
