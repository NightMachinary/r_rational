  That's why such a resistance movement necessarily has to be covert in nature.

Towards what end though?

The big problem here is that as soon as one dark wizard learns about nukes, whether because they imperioed a muggle to tell them how to end the muggle world or are muggleborn, and that's the end of modern muggle civilization. There is absolutely no way whatsoever, magical or technological, of stopping an endlessly teleporting nuke generator.

I do not see how covertly resisting them helps in any way. Sure you can secretly learn more about how screwed you are, and maybe assassinate/convert a whole bunch of wizards, but IT ONLY TAKES ONE! One dark wizard with modern knowledge will end everything!

One wizard that you missed in your surprise genocide or whatever you were covertly planning, because the wizard just so happened to be a hermit hiding in their trunk or had a horcrux somewhere, and then everything is lost.

There is no winning move here. No masterstroke by which you can prevent the rise of a teleporting nuke wizard that ends everything. You can only delay it by letting the wizards continue to assume the muggle world is completely uninteresting, and NOT doing anything that would make them reconsider.

JK Rowling's Earth is basically a ticking time bomb that cannot be defused. The only hope is to escape before the end.
