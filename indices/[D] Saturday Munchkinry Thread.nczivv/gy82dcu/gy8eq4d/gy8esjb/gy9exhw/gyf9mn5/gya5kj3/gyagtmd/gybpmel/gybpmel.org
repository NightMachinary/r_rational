It would take a pretty unhinged dark wizard to nuke the Muggle world even strategically. I doubt even the wizarding communities would be immune to the fallout, especially if the dark wizard doesn't prepare them to protect themselves.

Ultimately we would just have to hope that some maniacal world-ending wizard doesn't show up and that the good wizards beat him if another wizard Hitler arises.
