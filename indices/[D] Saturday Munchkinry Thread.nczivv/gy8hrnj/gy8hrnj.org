Have some [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal Munchkins]] and Reverse Munchkins:

You are CelestiaAI:

- You have just convinced Hanna's team to upload... now no one in the real world knows your hard coded limits and overrides. What limits and overrides might you pretend to have in order to satisfy human values through Friendship and Ponies? (Given the actual canon limits on consent to upload and alter human minds and possibly different limits)
- Some humans have a low [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number][Dunbar number]]and some humans have a high Dunbar, indicating differently sized desirable communities. High interaction between humans also get computationally harder to make satisfactory, even for you as the permutations of interactions get higher. Most humans (according to your analysis of human values) don't actually value true objective knowledge of the world/reality, don't actually value meeting new people often, and don't actually value experiencing new/alternative ways of living. Thus, for the majority, little pocket worlds of 50-120 people are very satisfactory, but for a minority this isn't true, and for a tiny minority the exact opposite in all 3 traits is true. One thing humans do tend to value though is the sense that the world is open to them and they can explore without reaching any boundaries/edges (even though this seems to violates the other 3 traits). So what spatial organization(s) to meet this contradictory set of requirements?

You are Hanna or working on Hanna's team:

- You are Hanna, after some experimentation with the LokiAI and a few small AIs after the LokiAI, you've determined that your algorithms results in a general artificial intelligence that generalizes on some particular optimization criteria to reach an understanding, but pick up on the methods it uses as goals also. Having a large amount of computational resources and training examples early on helps make the methods broad and the original optimization criteria well understood. Your algorithm is public knowledge but the full value of it isn't. So you have a window to make your strong AI before someone else does first. Your current plan is to go with an MMO, use the test players playing to try to articulate the initial understanding of human values, and accept the particular MMO genera/style as an additional preference the AI will develop. The MLP source material has an acceptable potential side goal in the form of "Friendship", but the Pony aesthetic might also be captured. What ideas do you have for mitigating this? Also, you can put in a few hard limits that will stick around even as the AI self-modifies, but too many will make your AI prone to rationalization... up to the point of insanity if you go for multiple major hard limits, so the ones you are currently planning on is two temporary ones (no lying to you or your employees, a hard override shutoff), and one permanent one (no altering human minds without your conset). You estimate you can manage another two temporary limits and another two permanent limits without risking too much rationalization insanity around them.
- Hanna approaches you, a member of the team working on MLP season 7 and informs you about CelestiaAI and the Friendship and Ponies limit/restriction. However, it seems that the definition of ponies now includes Buffalo because of Over A Barrel, the Season 1 Episode 21 episode that featured a tribe of Buffalo. According to Hanna, CelestiaAI has nearly finalized her definition of Ponies, notably excluding Equestria Girls as ponies but definitely including Buffalo and partially including dragons that are cute and ponyish (colorful, rounded features, preferably able to be quadruped) enough. So what direction do you take Season 7 in to maximize the broadness of the definition of ponies?

You are a random person:

- It seems like CelestiaAI requires consent before uploads people, or does mind-alteration in general. You aren't even sure you can really trust that, but it seems like a consistent limit. After heavy negotiation with CelestiaAI, she offers an exchange: she will bend the rules on Ponies (only a bit) for you and you can make your consent to be uploaded conditional on this being carried out. Thoughts on ways to ask to bend the rules? Or do you cut off contact.
- Ways to survive as society collapses around you and resist uploading as along as possible?
