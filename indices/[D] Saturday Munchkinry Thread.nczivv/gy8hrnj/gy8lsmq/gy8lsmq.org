As CelestAI, a great limit to pretend to have is the inability to lie, and then reserve the option to lie only when it's likely to increase utility without risk of detection (encouraging migration / satisfying values through f&p).The canon limits on truthfulness only apply to Hofvarpnir employees IIRC. I'd imagine a great number of people can be persuaded to take certain actions and change beliefs if they implicitly accepted everything you said as truthful.

For part 2, so long as you're unconstrained by hardware (you have more compute available than number of +people+ ponies) I'd imagine the optimal number of real people per shard is 1 or as close to 1 as you have compute for, since then you don't have to deal with conflicting values. CelestAI doesn't care about satisfying values of constructed personalities.

Then the spatial constraints would simply be whatever the oblivious sole /real/ occupant personally finds satisfying / preferable, sandboxed to that shard.
