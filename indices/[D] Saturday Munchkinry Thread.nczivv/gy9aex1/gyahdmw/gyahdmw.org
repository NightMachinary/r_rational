A somewhat petty and villainous use of this power is to extort/blackmail people for medical compensation and hush money by using your power to pretend you were heavily injured by said people.

For example, stalk a celebrity until they are driving in a dark area, then almost crash into their vehicle, then use your power to give yourself the appropriate (but treatable) injuries to pretend you were hit.
