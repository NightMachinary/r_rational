This power sounds borderline Blessed With Suck, and personally I would avoid using it as much as possible. The potential for an irreversible screwup is far too high.

Having said that, you could

- Win the +Randi+ prize for proof of supernatural powers.
- Start a cult by demonstrating your faith healing powers in restoring your own amputation.
- Be a contortionist by dislocating any joint at will. Or remove handcuffs by removing your hands.
- Does a clearing a coronary blockage count as structural damage? You could give yourself heart bypass surgery I guess. Remove cancerous tumors.
- How specific can you get? You could probably temporarily disable your fear / panic response targetting of parts of the amygdala, and maybe you could temporarily disable other unwanted emotional states like depression or empathy or pain similarly. Of the list this is by far the most stupid and dangerous since there's no way to test it outside of prod and there are too many unrecoverable failure states.
