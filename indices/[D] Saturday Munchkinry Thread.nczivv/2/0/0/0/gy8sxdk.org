I think the ambiguity comes from : are ponies considered satisfied if they can't tell the difference? If you valued quote "objective reality" and from your POV I apparently acquiesce to your request to the point you cannot distinguish, are your values being satisfied?

Because celestAI's NPCs as written aren't crude simulacrum, they're fully sentient entities made from whole cloth essentially cognitively equivalent to the real individual, perhaps even with similar memories, save for the fact they +"lack a soul"+ weren't former humans and thus don't matter because that classifies them as "not people".

Okay but for the sake of the arguement, if that was unacceptable then I guess it still becomes a numbers game, where just the /minimum/ number of "real" interactions are permitted between these troublemakers and other people so long as it results in a net increase in utility. How this is done would probably be on a case-by-case (maybe even word-by-word) basis, seamlessly shifting and moving ponies on demand like actors on a stage set as needed.
