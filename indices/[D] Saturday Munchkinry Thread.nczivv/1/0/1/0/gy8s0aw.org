I was thinking 32 bit space, so I think you're right. Of course, we're probably looking at even more than a billion billion if everyone uses it for basically all forms of communication. We're talking every text, email, voice-mail, etc. Every picture you've taken or paper you've written. Every "record" or "cert" or "revision" or whatever you generate at your work. I would venture to say (without doing the math) that the chance of collision is high enough government agencies would be somewhat worried about it happening and losing or leaking important documents. Meh, maybe not though. 2^{256} is a really big number...
