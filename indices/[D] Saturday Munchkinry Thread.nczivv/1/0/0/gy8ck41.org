  you would very quickly run out of unique "addresses" for information...a number far larger than 32 bytes can differentiate

It's much worse actually. Assuming uniform distribution, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem][birthday problem]] means that utilizing just 6% of the address space brings the risk of collision to over 50%. Using 8% of the space brings the risk of collision to 70%, and a mere 14% will bring collision probability to 97%.

#+begin_quote
  If, somehow, the 32 bytes are differentiated by intent
#+end_quote

Then it's not really a checksum anymore, since in a checksum any same input always results in the same output. Intent is so arbitrary that that you might as well call it reading data from a magical cloud, wish for any wikipedia article and just get it.

Honestly this just boils down to a big [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table][rainbow table]] lookup that's unconstrained by space.
