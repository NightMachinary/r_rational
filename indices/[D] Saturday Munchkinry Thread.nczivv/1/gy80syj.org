Magic lets you break or bend the laws of physics or probability.

What if magic let you break the known constraints on information?

Suppose the world has magic stones, maybe a centimeter in diameter. If you apply a very fast morse-code-like binary signal to one side of the stone, it will output on the other side a SHA-256 checksum of the binary data. So far no magic. But these stones let you retrieve any data with only the checksum! In fact, any stone can retrieve data input to any other stone, as long as the checksum is known!

This magic lets you "compress" infinite amounts of information in just 32 bytes. Or send arbitrarily large messages while using only 32 bytes of bandwidth!

What other consequences are there?
