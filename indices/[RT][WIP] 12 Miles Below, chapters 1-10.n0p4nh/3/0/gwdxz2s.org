I spent a ton of time studying his free word copy of Warbreaker just to see how he wrote and try to emulate that style! Basically shamelessly stole how he handles worldbuilding - using it as treats for his readers, dropping hints and foreshadowing and letting people play around with their own theories ahead of time. Best moments were always the reveals, when suddenly something secret about the world clicked and you had that "OHHHH" moment. I'm hoping I can do that in this story!
