I've really enjoyed these chapters! I think that your portrayal of Keith as having internalized the behaviors of his erstwhile clan is quite successful and the world building is also very exciting. I have to say though, I hope you include a bit more description of people: I know that everyone's wearing protective gear, but it sort of bothers me that I can't picture any of the Winterscars well. Like, what's Keith's eye color, hair? How tall are Keith and Kidra? But I'm excited to see where this goes!
