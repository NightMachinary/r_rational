I've got 60 chapters on backlog that wrap up the first story arc. I'm posting Monday and Thursday now though, since only the first 10 chapters had been beta read and polished up. The rest of the chapters are setup, but haven't seen more thorough editing.

I wrote first because you can't get discouraged from an imaginary audience lol, now no matter what happens, at least the book ends on a complete story.
