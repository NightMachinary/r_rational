I agree. interesting premise and good worldbuilding, but the MC has a chip on his shoulder and is constantly in "Daddy doesn't love me" mode.

It's also pretty obvious that he's not as clever as he thinks, and is going to drag others down with him when he falls after one too many dumb risks.

I'm not saying I don't like the story, it's fun and I'll follow it, but the MC really needs a reality check and an extra dose of humility. I guess we'll just have to wait his character growth period.
