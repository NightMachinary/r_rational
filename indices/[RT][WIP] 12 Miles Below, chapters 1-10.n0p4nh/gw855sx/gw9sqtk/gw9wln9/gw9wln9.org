*EDIT*: Feedback has been implemented, going to edit out some of the possible spoilers previously in this post.

Always appreciate feedback! Strong feelings about the story point that you really clicked with it, you wouldn't care to comment on a 'meh' story

I've modified the first chapter and the challange chapter to expand some more details and address those issues.

It absolutely was stupid to pull the lever, practically every bit of foreshadowing in the story was screaming it would blow up on his face. It's the sort of thing I wanted people to think "Don't do it you stupid little git!" But it's 100% the sort of sneakery that house Winterscar's infamous for, and Keith grew up absorbing too much of that unintentionally. Greed is a powerful motivator and he convinced himself he'd get away with it. Let's put it this way: If Kieth were stuck in the cave of wonders in Alladin, as he is right now, he'd get loot fever and touch the shiny.

On your last part, I really can't tell you much other then it would be spoilers to tell you now. Father's got his own baggage, ideals, promises to keep, goals to accomplish and all. I've added some more dialog that was originally cut for that section now.

I'd rather put too little exposition and have readers point out they want more like you did, rather then have too much exposition, and see readers glaze over and close the book.

Thanks for your feedback! I'll put it to use!
