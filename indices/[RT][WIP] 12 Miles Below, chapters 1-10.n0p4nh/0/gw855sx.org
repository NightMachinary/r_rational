I was a beta reader for this so I'm biased and take this with a grain of salt - but I can confidently say that it's an incredibly well written story.

you can tell how much time was put into the world building and character development. i'm not big on settings like this one, but got sucked in (i planned to bail after beta reading and was hooked for the long haul).
