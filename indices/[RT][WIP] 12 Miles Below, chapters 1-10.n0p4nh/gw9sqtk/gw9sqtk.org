Holy shit this was fantastic!

I really love the rich setting and the worldbuilding so far. It's super unique, and I'm really interested where it goes next.

I don't have many complaints, really. Also, note that I did really like the story, I'm just complaining about the stuff I disliked because I want it to be the best it can be.

Firstly, I feel like the sister's personality completely changed after chapter 1. It felt out of character for her to accept the challenge like that, and I feel like she became way more humourous after the first chapter. Also, regarding the challenge, I don't understand why she chose something she was clearly favored to lose in. Stereotypical rich bitch obviously had an advantage, because she's rich.

My second complaint isn't really a plothole or anything, but it felt really, really stupid for the MC to turn the building's power back on without telling anyone. There's no way that could have gone well.

Finally...I don't understand why the father is so adamant about the MC being a knight. I do understand that it has to be him, because his sister apparently needs to have children for the bloodline to go on. And the father wants her to have kids, but she doesn't. So... can't the MC transfer the suit to her? The MC is never, ever going to be a warrior like the father wants, so I really don't get why he thinks that his son will become a new person after 18 years.

Regardless, this was a fantastic start, and I'm really excited to see what comes next!
