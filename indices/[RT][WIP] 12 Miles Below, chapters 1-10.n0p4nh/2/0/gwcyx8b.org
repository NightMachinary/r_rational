Hmmm, not a lot of opportunity to describe people right now. I can let you know how they look like since it's not a spoiler though, just to help you mentally map it out. This would be pulled from my notes:

Kidra: Black medium hair, blue eyes, about 5'10". A face that's conventionally pretty, paired with an piercing gaze that makes anyone suddenly self-conscious. She enjoys playing with eye shadow to double down on this effect.

Kieth: Shaggy brown hair and brown eyes. Freckles. 5'11" with a face that looks like it would be more complete with glasses and too boyish to ever grow a beard. Rail thin. Usually has soot or dirt as an almost permanent feature on his cheeks and forehead. A first glance might make someone suspect an overworked engineer, and a second look will make them pat their wallets just to check it's still there.

Tenisent Winterscar: Is described in the story at chapter 36
