Checked the story. World building is interesting, as advertised. MC is too annoying though.

If asked to take the story as rational with low internal contradictions... After he risks lifes of other people twice in hostile environment, I expect that he would have faced a tribunal and execution (or something like that) for similar actions long time ago.
