This list is telling me a highly realistic sci-fi story using common themes would probably be very boring.

A lot of these "mistakes" are deliberate choices made for the sake of story. You can clean up some of them, and the ones tut-tuting the use of cliches are fine, but without making SOME assumptions/contrived circumstances... well there is a niche genre that it could end up as (a very interesting one too), but I don't think its fair to limit sci-fi to that niche.

I'm willing to suspend disbelief. A lot of these rules are just complaining about an author techno-babbling her way through an issue, instead of finding a real solution. I don't see how it is necessary for authors to come up with /actual/ solutions to problems that might exist /if there story were actually reality/.
