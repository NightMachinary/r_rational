If anything, I run into /more/ weird orbits in fiction than in real life. "Ooh, this species lives on a planet that spends a THOUSAND YEARS in the frozen depths of space, so everything is adapted to the freezing cold! This technological civilization arose while they were away from their star, and now they're approaching it again! This planet has TWO rings at right angles to each other!"

I'm not arguing in favour of fiction being unrealistic. (There are arguments for that, but I'm not making them - it /does/ bug me when fiction is unrealistic.)

I'm arguing that "moons orbit around the equator in roughly circular orbits" is a good rule of thumb that will produce realistic results 99% of the time, unless you happen to include a full Star Atlas of your chosen universe and it shows all of them in artificially perfect regular orbits.
