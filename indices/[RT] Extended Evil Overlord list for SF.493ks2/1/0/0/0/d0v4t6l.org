...Except no? Because they don't, any more than they orbit any other sequence of points on the planetary surface - which is the point that Stross was making. Just because quite a lot of them /do/ (to a certain degree, anyway) doesn't mean that all of them do, or should be expected to do, or that even the ones which are very nearly equatorial are exactly so.

The clich√© being railed against was that of every moon in every planetary system orbiting in nearly circular, nearly perfectly equatorial orbits. It's a quick visual shortcut when the details don't matter, sure, but it's lazy and actually counter to natural formation when you're setting an entire book on a world with a particular set of natural satellites.

Someone I know put it in perspective - it was OK to gloss over this kind of thing back before Google, because no-one expected authors to go do the heavy lifting needed to make various aspects of their works reasonably realistic. But the bar for quality has been lifted as the amount of work required to do said research has plummeted, because these days the /readers/ have the internet at their fingertips as well, and are far more likely at some point to have idly wandered through one or more wikipedia pages regarding moons, orbits, tides, satellite formation, effects on planetary ecologies, and so on. And if they haven't, it's an effort of mere seconds for them to do so at any point if they ever feel inclined.

Stories - /books/ - in which everything is cookie-cutter handwaved are going to be competing with ones in which the author actually bothered to put at least five minutes' effort into some basic research and was therefore able to include something more realistic and interesting, giving them an edge in detail and entertainment value, and a more three-dimensional world-setting, without requiring a corresponding additional suspension of disbelief. It's no crime to want better-quality stories.

Not to mention, when stories these days are discussed to death online, torn apart and nitpicked and clucked over with every new author release, including these kinds of details can help towards maintaining reader interest, giving them something to discuss, and improving the fandom community. That's not a bad thing. And all it needs is a couple of hours - sometimes even just minutes - in front of a computer in order to add that extra aspect.
