TL;DR: this list is extremely misleading.

Firstly, conflating "cliches" and "mistakes" is a weird move. A cliche is something that's so common it's become boring. It isn't something that's unrealistic or factually untrue. Those are different things, and you deal with them differently, and they have different consequences for the reader.

  1. Planetary civilizations
#+end_quote

About half of these are different ways of saying "don't do single-biome planets".

This is a) common knowledge, and b) actually pretty rare, when you consider that most scifi only ever visits a single location on a given planet.

It's also arguably a popular misconception /in itself/, since most planets don't have Earthlike axial tilt, and most planets have very few areas that would appear visually distinct to a human, since most planets are uninhabitable (and uninhabi/ted/) wastelands.

#+begin_quote
  You can fly anywhere at Mach 2.2+ without experiencing hull heating due to atmospheric friction
#+end_quote

This ... isn't a cliche /or/ a mistake, is it? It's just a fact about how some fictional spaceships work.

A lot of fictional spaceships don't even work this way, since everybody /knows/ that moving sufficiently fast will cause you to heat up.

Also, this is itself a misconception; the issue isn't friction, it's that the air heats up as it's compressed in front of the craft.

#+begin_quote
  You can fly anywhere at Mach 2.2+ without worrying about Air Traffic Control and NOTAMs
#+end_quote

/glances at which sub-heading we're under/

Why would you mention it at all, if it's not plot-relevant? Why would you assume that an alien civilization has come to the same solution as us for this, if you're trying to /break/ cliches? Especially if they have better technology than us.

Also, most scifi does in fact show some form of air-traffic control when approaching inhabited stations.

#+begin_quote
  Deep carbon cycle, subduction, ionosphere UV splitting of water, long-term terraforming stability: why worry about little things like that?

  Coriolis force, trade winds, cyclones, what are those?
#+end_quote

... usually irrelevant in scifi? Still, I guess bringing them up /would/ violate a cliche ...

#+begin_quote
  Some planets have a breathable atmosphere but no water
#+end_quote

Not totally sure where he's going with this. That oxygenated atmospheres can't sustain themselves without life? That sufficiently dry air is annoying (but breathable) and dehydrates you faster?

(Aside: how often does scifi specify there's /no/ water on a planet, as opposed to relatively little water compared to Earth? I can't recall ever seeing this.)

#+begin_quote

  1. Space and cosmology
#+end_quote

hoo boy

#+begin_quote

  - Moons are good, the more the better!
  - Suns are good, too, the more the better!
#+end_quote

Ugh. I know, right?

#+begin_quote
  ... Especially if one of them is a giant. (Those never explode or flare messily.)
#+end_quote

... is he implying that large stars don't have a Goldilox zone, or are sufficiently short-lived and volatile that they'd destroy any life forming? Scifi writers have no sense of scale indeed.

#+begin_quote
  Planetary ring systems are picturesque, not dangerous
#+end_quote

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ME5jhsgmB4][Indeed]].

No, hang on a sec. In all seriousness, planetary rings aren't dangerous, unless you physically crash into them like an idiot. They cast a shadow, that's about the only thing scifi doesn't acknowledge. (Although there is a tendency to get confused about the composition of planetary rings - they're pretty fine.)

#+begin_quote
  Planets have magnetic poles that approximate their rotational axis
#+end_quote

... yes, quite a lot of planets do? And it's been speculated that they may be a precondition for life, so that's kind of important.

Also, how often does this come up in scifi? I'd honestly be surprised if something brought up the details of planetary magnetic fields, not that Stross seems to know them.

#+begin_quote
  Planetary gravity can be approximated to a point source for purposes of calculating orbital dynamics
#+end_quote

Well ... yes, they can.

#+begin_quote
  If you are in geosynchronous orbit away from the equator you still hover over the same spot on the planetary surface all the time
#+end_quote

Yeah, there's no such thing as a geostationary orbit over points that aren't on the equator. Unless you're cheating by constantly hovering in place using schizotech, rather than orbiting.

#+begin_quote
  All satellites orbit the equator
#+end_quote

Are we talking planetary satellites? Because yes, they do.

#+begin_quote
  The flight time between planets in an inner star system is the same as between planets in the outer system
#+end_quote

Again, this point is reiterated multiple times for some reason, but it's actually a good one.

#+begin_quote
  Actually, hitting a space rock or other spaceship is no big deal, a bit like being in a minor car accident
#+end_quote

Another "let's make the same point 15 times" one. This point is ... kind of the main reason most scifi ships have shields of some kind? But technically true, I guess.

#+begin_quote
  Gas giants are good for mining volatiles ... Because dealing with Mach 6 wind shear, 10,000 Bar pressure, and a lethally deep gravity well is trivial
#+end_quote

Actually

a) it's not the depth of the gravity well, it's the slope, and gas giants aren't particularly lethal on that front (because very large,)

b) gas giants have regions of human-compatible pressure, because again, they're /large/, and run the full gamut from "absurd" to "very low" as you move upwards from the core,

c) Gas giants are, again, /very large/, and there are plenty of regions that are perfectly calm.

This from a guy who just finished ranting about how planets are large and you shouldn't treat them as having a single biome ...

  1. Biology

  /Biology is complicated---so much so that many SF authors suffer from Dunning-Kruger syndrome in approaching the design of life-supporting planets./
#+end_quote

I'd point out that Dunning-Kruger is an urban myth, but then, this whole essay/listicle is basically a giant example of it.

#+begin_quote
  All planets harbour a single X
#+end_quote

Evolutionary niches, what are they? (This is occasionally an issue, but it's so vague ...)

#+begin_quote
  The native flora and fauna use a biochemistry that we can derive sustenance from
#+end_quote

/sigh/ yeah ...

#+begin_quote
  Pay no attention to the native microbiota, they're harmless
#+end_quote

Literally the point after pointing out that /we/ couldn't eat alien lifeforms.

#+begin_quote
  There are no native parasites that might eat Maize, so we can turn the entire largest continent into a robot-run plantation
#+end_quote

... wtf?

#+begin_quote
  Terraforming is really simple; you can do it with algae capsules delivered from orbit
#+end_quote

I mean ... maybe? I'm not sure how "some kind of hypertech tailored algae capsule" equates to "simple" to you, but whatever.

#+begin_quote
  Ecosystems are robust; why not let your ship's cat stretch her legs whenever you land?
#+end_quote

What, a single cat?

#+begin_quote
  photosynthesis
#+end_quote

/glares/ I know, right?

#+begin_quote

  1. Economics

  Everyone uses Money to mediate exchanges of value
#+end_quote

Probably, yeah. Pretty much all human societies do.

#+begin_quote
  Money is always denominated in uniform ratios divisible by 10
#+end_quote

/glances at all modern currencies/ I'm sure we'll go back to pounds and shillings soon enough. this is just a passing fad

#+begin_quote
  Money is made out of shiny bits of metal, OR pieces of green paper, OR credit stored in a computer network
#+end_quote

Green paper is silly, but how often is currency green in scifi? Not /that/ often, right?

Still, alternate currency schemes are interesting. Go forth and create interesting types of currency, y'all.

#+begin_quote
  Planetary credit networks
#+end_quote

We do ... kind of have one of those already?

#+begin_quote
  Barter is a sign of primitive people who haven't invented money
#+end_quote

Economic orthodoxy until recently, but yeah, this isn't how it works.

#+begin_quote
  Because your body is just one of your fungible assets, right?
#+end_quote

What a crazy idea that could never happen.

Anyway, I'm bored now. I think this all makes my point pretty clear - this list is mostly wrong, and unbearably smug all the while.

Also, it makes me extremely dubious about buying Accelerando ... huh, the same guy who wrote this wrote wrote the /Laundry/ series? That was good!

... wait, was he under the impression that those were /hard science-fiction?/
