While I am of the opinion that, in the end, it is up to the reader to make that judgement call, I will admit to a sort of...slow-burning fury that wells up within me whenever I read Sci-Fi with classic dogfighting, or spaceship battles that are just glorified exchanges of cannon fire in space-water where all the ships line up in a pretty formation and fire at each other, or when our intrepid heroes land on an alien planet, grab some kudzu, and chow down because fuck proteins am I right?, or a number of other things that this list covered.

From my perspective, yes, well written soft Sci-Fi is in fact inherently inferior to well written hard Sci-Fi, but well written soft SF is superior to poorly written hard SF.
