I do not think it's a sequel. Bavitz mentioned that it's "an *original* dark and psychological urban fantasy featuring high school girls as protagonists", i. e. not a PMMM fanfiction. Albeit that tweet seems to be deleted, there are still, not to put too fine a point on it, /ways/ to access it.

Bavitz is also active on a Discord server of a subreddit related to one of the two stories OP mentioned, though I'll similarly refrain from mentioning the particulars, since Bavitz seems to value anonymity. Frankly, I already said too much --- the rest could be inferred with a bit of work --- but my desire to share valuable findings is only slightly weaker than my desire to be ethical.
