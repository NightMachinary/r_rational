When I talk about the line, I'm not talking about people fooling Albert. I'm talking about the courts as, in ideal situations, the experiments resolving morality.

For example, how much do I need to /like/ harming others, in my role as a LEO, before it crosses the line of intending to do harm?

I see what you say about Albert taking a direct (although subtle) hand in disrupting martial arts, which would prevent obvious mercenaries from forming. I still think you'd see it, but it would be as hidden and subtle as the traditional martial arts.
