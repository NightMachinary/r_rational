Hrm, while researching this, I came across something startling. I probably will not be able to use it in the book without stretching, but it's fascinating. [[http://scientificbrains.com/5-reaons-why-glial-cells-were-so-critical-to-human-intelligence/][Some types of glial cells seem to have a direct impact on human intelligence.]] At first I was a little concerned about the authenticity of the site, but there are links to several more detailed articles branching off of this article, which basically tied several bits of research together into a condensed article.
