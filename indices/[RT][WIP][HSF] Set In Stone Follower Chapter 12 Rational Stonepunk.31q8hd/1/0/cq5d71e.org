I'm not a dietary or medical professional, only an EMT with some experience treating malnourished elderly patients looking at journal articles. However, my understanding is that the permanent damage caused by starvation only occurs either because of secondary diseases, or when organs are cannibalized for energy. Pretty much anything else can be regrown later. Brain damage seems unlikely to me, because the brain generally has first-go at blood sugar, as long as levels remain high enough that the person hasn't slipped into a diabetic coma (IE, is still moving around), the brain is getting enough sugar to stay alive, though likely not enough to function optimally. Organ damage seems plausible, but a few days is an extremely short time period, even adding time for depletion of reserves. Muscles and subcutaneous fat would likely last at least a day or two, even for a lean individual. I've seen people make full recoveries after weeks without food, though most of them had a decent amount of body fat and were sedentary/neglected by caregivers. There isn't a lot of scholarly research on the pathology of starvation, other than post-mortems on hunger strike victims, and some studies on recovery after neglect and famine. I think a few days after depletion of reserves is overly pessimistic as a threshold for permanent damage, but there isn't a lot of easily accessible research on the subject and someone more familiar with it could give you a better opinion. I might ask my medical director later, he'd likely know more.
