First, let me just say not only am I enjoying your story, but I absolutely love it that the god-like AI is named (and still called) Albert. It's just such a... Dude next door name. It comes across that everyone remembers "people made this, and it's not a god, it's just powerful." Which is fantastic, in part because it means they've had tech loss without going cargo cult.

ANYWAY. Content time!

I had a realization! I think you would develop a really fascinating militant martial art in your world. Not martial art like his mom does - that's a joy-of-body kind of thing - but their version of Krav Maga. An "art" solely about winning, in combat situations.

Because winning here? It's about getting the other person to intentionally harm you /in a non-debilitating way/. You can't kill people, so how do you neutralize a threat? You play within the rules, you play /with/ the rules - but if you "just" defend in the normal way (say, aikido), they can just keep attacking, and you'll have to keep (effectively) defending. You /want/ them to end up harming you, because then Albert neutralizes them... but you also don't want to be maimed.

This also opens up the possibility of mercenaries - because in this world, /that/ is the epitome of the professional fighter. It's a thing that's possible, but it's possible only a weird, almost-but-not-quite aikido kind of way - Combat under Albert is letting the other guy get close enough to actually harm you, but not in a way that's truly bad.

Does that make sense?

PS - What does Albert think of things like sleeper holds? Where's the line that he draws? Do people get to argue about which side of that line their actions are on? Where are the stories that teach people where that line is?
