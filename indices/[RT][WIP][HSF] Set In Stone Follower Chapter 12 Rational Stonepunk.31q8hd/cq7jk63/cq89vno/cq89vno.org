I have perhaps been a little unclear. In most cases, Albert does not engage directly with humans. There are exceptions, however.

Albert is always involved in prison island banishment cases. Every now and then, he might overturn a human decision, or draw in more individuals for questioning. In rare cases, he might even require different/additional people be sent to the prison islands after he investigates.

In the case of martial artists, Albert is trying to break up their internal communications and disrupt the organization of the various schools of martial arts that still exist. Over four thousand years of guiding humans in their views and understanding of violence have resulted in isolation of martial artists as aberrant, so it is very difficult for martial artists to recruit outside of their own families.

Law enforcement officers are taught a very soft martial art which focuses almost exclusively on defending oneself, and/or using the opponent's strength and momentum against them. Since other martial arts are nearly unknown, the law enforcement martial arts are effective against practically anyone.

Albert's rule is that you must intend harm before you are flagged as a violent offender. If harm is unintended you might still face human justice. Crimes of passion are frequently overlooked, provided there is no premeditation. In most cases, there is no need to involve Albert in first or second offence discussions.

The people of Nirvana know what Albert is, what he did to them, and what his goals are. He has not hidden himself or his goals since he emerged. However he has intentionally kept himself behind the scenes, so humans do not grow to depend on him too much. Even though he has not hidden himself, he does do many things that humans are not told about, in his efforts to guide their development. Much as a human parent might do for a human child.

A law enforcement officer can act to defend others or themselves using violence. They can even use violence to try to prevent people from harming themselves. The critical point is that the violence must be used in a mental state of desiring to protect as opposed to intending harm. If there is any question about whether the officer intended to harm or to protect while in the act of being violent, Albert would be brought in, and no human can fool him when directly questioned.

People can and do argue, but if the argument reaches Albert, it is completely unraveled and resolved. Albert is a high functioning AI with over four thousand years experience working with humans, as well as all human electronic records possessed by the colony at the time of his emergence. The only time when there might be any mystery about what occurred in a violent case is if some or all witnesses died or suffered brain damage.

I'm a bit tired writing this, and it feels as if it might be a little repetitive. I'll take a look at it after I catch some sleep and see how bad it is :P

EDIT: Something was bothering me and not letting me sleep, and it finally hit me what it was. *Thank you for reading, and I hope you continue to enjoy the book!*
