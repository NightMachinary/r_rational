Beware of transhumanist art that has it's roots in groups from the 90s... for some reason I've noticed there is a massive bias of 'OMG WE HAVE ANY ART AT ALL?! IT MUST BE GOOD' and it really is not.

like on the actual scales of evaluating art and aesthetic it's mediocre and occasionally clever at best (Orion's arm I am glaring judgmentally at you)
