I just watched that episode, and it wasn't /quite/ as stupid as it seemed. The plan was to lure all the demons inside, have the people on the roof jump down and salt the doors so that the demons couldn't get out, and then do a massive exorcism to get rid of all of them at once while they were trapped inside. If the good guys let the demons in one-by-one it probably would have ended up with one lucky demon taking the good guys down before all of them were inside, so they needed to let them in from multiple places simultaneously.

The advantage of their plan was that they didn't have to kill all the possessed people -- the exorcism drove the demons out without forcing Sam/Dean/etc to shoot all of the host bodies. Your plan would have had a better chance of working, and the plan they used never should have worked...but it did allow them to be heroic.
