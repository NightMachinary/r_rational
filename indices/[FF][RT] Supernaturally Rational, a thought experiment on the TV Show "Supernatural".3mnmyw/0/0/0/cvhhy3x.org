Oof, that's pretty bad.

I'm only in mid-season two so far. There have been a few too many "let's split up!" moments for me to be entirely happy but, for the most part, things have been...at least not unreasonable, albeit not always the way I would do them.

One thing that /does/ annoy me is that Sam is the resident Damsel in Distress. Every single episode, Dean saves him from something. Every time there's a fight, the bad guy gets the upper hand on Sam almost immediately and is choking him / about to stab him / whatever when Dean shoots / punches / whatever it off of Sam. It's irritating. The whole "I need to take care of my little brother" thing is nice character motivation, but it doesn't need to be so one-sided.
