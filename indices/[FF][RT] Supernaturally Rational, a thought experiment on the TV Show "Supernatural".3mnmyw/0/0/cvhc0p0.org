I have to say, one of the absolute worst depictions of tactics I've ever seen was on an episode of Supernatural.

So, the brothers and some other heavily armed people are holed up in a school, protected by a salt ring around the building, while the town outside is overrun by demons. They decide that their only way out is to let the demons in and fight them.

So, obviously, they set up a bunch of barricades to keep the demons in a kill-zone, concentrate all of their fire on the area from behind cover, and open a small break in the salt circle to let the demons come in one at a time, right?

Nope. Each person goes to different part of the school building, wipes away part of the circle, and is immediately surrounded by demons. While two of them wait on the roof.

Granted, the characters were in sort of a "doomed last stand" mode in that scene, but damn was that uncomfortable to watch.
