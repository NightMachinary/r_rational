  Dresden Files plays with it both ways. A form of warfare is seeding the public consciousness with the weaknesses of your enemies (this lead to the near total destruction of the "classic", Black Court vampires, less nimble and adaptable than their enemies)

There's another information war, too: the Oblivion War, where people go around destroying books and etc that contain information about certain Outsiders, because knowing the names of those Outsiders gives them power. It's only mentioned in one particular short story, but it's canon.

  but there is still a Masquerade for some reason, likely because no one actually wants to deal with a humanity that has been growing

Yep. That's actually canon -- it's been mentioned a couple of times that humans occupy this weird niche where everyone has contempt for them as oblivious prey...but also doesn't want to stir them up, because there are a LOT of them, and they have good weapons.

  and the races that exist are just powerful enough that you don't want to make that decision unilaterally. There'd look at you oddly in the next Fantasy UN

By "look at you oddly", I assume you mean "squish your face"?
