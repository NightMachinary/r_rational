Ideally universes would have reasons for why that doesn't happen.

Dresden Files plays with it both ways. A form of warfare is seeding the public consciousness with the weaknesses of your enemies (this lead to the near total destruction of the "classic", Black Court vampires, less nimble and adaptable than their enemies) but there is still a Masquerade for some reason, likely because no one actually wants to deal with a humanity that has been growing and the races that exist are just powerful enough that you don't want to make that decision unilaterally. There'd look at you oddly in the next Fantasy UN (they do actually have some diplomatic system)

Supernatural? Absolutely no one to impose the Masquerade. Which makes it all odd. It's probably the worst time in history for supernatural beings, given our information gathering capabilities.
