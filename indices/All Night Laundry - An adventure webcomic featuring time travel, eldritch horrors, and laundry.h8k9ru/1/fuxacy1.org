Reading this right now, thank you so much for the rec!

This is definitely the best MSPA-inspired (?) thing I've ever seen, both in terms of the visual aesthetic and the plot. I especially like, in addition to all the praise this has already gotten, that the main character is a very /sensible/ person who is not unrealistically smart. Usually, either both of these traits present or neither; here, the author struck a perfect balance.
