Going through it now. Up to chapter 8. It reads well. Interesting story. Might help to have the author get a couple of editors to nitpick through the text - I noticed some your/you're, it's/its, to/too issues. A couple of other homophones which wouldn't be picked up with a spellchecker. Misplaced apostrophes. Some leftover author notes about images yet to be drawn, as well, which haven't been yet. Otherwise not bad!
