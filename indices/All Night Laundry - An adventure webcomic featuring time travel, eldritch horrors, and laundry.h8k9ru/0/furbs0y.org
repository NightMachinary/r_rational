So I once promised someone here that I would let them know when this story was finished and after 6 to 7 years of daily updates, it's complete! Took me a while to realize though, since I haven't checked in on the comic in months. Also, I have completely forgotten who I made that promise to.......

Moving on, here's the summary:

#+begin_quote
  All Night Laundry is an interactive horror webcomic about time travel, dreams, and the problems with identifying monsters. It follows the story of Bina Miryala, a journalism student at McGill University in Montreal. One night in June she went to a laundromat and rather than cleaning the clothes she needed for class the following morning, she landed right the middle of a supernatural mystery. All Night Laundry is written and drawn by Zachary Hall. It was created on the MSPA forums in May of 2013 and it has updated daily ever since.

It's really well-written and drawn with confusing rules about the time travel and monsters where Bina investigates to find the weakness and come up with plans to keep herself and her friends from getting hurt or killed. Unlike other protagonists of the fiction posted here, she's very empathetic and demonstrates a high emotional intelligence to get conflicting personalities to work together in a crisis. I just simply adore her!
