I can definitely give this a strong second. I started reading it when it was recommended here a while ago, and really enjoyed the whole thing through to the end. Definitely check it out if you're interested in well written time travel or Eldritch horror.

There's supposed to be an epilogue at some point, but the author is taking a well deserved break after years and posting every single day.
