Portfolio sense alone is going to make killing the god of death such a pain. He may not get any specifics, but I know I sure wouldnt grant any audiences to uppity mortals if I sensed my death coming.

Guess Jake should be thankful its at least only a god and not a TO build like the emerald legion or the terminator. If he can get an immediate action off it is possible.
