You don't need a magic item to cast Time Stop at will, since deities can do that anyway, as much as they want. There's actually nothing in the rules that indicates that a deity can't stop time for arbitrary amounts of time and exclude himself from the influence of other gods while he does his dirty work. (Well, there's portfolio sense, I guess, and other ways of seeing the future.)
