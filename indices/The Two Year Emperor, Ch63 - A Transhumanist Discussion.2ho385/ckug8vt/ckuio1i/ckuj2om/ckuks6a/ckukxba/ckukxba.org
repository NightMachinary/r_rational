I don't think so. PAO will certainly allow you to specify the physical characteristics of a created person. I would even believe that it could let you specify the physical characteristics, so long as they were within the norms of the species. I can't see any RAW evidence that it would allow you to specify specific details of their mental state, such as which deity they worship.

It works for Neklos because he's not creating worshippers via PAO -- he's creating humans, who can then be immediately eaten by undead in order to convert the PAO'd humans into more undead. Undead generally count as worshippers of Neklos (or, at least, they feed power to him, even if they are clerics of another deity or such), so this gives him a straight powerboost.
