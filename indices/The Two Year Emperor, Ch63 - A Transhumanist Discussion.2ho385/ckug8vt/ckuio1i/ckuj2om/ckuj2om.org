  It wouldn't be easy. Here is a list of the traits of a D&D deity, with Neklos probably being rank 16-20.

"Rank 16-20: Called greater deities, these entities may have *millions of mortal worshipers,*..."

Neklos has a billion worshippers in Anundj√• alone. He is most definitely a rank 20 greater god.

[Orb of Force] Wow. That's an option I hadn't considered. Thanks for the pointer.
