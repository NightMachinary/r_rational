Correct, which just means that they'd be doing average damage instead of maximum damage. That means 35 points per shot instead of 60. Still, multiply that by several hundred thousand (maybe a million? I need to do the math to see how many people have gone through the FLEAs so far) and you'd have enough damage to kill a god.

Except that it wouldn't work, for reasons discussed above re: celerity, foresight, readied actions, portfolio sense. :/
