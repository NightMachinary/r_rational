Yup, I had accounted for average damage in my calculations.

I assumed that they had access to enough level 20 Wizards or Sorcerers that it isn't relevant anymore, so they're all casting it at caster level 20.

Next, I calculated how many can fit in range (300' (60 squares) at caster level 20) using pi * r^{2,} which is 11310 people, rounded down to 10k for easy numbers. This can be increased to ~900k casters by making it a sphere (4/3 * pi * r^{3)} instead of a circle, but there's no need to go crazy (yet). This also assumes that casting past teammates is allowed.

10d6 averages out to 35 damage, with no resistance blocking it out, so that's simple.

Orb of Force is a ranged touch attack, which always succeeds on a natural 20, so 1/20 attacks will hit. Neklos' touch AC is likely in the 60's to 80's, so none will hit on a 19 or lower. There is no save and no SR, so there's no need to worry about that.

The final damage calculation looks like this: 10k people * 35 damage per hit * 0.05 chance to hit = 17500 damage.

A deity with 100d10 hit dice and a constitution score of 100 would have 5500 HP.

Of course, readied actions, foresight, celerity, timestop and other things make this more of an academic exercise than practical advice, but it's a nice thought experiment.
