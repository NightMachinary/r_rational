It wouldn't be easy. [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineRanksAndPowers.htm][Here]] is a list of the traits of a D&D deity, with Neklos probably being rank 16-20.

The only way I can think of is tens (or hundreds) of thousands of readied actions, each chipping away at his thousands of hitpoints, and carefully chosen to avoid his immunities and get enough natural 20's by sheer statistics to overcome his saves, AC, and/or spell resistance.

If Flobovia contains Complete Arcane content, I'd say [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/complete-arcane--55/orb-force--470/][Orb of Force]] is perfect, 10d6 damage with no save or SR. 1/20 casters would automatically hit the ranged touch attack, meaning that 10,000 castings (the most that fits in a 300' radius) would deal about 17k damage, enough to kill most gods.
