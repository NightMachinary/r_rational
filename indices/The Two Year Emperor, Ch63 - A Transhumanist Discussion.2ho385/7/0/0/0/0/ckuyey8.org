(Would've bought it already if it didn't require a somewhat obscure payment processor. I assume there are at least some others for whom the same limiting factor applies (would be strange to have unique reasoning in that regard). The $1 is inconsequential as opposed to entering CC information (doesn't seem to allow me to just do it via PayPal, could be locality based or what have you). Ah well. No such caveats would apply with the Patreon/Kickstarter route.)
