Cool, thank you!

I'm actually planning to move to Malaysia for a while so that I can spend some serious time trying to build passive income. Write prose and / or iPhone apps is the current plan, with a strong inclination towards prose. Knowing that there is at least one person willing to support that effort is reassuring. (The fact that a few people have bought [[http://greendogpress.blogspot.com][One Hot Night]] (</repeated_shameless_plug) is also reassuring.)
