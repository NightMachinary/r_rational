Well, even once the drauga war is dealt with, I still have a few things that I could write about:

1. What the other liches do once Afi / Neklos / both are out of the picture. Some of them would fade away, go back to research. Others would still try their hand at taking over the world now that they've gotten a taste of it. Not all of these would be straight up "kill everything" moves, either. cf Hammond's attempt at a mind-control plague.
2. What the lower-level undead (vampires, etc) do once they don't have a cohesive structure imposed on them from above.
3. The aftermath of the Drauga War -- how Anundjå pick up the pieces in terms of their population and economy.
4. What it's like living in Anundjå after they aren't fighting for their lives, but they've been packed-cheek-to-jowl refugees for the past N years.
5. What it was like living in Anundjå /before/ the Drauga War.
6. Things that happened during the Drauga War that happened offscreen -- for example, I have a great idea for a short story about Albrecht defending the Legion camp when it was first attacked (see chapter 39 for a summary description).\\
7. The political scene in Flobovia -- Jake trying to administer the country now that Anundjå is part of it, and the Conclave of Lords has gotten used to running things without him.
8. The end of Jake's reign, when it's time for him to go home, and what happens after. (I actually have some sketched-out plans for that.)

That said, 2YE has been a LOT of work. If I were going to continue it, I would move away from the D&D framework, convert the sequels to straight original fantasy, put it up with a Patreon or a Kickstarter, and eventually try to sell them on Kindle / Nook / iTunes / whatever.

I even have some ideas on the Patreon / Kickstarter thing -- letting readers help shape the story by voting with their dollars. I'd have final say, of course, but rewards at various levels would include cameos, addition of minor characters, introduction of plot points, etc.

I should add that I've done a test novella along these lines, which is available on [[http://GreenDogPress.blogspot.com][GreenDogPress]]. It's called "One Hot Night", and it's a story about Anundjå before the Drauga War. It's on sale for $1 -- it was my MVP to see if people would buy my writing at any price. Sales have happened, which means I'm more comfortable with the idea of more writing.

Hm. Come to think of it, 2YE is very clearly satire, much like [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html][Order of the Stick]]. Rich Burlew has published compilations of OOTS, so I could probably publish 2YE as is. Hmm...
