How to kill a god. Cast statue on a person (or a PAO insect if you want to be sneaky). They can now, as a free action, turn into a living statue or back, and their equipment and garments change with them.

Use true creation or whatnot to create a sphere with anti matter inside. Have the person take said object and turn into a statue of granite. Have a companion then smash up the object that previously contained antimatter.

As a free action the person can turn back into a human and an object that is made of antimatter and is mixed with matter and make a big boom.

Suppose instead you want to just kill the god.

Cast crown of flame, a spell with an emanation effect of 2d6 damage to evil undead, on 2000 commoners. Use PAO to turn them into lice or some similar insect. Tell them to stand on a spell component and put them in your spell pouch, which blocks line of sight and the emanation. Find Neklos and get within ten feet. As a free action, faster than the immediate action of celerity, draw out your spell component and do a minimum of 2000 damage per round.
