It is assumed that you have all your ingredients in there and should be possible to put something in and draw it out. If it's a particular issue you could just do an ice assassin spell and have a particular aspect of flesh from a creature that you use or diamond dust. Presumably whatever component of flesh or diamond you use exists independently of the pouch.
