Readied actions explicitly occur before their trigger. So I would read that scenario as:

1. Casters ready an action "Shoot Neklos as soon as he appears."
2. Casters readied actions go off (trying to cast whatever).
3. Neklos appears (triggering Casters readied actions).
4. Neklos' uses his standard from celerity (casting Time Stop)\\
   4(a). Now in a 5 round Time Stop, Neklos does whatever he wants (including more time stops) until he returns to normal time and..
5. Neklos takes an immediate action to cast Celerity (triggering an "as if readied" action)
6. Neklos is now dazed

Since the casters spells actually try to go off before Neklos appears, their readied actions would fail. They cannot cast a spell at a target that is not actually present (unless they were aiming at his square with an aoe or casting a spell that didnt require a target).

Neklos then appears. He decides to immediate action celerity, but only /after/ he uses the standard action celerity will grant him to cast Time Stop. When he exits his Time Stop, his casting of celerity will finish and he spends a round afterwards dazed.

Stupid, but RAW.

If the caster's readied an action for whenever Neklos acted like a giant evil windbag, that would guarantee that it will go off and with a valid target in sight.

An immediate definitely trumps a readied action, as it can explicitly interrupt other actions. Thinking more on it, I am inclined to agree that if you are triggering a readied action with an immediate then:

(a) your immediate (ie your trigger) would go off before the other readied action

(b) your readied action would go off before your immediate action

and so (c) Your readied would come before your opponent's
