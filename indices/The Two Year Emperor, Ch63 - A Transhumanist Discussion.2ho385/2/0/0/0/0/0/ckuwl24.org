I'd say you're right on all of this. Which just means that Neklos gets to freeze time and keep it frozen for as long as he'd like. So, Neklos wins.

Now, here's the interesting thing: two gods with Alter Reality. Both decide to use it to cast Celerity / Time Stop. What happens?

Note that I'm not entirely certain that Time Stop would freeze time re other gods. I think they would probably be able to enter the TS with you. Not sure if RAW supports that, but if not then I would houserule it in because otherwise it's too easy for one god to take out another.
