Also an option, since you 3x overkill him:

1/2 ready for "When Neklos appears(attosecond?)" 1/2 ready for "When Neklos uses Celerity"

(Optional, split a third for "When Neklos casts Time Stop")

If he uses Celerity, then the second group goes before the Celerity goes off via the rules for readied actions. If he does not, the first group waste him.

The thing is, an immediate action uses your swift action for the next round. You only get one of them per character per round. You can't double Celerity.

Thus, readied actions between high level characters become an elaborate double bluff: Do you ready against their actual actions or appearance, or against their celerity? Celerity beats the readied against basic actions, and basic actions beat readied against Celerity.

The side with the ability to simultaneously ready for more different potential scenarios will win.

This is sort of a continuation of D&D optimization at it's most basic: The Action Economy is a harsh mistress. It is very very difficult for a single +5 CR or so opponent to threaten 5-6 optimized PCs for that reason, they have 500% more actions.

It's also why 3.0 Haste, Time Stop, and Celerity are some of the top spells in D&D - they give you more actions or let you take your actions first.
