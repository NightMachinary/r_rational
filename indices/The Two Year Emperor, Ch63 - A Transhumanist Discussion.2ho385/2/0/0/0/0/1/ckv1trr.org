Hm, actually, it occurs to me that's it's easy to beat the "readied action goes off at the wrong time" problem.

Instead of readying the action: "Orb of Force as soon as Neklos appears" (which goes off BEFORE he appears and therefore self-spoils)...

...ready the action: "Orb of Force one attosecond after Neklos appears."
