Hm.

Celerity: "This spell works like lesser celerity, except that you pull even more time into the present. When you cast this spell, you can immediately take a standard action, as if you had readied an action. You can even interrupt another creature's turn when you cast this spell. However, after you take the standard action granted by this spell, you are dazed until the end of your next turn."

It's an immediate action to cast. "An immediate action is a swift action that can be performed at any time---even if it's not your turn."

The way it reads to me is:

1. Casters ready an action: "Shoot Neklos as soon as he appears."
2. Neklos appears.
3. Casters readied actions trigger.
4. Neklos takes an immediate action (which can be done at any time, even on not-your-turn) to pre-empt the casters and cast Celerity, giving him a standard action.
5. Neklos uses that action to cast Time Stop. Neklos wins.

...unless, of course, it's a surprise round and Neklos were not aware of his attackers, then he would not be able to act, at all. Hence he couldn't use an immediate action to cast Celerity, and therefore he would lose.

...unless, of course, he had used his Alter Reality power to cast Foresight some time in the last few hours. In that case, he can't be surprised, so he /would/ have the immediate action, so he would win.

...although, of course, even if he /hadn't/ cast Foresight, his portfolio is still Death. Since he's divine rank 20, that means that his Portfolio Sense ability is: "Greater deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios, regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses extend one week into the past and one week into the future for every divine rank they have." So, he's known for 20 weeks that he was going to be killed, and can therefore act to prevent himself from being killed. So, Neklos wins.

So, yeah. I think Neklos wins if you try to just ambush him and shoot him to death.
