Alter Reality takes a standard even when casting spells that are normally faster. But I assume somewhere in his 30-50 class levels he can cast foresight and celerity on his own.

Assuming casters are using readied actions and Neklos casts celerity, what I am trying to figure out is: who goes first?

Celerity's standard specifically states it goes off "as if you had readied an action" and a readied action "occurs just before whatever triggers it". Amusingly that means the standard action celerity grants actually occurs just before celerity is cast and this is just readied vs readied then. The immediate action and its "very small amount of time" doesnt even come into play until afterwards, even though its the immediate action feature of interrupting that lets him cast it in the first place.

I know the "readied action" bit in celerity is usually ignored and people simply rule it LIFO, but a stricter reading makes it a bit of a conundrum. If there was a clear trigger on each side it would be much easier to determine, but since celerity's trigger is celerity itself I have no idea.
