  Heh. Yeah. Although, you'd probably still lose. Neklos would use his Alter Reality power to simulate a Celerity, giving him a standard action before anyone else, even if it's a surprise round. He then casts Time Stop, giving him 2-5 rounds. He spends the first round of the Time Stop being dazed from the Celerity, then uses the second round to cast another Time Stop, which resets the counter to "2-5 rounds". He uses the first round to do something, then Time Stops again. Lather, rinse, repeat until you're all dead.

Could you beat that with readied actions?

Like, say you have a custom magic item that casts PAO, turning itself into antimatter, or something. (Maybe make it turn into anti-water and put it in a sacred vessel, just to see if you can get a holy antimatter explosion) You have one person ready an action to push the button upon Neklos performing any action. Then even if Neklos uses alter reality to subvert the surprise round, you /stll/ have the bomb go off before he moves.

I mean, overwhelming force prolly isn't the way you kill a god, but if you figure out something that /does/ work, then could you use a setup like that to get them before they could react?
