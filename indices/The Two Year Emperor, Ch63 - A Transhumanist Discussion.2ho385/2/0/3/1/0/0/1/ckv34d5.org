Second PAO totally trumps the first, but the original vs enchanted state wording does make it a bit debateable.

A rock polymorphed into a human, what is its original state when we cast PAO again? Can we make that permanant with another PAO?

If we consider original just meaning to refer to the state before the current spell was cast, then yes we can. But if original is taken to mean its natural, base form before magic was used to alter it, then no- it would just refresh the duration.

I would say either is a valid interpretation. I cant even guess which one is closer to RAI.

While I doubt the designers ever intended the gross violations we use, I could see the capability for permanent change being desired in this swiss army knife version of polymorph. Baleful polymorph lets you do permanent after all, so its not that far out there.
