If you cast Time Stop while inside a Time Stop, it simply resets the duration instead of nesting the spells. I am pretty certain that this is a general rule--that a second application overwrites the first--although I can't think where it is at the moment.

If, as I believe, that's true, then the second casting of PAO would overwrite the first and reset the duration to "Permanent."

In any case, I'm not aware of any RAW that says a spell stops working if the target becomes invalid. It might be there is, but I'm not aware of it.

EDIT: AHA! I found it off of pareus's 'Combining Magical Effects' link:

#+begin_quote
  Same Effect with Differing Results

  The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more than once. Usually the last spell in the series trumps the others. None of the previous spells are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell in the series lasts.

So, clearly, a second casting of PAO trumps the first casting.
