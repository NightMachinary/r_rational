It took me an embarrassingly long time to notice that it was called transhumanist because they discuss killing death. And should Jake not POPE himself before making such adventurous plans? He doesn't know it will fail, and a plan to kill a god requires as high mental stats as he can acquire

I have absolutely no idea how Jake plans to kill Deathboy, but given that the gods appear to have insanely OP abilities, i doubt it will be anything to do with causing damage in a direct fight. Having an audience itself seems quite risky, unless he gets a guarantee of safety beforehand.
