The two liches re-pao from mite to humanoid somewhere private. One takes off the amulet and hands it to its partner. It then sends its messages and immediately begins tapdancing. The other lich has a readied action, to put the amulet back on its partner upon them tapdancing. Since readied actions always happen immediately before the trigger, the lich will only be vulnerable for the brief fraction of a turn that it takes to send the message. Probability of detection by anything short of a god is pretty dang low.
