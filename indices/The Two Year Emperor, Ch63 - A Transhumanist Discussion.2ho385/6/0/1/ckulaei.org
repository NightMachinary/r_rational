WIS seems pretty useful for a plan of this nature. I had meant that shouldn't Jake wait a day to POPE himself before making such plans? And has Jake tried asking fragment about making custom items capable of granting more stat points?

Jake asks what would happen if Deadboy wasn't around any more which, combined with your subtle hints, seems less of a euphemism and more of a plan to get him to leave their planet or plane alone. Which seems a lot more plausible for them to do. I might have guessed that Jake would suggest Neklos move everything to another planet so they can live in peace, but Jake forgot that and all similar plans. No other plans spring to mind.
