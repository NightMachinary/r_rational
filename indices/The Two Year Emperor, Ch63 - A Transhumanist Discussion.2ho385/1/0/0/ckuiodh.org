Some? /chuckle/

There's large chunks of complete crap in here. If I run into one more female character with "high, firm breasts", I may yarf. I find it fairly squicky that Herzer spent three books boinking Bast who (it took me a while to realize) looks like she's /14/ even though she's over 2000...no, wait, 1000, no, wait...oh hell, Ringo, get it right! Also, the "Elves are better! And defy physics! And get new powers as the plot demands!" is a bit annoying.

Despite all of that, these things are big-time page turners. I'm crashing through the last one this evening and it's hard to put down.
