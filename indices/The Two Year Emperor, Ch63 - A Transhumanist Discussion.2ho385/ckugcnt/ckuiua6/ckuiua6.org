  Polymorph Any Object can be cast twice to make it permanent? I think it just edged into the lead as Most Broken Spell in D&D.

Yep. If you, say, PAO a pebble into a human then it lasts for 20 minutes...but if you PAO a human into a human, it's permanent. So, PAO the pebble into a human, then PAO /that/ human into itself. Boom, permanent.

  On the other hand, killing Afi is as simple a matter as yelling "Hey Neklos, guess what your avatar's been doing behind your back!",

Indeed. The problem with that is that doing it means giving away your position to Neklos, which tends to result in squishage. (Currently Shailos, Arros, and a few other gods are working together to keep Our Heroes out of Neklos's sight.)

The heroes actually have several ways to win, or at least better their position, at this point:

1. Remove Neklos. Afi will then /probably/ go back to doing research instead of trying to conquer the world.
2. Remove Afi. Now the other Lich Kings become much less engaged (except when Neklos is directly supervising), and Neklos is in charge directly. Good thing, because he'd be a crappy general.
3. Reduce Neklos's power enough that the Team Good gods beat him.
4. Cause enough dissension in the ranks that Afi gets tied down fighting internal battles instead of fighting our heroes.

  Summoning [Neklos] into a canyon full of level 60 casters under your command is probably a good place to start, though.

Heh. Yeah. Although, you'd probably still lose. Neklos would use his Alter Reality power to simulate a Celerity, giving him a standard action before anyone else, even if it's a surprise round. He then casts Time Stop, giving him 2-5 rounds. He spends the first round of the Time Stop being dazed from the Celerity, then uses the second round to cast another Time Stop, which resets the counter to "2-5 rounds". He uses the first round to do something, then Time Stops again. Lather, rinse, repeat until you're all dead.

Although...if you got a surprise round on him and had enough firepower, MAYBE you could get it done.
