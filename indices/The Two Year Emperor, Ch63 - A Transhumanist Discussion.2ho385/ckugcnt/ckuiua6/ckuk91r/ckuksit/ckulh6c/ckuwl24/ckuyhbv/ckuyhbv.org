The last person to cast celerity would win I believe. God_1 does something, God_2 interrupts with an immediate action celerity<-time stop, God_1 interrupts the time stop with their own immediate action celerity<-time stop. (It feels so wrong to have those arrows that way, but easier to read.)

Following the same logic for why celerity lets you go before a readied action, the resolution order would be:

God_1 does something

God_1 casts time stop

God_1 casts celerity and is then dazed

God_2 casts time stop

God_2 casts celerity and is then dazed

Contingency spells add another layer to that and it can easily spiral out even more with more tricks, but still it should be LIFO in the end.

Without the spell stowaway epic feat, nothing I know of offhand lets you share another caster's time stop. Time stop is so very broken that once you come out of it, you've regained your immediate action and can interrupt your own celerity to do other things...and so can the 10 million ice assassins of your opponnent you made during your infinite-me-time.
