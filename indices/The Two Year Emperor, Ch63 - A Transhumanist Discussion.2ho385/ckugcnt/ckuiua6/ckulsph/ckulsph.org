  Polymorph Any Object
#+end_quote

from the SRD: This spell functions like polymorph, except that it changes one object or creature into another. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state. The duration is determined by using the following guidelines.

That's fairly clear cut to me. PAO causes an object to have two states, the original form, and the enchanted form. When you cast PAO a second time, you don't get a different original form, you're just changing the enchanted form.

A much more sensible spell to use would be Reduce Person. It can be permanencied, and each time you cast it explicitly halves the affected target's size. No mention of limits regarding original form or multiple use. Thirteen halvings reduces 2m to a quarter of a mm, and the only real restriction is that each casting reduces your STR by 2.

Getting 27 Strength to survive the 13 castings is possible in many ways, or using some other method to become 6 inches tall, which would reduce your need to only 9 castings and thus 19 STR.

But yeah, try not to overuse PAO, it's broken enough without skipping around that restriction by fast-talking the DM. It's much more fun to see the "useless" spells being cheesed.
