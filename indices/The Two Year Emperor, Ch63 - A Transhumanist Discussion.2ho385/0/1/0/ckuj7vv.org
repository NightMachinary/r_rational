Well, /Mindscrape/ is Mind-Affecting, and deities are immune to those anyway. I was thinking that perhaps they were going to make a new version of /Mindscrape/ that only affected the spiritual component in order to flip his alignment, but you're right that this would create a number of problems with regards to his saves. I had also been thinking that they could just fire on him /en masse/ in the hopes that he would roll of 1, but on rereading the rules for divine ranks, apparently deities aren't subject to automatic failure on a 1 when making saves. And if he's divine rank 16 or higher, he's assumed to be taking 20 on the save, which makes it even more difficult. All that could potentially be overcome through incredible feats of optimization, but /Mindscrape/ is still Mind-Affecting, so they'd have to make a new version that only held the spiritual component anyway.

So I'm not sure what's going to happen now - I have no idea what kind of plan Jake has come up with that he's so sure will work.
