"I am imagining a magic item that shall be called Neumann's Priest. It looks like a Pope Hat with its tip flattened into the form and substance of a clock. Upon activation it releases the Time Stop spell stored within. In the first round of the Time Stop spell effect, it casts Quickened Greater Teleport to increase its distance from me by a billion miles, and Wishes into existence a Neumann's Priest into the cavity one might expect to accept a head. In the second round, it activates it. Over its next three subjective rounds, it uses True Conjuration, Polymorph Any Object and Mindscrape to create from scratch a worshipper for me. I Wish to wear a Neumann's Priest."

Then use the infinite worshippers to crush the other Gods like bugs.

Edit: Or just make a magic item that allows you to cast Time Stop at will and take all the time you need to create worshippers. Or have Jake come up with infinite plans, which is probably worse.
