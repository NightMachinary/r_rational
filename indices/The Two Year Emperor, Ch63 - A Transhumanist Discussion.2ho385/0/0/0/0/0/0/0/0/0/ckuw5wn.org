There's something of a Geneva Convention among the gods that limits how they are permitted to act against each other and in the world. As a god, your worshipers have a lot more leeway than you do. For Neklos to directly create worshipers would get him squished. Allowing his worshipers to directly create worshipers for him would either get them squished or him squished, depending. Creating humans who can then immediately be turned into worshipers...that's a bit of a grey area.

tl;dr -- he found something of a loophole in the rules of the gods and is Munchkining for all it's worth.
