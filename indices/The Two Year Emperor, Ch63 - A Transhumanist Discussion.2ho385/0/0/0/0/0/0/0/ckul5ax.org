Pretty sure the other gods would straight up kill any god that tried that. Right now the gods are being polite, keeping it to a proxy war. They don't want to actually go after each other directly, because that could actually lead to fatalities and who wants to risk that? Much better to just jockey up and down the rank ladder.
