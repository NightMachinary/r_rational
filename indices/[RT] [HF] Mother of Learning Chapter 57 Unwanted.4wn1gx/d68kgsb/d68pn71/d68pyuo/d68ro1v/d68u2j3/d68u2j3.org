Zorian assumes RR is a necromancer because RR has openly boasted about his extroverted soul perception. While having soul sight is not the definitive proof of being a necromancer, it is a particularly strong evidence for it.

As for Zach's disappearance, this is complicated by Tesen not being trustworthy at all. Let's say on the start of the loop Tesen finds Zach's soulless corpse. Tesen knows that people know that he has been looting Noveda, but outright killing Zach in his sleep (and that's the reasonable assumption when the boy is found mysteriously dead) is beyond what's acceptable. He shoves the corpse into a pocket dimension and announces his eccentric ward has totally disappeared! He can even hire investigators in earnest to maintain plausibility.

The reasonable assumption was that the Gate was simply detecting soul damage done to the Controller and has abandoned remaking controllers body(ies) in favor of giving the soul time to heal. Zorian's soul was either more resilient or got less damaged and got healed faster.
