I had forgotten about Sudomir's soul sight, but Zorian doesn't try to hide himself entirely from Sudomir at any point anyway. Probably because Zorian's presence in Iasku mansion was such that it couldn't be disguised in the first place, breaking stuff and destroying undead to get the innermost rooms of the mansion.

For the moment, I'll continue to find it suspicious that RR congratulates Zorian on hiding himself from his soul perception, goes on to talk about how great he is at soul magic (since he just used it to kill the aranea, which was a lie), and then grabs Zorian and slams him into a wall, and then attempts to read Zorian's mind (without any chants or gestures). One of the big appeals of Daimen as RR had to me was the idea that Daimen might be an inferior mind mage, which would explain RR's mental abilities.

Making a person disappear entirely would have one advantage over simply eliminating their soul, which is that other people are less likely to know for sure that the person is gone. Still, I'll admit that it would be an odd mechanic. Could the Guardian have collected Zach immediately due to the soul damage, and put his body in a place he couldn't be reached? If that was the case, maybe the Guardian did the same for Veyers for some reason?
