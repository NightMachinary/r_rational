But was it really soul sight and not some other sense?

RR manages to locate Zorian just a few paragraphs later, despite Zorian still hiding himself from soul sight. Lying about /how/ you're tracking someone seems like a good way to catch them. He does seem to know that Zorian is hiding his soul though, so there is some evidence for him being a soul mage, unless he was just guessing.

True, Tesen isn't trustworthy, but I feel like Zach's disappearance was legit. Zach being dead at the start of a loop fulfills one of the conditions for the loop to reset, so I'm not fond of that idea. Zach being in a coma would work better, but I don't see why Tesen would need to hide it in either case. There's not really a reason for people to suddenly start suspecting him of foul play, (other than Zach in a coma) and if lies can be detected with great accuracy in this world, he should be able to tell the truth and clear any suspicions regarding himself.

My thoughts are more in line with your "reasonable assumption", Zach's body simply wasn't created for those first loops, or it was created and immediately moved into a special location to facilitate the recovery of his soul. RR had a decent idea of when Zorian entered the loop, which I assume was based on when Zach's disappearances began.

Too bad Zorian didn't investigate Veyers' disappearance more in earlier loops, I'd like to know if this is a consequence of RR leaving or something established many loops ago. If there was a controller ability to keep someone's body from appearing in the loop, that would be pretty significant.
