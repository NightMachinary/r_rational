Zorian barged into the cultist gate guns blazing, with reasonable expectations of being confronted by necromancers (because Ibasans) and a possibility, albeit small, of facing RR himself. He had been preparing for this assault for at least a month. Of course he had every possible ward and defense up including soul defenses and still Sudomir bypassed them.

Still, of course, every RR's word is suspect. We can be certain only about his mind magic, because he used it.

The way the safeguards against soul tampering are set up for the Controller ultimately depends on lots of intricate worldbuilding questions. I.e. does a soul need a living body to heal? If no, what happens to the souls of the dead in the loop? Since there is no afterlife for them to move on do they simply float for a month before the current SG-iteration is collapsed? It could be that a soul needs only time to heal. In this case the Guardian will simply place Controller's soul in the control room (or whatever this weird place where they talked to the Guardian was called), which is probably the safest place for a Controller to be, and wait.
