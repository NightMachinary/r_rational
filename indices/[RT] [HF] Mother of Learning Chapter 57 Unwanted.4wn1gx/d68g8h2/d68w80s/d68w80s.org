Well, if they got together it might be kinda contrived. Since part of the reason they're such good foils could be the spell that qtach ichl cast on them to try to combine their souls or something. So I guess you could kind of say they're soul mates in a sense I guess, but only because an evil lich tampered with their souls.

As for Xvim/Alanic I don't think there's been any contextual evidence for that whatsoever. No hints that they've ever interacted before. It would have been kinda funny though.
