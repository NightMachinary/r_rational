I'm mostly just being flip, honestly; you'd have to rewrite the entire story to make Z/Z make sense and be interesting, and it'd almost have to take the place of something else, since piling a romance subplot on top of everything else would be a bit crazy. Surprised it's so controversial as to get a cross, but hey.

And I'm only joking about X/A, mostly as an excuse to talk about what actually happened in this chapter.
