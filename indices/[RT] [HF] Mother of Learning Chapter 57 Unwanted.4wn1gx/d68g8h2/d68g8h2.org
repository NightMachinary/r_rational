This is a bit tangential, but to be totally honest, I've gotta say: I ship Zach/Zorian p. hard. It's not remotely supported by the text or even slightly indicated subtextually, but still, they have a lot of chemistry. Zach is a really good foil for Zorian, and props to [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]] on that score; I was legitimately surprised at how well he slotted into the story, given that he had been purposefully put on a bus for large swaths of the text.

Also, this was a good chapter, because I /also/ ship Xvim/Alanic. I'm excited to see what happens here; Alanic's presence is likely helpful, since we have every reason to believe he's got pretty high-level connections with the church and the military.
