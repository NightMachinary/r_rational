I dunno, I'm pretty sure that romance sits at the heart of some of the most iconic works of fiction. It's true that when it's done poorly, it's uniquely terrible, but I'm inclined to think it's /easy/ compared to the complicated plot work nobody103's doing; it's one thing to put together a mystery plot, but doing it so that you tell a satisfying mystery in a serial format seems even harder, since you can't go back and edit in that subtle foreshadowing that nobody103's so good at.

Z/Z obviously is not a real thing that can happen in the story at this point. But I call it compelling because romance is a good vector for conflict, and these characters and their motivations would be interestingly complicated by additional tension in their relationship. I don't think /MoL/ would necessarily be better for it, given that the space that sort of thing would take up has been used to tell a story from an arguably more original POV, but I can see how it'd be an interesting alternative.
