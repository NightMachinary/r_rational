Really enjoy the recent chapters! In the past it used to be monologues and hell lots of doubts and speculations, but now with Zach it really add more flavors into the story and have a more positive vibes when reading it. Interesting to see how an additional character really change the whole mood of the story and really affects Zorian and his thought process
