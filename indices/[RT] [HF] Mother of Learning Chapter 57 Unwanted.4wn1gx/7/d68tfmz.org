I like that the major problems with VB!RR have been addressed. There is more to it than simple teenage classmates 3-way drama.

And team Xvilanic is gonna tear ZZ a new one, hue hue hue. On that note, I wonder if Alanic knows a tidbit or two about Boranovas. An expert fire mage could know something about expert fire House.

Wait... House Boranova is the Fire Nation!? [[/lunalaugh][]]
