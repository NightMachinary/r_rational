What I'd really like to know at this point is more about the Time Loop. The identity of the Maker isn't known, but it seems like a good bet would be on this being a god... Except what reason would a god have to give a human ever few hundred years 11 lifetimes worth of experience and magic on a fixed date?

In this case it's fortuitous that it ended up being around the time a primordial was going to be released, but under normal circumstances, it doesn't seem likely that anything of that significance would be occurring. We do know that one Sovereign Gate user established the Ikosian Empire so maybe it was intended to help advance humanity? And it was implied by the Spirit that it used to be common (every few centuries or so on the planar alignment), was the Gate being used to occasionally shove humans forward?

It would also be nice to know more about the gods and why they left...
