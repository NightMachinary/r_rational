Regardless of whether Veyers is RR, Zach and Veyers have gone through completely different events. Even if Veyers was RR, why should RR leaving have the same effect as the Lich trying to combine Zach's and Zorian's souls had on Zach's existence? What's weird is that it does seem to be giving the same results, as far as Zorian's information gathering is concerned.

Granted, while Zorian himself didn't have the resources or skills he does now back in loops 2-7, it's still odd that absolutely nothing could be found regarding Zach in those loops. And overall, Zach's disappearance then was a bigger deal than Veyers' is now. Investigators hired by Zach's guardian and other interested parties couldn't find any trace of him.

Even though we've had the loop explained, it still has some plot relevant mysteries to it, such as the mechanism or entity that made Zach disappear entirely for loops 2-7.

One other thing that's been bothering me, that came up again this chapter. Zorian is still assuming RR is a necromancer, despite never seeing him perform any necromancy. "Soulkill" was never a necromantic spell at all, just a time loop specific one, RR could have been misdirecting Zorian to throw him off by naming it as such. RR somehow manages to track him down while Zorian is invisible and shielded from Soul Sense, which could be explained by mind sense or any other non-visual detection abilities.
