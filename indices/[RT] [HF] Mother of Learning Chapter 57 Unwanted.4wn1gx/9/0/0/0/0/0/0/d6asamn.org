That's an interesting question. I'll go with soul sight.

Zorian had learned the very basics of soul protection before ch 26. His only mentor, if you can even call him that, was Kael. His soul defenses were extremely shoddy. It also seems that he has not mastered absolute soul defense in the current chapter. Maybe there is none, unlike mind magic and Mind Blank. In any case, even after Alanic's lessons he was still vulnerable to Sudomir's soul sight. The necromancer could even tell when Zorian activated his soul marker to reset the time loop. So of course Red Robe was able to find him.

The ability to have someone's body disappear would be fairly useless, if you have an ability to make anyone a soulless corpse. The only difference would be that someone disappearing is less disturbing then someone being found mysteriously dead.

However, you got me thinking, such ability is from entirely different class than "Soul Eject" ability. Modifying the physical world Template could be very useful and it makes sense to grant Controllers such ability. No need to gather crystallized mana and alchemical ingredients each restart when you can simply tell the Guardian create you some in the next restart. I wish Z&Z brute-guessed some info of the Controller abilities from the Guardian. He is, after all, obliged to answer a direct yes/no question about a particular ability.
