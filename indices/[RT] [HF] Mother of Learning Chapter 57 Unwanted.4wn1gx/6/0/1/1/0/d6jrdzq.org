Eeeeh, hard to tell.

IIRC Alanic was awed by the marker's complexity. so he can't. Xvim may be a good enough mage to handle such complex spell patterns, but then does he have an extroverted soul sight? Introverted absolutely, he is a DADA master after all, but extroverted perception may or may not fit his moral framework. So, who knows.

Maybe by their powers combined they could do this, but I think this is unlikely for story-wise reasons. If they manage to create a significant number of loopers, the 'real world' fight once they exit the loop is no match for them, because there are so many of them.
