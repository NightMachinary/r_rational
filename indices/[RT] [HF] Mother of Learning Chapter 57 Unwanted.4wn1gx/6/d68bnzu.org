So how much will Z&Z have to reveal now one cat is out of the bag? If Zorian reveals that he's a very good mind mage I'm worried Xvim might have a bit of a reaction. Even if Xvim is okay with it Zorian is going to have some gruelling soul protection lessons ahead.

Having Xvim and Alanic involved would be a massive help regardless.
