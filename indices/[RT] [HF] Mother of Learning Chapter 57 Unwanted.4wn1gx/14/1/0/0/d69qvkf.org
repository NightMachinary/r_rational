I didn't mean during the loop though, he himself said that he wouldn't contact Raynie any longer while it was going.

Z/Z could work if Zorian was bi, which I just don't see happening, he made his view of Taiven sexiness very explicit when he initially described her, so there's no doubt about him being interested in women, but he has never shown any such views on men.

I'm also happy that there's no romance, it usually ends up being fairly crass and often bloat out of proportion to take over the plot and romance pretty much only works as a side dish so it's pretty bad when that happens.
