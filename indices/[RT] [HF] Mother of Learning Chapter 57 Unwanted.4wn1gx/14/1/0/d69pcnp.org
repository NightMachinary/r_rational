I think it'd be a stretch for nobody103 to include anybody as a romantic partner for Zorian at this point, except as some sort of aside in an epilogue that follows some kind of time skip. As Zach pointed out last chapter, Zorian hasn't thought much at all of the romantic possibilities of the time loop, and it's hard to see him turning to that at this point.

I don't miss the romantic subplot here, fwiw; I think Z/Z would probably be the most compelling possibility if one were to add such a subplot, especially given the mechanics of soul magic and etc., but it would arguably slow down the narrative of a very plot-driven piece of work. Part of what works about /MoL/ is its approach to the time loop gimmick, and given how many time loop stories include romance as the main plot driver, it's refreshing to see nobody103 eschew that in favor of worldbuilding density and plot elegance. Very Nasu-esque, really, all while avoiding the pitfalls that Nasu falls for in his H-game plots.
