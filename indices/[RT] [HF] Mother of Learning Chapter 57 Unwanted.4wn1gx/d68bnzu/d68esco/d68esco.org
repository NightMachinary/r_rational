Just to recap, what do they each know?

Alanic knows that they were targeted by some soul magic, and that both of their souls now have a marker. He knows that Xorian has some knowledge about sensing his soul, and that Zach is a novice. He probably knows that both are inordinately good magicians for their apparent age (depending on how exactly they saved his and Lukav's lives), and may be aware that they can both teleport. He also had to find it strange how Zorian spoke about him as if they were acquaintances, and seemed to know Xvim. (Although it was fairly obvious, he still somehow knew that Xvim was a person's name rather than a place or a training method, and he also knew right away that it was a reference to a man and not a woman.)

Xvim, on the other hand, knows that the time loop is a thing, and that Zorian and Zach are "endlessly" repeating this same month. He most likely knows that the Astral Plane is currently disconnected from their plane of existence, since he's told Zorian in the past that this is one of the most convincing things that he could be told to believe in the time loop. He also knows that both Zorian and Zach have very developed shaping skills, and that Zorian has been his student for a long time, going so far as respecting him as his master. He can also easily guess that this is really Zach's first time spending a restart as one of his students. Beyond that, all I can think of that he would also know would be whatever anecdotes and circumstantial evidence Zorian would have told him to convince him of the time loop.

As far as I can tell, neither is currently aware of the Sovereign Gate's usage or that Cyoria's time magic research facility is involved in any way, they are unaware of the invasion, unaware that Sudomir is a necromancer and built a spiritual sinkhole. They are most likely unaware of the deaths of all of the people with working knowledge of soul magic around Knyazov Dveri. They are also unaware that Zorian is a mind mage, although Xvim at least must have strong suspicions that Zorian is very knowledgeable in the field, after his talk with Zach. And they are unaware of the exact purpose of the soul marker.

Did I miss anything that they could have taught each other about the time loop and Z&Z?
