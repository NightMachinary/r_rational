A good summary, though the attack on Lukav is definitely hinting at something. They might be able to deduce something from that. The real kicker is what they are going to ask Z&Z since they'll have to be honest since I think Alanic might have some lesser form of truth detection like the priestess or at least was able to recognise he taught Zorian his soul sense and thus will be sceptical.
