To be honest, he never told a lie about him, afaik.

  "I was just joking, mister Kazinski," [...] "If I really wanted to meet this 'Xvim', I would have sought him out on my own. With a name like that, I doubt he'd be hard to find."

He asked for an introduction (which could be done merely to see how he'd go about doing this, whether or not he and Xvim are already acquaintances), stated that he knew "Xvim" was an exotic name, and that he'd be easy to find. He never claimed that he didn't know him. Merely spoke in such a way as to give that impression.

Until next chapter, we won't know if they were previously acquaintances or not.
