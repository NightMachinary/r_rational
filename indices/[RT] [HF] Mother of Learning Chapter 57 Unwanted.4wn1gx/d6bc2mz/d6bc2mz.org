I just realized, Red Robe spent at least two long periods in the loop before the time Zorian entered. First, somehow getting in and finding ways to assist the invasion. Second, erasing Zach's memory of the normal version of the invasion, and repeating the same changes each restart to avoid suspicion. It was like this long enough that Zach made an elaborate plan to save Zorian, a side objective, from an explosion that only happens with Red Robe's influence, without thinking it was anything new.

Hopefully Alanic and Xvim force him to get his head checked.
