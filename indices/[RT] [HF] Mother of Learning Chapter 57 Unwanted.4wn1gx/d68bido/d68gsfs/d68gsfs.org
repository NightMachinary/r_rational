Is Anixa Pravoski that unnamed girl that was hanging out with Zach along with Neolu at the beginning?

Here's a theory out of left field: what if she is Red Robe? No evidence for it, but there is the possibility that she blanked Zach and then hid Veyers/got rid of him. It'd be a pretty good red herring.
