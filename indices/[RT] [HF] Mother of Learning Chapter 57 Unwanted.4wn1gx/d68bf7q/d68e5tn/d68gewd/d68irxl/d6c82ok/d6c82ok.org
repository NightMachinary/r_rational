No, you're making an ad hominem argument.

Just because Alanic does those things doesn't make it more likely that he's lying about knowing Xvim. Then you might as well say everything he's ever said to Zorian could be lies.

As to [[/u/-Fender-]]'s point, there's really no motive to provoke Z&Z about Xvim since they were the ones who mentioned Xvim's name first anyways. The way he phrases his responses makes it extremely unlikely he's lying about knowing Xvim.
