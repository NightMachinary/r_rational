And as I stated [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4wn1gx/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_57_unwanted/d68esco][here]], it's curious how Alanic knew right away that "Xvim" was a person rather than a place or a training method, and also that he knew right away that it was a man and not a woman, and with seeming certainty. I honestly think that they knew each other beforehand.
