You know, it sounds pretty feasible that RR could have asked the Guardian to transfer his physical body to the real world. The Guardian wouldn't object to him leaving, since he has the Controller marker, and it's perfectly capable of creating a copy of his body and anchoring his soul to it.

Zorian and Zach might even be able to pull the same thing, once they get the Key and reopen the Gate. By transferring their physical bodies, they would sidestep issues of interfering with the template, since their original selves would remain intact. Of course, that would mean that there are two copies of them in the real world - or at least two copies of Zorian - but clearly the Guardian was not designed to anticipate that possibility. If the Maker thought about physical exit at all, then it would have anticipated the Controller's original body being a soulless corpse. Not a big deal. So the Guardian might allow it.
