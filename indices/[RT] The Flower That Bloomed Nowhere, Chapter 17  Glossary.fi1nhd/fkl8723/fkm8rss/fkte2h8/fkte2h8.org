The names do feel as if they have interesting associations to discover if one tried to probe further; I might try sometime with the religious/mythological aspects. As far as the world itself goes, I would say I particularly liked when they talked about memories, politics etc. of their homes. It was very natural and stimulating, and aided much by the evocative naming. Looking forward to how you handle the development of people with prestige and authority.

I'll emphasize that Utsu is one of the big selling points of the story, and my experience would have been greatly helped if I felt just a little more that I had the story's permission to notice my disorientation. Of course I can't say that it was as big a problem for others as it was for me.

Yes, I forgot that part about the veils (sorry!). There's a lot to take in, and chances are in my attempt to keep reading (getting myself to read anything is hard) I've missed some more obvious things.
