I'm really enjoying it so far. Oddly enough the main character is, in someways, my least favorite part. She is just so clearly struggling with asperger's/depression/ unfair moral self condemnation, that I find her head a somewhat exhausting place to be. I want help her, to tell her that her thoughts fall into a pattern i've seen before and that there are treatments.

But I am still really enjoying meeting everybody and learning about the world. I'm hopeful we will encounter the actual mystery per se soon.
