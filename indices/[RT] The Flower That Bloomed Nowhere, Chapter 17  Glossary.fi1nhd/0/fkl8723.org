To [[/u/lurinaa][u/lurinaa]]: The writing has feeling, and I can tell you can do remarkable work when on form. The so-far developed characters, even presumably side-characters, have all grown on me. The worldbuilding is done with an envious confidence, the names of places and people are all stylish and tasteful (/applause/), and I really liked the way you tied it in with the Epic of Gilgamesh. I think the story first got me interested by the more humble, self-aware tone than usual for around here, and that first chapter has kept me reading.

Some thoughts: Post-chapter 4 Utsu seemed too different at first. I actually wondered if I was just reading a different protagonist. She's still very likeable but I think you need to sort it out more explicitly, ie. /in what ways does she match the self-aware humility she showed in her introduction?/ There's a judgemental edge (admittedly a quirky, self-aware one) to her since chapter 4 that I don't know what to make of- how far does it go? I guess its the feeling that if I take her at face value, I might misunderstand her again, so I keep reading her with a suspicion that isn't as comfortable as she /seems/ likeable. I don't think I'm alone in this opinion.

You'll probably have to elaborate a little more on masculinity and femininity in the world because the aesthetic is already evocative- women healers in veils, despite Utsu being a death mage and all of them being high achievers. Given the reappearance of the male healers, I'm sure you already have some ideas.

Be aware that suspense-by-author-knowledge is risky.

You're getting better at being terrifying. Keep it up!
