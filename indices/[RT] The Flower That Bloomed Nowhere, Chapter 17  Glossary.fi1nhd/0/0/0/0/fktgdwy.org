  I'll emphasize that Utsu is one of the big selling points of the story, and my experience would have been greatly helped if I felt just a little more that I had the story's permission to notice my disorientation. Of course I can't say that it was as big a problem for others as it was for me.

It's a good point. To be honest, I'm pretty bad at judging how a reader will react to the the stuff I write? When writing mysteries, I feel I do well at causal planning (x and y about this character is true, ergo they will react to this by saying z) but less so at experiential planning, or how people will process things they see with a lack of foreknowledge and go on to experience the text between setup and reveal. I struggle a ton with writing openings for this reason. I struggle to get a sense of how compelling it's going to appear to someone going in completely cold.

My goal on this point was probably to /slowly/ cultivate a sense in the reader of the entire first arc, of which we're about 1/4th to 1/3rd through, of Utsu's character being a little different than she is in the prologue, and them making a connection to some of the foreshadowing to that respect in chapter 3. But right now it's probably too bluntly different.

Other than the point when talks about the headmaster at the end of chapter 4, which I can already see being kind of weird turn and I'll probably correct, were there any other moments you felt were overwhelmingly dissonant?
