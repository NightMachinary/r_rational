Thanks for commenting! I've been hoping to get more of this kind of broad feedback on how the setting and the characters come across.

I'm glad you like the worldbuilding; most of the names of people and places are derived or closely inspired by late bronze age/early iron age cultures, which I hoped along with the descriptions of the clothing would cultivate a certain kind of aesthetic, even though in a lot of ways the setting is very modern in presentation. I'm one of those people who tends to obsess over making sure every single Name Of A Thing is somehow meaningful in some esoteric way that will go over 99% of people's heads, so to even see it praised vaguely makes me happy.

Regarding the vibe of Utsu's character changing after the prologue chapters, it's intentional that there's a shift, which is foreshadowed in chapter 3. She's meant to come across as judgmental of others, but also self-deprecating at the same time, like in the scene where she first describes Ptolema and talks about how she thinks that she's kind of an idiot, but then turns around and immediately mocks herself for that sentiment, despite not renouncing it. Having a slight underlying sense of suspicion towards her is probably the reaction I was hoping for, though you're right that one needs to be careful in navigating between cultivating an atmosphere and reader comfort, especially when it comes to the protagonist.

On the veils, though, I think you might have got the wrong idea, which makes me think I should revise the text slightly, or hammer the point in further? I don't normally like to self-justify in this way since it compromises the reader experience a little, but the intent was for it to be explicitly clear this point that /everyone/ wears them in public.

From chapter 6:

  Everyone, without exception, was clad in veils or the very occasional mask. Most of them were variants of the standard style, like ours. Long, black, though you also saw some blues, purples, and even the occasional cheerful colour. Men's were usually subtly less frilly and flamboyant, and were often a little shorter, even though this was technically dangerous and could get you in trouble if it wasn't tied up properly.
