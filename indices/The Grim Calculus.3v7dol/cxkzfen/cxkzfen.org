Is the person making this calculation supposed to be well-versed in game theory? If so, this construction is quite rudimentary and probably won't be believable to knowledgeable readers. You might want to look into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem][Bayes' Theorem]].

For a less technical analysis, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_negligence][Hand theorem]] is a principle of law that is used to make this kind of determination.

Note also that many people don't see preventable deaths as having the same moral weight as murders. If this guy has a high chance to be Hitler and a low chance to be Norman Borlaug, even if the math checks out, a lot of people would still not consider it to be worth the risk. For an analysis of the way people treat preventable harm as less significant than deliberate harm (from the point of view that they are wrong to do so), I recommend Peter Singer's seminal essay [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine,_Affluence,_and_Morality]["Famine, Affluence, and Morality."]]
