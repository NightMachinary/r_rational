I mean, if you want letting a bad guy escaping to be desirable, just make it more acceptable than that. You're the author, you can write the story. Maybe the bad guy isn't a murder, but he's otherwise a criminal-- he's a thief or something-- but he uses his stolen money to save people's lives. Like a modern day Robin Hood or something. Now, if you're a cop or a superhero maybe you have to arrest this guy, but there's a moment of privacy and you can let him escape and say he overpowered you. He'll continue stealing but he'll save more lives. Do you do it? Now there's an interesting dilemma, and one that a typical reader will understand!

If you have to go with the "murder vs lives saved" thing, again, frame it narratively in an interesting way. Maybe the guy you're saving is a famous general, and he has a gambit to bring the civil war to a close, a gambit that involves launching a big offensive in an urban area....

/"Listen to me," he growls, and you can hear every smokey oily cigar this man has smoked in the timbre of his voice. He's a mountain of a man, not what you expected for a filthy rebel. "I know we're enemies, boy, and I know you want to take me back to your headquarters. We all know what happens then. Your bosses, those men in charge, they execute me, and this war goes on."/

/You're trying your best not to listen to him, of course. Seditious treason spews from the rebel leaders' lips, and he continues, "killing me won't stop the war. Millions will die no matter what, boy. I'm not running the revolution personally, I'll just be another martyr. Cut me down and there are many who will take my place. The war drags on, and more people die."/

/"Let me go, though, and I can finally bring peace to Olaron. I've got a plan, one last push through to knock down your comms towers and take out King Baston. It won't be pretty, and innocent guys, guys like you and I, are gonna die in the process. But you know what? It just might work. Baston's the last of his line. With him dead, it's the end to the monarchy, and we'll finally have control of this damn country. The war will end tomorrow, and the millions fated to die in the next few years will live instead."/

/"I'll be honest with you, boy, it's a long shot. Less than a 1% chance of succeeding. Normally, I would never try something like this, but Baston never comes out of the palace. This is the first time he'll be outside in over a year. It's the only chance we have to end this thing, before it swallows up another generation of you kids..."/

See, now there's a guy who maybe you'd let murder a thousand people! Just maybe! Framed like that, murder a thousand to MAYBE save a million, well, that's not unthinkable. Maybe you won't agree with what the protagonist does, but you'll be able to relate, see?
