It is indeed the right choice, assuming that

1. those are the only two options available to you, and

2. you can trust your numbers.

It's an easy enough choice to make in a clear-cut dilemma, but the complexity of real life (or fiction) rarely provides those. Is your protagonist certain that subject A has at least a 0.1% chance of saving those lives, and not, say, 0.08%?
