Keep in mind that humans aren't perfectly rational by default, and it's pretty hard to get there. The math you propose is okay in theory (with the caveats that others have already mentioned - that's a pretty different order of magnitude, and the information needs to be damn near perfect at that point), but in practice, intuitively, the returns on a gamble need to be roughly twice the losses.

What I mean is that letting a person who has a 50% chance to kill a person a 50% chance to save two people is barely positive for most people, and many probably wouldn't do it. If the character in your story actually lets go someone who has 50/50 chances of saving/killing a person, they will seem.. odd to most readers, even though that's mathematically neutral.

(I'm referring to small amounts of people to avoid scope insensitivity - it may "feel" different when the stakes are larger, too.)
