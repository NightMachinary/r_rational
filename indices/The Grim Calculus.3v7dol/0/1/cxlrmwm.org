  Is your protagonist certain that subject A has at least a 0.1% chance of saving those lives, and not, say, 0.08%?

Uncertainty about the exact probability of an event devolves to just normal uncertainty about the event. A rational agent will have a probability, not a fuzzy range of probabilities.

Where the uncertainty would come in, for me, is in the knock-on effects. As a simple example, if everyone starts letting murderers go free because they're likely to save more lives than they take, you may end up with rich people going on shooting sprees, then paying it off with anti-malaria bed nets or whatever.
