Personally i don't know if that ratio is that good actually.. to compare, lets say someone offers you a bet, you roll a dice with 10 faces, if you roll higher 3 or higher you win. now you have the option, either you put 1000$ and do this once and get 2000$ or lose the 1000$ if you lose. alternatively you can do the same thing, but need to win 20 times in a row. if you win you get 1024001$, if you lose you get nothing.

technically the second one gives you 1$ more than the first option, but unless you have the option to repeat the bet many times the first option is much more relevant because you may actually end the day with 2k$, as opposed to almost for sure lose 1k$.

unless the person that gets to take this decision is building a procedure because every day he catches a bunch of bad guys with similar odds and thus statistically will get the benefit of these odds over time i would probably suggest not letting the bad guy go.
