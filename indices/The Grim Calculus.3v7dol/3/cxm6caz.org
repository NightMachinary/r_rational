Unless that 0.1% chance comes up then the readers (and also many of your supporting characters) will use this to come to the conclusion that the character is too smart for his own good and this whole math-based morality thing is stupid. Conversely if the 0.1% chance does come up, then it's an arse pull by the writer and unconvincing as well. If you want to get people to agree with that lesson, I would suggest you do it another way as the only people who will agree with you now are the people who are already convinced of that methods' correctness.

Further, if this guy (who is the sort to kill 1000 people) survives the second event, he has a much higher than base rate chance to kill many more people.
