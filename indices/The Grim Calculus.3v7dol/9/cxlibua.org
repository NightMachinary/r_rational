In isolation, if no other factors are involved, I'd say the calculation is correct. However, I think it's impossible for it to be in isolation. Maybe letting go a criminal will set an undesirable precedent, the person will surely do something besides kill 1,000 people or save 1,000,000 people -- they might steal something, incite a rebellion, steal $1,000,000, break out other criminals... Conversely, the person might do something productive. I don't think it's possible to plausibly engineer a situation where a character needs to make a choice like this, without having anything else to consider.
