Even assuming your numbers are correct, you still risk weakening existing precedents. Other people may be more willing to commit crime knowing that people much worse then them have seemingly escaped punishment.

A big reason why the law is so effective is it's a credible precommitment to punish despite other factors (such as this grim calculus). When you decide to take this calculus into account, you let off every rich person who says 'Let me skip jail time and I'll donate $50k to buying mosquito nets. Surely the 25 lives saved by the mosquito nets outweighs the need to punish me for something that can no longer be changed anyways'.

Beyond that, by playing by these kind of rules, other bad guys can win by pre-committing to things like...

"If you send me to jail, my henchmen will kill 100 people indiscriminantly."

"If you don't give me 50 million dollars and a helicopter, I'll blow up this school". (Valuing a life at $5 million dollars, I'd expect this logic to lead to many almost bombed schools, and huge numbers of bankrupt municipalities).

etc. If you fold to any credible blackmail, as this simple arithmetic strategy suggests, then you very strongly incentivize criminals to follow that route in the future, which has substantial negative utility.

It may actually be worse then this, because it's in the 'bad guys' best interests to make sure their threats are taken seriously, so a winning strategy on their part may be Commit Atrocity -> Demand Ransom while threatening another Atrocity.

A character acting on this example of 'the grim calculus' would be hugely mistaken in my mind. It's a classic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence][Chesteron's Fence Scenario]]. He's acting on what he knows for sure, while ignoring/giving no weight to the reasons the cultural norms exist in the first place.
