joking answer:

I put down the letter and seriously re-evaluate some core beliefs I currently hold about the government, especially in the areas of its willingness to help its citizens and willingness to conduct experiments and accept evidence.

more serious answer:

I look for an inexpensive dev bootcamp in an area where [median income for that city] >= [cost of living]. with a list found, applications pour out, then move and attend. within half a year, I'd have a better, permanent job in a better area.
