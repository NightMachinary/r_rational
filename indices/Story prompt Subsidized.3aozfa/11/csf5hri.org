I /could/ do the kinds of things I've always wanted to do: not work all the time for a living, travel more, actually intensively study all the things I want to study, finish up hobby projects, contribute more to the research world, and apply for PhD programs without worrying about the career consequences.

But frankly, I do like my day-job somewhat, and I feel like I'm waaaay too far up the privilege scale to just take mercenary advantage of a program like this that's not available to /everyone/ yet.

I'd probably end up splitting the money between charitable donations and helping various close friends get out of cash-flow troubles (ie: financial problems that don't require a genuinely large sum of money to fix, but which persist due to low income).

But maybe that's just the golden handcuffs of industry taking hold. Hmm...
