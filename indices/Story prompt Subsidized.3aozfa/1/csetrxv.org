There's really three ways for me to approach the situation, given my current financial situation (comfortable) and political preferences (highly in favor of a program similar to this, even if I don't personally need to benefit from it).

Realistic: I would move to a nicer condo in downtown Chicago, and otherwise continue living my life as I currently do, including going to work, saving, etc. A program like this would cover the opportunity costs that are currently standing in the way of my doing this today, and since it's only a year long, I need to still have a job afterwards as well.

Charitable: I don't actually need any of the money, so I realistically should donate it to someone else or start my own program to fund two or more others in a lower cost of living area for the cost of my own area. This is less likely because I'm not currently especially charitable, but it's what I'd say I would do to give myself warm fuzzies.

Munchkin: Try to discover what is required to create a new municipality. Create it, and then test what happens for the following situations: I set my salary as mayor equal to double the median salary of the town; if that doesn't work, I recruit foreign investors by offering to pay them 1.5x their current salary to live here, and spend half of my newly increased funds to do just this.
