The nitpick, then, is in the definition of "small population."

You assert that Hidden Hills has a small population of wealthy individuals, because there are less than 2000 of those individuals in the city.

I assert that Hidden Hills does not have a small population of wealthy individuals, as 100% of its residents are wealthy.

It's an absolute vs. relative thing.
