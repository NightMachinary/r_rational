  We don't actually know this; all we know is the median, which as you said, removes outliers.
#+end_quote

We also know that there are no significant outliers on the low end, as the last census said that 0 residents were in poverty.

(I can also offer a small bit of anecdotal evidence as I used to drive past Hidden Hills on a near-daily basis during my commute, and there's nowhere in the area that you could live if you were less than middle-class and not homeless.)

But yes, you're correct in that the statistics only allow us to formally assert that less than 50% of people make less than ~$250k.

Anyway, my mistake was forgetting which sub I'm looking at, because plenty of other places on the Internet would have people confusing median for mean without realizing it. :P
