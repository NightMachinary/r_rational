There are still outlier municipalities. For example, Hidden Hills is a town in California with a median income above $250,000. It's got a small population (about 2,000) of very wealthy individuals. Same goes for Chevy Chase, MD, pop. 3,000 and median income >$250,000.

The trick is to find one of those outliers where there's not a correspondingly high cost-of-living.
