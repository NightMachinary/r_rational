Turn down the offer, because I don't think it will accurately predict the behavior of those under UBI. It's not universal and it's not guaranteed.

If there's no turning it down, I'd use as much of the govt money as I can spare to buy something non-inflationary (gold? I need more research). Later down the line I can use it to finance my transition, or failing that, my retirement.
