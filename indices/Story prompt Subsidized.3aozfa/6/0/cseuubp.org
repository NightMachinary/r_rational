Don't colleges often give "financial aid" that depends on your resources, as a means of price discrimination? That would mean you would have to report the basic income to the college and they would respond by decreasing the "financial aid" by the amount of the basic income, capturing all the surplus. It wouldn't be any better than going to college without the basic income.
