What? /What/?

I'm attending college right now! My experiences will not be demonstrative of /anything/ relative to the average citizen! Either I'll save it all or I'll spend it on random crap because my scholarship already takes care of my basic needs.

Alright. So I have an extra $26,000 (people don't make a lot over here, since half the population is college students). Uh... I'll see if maybe I can arrange to just take a year off and go down to San Francisco. That gives me an extra $53,000 (seems well worth it) and gives me the opportunity to establish residency there so that I can pay less tuition when I move on to getting a Master's.

And then... going to save a good portion of it, going to invest some of it in my writing, and (obviously) going to spend some on food and housing. I'll probably still save most of it. I can live off of $15,000 a year if I chop out all of the unimportant stuff, so if I save $40,000 then that still leaves me with enough for a (tight-ish) year in San Francisco, including enough to invest in my writing a little bit.

I still probably won't be a very good example of the average citizen.
