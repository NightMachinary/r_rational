I'm not sure this is the best sub for this since it's more a political question than a story question. Most answers that people would give would not be story ones.

At any rate, giving someone a trial of guaranteed basic income wouldn't work like the real thing. For instance, if I had a minimum wage job, I might quit my job because GBI would allow me to hone my skills such that I can get a better one. If the GBI is a trial and has an end point, it would be stupid for me to do this since the trial could end before I gained the skills and found a job.

Also, much of the effect of GBI, both positive and negative, would happen because of how the market reacts to it. For instance, minimum wage employers know that their employees will still be able to eat if they are fired, which affects how they treat their employees. Since this is a trial and done in secret, and doesn't apply to most people anyway, that won't happen.
