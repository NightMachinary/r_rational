"America" describes dozens of countries, but I'll assume you're talking about the United States.

Half the people criticizing US welfare think it's too tough on recipients and not accepting enough. Half the people think it's too generous and we shouldn't be giving handouts to people. Some say it's not standardized enough. Some say that large companies like Walmart are using government assistance programs to reduce the amount they have to pay in salaries -- they have employees sign up for EBT to avoid having to pay a wage that people might actually be able to live on. Some say that welfare discourages working (because your value as a person is bounded by your economic output, of course). Some point to welfare abuse, citing one person in the 1970s who signed up for benefits under several dozen names (and assume that we've not become any more adept at catching fraud).

So asking me to Google it doesn't give me much information on what problems you in particular have with welfare, especially as they relate to basic income.

If you don't want to discuss it, you could just say that.
