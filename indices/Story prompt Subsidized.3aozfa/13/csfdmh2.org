I'd be getting about $35k (Canadian) where I am, and I could get another 13k by moving to a different city (and probably a bit more in some small areas).

I would mostly ignore it, and continue on with my life. 35k is very good but not life-changing, and another 13k is not worth uprooting myself for right now.
