  I'm not sure this is the best sub for this since it's more a political question than a story question.

A political question can also be a story question; some of my favorite stories are political in nature. It's not a terribly great story prompt because it encourages answers like, "I do X", which aren't really stories. A better prompt (if the aim is to get stories) would be, "The government begins running random trials on its citizens in secret through a 'dark' fund", because that's more broad and offers more possibilities. Even, "the government begins a trial with the following rules" would be more likely to get a story, because we wouldn't be penned in by having our protagonist and setting decided for us. (For example, my story would always have to start with a married 29-year-old software engineer living in Duluth who shares my values, unless I wanted to go off-prompt.)
