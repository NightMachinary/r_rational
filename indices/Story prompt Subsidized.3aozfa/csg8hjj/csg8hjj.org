Is this guaranteed minimum income or basic income?

If it's guaranteed minimum income, I shrug, refuse the offer, and go on with my business. I make more than my city's median salary, so a guaranteed minimum income wouldn't pay anything to me in my present job. It would allow me to drop my income by a large amount and gain back ~40 hours a week, but I can't afford that.

If it's basic income, I shrug, accept the offer, and put the money into savings. It should see me retiring a year earlier.

If it lasted for life rather than just one year, though, I would continue working but retire appreciably earlier. Or maybe I'd just take a few years off to work on my own projects. Yes, I'm boring.
