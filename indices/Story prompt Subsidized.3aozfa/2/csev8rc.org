My first thought is that the government has gone insane. This experimental model is terrible. The NDA is never going to work; even if I don't do it, someone else in the group is going to anonymously leak the contract. If they're really selecting randomly, and their sample size is large enough to be meaningful, they're going to get someone who's dead-set against GBI and wants to sink it. Further, you can't present someone with an offer and then have them sign an NDA as part of it, because if they refuse the offer they're not bound by the NDA. Either the government is having people sign an NDA /then/ giving the offer, which means selecting for a certain type of person, or they're using the law in a highly unconventional way that I'd find pretty troubling. More worrying than the fact that the government is doing experimentation on its citizens is the fact that they're doing this in secret.

So the experiment is probably going to end within the first few weeks, if not sooner. The costs associated with moving are so high that I can't actually change my location in order to take advantage of a place with a higher median income, and that's if I had any confidence that the experiment would last. There are also costs associated with quitting and starting a job, so I'm not really going to change my employment. Cost-of-living is highly associated with median income, so I don't really see much benefit in moving anyway, though I suppose I could run some numbers and figure out if there was a place I could move that's best on some income/cost index. (And I probably still don't move, because I've put down roots.)
