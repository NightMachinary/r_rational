The way Nic is dealing with Simole and Dizzy is masterful and honestly, a little bit scary. His manipulations are reminiscent of the Ranvarian alliances with other nations. Roke alludes this is what the demons are doing too which doesn't really mesh with what we've seen from them so far. They could've destroyed humans from the very beginning so I think fusing in order to grow is still their primary goal.

On the topic of Nic, I think he's doing a lot of projecting here. He believes Simole and Dizzy see him as a container for Winnum Roke or some key in a grand plan because that's the way he sees them. Not entirely, of course, but a large part of how he considers each of them is in terms of what they can do and what knowledge he can extract from them.
