For books, "Lonely Soldier: The Memoir of an American in the Israeli Army" is...exactly what it says on the tin. Great view from an outsider on the inside.

"Brotherhood of Warriors" gives a look into the elite, counter-terrorism units.

  What's the day-to-day life of a soldier like?
#+end_quote

This varies wildly with said soldier's position, of course, as well as whether or not we are in wartime.

The bulk of the military is non-combatants, known as jobniks. I am included in this demographic. In reality, about 50% of jobniks don't actually do anything essential. The result is a lot of "busy work", the idea of which drives me bonkers. I once tried to suggest a reasonable reorganization of the storage system when I was working in the logistics division of my base, and my commander declined to make any changes, saying "that's not how we do it here". I was then told to sort a bunch of papers in the most inefficient way possible, so that I would "have something to do". Granted, I cannot know that it is handled thusly in all section of the jobnik forces, but that does seem to be the general mindset.

My first day on base, I was put in the storage unit with another soldier (who had been there a year already) and told to unpack a recent shipment of supplies onto the shelves. Being as naive as I was, I assumed that meant I should actually do so. When he saw how I was trying my utmost to do a good job, he told me to stop working so hard, "it's easier if you show them you can't be relied upon".

This entire mindset is radically different in combat units, however. I've just asked a friend of mine who is in the tanks division to send me his own answer to the question - I'll either edit this post when he responds, or send it to you as a message.

  How much is the IDF governed by external politics? To what extent is public perception a factor?
#+end_quote

I can't answer this nearly as well as I'd like, as I am embarrassingly ignorant of the greater workings of the army and its interactions with politics as a whole. I can say that public perception is usually pretty in-line with the army, as, it being a mandatory draft, just about everybody is part of the army, in some way, at one point or another, and a large part stay in as career soldiers/commanders/officers.

That isn't to say that everyone loves or agrees with the army, just that everyone understands and "knows" the army, having been on the inside themselves.

  How much is the IDF governed by /internal/ politics? Are there choice postings that people strive for? Men and woman trying to move up the military power structure? Decisions that were clearly made because someone cared more about looking good than about tactical/strategic thinking?
#+end_quote

Again, this differs between the jobniks and the combat units. As for "choice postings," this depends entirely upon the individual. I consider myself to have such a position, where I am required to do not-much-at-all all day for a week, then am given a week off to work/be home. Most people would never take my position, however, because I almost never see anyone when I'm on base. I'm alone for most of the entire week, both in my "office" and in my room. From ~5:00 Thursday to Sunday morning, I see absolutely no one. This is perfectly fine with me, but I understand how it would drive most Israelis insane, given that, as far as I can tell, they are 99% extreme extroverts.

The climb up the "military power structure" really only starts one you've finished mandatory service and signed on for additional years, as a career soldier/commander/officer. Usually the people in these positions actually want to be there, which makes their attitude quite different. There are always those who are just in it for honor/prestige/power, but generally the military life isn't the most enjoyable lifestyle one could choose, thus effectively selecting those who aren't only in it for themselves. Of course, this doesn't mean they're smart, or guarantee that they'll make good decisions. But at least their motives are good, right? Yay.

More on the two previous questions as responses come in from people I've contacted. People who actually know what they're talking about.

  How religious, if at all, is the IDF?
#+end_quote

It's actually becoming /more/ religious as time goes on. Kosher meals are a given everywhere in the military now, and every base has a synagogue with a rabbi that provides the usual services and daily prayers. Soldiers are required to be given these times if they are requested. Religious soldiers are alone in being allowed to not shave - as long as they are actually growing a beard, meaning that you can't just have a bunch of stubble every few days because you forgot to shave. All or nothing.

Obviously the requirements in the field are another story, but where the activities are not necessary to prevent loss of life, religious soldiers keep the Sabbath as always. For most religious holidays, jobnik bases are practically empty, left with a skeleton crew as the rest of the base is given off, even those not religious - most religious holidays are national holidays as well.

There are combat units composed entirely of religious soldiers, and many, many heads of the elite units are religious themselves. Yeshiva programs called Hezder have their entire participating student body (of the same year) go into the army together, as in the same unit(s), throughout the entirety of their service.

The vast majority of the soldiers in the IDF are still secular, of course, but the trend seems to be that the IDF itself is growing more religious. How far it will go, I have no idea, nor what the political repercussions will be.

I'm sorry if I wasn't able to answer everything as well as you had hoped - again, further information is incoming.
