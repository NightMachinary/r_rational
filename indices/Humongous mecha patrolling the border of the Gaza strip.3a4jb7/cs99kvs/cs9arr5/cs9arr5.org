I'd like a book recommendation, ideally something that focuses on a soldier's experience more than the political aspects. My questions:

- What's the day-to-day life of a soldier like?
- How much is the IDF governed by external politics? To what extent is public perception a factor?
- How much is the IDF governed by /internal/ politics? Are there choice postings that people strive for? Men and women trying to move up the military power structure? Decisions that were clearly made because someone cared more about looking good than about tactical/strategic thinking?
- How religious, if at all, is the IDF?

Hopefully none of those questions are too stupid.
