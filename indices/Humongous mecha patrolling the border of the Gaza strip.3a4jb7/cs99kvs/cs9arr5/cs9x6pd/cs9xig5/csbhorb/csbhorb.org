I think anything going into a rational powered body armor is going to need handwaving similar to Shinji's body armor in "Shiji and 40k" or "Thousand Shinji" whichever one had the non-Newtonian fluids quote. Either way watch a few history channel specials on infantry, reactive armor, and read that one on the war against Heaven and hell and you'd be good enough to take a swing at it.

Disclaimer: I did my tours in the navy, and just finished listening to "Metropolitan man" again, so I'm biased
