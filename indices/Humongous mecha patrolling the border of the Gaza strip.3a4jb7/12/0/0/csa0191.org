Hmm...based on my knowledge of the current conflict...either the PA or Hamas would have to have vastly improved air and antitank weaponry, since the current Israeli system works pretty damn well given its own regulations about civilian warnings have been hamstringing it. Also, Israel's economy's survived a much expanded BDS network(Since mech troops would destroy Israel's national image worse than settling literally in Abu Dis would), so either America really came through in the clutch(indicating at least a few victories for a kulanu govt b/c there's no way Likud got that kind of diplomatic participation out of even the most diehard of republican govts) or they've improved tech to the point that corporations take the PR hit and buy from them.

EDIT: I think this covers everything that would have to be true from the geopolitical side, but anyone more versed in Israeli politics should please correct me([[/u/brandalizing]], perhaps?)
