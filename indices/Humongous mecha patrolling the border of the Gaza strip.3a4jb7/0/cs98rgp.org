Obvious questions:

- How do giant mecha support their weight?
- What sort of threats are giant mecha more cost-effective at addressing than fences, soldiers, or an array of disposable human-scale mecha?
- I definitely had a third question when I started this comment but then a friend linked me to a Scott Alexander post and then after following a linktrain through several tabs, some of which are still open, I closed enough to realize that oh God I never finished this comment and can't remember what I was going to say next, but it's been half an hour so I'll just hit post.
