The words are a pun on a well-known [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayim_Mayim][Zionist folk dance]].

The part that Google Translate is rendering as "blow" can indeed be read as "makah", a /blow/ or /hit/, as in a "blow to the face with his elbow". Since Hebrew makes "machine", the original root word for "mecha", into "mekhonah" (or rather, it has a pre-existing old-Hebraic word to use for "machine"), with the kh and k here being the Hebrew letter khaf/kaf, I'm imagining that the English loan-word "mecha" would be taken into Hebrew as "mekah", since the written pun makes a kind of sense. A mecha is a machine for blows, you see.

And I would start singing the mayim-mayim song because I just really like Humongous Mecha. It doesn't help that at some point the Mayim Mayim Dance got taken over to Japan and became a part of children's gym classes, so there are loads of YouTube videos of "mayim mayim memes."

It comes out as, "mecha mecha mecha mecha, mecha mecha in the well!", from an original, "Water water water water, water water in the well!" -- which is what people burst out singing when they managed to sink a well in the Negev.
