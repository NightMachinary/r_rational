Ahem.

Eh, all the justifications happen in implications, interludes, and behind-the-scenes - besides, it's all a bit silly, anyway. Find interesting uses for semi-organic supercomputer continent-sized organs by cutting down their capabilities to almost nothing and having creative species optimize them for /combat/? When some of the demonstrated capabilities of the shards include simulating human minds for the purposes of precognition? Either a) the precognition is too resource-intensive, in which case why are you doing it, or b) it's not, in which case why aren't you just devouring everything and everyone immediately, adding all minds to a growing collection of uploaded experimentation engines running on a set of dedicated shards?
