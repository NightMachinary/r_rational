Of /course/ this got its own thread (inspiration is [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a0k2u/lets_stay_on_topic_rational_or_rationalist_fiction/cs8kdco?context=1][here]]). I just knew it would.

I've brought up [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2fksk7/qdbst_is_there_any_interest_in_a_rationalist/][Rational Mecha]] myself. The story bogged down in a never-ending loop of technical justifications for the plot, which is a sure indication of a crappy plot. Shelved for later, maybe after the fall or winter holiday seasons.

Someday I'll get around to finishing /Flag/, an anime about modern politics, propaganda and transforming mecha in the middle east.

Personally I know little about the Gaza strip and its politics; doing it justice would require a massive amount of research and preparation.
