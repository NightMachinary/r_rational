From what I know about armor and warfare, which is NOT based on being an experienced armored warfare specialist, the only strong advantage that a mecha we might build today would have over a light tank would be the potential to rapidly switch weapons.

The tank, on the other hand, would have a lower profile, better sloping of armored surfaces, and a extremely low center of gravity.

The mecha might move better in extremely broken terrain, but tanks are better in urban warfare than you might think, if the *hit hits the fan, and your commanding officer says it's time to take the gloves off. Then you can go through buildings rather then around them, and it doesn't matter what's in the road if you need to get to point 'B'

Also, a mecha, because of how many joints it has to allow humaniform motion, has a LOT of weak spots in it's armor. That humaniform motion also requires a FAR more complicated locomotion system.

In the end, I don't see mecha as being rational fighting machines for urban combat until they are very close to what we see in Battletech or Robotech.

Now, for amphibious assault? That might be a different story entirely. Being able to walk across the ocean floor could open up a LOT of interesting options.
