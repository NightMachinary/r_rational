Although I'm not at all versed in the nuances of middle eastern politics, I can speak to the humongous mecha aspect. Currently, I see HM being limited by materials, energy, and software. I.e. they collapse under their own weight when doing much beyond standing still, they require a lot of power used inefficiently to operate, and they have to be coordinated and balanced with good software to not fall over like babies.

All that being said, let's say we get some strong, antigravity, superconducting material that makes them feasible. I'd envision them much the same role as aircraft carrier's today: mobile superior force with high upkeep. Seems like just having one standing nearby would be a huge deterrent.
