I can't say for sure, but isn't the human form recognized as sub optimal in many ways? Like, even just its very shape means you'd have to go through so much engineering to allow it to stand up and walk around, to say nothing of the jet boosting acrobatics we've seen some of our favorite Gundam accomplish. It would be a lot easier to have a mech with, say, a spider shape or a quadraped shape.

Just balancing a human-like form alone would kill you; the amount of background mechanisms that go into allowing human beings to stand upright is pretty crazy, when you get down to it. And we still fall over sometimes. Multiply that by the size of a standard mech? May be more trouble than it's worth.

P.S I vaguely remember [[/u/alexanderwales]] describing something along this line in Metropolitan Man, during a little scene where Lex Luthor initially started out with the idea of a mech suit, which became a better tank, after a few needed modifications.
