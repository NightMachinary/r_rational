  Some years ago, he'd spent days trying to make what he called a battlesuit a practical reality. It was going to be a callback to the knights in shining armor, creating a solitary soldier encased in impenetrable armor and capable of advancing on enemy lines with impunity, mounted machine guns firing away the whole time while a diesel engine belched smoke. He'd drawn up schematics and eventually began stripping parts away, replacing those things that thrilled the imagination with those that would work practically and reliably. The steel legs were replaced with treads. The arms were removed in favor of a larger cockpit with buttons and levers. The center of gravity was lowered, until the cockpit sat between or just on top of the treads. He still remembered the feeling of looking down at his design and realizing he'd done nothing more than make a better tank. LexCorp now owned two factories that made them, building up a stockpile to sell to the European powers when the next inevitable war broke out. Still, the whole project had been borne out of a vision he'd had, of diesel powered mechanized armor striding across the battlefields of the next war. The fact that he'd spent so much time pursuing that vision was a source of embarrassment. It had been a valuable lesson in critically examining those ideas that came to him suddenly and struck him on some emotional level.

The basic argument for having two legs is that you have supreme maneuverability. You and I spend our time balancing upright, which isn't that hard if we have all the compensation in place; that unsteadiness is actually an asset, because it means that we can swiftly change direction. In humans, walking is partly accomplished through controlled falling. You would need a good computer, good sensors, and some ridiculous math to do it, but none of that stuff is insurmountable. (The other basic argument for having two legs is that humans have two legs, and if you're putting a human inside the thing, they need to be able to control it.)
