Smaller is definitely more realistic. Even gundams, which are "only" 60 feet tall, are probably still impractically big. The Knightmare Frames from Code Geass are a much more practical 15-20 feet tall, which is only about twice as big as a human. If you make the thing out of lightweight materials (so it's designed more to deflect a roll with a hit instead of absorb it) you might have something that you could still argue was maneuverable. Going even smaller might be better.

But then we get into quibbles about the difference between power armor and mechas.
