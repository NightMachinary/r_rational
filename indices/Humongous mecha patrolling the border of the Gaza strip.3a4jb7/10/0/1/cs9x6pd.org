There's also Unit 8200, which takes soldiers who have high-tech skills by age 18 to work on things like the Iron Dome, +Stuxnet+, drones, and enemy detection systems. There are also some smaller high-tech units inside Tzahal -- a friend of mine works on neural-nets for computer vision as his army job. Oh, and there are Atuda'im, who basically study their university degrees while in uniform, then do "keva" (meaning: permanent/set) extended service over the base 3 years in the IDF.

Many of these sorts of units supply Israel with its high-tech entrepreneurs later in life. The Army tends to be a good experience for that, because it inculcates the famous Israeli attitude of, "Just make it fucking work." Half of everything in Israel is jury-rigged, in some ways, and the reason it all keeps working is because of that attitude: make it work, then keep it working, and design constraints are for suckers.

Now, I don't know about /humongous/ mecha, but some kind of powered armor that could protect from booby-traps, IEDs, grenade shrapnel, and the other hazards of asymmetrical urban warfare might make a decent sci-fi device.
