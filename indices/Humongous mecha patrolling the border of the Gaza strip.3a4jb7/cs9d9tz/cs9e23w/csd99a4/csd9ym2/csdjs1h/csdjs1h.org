Huh. Why bipedal, instead of something closer approximating a crab? Multilegged designs get more traction per unit body mass, better terrain stabilization, and improved weight and drag distribution. Bipedal bodies tend to be very vertical, so unless the biped it keeled all the way forwards, it's not going to have a good =leg traction force= to =drag= ratio.
