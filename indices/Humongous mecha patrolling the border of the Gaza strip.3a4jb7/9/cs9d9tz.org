I don't think there has been any kind of valid rational arguments for humanoid mecha bots(not counting mechanized armores which are possibly a little different situation).

The only possible reason such a bot might exist IRL would be because people think its cool and its not out of the question some military person would also ignore\rationalize the impracticality of such a bot and have it made.

Otherwise such bots are just significantly inferior to plain tanks\planes on land, and space optimized(oval?) fighter for reasons I believe already explored in multiple such discussions in the past.

Not sure how huge mecha's are a particularity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict btw..
