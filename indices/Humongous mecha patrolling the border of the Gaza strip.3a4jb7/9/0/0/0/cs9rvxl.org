Battle applicability would definitely be lower, only mobility would be enhanced. Humaniform mecha would be able to walk on the ocean bottom, climb over rocky terrain, and then emerge from the water and seek cover on land. Basically a specialized beachhead-creating unit. They would not press an attack, their purpose would be to quickly attack, establish a place to land more troops and armor, and then get out of the way.

That's the only potentially significant role I can imagine using humaniform mecha for, with technology levels anything like our current-day. At least rationally.
