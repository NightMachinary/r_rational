Swimming on top of the water makes you a boat, and easily seen, and shot at. Swimming below the water makes you visible to side scanning sonar. Walking along the bottom means you can follow the terrain, and do not need an extra / disposable propulsion system.

Bipedal mecha suits could be very handy for Engineering and maintenance teams behind the front lines, and fitted for amphibious operations when needed.
