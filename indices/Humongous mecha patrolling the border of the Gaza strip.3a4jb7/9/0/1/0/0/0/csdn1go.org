Good points. A many-legged vehicle will have even more complex drive train than a bipedal vehicle. It's individual legs are going to be less powerful and less well armored. I don't see why a bipedal mecha couldn't move on it's hands and knees, if need be.

That being said, the fact that biological crabs have been around for a great many millions of years, and happen to be little amphibious assault critters, gives a lot of weight to your argument. If the extra complexity of the drive train wasn't a problem, the crab-style body would probably be superior.
