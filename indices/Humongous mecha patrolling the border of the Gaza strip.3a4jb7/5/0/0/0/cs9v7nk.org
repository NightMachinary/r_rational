Oh it doesn't. Like others in this thread said, there's not much reason to make a human shaped mecha. I thought about it for quite a while, trying to think of what sorts of scenarios would see them being useful, and there really just aren't many. In urban warfare, maybe something like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuratas][Kuratas]], but even then, you're talking about a vehicle with a very high centre of mass. It'd make an easy target for someone in a building with an RPG. There's lot of interesting designs and shapes you could come up with for fighting vehicles, but I don't think 'human shaped' is ever going to be particularly ideal, unless its also 'human sized'
