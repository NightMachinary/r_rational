Actually, that thread you linked is the /original/ original inspiration; I was fairly sure that the idea came from here, and found it pretty easily in that thread. It's specifically [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2fksk7/qdbst_is_there_any_interest_in_a_rationalist/ckbz5dm?context=3][this comment]].

The basic argument is that the role that mecha best serve are as highly mobile urban special forces, with better mobility than a tank. That's aside from the obvious +propoganda+ public relations aspects of having highly vaunted pilots in expensive machines that are essentially the pinnacle of technological sophistication.

And yeah, the research and preparation required to tell a politically touchy story like that is basically what kills the possibility of writing it for me.
