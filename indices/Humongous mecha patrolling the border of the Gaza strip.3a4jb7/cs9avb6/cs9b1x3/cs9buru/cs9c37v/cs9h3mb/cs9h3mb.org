I feel like power armor and mechas start to differ when the suit becomes so large, simple movement isn't enough to move said armor. In power armor, more often than not, the motion of your limbs (albeit powered by pneumatics, hydraulics, physics bullshit, etc.) moves the armor. Whereas in a mech, I feel like it's large to the point where lever pulls and pedal pushes are what moves the suit. Of course, this isn't an exclusive definition (think G Gundam) but, for my purposes, it's how I define the difference between the two.
