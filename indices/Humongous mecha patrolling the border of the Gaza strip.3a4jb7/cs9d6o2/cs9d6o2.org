Mecha are not rational. About the only reason to make a human form machine is if you want it to fit into spaces and roles constructed for humans, in which case it needs to be human sized. An android would be a not-insane choice for a combat bot designed to do house sweeps without knocking the house down, but that really falls under "policing". I could see Israel building remote-waldo soldiers like that, but a huge one? No military value, and the public relations effects would be unlikely to be a net win. Uhm.. the Palestinian's build it as a pr stunt to protest against an Israeli policy of hunting down Hama's soldiers with disposable android drones? That would be about the only rational reason I can think of to have one.
