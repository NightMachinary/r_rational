I just pick whatever looks like I can sustain the push toward completion for, with just a little bit of focus on what people would actually want to read. I have, at the moment, about twenty things in draft stages, some with a few chapters, some only missing their ending, everything from novels to novellas to short stories. "can sustain the push" is some combination of enthusiasm and percent currently done.

Since I've instituted this way of thinking, I've pushed out a number of stories that were sitting near the finish line, and gotten significant chunks of work done on other things.

(In my case this is complicated by /also/ running a web serial that I try my best to devote all possible writing time to. But if I didn't have that, the answer would be the above, and I do dip my toes in other stuff.)
