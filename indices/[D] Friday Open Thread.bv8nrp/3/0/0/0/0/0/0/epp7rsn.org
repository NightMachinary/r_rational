Your notes appear to be denser than mine. My notes covered about 700 words of the story that resulted.

I... think I'm pretty fast paced? I tend to cut most of what I write out in the end. Otherwise I end up saying the same thing three different ways, three times in a row.

I should add that sometimes my notes for a 3000 word story are only one sentence long--usually because I ended up writing the whole thing without taking notes and without planning. Similarly, my notes for longer stories would cover more ground if I ever actually wrote long stories.
