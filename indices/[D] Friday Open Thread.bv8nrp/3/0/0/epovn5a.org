Okay, I wasn't ready for you, the legend, to specifically reply.

Is there any way you determined the "sustain the push" factor with what you're writing? I'm up to about 3 to 5 serious stories, each of which I enjoy expanding upon. I plug away at them but dialogue feels strange to me every time I look at it again from a different perspective, and I find myself adding details and more which I know can be a slippery slope. Any tips?

Also, your web serial is awesome btw. I wanted to ask if you wrote at all during you're hiatus from it the last couple months.
