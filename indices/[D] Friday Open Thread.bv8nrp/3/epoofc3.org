To all the writers out there, how do you decide what story to really start on next?

​

I've had several ideas bouncing around and have been consistently writing chapters for each of them the past few months, but have reached a point where I spend more time catching up to what I've written and editing/trying to find room for excerpts I made at work than I do writing. I don't think that its writers block, mainly because I usually combat that by working on different stories when I can't seem to give one more meat. It's just become impractical for me to work on several at once.

​

Any answer is appreciated. I've considered rolling dice and dedicating all my spare time to my favorite story, but neither of those appeal to me as they seem like they'd take all the fun out of writing. Thanks in advance.
