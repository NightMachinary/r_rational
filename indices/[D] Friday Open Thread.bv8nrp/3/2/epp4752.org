My strategy is to only write short stories that I know I can finish in a few days. Then I review and edit the story a week later.

I write (almost) only stories that are shorter than twenty pages. If I have an idea for a story that would be two-hundred pages, I try to write the most important scene only.

It's a lazy way of writing that keeps me at hobbyist level, but I find it sufficient and sustainable. I have notes for a few longer stories. Maybe I'll write those in their entirety in the future.
