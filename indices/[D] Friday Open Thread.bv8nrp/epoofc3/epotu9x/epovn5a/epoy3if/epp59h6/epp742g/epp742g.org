This made me look back at my google docs history to see how I'd made notes for my last story.

#+begin_quote
  Resolve Michael plot-- he's going to Japan (get some closure)\\
  Krusty talks to Shoryu/reprimands him/strategizes\\
  Akihabara Round Table (with Minori's help) plan what to do next.

That was about 2500 words worth of plot. How many words did those notes cover? And do you feel like you're a faster pacer than normal, or a slower one? This makes me wonder if writers with faster pacing have fewer words of story per words of notes, or if they also write more condensed notes so the ratio stays similar...
