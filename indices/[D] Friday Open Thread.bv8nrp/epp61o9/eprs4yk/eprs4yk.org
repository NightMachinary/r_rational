Hey, you're here! We should meet up at some point.

Re: coffee, I'm not much of a drinker, so I don't know. The only time I see people drink coffee is at the company's coffee machine. Oh, or at the McCaf√©. I know it doesn't sound super "authentic", but let's be honest, McDonalds is as much a part of French culture than American culture by now, if not more.

Re: breakfast, I think you can find bakeries open earlier than 9am. Maybe it depends where you are.
