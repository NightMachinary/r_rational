So, I've been in Paris a week now, and I want to know: why the fuck can't you buy takeaway coffee anywhere? Is it just an Australian thing? Is Australia's "cafe culture" full of dozens of small businesses that sell good coffee out of their windows from 6 or 7am a unicorn?

On that note, why the fuck is nothing here open until 9am? Who the hell eats breakfast at 9am?

(note: I'm actually having a lovely time, but this is the thing that is the most strange to me. And I don't even like coffee that much! I'd get takeaway coffee like once or twice a week! But here I was so desperate that yesterday I went to a gorram starbucks!)
