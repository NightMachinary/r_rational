Let me see if I can channel my 'light novel trash' powers...

  Juniper Smith finds himself reincarnated in the world of Aerb with the power to level-up and realizes that he is the creator of the world. Aerb is a place that he had intricately constructed over a decade of tabletop gaming sessions, filled with dozens of fantastical magic systems and hundreds of fantasy races. The only problem is that he was too much of a teenage chunibyo when he made it! Can he survive the edgy grimdark universe that he filled to the brim with the hardest challenges that he could possibly imagine? And is it fair to fall in love with the perfect women in his harem, if he's the protagonist and they can't stop themselves from falling in love with him?

I'm not sure if I would have been more or less likely to read it, if he'd gone into full clickbait / shill mode during the summary. I probably would, TBH, but then again I'm also the kind to read Light Novel trash.
