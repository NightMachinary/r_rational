I hadn't considered that. I see what you mean with possibly attracting people who would not like your story. I have seen the occasional negative comment on the story threads.

That said, I don't think it would be a bait and switch to emphasize any of these points I mentioned because they are all true. If you're really worried about managing expectations, maybe put a note below the (new and improved) summary saying that your story has an emphasis on character interactions. Or the occasional chapter note in the sections that have a lull in the pace/action.

I'm actually re-reading the story right now and I think you've already done a decent job managing expectations, like with this paragraph at the beginning of chapter 3:

  Look, you probably want to hear more about the sexy motorcycle mechanic or the punk gangs or the giant zombie creatures, but before we go too much further, I need to tell you about my D&D group. I know, I know, but so much of Aerb is a reflection of my scribblings while DMing, so there is a point to this. I'll try my best to keep it to what's important.

I really think your stuff won't stand out as much as you seem to worry. WtC might put a large focus on characterization, and the real world sections might break the expected flow of action, but many of the top rated stories on rr have that. Take Wandering Inn as an example, which is 10th best rated, and first or second highest patreon on rr(>$8k). The story is so slow and deliberate and introspective in the beginning and in between the action scenes that it makes WtC feel like a summer blockbuster! A good number of the top rated stories have a slower pace and an emphasis on characterization.
