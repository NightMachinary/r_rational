I don't know if the spoilers are bad for a new reader or not, but you could possibly avoid them by referencing, so it becomes payoff when the details come out in the chapters. Mention that Joon was a dungeon master, something terrible happened to his gaming group in bumblefuck kansas (IMO the name of the town is a detail that will make people laugh rather than complain about spoilers, assuming it isn't censored), and his worldbuilding took a turn for the darker in the wake of that tragedy. Now he wishes he hadn't because he got inserted into a fantasy based on his worlds. The fact that it's complicated and cerebral is I think the main filter criteria for your audience, not the fact that it's D&D derived. The people you don't want reading the story are people who expect generic fantasy tropes, don't want to juggle too many details, or maybe just aren't into gaming at all. The people you want to attract are more into subversion, originality, nerd talk, etc.

  The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.

I'm not so sure I like this line because it sounds like it is saying he was the kind of person who would cause Aerb, Fel Seed, the Hells, etc. to exist deliberately. However, his big crime back on earth was being a bad friend, some of the time. He feels guilt about this, some of it earned, but he wasn't the kind of person who would willingly torture billions of people, and at the beginning of the story didn't even like the idea of people winking permanently out of existence because their soul got used to power a motorcycle. His dark fantasies were constructed under the assumption that they were, and would remain, fictional. They were an escape from reality, a cry for help perhaps, but not a plan or wish to be fulfilled.

Not saying you should use it, but the following would probably fit right in at RR:

  When disaster struck our little gaming group of hyperintelligent teenagers in Bumblefuck Kansas, my style as dungeon master took a turn for the darker and edgier. I really wish it hadn't, because I have now been inserted into a life or death struggle in a fantastical world where life is cheap, death is unthinkably bad, and I still can't figure out all the mechanics of this character sheet stapled to my soul. And even though I have no idea why or how this world came into existence using so many of the things I once made up, I now feel a responsibility to its billions of inhabitants, to fix it somehow. It's a good thing I can level up. Should I put some points in intelligence? Because one thing I'm starting to realize about my worldbuilding is that it's super complicated... Is this a harem I'm seeing? No way, I can't have a harem! WTF is up with this crazy DM?
