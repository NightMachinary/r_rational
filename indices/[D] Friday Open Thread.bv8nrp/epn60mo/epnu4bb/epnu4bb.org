My pet theory: The reason Bran was so insistent that Sam had to tell Jon about his heritage /right then/ in S8E1 was so that he would end up on the Iron Throne.

That discussion waits until after the battle, the information probably doesn't have a chance to spread, and Dany still has trusted advisors to temper her Targaryen nature come S8E5.
