If we're looking at theories stemming from the show. I believe the Three Eyed Raven is evil as he allowed all this shit to occur while having seemingly unlimited omnipresence in the past and future. He didnt warn anyone about anything.

If we're talking books. My favorite one is that the dragon horn that Euron gave Victarion is actually the horn of war that will bring down The Wall for the Others in a mix between the two legends.

Furthermore that Valaryia and Asshai have more to play with in the end game.

I also like the theory that the gods arent real.
