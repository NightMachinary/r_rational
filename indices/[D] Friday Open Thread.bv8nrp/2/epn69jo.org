The GMTK game jam is scheduled for August 2nd to 4th: [[https://youtu.be/vWSmZgL50vE]]

The /r/r discord ran an entry in 2017 (to unfortunate results; an unclear submission page meant we uploaded but didn't submit), and this year some of us are doing it again. We're aiming to use Unity and are spending the next couple months brushing up our skills in preparation.

One of the major roles we're missing is artists, so if there's any of you willing to mark their calendar and draw pretty pictures with us that weekend, we'd be happy to have you.

Anyone else interested in other aspects of game design is also welcome to join; there's a #gmtk_jam channel on the discord (link in the sidebar here). If you just want to learn with us without entering the jam itself that's fine too, we'll be doing a handful of test runs over the summer to make sure we've got the kinks worked out and it should be a good chance to learn the basics of game development if you're interested.

Signup sheet and more details are linked in the pinned messages of that discord channel. See you there!
