I like the theory that the Starks are to Ice/the Others as the Targaryens are to Fire/Dragons. Or at least that there's some kind of relationship.

And as much as I hated the final two seasons(the final 4 seasons?), I can see how with proper set-up and execution by Martin the resolution could have been fine as-is, maybe even great. The fine foil-people over at [[/r/asoiaf]] are doing a good job of sussing out the wheat from the chaff, it's fascinating to watch.

As an aside, you'd think the tv show clusterfuck would sour the fans and be ultimately bad for Martin, but I for one haven't been as excited about the books in 8 years(ADWD was mediocre, imo), which is crazy considering I started reading it when I was 13(almost 20 years ago!). I think many people on [[/r/asoiaf]] feel the same. I never in a million years would have predicted that.
