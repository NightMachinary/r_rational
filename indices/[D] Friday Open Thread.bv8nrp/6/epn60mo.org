I have a game of thrones question. What are your favourite theories? Roose being 1000 years old half other. Euron being a failed candidate for 3 eyes raven. People able to intermarry with different magic beings due to everyone being created by a sci fi society? Long winter being nuclear winter. Why the seasons work the way the do?
