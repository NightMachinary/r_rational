Yeah from what little I heard from people while in London, Paris is kinda unusual when it comes to the culture of eating out.

Waiters have a salary instead of living off tips, so they tend to be stony instead of cheerful.

Usually you have to come knowing what you want to order instead of choosing from a menu.

They really hate it if you talk in anything other than French, but they'll be merciful if you at least make the attempt with a few words of hello and food terms.

You have to be quiet when eating out since the noise level is usually much lower in cafes/restaurants, and anyone who is too loud may be asked to leave.

It's expected that if you are eating at a cafe alone, you are most likely spending a few hours people-watching.

I'm sure there was a lot more to it than just what I learned in some conversations with people traveling through Europe.
