I've (unfortunately) had to drop reading to historic lows. There's a pile of books on my bedside table, a bunch of bookmarked stories, and very little time to read them. And if I /did/ read them, I would worry about creative pollution, picking up another author's voice for a few days or worse, getting bitten by the bug to write something similar (or dissimilar, because reading stuff from other people often gives me a glimpse of inspiration into a story that they're not actually telling). Same goes for tabletop gaming: I no longer DM, instead opting to play about once every two weeks, also at historic lows. Creativity is for writing, and writing alone (well, also telling my son stories, but that's halfway to writing).

To answer the other question about writing consistently:

- Have a time dedicated to writing, ideally the same time every day when there's nothing else you should be doing.
- Have a space/setup dedicated to writing, somewhere with minimal distractions, or failing that, at least a space/setup that gets you in the mood for writing, or which your brain will associate with writing. Some people have a writing-only netbook, but that seems expensive and overkill to me.
- Cut out distractions as much as you can. I used to use a browser extension that would block websites at a certain time, but have since moved on from that. I also tend to turn off my laptop's wifi, which cuts down on the impulse to go surf the web. If your cell phone is a distraction, put it in a mason jar, which won't cut you off, but will make you stop to think before you reflexively open up an app out of habit.
- Track metrics, if that works for you. Word count, words per day, writing speed, days in a row you've met your word count goal, etc. The risk there is that you'll see a dip in the metrics and get discouraged, or that you'll break a streak and give up, but this is sort of a matter of how much you know yourself and what works for you as far as these things go. I've lately been using a writerbot that I set up for "sprints" of 30-45 minutes of pure writing time, with level ups and experience points and other gamification. Time will tell how much that helps productivity in the long term, but it's a thing to try.
