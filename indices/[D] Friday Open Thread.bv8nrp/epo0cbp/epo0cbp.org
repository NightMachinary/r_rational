I have long desired to write a fictional work of my own. I write poetry and thought-pieces, have began many stories of fantasy, sci-fi, etc., and I still plug away. I am determined to produce a work of quality, one day.

â€‹

However, I do often find myself torn between sitting down and painstakingly writing and thinking of ideas, VS. reading and re-reading my favorite web-serials, Issac Asimov short stories, poetry of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Mary Oliver.

Are there any creative writers out there who may share with me their own experience in getting started/writing consistently, and how/whether they balance reading others' works, vs. creating their own works?
