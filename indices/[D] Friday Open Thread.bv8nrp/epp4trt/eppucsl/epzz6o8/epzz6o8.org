Also, like I said:

  It's a reminder that lots of little things are probably going to end up being lost and I'm not even going to remember what they were to miss them.

I took a few days off and now I'm going through and working on the rebuilding effort again, and it turns out that all the playlists I ever made on iTunes no longer exist, and the only playlist I would sync to my iPod is my workout playlist so they're just straight up gone. And I used to sort Windows Explorer by Date Created or Date Modified or Date Accessed depending on use case, and that's all been reset as well, so now files from years ago are all mixed in with newer files instead of newest at the top and oldest at the bottom, which is going to force me to do even more reorganizing.

So it really wasn't about being able to see who I've upvoted/downvoted, that was just the first thing I noticed was gone.

EDIT:

And I totally and completely forgot to make any sort of note of all the VSTs/plugins I had for FL Studio, so I'm going to have to try to find all of those by memory. Great.
