Is it just me, or is the summary of Worth the Candle kind of... I don't know, unappealing, likely to give the wrong impression. Take a look:

  From the age of nine, Juniper Smith began filling notebooks with his worlds, at first places of fantastical imagination, but later with each as an expression of some theme or idea that momentarily grabbed his interest. Over the course of eight years, he shared these worlds with his friends through twice-weekly sessions of tabletop gaming. Now at the age of seventeen, he finds himself in Aerb, a world that appears to be an amalgam of those many notebooks, stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world is trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.

Emphasizing the story's main conceit is not the way to go on royalroad, in my opinion. These are mostly younger guys who know what they like and who read dozens of hours of that every week. Readers there are starved for new things to read, and they will try any new story if it: 1)pattern matches to something they already like, 2) is updated regularly, 3) has a huge backlog, and 4) is already popular.

WtC already matches 1, 2 and 3(the last only until it catches up, anyway) and should do great there. The best way to capitalize on that imo would be to emphasize the familiar --in order of importance: Strong MC | young male first person POV | LitRPG | Isekai/portal | Epic fantasy-- and to reduce any potential "friction" by burying the lede a bit on the esoteric stuff. Let them discover the Juniper/Aerb connection gradually, as he does.

Any thoughts?
