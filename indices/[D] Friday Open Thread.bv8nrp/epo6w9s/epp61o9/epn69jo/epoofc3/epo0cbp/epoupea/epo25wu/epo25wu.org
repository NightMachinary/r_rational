I occasionally write short stories (not very good ones though), and I spend most of my reading/writing time on the reading end of things. Mostly my writing is after I see an interesting idea in one of the works I read, and want to explore it in a different manner, leading to me making a short story about that concept. This method doesn't result in me writing much, but I always enjoy my writing when I do do it. If you are looking for advice about writing a greater amount than that, I do not have firsthand experience, but if I were in that situation I would probably write out a list of all the interesting ideas from the last few works I read, to bring them to mind and make reworking them a more available idea. If I really wanted to get a short story made, I might then force myself to write about one of the ideas, to make sure I do not end up thinking “none of these seem particularly striking to write a story about”. YMMV, of course, and good luck with your writing.
