I've found myself in the bad habit of writing excerpts while at work and plugging them into the story I'm writing awkwardly. Consistency was a problem at first, but once I started to make several paragraphs a day it started to get easier. Like, a lot easier. Humans are creatures of habits, and its up to you to cultivate those habits.

On that note, I've got a friend who every time he smokes tries to write as much as he can before his cigarette runs out, but he's an extreme example. Try to work it in where you can. Have fun with it. Start small and build up to where you want to be.
