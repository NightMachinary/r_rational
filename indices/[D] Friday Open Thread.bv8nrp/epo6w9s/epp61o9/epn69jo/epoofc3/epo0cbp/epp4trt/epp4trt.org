Rant incoming.

I screwed up my computer like 3 weeks ago. Desktop went from a slideshow of pretty landscapes to flat black with white text in the bottom right telling me that my copy of Windows isn't genuine, other things being screwy, etcetera, ran multiple scans of defender and the malware removal thing and nothing got found but the system was still screwy, so I copied all of my crap over to a 2TB external hard drive, completely emptied my computer of all my files.

I then spent the next few weeks going through all of my email addresses and deleting and/or consolidating all the internet accounts linked to each of them, changing all my passwords for the internet accounts that I kept and then updating each of their emails to my "main" email before deleting the email address that I used to create the account, like, I had three Hulu accounts with three different email addresses, my internet activity over the last few years has been a mess, whatever. I'm down to four email addresses and three of them are only getting mail from like one or two places each, so that's probably good.

I spent the last 12 hours doing the (semi)final stage: a factory reset on my computer, and then updating windows. I'm pretty sure that at least the last 8 hours, if not longer, were running Windows Update. (I still have to reinstall my programs and I haven't moved my files over from the hard drive yet, gonna do that tomorrow and take advantage of the situation to make sure things are organized and not have a bunch of folders full of random crap that get created every time the desktop gets too full.)

And now here I am, importing bookmarks, signing in to websites, adding browser extensions, and I add the Reddit Enhancement Suite and come here to look at what's been going on in the Friday thread... All my little "+40"s and "+9"s and "-5"s and "-15"s and whatever beside people's names? That's all gone. I hadn't even thought about that. What a nice little irritating annoyance to cap it all off with. I mean, I recognize most people's names, but still. It's a reminder that lots of little things are probably going to end up being lost and I'm not even going to remember what they were to miss them.

End rant.
