My trick is to leave myself a lot of notes. Every time I think I might be moving over to a different project, or sometimes even if I don't, I leave myself little TODOs on the project, and at the bottom of every doc is a brief description of the plot and the major players. Here's one example:

#+begin_quote
  Case unwinds itself, leads to larger conspiracy, ties into wizarding election, mires the main characters in mortal danger

  Charles: affable and bumbling force for the status quo, ignorant of politics, growing toward having to make a moral choice for once in his life

  Madeline: stuck between two worlds, bitter in the way that competent people sometimes are when surrounded by incompetence, serious and dedicated, growing toward rebellion against system
#+end_quote

All that helps to give some purpose to whatever I'm going to do when I revisit the project, so that I don't have to reread and re-edit the whole honking thing every time I resume work on something that's been laying in the drafts folder for ages. A lot of what I do is calculated toward helping my future self. (Because I use Google Docs for writing, I try to leave myself annotations too, usually things like "try to pay this off later" or "name comes from Afrikaans for shadow" or something like that. This is also pretty helpful.)

"Sustain the push" partly depends on how interesting I think I'll find the work without any jolts of inspiration, and how likely I think I am to run into roadblocks (whether those include scenes I don't know how to write or plot resolutions I don't immediate answers to). I think working without inspiration or motivation is one of the greatest skills a writer can have, and something that should be cultivated as much as possible, which helps get through the inevitable creative dry spells. My usual way of thinking in those dark times is just "put one word in front of the other".

As for the haitus, I usually don't actually stop writing, and it's rare that I'll skip a day, I just sometimes go a long time without publishing. If you're interested, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing][I maintain a word count spreadsheet here]] which tracks output. /Worth the Candle/ has gotten pretty hard to write, given there are a million words of continuity to track, a mammoth, sprawling world, dozens of powers and magic with all their interactions, and a pretty full cast, which accounts for some of the slowdown as compared with the first month or two of 4K words a day.
