OK, the window thing is not ubiquitous as I made it sound, but [[https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x2a32ba950a372a99%3A0xa27a1528b2ecd523!2m22!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m16!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!2m2!1m1!1e6!3m1!7e115!4shttps%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipNJOHfM1vmjXSk-c7NiEiBfUblMUnVSNMn0w0AG%3Dw284-h160-k-no!5ssecondeli%20cafe%20mount%20lawley%20-%20Google%20Search!15sCAQ&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipOWivsTFvW8RqKyHU7WnrlPin_MPAszSlA8wZCB&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8v_mTxsfiAhUJohQKHVi0DtUQoiowD3oECAwQBg][here's an example]] - probably about 5% of coffee shops have them.

More accurately, any shop that sells coffee (cafes, etc) I can walk in, order my coffee, stand there and wait, and be handed a coffee cup and then go on my way (exactly like starbucks, which hasn't really been very successful in Australia because apparently we're coffee snobs?). Whereas here the places that sell coffee, they don't have disposable cups, and I've not seen people carrying them around (whereas in Australia on public transport or walking around town it's a very common sight to see people with disposable coffee cups).
