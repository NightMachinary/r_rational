  Waiters have a salary instead of living off tips, so they tend to be stony instead of cheerful

That's true in my homeland as well, though the more upmarket the place in Australia the better the service generally speaking (because you have 14 year olds who don't give a shit at somewhere like Nandos VS people who have been serving for decades and will be fired if they fuck up the least bit at a $100 a person fine dining place).

I've eaten out a few times here, and I've honestly found the service to be good to excellent. My french is passable (despite how CouteauBlue made it look in his response to my last comment ;), but I've found that sometimes they'll switch to English out of courtesty (which bugs me because I want to practise my French, but the stereotype is that they refuse to speak English, so...). But then again maybe that comes back to:

  They really hate it if you talk in anything other than French, but they'll be merciful if you at least make the attempt with a few words of hello and food terms.

I had a run in with an American tourist at the airport who tried to make me order cigarettes for her at a newsagency because she saw me inquiring about a SIM card in French. She spoke to me like the salesperson wasn't there. I felt so awkward. Especially because her friend had been in front of me in the line and had repeatedly asked the salesperson about tax refund forms in English.... the poor woman works at the newsagent in the airport, she is not a tax form person. Fortunately I've not seen anyone that bad since.
