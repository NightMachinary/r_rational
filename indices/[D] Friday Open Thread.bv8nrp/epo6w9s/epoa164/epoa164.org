Depends on what you're looking to optimize. If you're trying to optimize for "# of people who will try the work", then you want the most tailored-to-demographic description that you can get. If you want to optimize for "# of people who will give favorable rating/reviews", then I think you should wear your heart on your sleeve, because that way you'll scare off all the people who would be mad about a perceived bait-and-switch, plus all the people who would simply go into the work with hopes and then find that it's not their thing.

My position is basically that I don't want people who don't like the story to read the story. From a monetary standpoint, they're unlikely to become patrons. From a metrics standpoint, they're likely to leave bad metrics. From a word-of-mouth standpoint, they're likely to put out bad word-of-mouth. From a citizen-of-the-world standpoint, I would rather people have as few barrriers to optimizing their enjoyment of works as possible.

With that said, I didn't even think of tailoring the description to RoyalRoad, so maybe some better copy could be written, with the above in mind.
