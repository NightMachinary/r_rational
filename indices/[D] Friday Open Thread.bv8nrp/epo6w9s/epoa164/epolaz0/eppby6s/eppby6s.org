This is the new blurb:

#+begin_quote
  A teenager struggling after the death of his best friend finds himself in a fantasy world - one which seems to be an amalgamation of every Dungeons and Dragons campaign they ever played together. Now he's stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world is trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.

Minor spoilers, but only for the first three or four chapters, and it's mostly background information. Might still try to work in the "character sheet stapled to my soul" bit at some point, but I hate blurbs, so whatever.
