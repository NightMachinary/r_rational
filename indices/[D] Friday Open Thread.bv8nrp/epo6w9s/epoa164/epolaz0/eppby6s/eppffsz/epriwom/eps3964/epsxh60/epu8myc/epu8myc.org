Everyone seems to think that the point is to give a sense of the entire story, but this isn't a 900k word book on a shelf, it's a long as fuck ongoing webserial. Describe the first volume and let people see the quality for themselves, and they will get invested in the story. Just like every trilogy or series has ever done. I don't see in what world that's a bait and switch or clickbait.

And I'm speaking from experience, too. Trying to "accurately" describe the story to friends and colleagues was not the way to go, while saying that "it's a portal fantasy that puts a heavy emphasis on characterization and worldbuilding" and elaborating a bit did get some to read it.
