I wouldn't mention DnD at all, really. I know it's a crucial part of WtC, but I truly think it's... prejudicial, for lack of a better word. Fantasy stories which feature roleplaying are uniformly bad, in my experience, WtC is pretty much the only exceptions.

The second paragraph is better. I wouldn't list things like in the last sentence, though. It's kind of lazy.

That said, I don't know what I'd do differently. I suggested this in the discord, but it was met with a collective groan:

  In the blink of an eye seventeen year old Juniper Smith finds himself in another world, on the verge of being thrown out of a plane into a desolate land teeming with monsters. A Trial by Adversity, they call it, punishment for who knows what crime. Now he needs to survive by wits alone long enough to discover what's going on, and why the world is so incredibly familiar. . .

This whole thing made Neil Gaiman's advice to authors come to mind:

  Remember: when people tell you something's wrong or doesn't work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.
