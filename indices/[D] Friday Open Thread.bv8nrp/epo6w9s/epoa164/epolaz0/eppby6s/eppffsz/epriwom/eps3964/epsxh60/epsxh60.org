Recursive writing advice:

- "Trial by adversity" already gives too much detail, and it's not central to the plot.

- "who knows what crime" is the wrong sentence structure. I often see that structure used by amateur writers here (PGtE used to have it /a lot/); "who knows what" introduces a question ("what crime is he punished for?"), except the rest of the sentence doesn't lead into that question; instead the question is a digression, adding extra detail to the "trial by adversity" part.

- The blurb only gives the premise of the first chapters, but it doesn't really illustrate what's special about the story. Like, "character is thrown from a place into a horde of zombies" is a good way to raise the stakes from the start (which is especially important in an isekai story), but it's not really a hook. People looking for isekai are used to "everybody wants to kill the MC" stories.

Honestly, on second read, I think the blurb above is fine. It doesn't quite have the clickbait effect of saying "The character is thrown from a plane and about to be eaten alive", but I think that's okay, because WtC isn't a clickbait story.
