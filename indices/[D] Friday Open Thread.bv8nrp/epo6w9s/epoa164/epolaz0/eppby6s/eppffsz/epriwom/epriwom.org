I'm not familiar with the audience of Royalroad, but to me, this summary is missing the point of WtC. The only part worth keeping is "this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth", because it hints at some character analysis and deeper meaning.

Because, really, when I think WtC, I don't think "muchkining level-up mechanics" or "teenager in a fantasy land", or "yeah, but /this/ loli character has a perfectly valid reason for being underage and naked, I swear!". I think about Amaryllis and Joon's relationship, where Amaryllis is more of a munchkin and Joon treats it all like a story; or the way the world is laid out, how it emphasizes multiculturalism and takes ideas that Joon would have had over the course of an afternoon and develops a whole society around them with its own customs and social expectations.

I don't know how you'd make that into a blurb, though. Maybe something like that:

#+begin_quote
  In Juniper's D&D games, these little societies were so simple. This one was warmongering, and this one farmed rocks for a living. But in the world of Aerb, they're functional cultures, with customs, traditions and many nuances.

  Struggling after the death of his best friend, Juniper is plunged in a fantasy world, a world that struggles to meet the challenges of both modern life and world-ending threats. To survive, Juniper must deal with societal prejudice, black ops forces, murderous creatures and, most terrifying of all, his own internal demons.

(except better written)

Otherwise, maybe you could do the same thing r!Animorphs did, and find a particularly striking quote in early chapters that really illustrates what's special about /this/ isekai universe?
