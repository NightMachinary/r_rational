I think it's only a slight improvement, to be honest. I don't think it's much different to the one that scared me away when I saw the first chapter here on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], despite the fact that I read pretty much everything that's posted here. It reminded me too much of several awful stories I dnf'ed. You'd be surprised at how many litrpgs start with a DnD group incarnating in another world as their characters, and unsurprised at how much they all suck.

It was only 2 months later when the thread got 100 upvotes (the first chapter thread besides MoL to do so, iirc) that I gave it another shot.

Anyway, I'm aware that everyone on the discord seems to disagree, which combined with my pathological dislike of giving negative feedback makes me... unsure of my position. Maybe I'm wrong, what do I know of blurbs.
