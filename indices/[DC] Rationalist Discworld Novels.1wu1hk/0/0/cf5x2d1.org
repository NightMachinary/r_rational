The Witches books are often written as full of heroic responsibility. They also involve a lot of difficult moral judgements at times - I just recently reread the opening of Carpe Jugulum, and there is a bit about Mr. Ivy and his wife that was still as amazingly written and interesting as ever. [[#s][Spoilers for Carpe Jugulum's opening (not relevant to the major plot of the book, just gives an idea of characters]] It really brought up a lot of interesting moral ideas I hadn't considered before about people making decisions for others, and is a well-written way to expose the core of Weatherwax's character - the person who does what is necessary.

I agree about the Tiffany Aching books in particular - great novels for children, but fully readable as an adult. All of his YA fiction still reads well for adults.

That said, I am not sure that merely having heroic responsibility qualifies a piece of fiction as rationalist. They are good books, even great books, with a lot to commend them, but there's not necessarily a lot of rationalist thought involved most of the time IMO. I don't really think semantics arguments are particularly meaningful or helpful in most circumstances, but in this particular case if we start saying "books involving protagonists who do what they need to do no matter what" are "rationalist", it will help dilute the term of any useful meaning it has accrued.
