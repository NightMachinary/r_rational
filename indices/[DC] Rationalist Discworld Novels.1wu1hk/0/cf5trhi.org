I always recommend the books featuring the Witches are rationalist reading material. The Witches modus operandi is simply "get it done" no matter what.

Those books are also full of heroic responsibility (which is best explained in I Shall Wear Midnight as doing all the necessary things no-one else does).

I'm pretty sure the Tiffany Aching novels will end up on my children's bookshelves. (The translated copies, the English copies are for shelves.)
