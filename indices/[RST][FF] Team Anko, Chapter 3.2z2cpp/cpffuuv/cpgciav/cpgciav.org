I just read that; thanks for the link. I enjoyed the story and I think it's pretty original, but it does require some suspension of disbelief. Kakashi is one of the best jonin in Konoha. He was an ANBU captain when he was...8? I forget exactly. The idea that three fresh graduates could take him down is thin -- he's fought plenty of other jonin, is it actually the case that none of them have ever tried toxic smoke?

He noticed the piles of trash, and he noticed Sasuke lighting them up. Surely he should have realized "I don't know what these are, but my enemies put them here, so they are unlikely to be good for me. I think I'll move the fight away from them and stay away from the piles and their smoke."
