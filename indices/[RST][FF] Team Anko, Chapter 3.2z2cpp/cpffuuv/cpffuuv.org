I want Anko to learn the lessons of Kakashi from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6940744/1/A-Teacher-s-Glory][A Teacher's Glory]]. Who in their right mind would pull a drill sergeant "unite against me, use lethal force" ploy on their own team of assasins? I mean, maybe Orochimaru could afford to do this, but he has a survivability of a cockroach in plot armour and only one student.

Consciously or not, they will learn to treat Anko as an enemy at least a little bit. Hopefully there will be consequences.
