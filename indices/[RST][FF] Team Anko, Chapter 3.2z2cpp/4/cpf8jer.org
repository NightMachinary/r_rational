  "Hate you so much," Naruto mumbled under his breath. After a minute he cocked his head. "Hang on, you said you wouldn't tell us any direct lies, and you said to me 'it was on the spoons'. Were you lying when you said you wouldn't lie to us?" he asked accusingly.

  She laughed and bounced to her feet, stretching luxuriously. "Nice catch. Yes, it was on the spoons. So, now that you've figured that out, O Grand High Mission Commander Guy, what's your plan for the day?"

She didn't actually answer the question about directly lying to them. Also she changed the topic straight after while distracting Naruto with stretching and the mocking title. Fits right in with her speech about deception training earlier.

About what happens next my guess would be that the slippers won't work out and that Naruto creates and transforms two clones which will carry his teammates to the city under some pretense.

Also in the section with your advertising the name renders as "Albrecht LË†fgren" for me.
