You're quite welcome. And it's definitely hard to accept Kakashi falling for that kind of trap. My point is that it's impossible to predict every strategy someone may try against you, and taking unnecessary risks is stupid. Granted, the team will surely interpret this situation as "don't hold back when sparring" rather then "I'm now your enemy, do your best to kill me when I least expect it", still the risk just does not seem worth the reward here.

I'm more worried about the bias she will introduce into their minds. Sure she talks about helping one's teammates regardless of personal feelings, but, as we well know, human brain does not care what pretty ideas you spout. Training your team to subconsciously consider their team leader an enemy is not a good idea. Any kind of "unite against me" style training should be carried out by someone other than a commanding officer who leads the team on missions.
