I wonder why Waterfall and Sound would even oppose this?

1. Having Fire between you and your enemy is less work than a buffer zone, you have to occasionally monitor.

2. They should profit as much as Fire from a trade route to the Republic not going through Lightning.

The only reason would be that Fire is already threatening due to its power and they do not want them to grab any more land.
