I'm missing a plot-hook. We're 26k words into the story, which is a third of a novel already and nothing much has happened yet.

The story is boring. If I had just stumbled on the story on ff.net I'd probably have stopped reading in chapter 3. We spent the whole chapter, over 8k words, in one night camping. We learned a bit more about the characters and the world, but not nearly enough to justify the length.

What was the point of spending over a sixth of this long chapter on how to estimate the probability of being caught? To be that thorough, you had to be trying to teach the audience. The problem with that, is that the thought experiment is about a magical ninja-world about which we don't know nearly enough to know what assumptions are plausible.

The interactions between the characters - which could carry such a long scene absent plot - are not as fun or interesting as a well written canon Team 7 usually is. Shino, Hinata and even your Anko and Naruto just don't seem terribly interesting or engaging.

There is also a lot of repetition in the character interaction. Anko goes back and forth between challenging the genin and praising them /constantly/. Compare that to other similar stories that do the drill-instructor as a sensei bit. They usually have the jounin be a dick for chapters at a time until the genin are completely exhausted or lose it and only /then/ the teacher goes back to explaining what s/he was doing and praising them for how far they've come. That cycle is done once or twice. In your story, Anko goes back and forth between those two 'modes' all the time.
