The clones don't seem to mind dying so much, so I'm not sure that this counts as murder. I mean, if I was a shadow clone, I would not mind dying for the original me. In fact, I would urge the original me to keep creating more shadow clones. We would be close enough in memory and personality that it would not feel like death.
