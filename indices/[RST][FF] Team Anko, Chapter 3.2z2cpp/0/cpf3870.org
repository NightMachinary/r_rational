Nice chapter. You explained the differences of the Shadow Clone technique from canon, as well as begun exploring the various ways each teammate has different abilities and what they can do. Having Shino use his bugs as a mapping tool is quite a smart idea.

EDIT: Can we post comments on the page the chapter's posted on your website?
