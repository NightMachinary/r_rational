Interesting. I absolutely agree that Chili and Bucket are horrible people in a visceral way. It's unsettling and might move the story into unenjoyable territory for some readers. But it also works with the mood whiplash that makes the story so good.

However, I don't think I follow the sneer club comparison. While the story was clearly poking fun at various rationalfic tropes, plot beats, etc, they scanned more like in-jokes than mockery to me.
