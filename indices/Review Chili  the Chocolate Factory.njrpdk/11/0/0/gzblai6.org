I was referring to the palpable joy those characters took in their cruelty to others. I don't think I'm describing it quite right. It's a specific emotion that EY has talked about previously (and in particular stated he does not experience and cannot model well).

I did not mean to imply that I thought the story itself was sneering at the community of readers, only that, e.g., Charlie would fit right in posting on SneerClub.
