I am always surprised when I see folks talk about this story and not give any mention to the hatefulness of the characters. Chili was bad enough, but Bucket is so incredibly nasty. Whatever else it had going for it, I found reading Charlie's interactions with the children to be far too distasteful to enjoy the story and I ultimately did not finish it. The whole story was steeped in the tone of [[/r/SneerClub][r/SneerClub]] in a way that I was very surprised the sub took to so acceptingly.
