Sure, I've definitely struggled to convince people to try worm and I do agree it has it's flaws. It's just that it feels like the flaws are more in the editing and quality of the prose (especially early on) rather than in how much value you can get from consuming it vs reading the wikipedia summary. A large part of the enjoyment of reading worm (at least for me) was in experiencing the escalation and breathtaking pace of the middle arcs. I'm not sure if that is at all captured in reading a clinical description of Taylor taking over the universe. Perhaps I'm not understanding wiki-adjacency correctly.
