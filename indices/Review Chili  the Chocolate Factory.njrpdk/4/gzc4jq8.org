I loved the story, but I also was expecting something very very different from the first chapter. In that chapter Chili is portrayed as an antisocial and angry but brilliant child, who reads books on statistics and medical textbooks and has that classic [[/r/rational][r/rational]] contrarian streak:

  The first and less important reason for the delay was that he didn't like the idea of formal education, of being told what to read instead of choosing himself. He disliked the concept even more than he did the hunger. The choice was important to him, even if he had trouble explaining why.

I was desperately hoping for a sort of classic /bildungsroman/ where a poor orphan rationalist Chili fixes problems with SCIENCEâ„¢ and learns what friendship is. Instead we got a more dark funny absurdist story (not sure a rationalist protagonist would even make sense in this kind of world) where Chili's intelligence is mostly sidelined in favor of him acting as a hateful murderchild and eventually being removed from the plot completely. Was anyone else expecting the first type of story, or was that just me?

(If anyone were to write the first type of story I would read the /shit/ out of it, FYI.)
