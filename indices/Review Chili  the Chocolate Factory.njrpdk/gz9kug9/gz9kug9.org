I loved this fic. I agree that you can't derive the ending from the setup, but I interpret that as a deliberate prank on us. The author certainly liked playing them.

There was even a bit in the middle where a character talks about mysteries and endings. About how sometimes there isn't any payoff. The fic was then marked as complete, before we even entered the factory.
