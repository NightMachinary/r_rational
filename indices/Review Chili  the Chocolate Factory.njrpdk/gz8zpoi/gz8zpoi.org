LOOK IT'S MORE CHILIPOSTING YESSSS

(If you haven't read through them, I actually do very seriously recommend paging through [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=Chili+and+the+Chocolate+Factory&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on][the discussion threads back from during Chili's publication.]] (And I'm not just saying that because I'm proud of my own Chiliposting (although I'm not /not/ [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/go9y95/rtffwip_chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_chapter/frfaqp3/][proud of it]].))

  Gazemaize gives friggin Scott Alexander a run for his money here.

Hard disagree here. UNSONG was a masterpiece, but didn't come anywhere /close/ to the sheer dazzling density of wordplay in CatCF.

#+begin_quote
  I think Chili would be much improved if all instances of the word fuck were replaced with made up words. What puzzles me is that this is already kind-of done, so I'm surprised Gazemaize didn't go all the way here, it would make the tone a lot more consistent.

I liked this a lot, actually. The work is a deconstruction, and its target audience is very much not children, but, well, /this subreddit./ The chat conversations were, in large part, based on real conversations and participants in an [[/r/rational]]-adjacent Discord server. The made-up swears felt Dahlian to me, and the in-universe swearing felt to me like it served important purposes. The fact that it had both traditional and Dahlian swearing was part of what sold the tonal marriage of this subreddit's culture and voice with Dahl's entire canon.

#+begin_quote
  Loose plot threads that don't really go anywhere (Looking at you, Gabriel and Chillenial).
#+end_quote

Have to disagree with you again here, at least as somebody who experienced it as it came out. The consequences of Gabriel's actions actually /do/ crop up during the ending, although it's not explicitly spelled out. And I honestly loved that. Chillennial, on the other hand, served multiple narrative purposes, but primarily to act as a voicebox for the theorizing going on here in the threads about the story on this subreddit. I think he holds up after the fact as a container for the kind of predictions that ratfic fans would be likely to make having read up to that point in the story.

On another level, Chillennial Lee and Gabriel Munoza were head fakes. We expected them to be children who'd get golden tickets. Everybody who's familiar with the question of AI safety knew what was going to happen with Gabriel's chocolate-maximizing AI. The idea that happiness is produced from the murder of animals, which gets drilled down into later in the story when we learn about quarks, gets introduced with Gabriel and his dad.

On another level, the "incompleteness" of their plot threads serves a dimension of the storytelling which we're told about diegetically: the fact that incompleteness /can in itself be an artistic statement./ Truncatism is presented as a joke, but this is also part of the deconstruction of rational fiction, in my opinion: ratfic readers /really/ don't like having things spoonfed to them or spelled out explicitly all the time, and there really /is/ art to knowing when to stop expositing at your audience and trust that they'll pick up the rest as implied.

  Character focus issues.
#+end_quote

I didn't have a problem with this. Protagonists get a lot of moral weight by virtue of the fact they're protagonists, and Chili strips that right away off the bat by having the "main character" be hateful and grating. Gazemaize didn't trap us around that horrible child's perspective all the time and I'm grateful for that. More subversion and deconstruction, and making an implicit promise to the reader that things will happen according to internally consistent rules, not following some imposed external framework like some silly "hero's journey" that describes everything that is going to happen regardless of any logical progression of events or character motivations.

Honestly? Masterfully done, all of it.

#+begin_quote
  The ending.[...]pun.
#+end_quote

I dunno, I was pretty familiar with Dahl's antisemitism prior to reading the story, and when I read the relevant line, I literally leapt up and ran around screaming for a bit at the terribleness of the pun. (In the sense of being so groanworthy as to break the scale.)

I was one of the people who originally thought that perhaps Wonka had turned himself into a pickle. I didn't mind if it was that meme, so long as it was well done, then lo and behold! It wasn't that and I still didn't mind.

(Also I'm really sorry but I'd never heard of that food before. Interesting idea there?)

Anyway, thanks for giving me the excuse to wall-o-text about Chili again. And [[/u/gazemaize]], deep and sincere thanks again for making something that brought us so much unbridled joy.
