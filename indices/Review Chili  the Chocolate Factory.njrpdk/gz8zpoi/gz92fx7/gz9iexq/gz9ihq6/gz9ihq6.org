* hopefully clear what I meant by 'love letter.' CatCF doesn't worship Dahl or project perfection onto him, but it is highly, highly /aware/ of him through the entire work. Dahl isn't the omnibenevolent god of his realm, more of a demiurge which was the product of its time. In keeping with the properties of the pickle as established diegetically.
