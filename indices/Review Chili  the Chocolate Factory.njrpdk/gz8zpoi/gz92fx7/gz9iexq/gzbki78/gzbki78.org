The incredibly narrow niche of the Road Dill...Cinematic Universe? is why I'd recommend the discussion threads too. This was 100% off the rails at the time. It felt like anything could happen /and it would be totally justified by some bullshit Roald Dahl published in 1980./ I definitely didn't get a decent chunk of the jokes until I checked the thread; this probably detracts from the experience of reading it now, but it really drew me in at the time.
