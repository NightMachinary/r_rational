  De gustibus non est disputandum

Fax mentis incendium gloria cultum, et cetera, et cetera... Memo bis punitor delicatum. It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal.

  I'd say something 1000 people rate 9.5/10 is, in a quite objective sense, better than something 10 people rate 10/10.

This is one more place we differ, really. I'm all about weird, specialized things for specific audiences. This argument feels to me like "Twin Peaks would be objectively better if there were explanatory inserts to make the story more accessible to more people." Art has to commit to an audience or else risk becoming not-art, in my opinion and experience. Like Thomas Kinkade paintings.

  ..and that in a nutshell is my main gripe with building a whole work around something that only a fraction of the audience will understand.

Judging by the comments threads when it came out, I think it was a fairly /large/ fraction of the target audience that got the joke. I will say that Chili is certainly /deeply rewarding/ of doing the background reading (or even background Wikipedia skimming); I understand and appreciate where you're coming from here, but I also cannot fault the work itself for being such a /comprehensive/ love letter* to Roald Dahl (warts and all), even at the expense of its own comprehensibility.

Anyway, thanks for having opinions different enough from mine to "justify" me posting this much about this story. I foam at the mouth for opportunities to write my Chiliposting screeds (obviously) and it would have been so much more boring if all I'd been able to say was "yup I agree with all this it's one of the best things I ever read."
