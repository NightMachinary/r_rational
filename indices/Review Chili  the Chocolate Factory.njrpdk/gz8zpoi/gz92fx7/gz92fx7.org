  UNSONG was a masterpiece, but didn't come anywhere close to the sheer dazzling density of wordplay in CatCF.

  Gazemaize didn't trap us around that horrible child's perspective all the time and I'm grateful for that.

Yeah, me too. It really shines as an ensemble fic. I just don't understand why the the story has his name in it. If it was for a pun, I'd understand, so I was surprised when it didn't. Like I said, these are mostly minor issues.

  On another level, the "incompleteness" of their plot threads serves a dimension of the storytelling which we're told about diegetically: the fact that incompleteness can in itself be an artistic statement.

On one hand, I love arguments like these. On the other, it's a fine line, take it too far and you end up sounding [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGfHnJ1KTA0][like this]]. I prefer to err on the side of universal understanding; I'd say something 1000 people rate 9.5/10 is, in a quite objective sense, /better/ than something 10 people rate 10/10.

..and that in a nutshell is my main gripe with building a whole work around something that only a fraction of the audience will understand. My problem with the pun in question wasn't so much on how prevalent the knowledge was, but rather that it was outside-context and relied on real world info to be solved, which doesn't sit well with me.
