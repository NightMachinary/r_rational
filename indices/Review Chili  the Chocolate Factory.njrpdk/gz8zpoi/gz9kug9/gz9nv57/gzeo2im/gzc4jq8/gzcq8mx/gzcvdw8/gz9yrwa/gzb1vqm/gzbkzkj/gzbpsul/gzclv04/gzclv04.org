I just mentioned Worm because it's a well-known work that exhibits this trend, not because it's my main gripe with it or even has a lot of this problem.

Wildbow's worldbuilding is absolutely stellar. I feel confident saying this not because I've read all his stuff- I've only finished Worm- but because I've read their entries on tvtropes.

It's just- when I feel like I can get a good proportion of the value of a work by reading a detailed synopsis and looking at the tvtropes entries, which usually give adequate context, quite often I find myself doing that instead of reading it. I've flipped through the character list for Ward a few times, and I'm very interested in the new characters, their powers, and their relationship dynamics... but I still haven't found the motivation to get more than 3 chapters in, because I remember how /tired/ reading Worm made me.

Worm was such a page-turner, to the extent that by the time I was approaching the climax, I was almost skimming the stuff- I have very little recollection of the plot roughly around the time skip.

I guess this is as admission of fault on my part as a reader- I don't pay enough attention to the words as the action ramps up, and by the end of a particularly exciting story my reading comprehension sort of hydroplanes.
