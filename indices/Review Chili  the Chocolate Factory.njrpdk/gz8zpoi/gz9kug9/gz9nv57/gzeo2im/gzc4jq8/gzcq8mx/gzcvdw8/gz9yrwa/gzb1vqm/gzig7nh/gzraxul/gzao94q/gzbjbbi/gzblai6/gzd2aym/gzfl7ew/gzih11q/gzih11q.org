I think Charlie in particular needed to be presented /really/ intensely for the story to have the same impact it did, and to a lesser extent Chilli. The way that everything is amped up to 11 doesn't necessarily help, but I think the payoff was pretty good along both lines, with Charlie dying after having his beliefs rejected by the characters, the readers, and the world itself, and Chili finding offscreen reformation.
