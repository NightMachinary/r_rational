Oh. Yeah, I can totally see that. There's got to be a name for this. Like schaudenfreude with agency. I was trying to describe it when writing that post but ended up cutting the following:

  the way they're written reminds me of villains in a Stephen King novel, doing horrible things for reasons that are /obviously irrational/ to us but just uncomfortably human. The scene that came to mind was early in The Stand, where some two-bit criminals hold up a drugstore for cash, which snowballs out of control and ends with half a dozen gory shootings. It's visceral, it's pointless, it's a drop in the bucket compared to the millions dying of the plague in the background, but it makes you hate these characters. That was Charlie and Chili for me. You just know that this is not a person you're comfortable enabling or being around. You get that feeling that if you were there, looking them in the eye as they said it, you /wouldn't do anything about it,/ because they don't think the way you expect and you have no angle. And you can imagine those kind of people around you.
