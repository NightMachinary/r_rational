I can sympathize there. For me part of the charm was that rush of "this is so good I can't put it down," which I was able to do because I was mainlining Worm while in the passenger seat on a road trip.

I read Wildbow's other stuff (up until Pale) as it came out, so there was an enforced pacing that kind of improved parts of the experience. For Pact in particular, I suspected I enjoyed it a lot more than most of the binge readers.

Twig is the one I would expect to hold up best in this case. It's more episodic at first, with R&R between team missions, and a somewhat more subtle use of worldbuilding as opposed to the twist after twist on a known formula of superhero fiction or urban fantasy. The character dynamics are also the best out of all the Wildbow stuff I've read. Their tighter network makes it a bit easier to keep track of relations and I found skimming less likely.
