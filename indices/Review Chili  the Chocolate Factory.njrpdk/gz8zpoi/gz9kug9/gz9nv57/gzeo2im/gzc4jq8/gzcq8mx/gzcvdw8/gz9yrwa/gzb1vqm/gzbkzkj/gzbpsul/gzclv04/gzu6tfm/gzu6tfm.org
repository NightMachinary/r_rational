The wiki doesn't really dive into any of the literary, thematic, or metatextual elements of Worm, which are some of my favorite things about it. I love how it can be enjoyed as a dumb, fun superhero action romp, while also being an absolute joy to dissect in a more literary way.

There are scenes where every time I come back to them, I find new ways they connect to or contrast with existing characters and plot threads. If you haven't, I really recommend checking out the [[https://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-worm/][We've Got Worm]] podcast, where two hosts come at the work arc-by-arc from these perspectives. It's an absolutely engaging listen.
