Something that I think is worth pointing out, that you wouldn't have properly understood if you binged through it after CatCF was finished -

The gut punch that was chapter 6!

Look. Chapter 6 was published in the first week of January 2020. At this point the story had been going for a few weeks, we were all invested in it, lots of guessing about the solution to the puzzle, and etc.

And then - a chapter called "The End", the story's status changing from in progress to completed, a chatlog of a character complaining how nobody who doesn't enter the factory will ever know what the solution to the puzzle was or what happens inside the factory. It fit, it fit so well with JUROR and incompleteness and etc, it felt like this was definitely how the story was going to end. I personally was devastated and I know a bunch of others felt the same way.

And then we got a new chapter! And the story kept going! And it was so good and so much fun! I'm so happy that chapter 6 wasn't actually where it ended but I do wish there was a way for future readers to feel the emotions we felt at the time.
