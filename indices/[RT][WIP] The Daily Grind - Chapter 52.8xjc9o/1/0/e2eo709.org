I think it mostly stays the same. The writing gets a little bit better, but there's still a heavy focus on action, which doesn't really do much for me. I do really like some of the ideas in it, and the weirdness of the premise, but plot progression is slow, and people have forgotten important things one too many times. There's a little bit more character interactions, which helps a bit, and some deepening of the mysteries, but it's still somewhat slow, and I think if you read it, you're probably reading /for/ those action scenes.
