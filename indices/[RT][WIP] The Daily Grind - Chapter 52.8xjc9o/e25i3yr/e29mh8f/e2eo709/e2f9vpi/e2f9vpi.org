Thanks for the input, and yeah I had the same impression so far , the ideas and weirdness is getting you hooked, but the character and plot progressions and wiritng style just dont hit it of for me. The action focused writing style really ends up in being kinda chaotic. In one sentence they talk about running back to the entrance they are hurt and want to escape so they run , next paragraph they are under some table resting talking and then fighting again... adn then in detail the fight then some weirdd paragraphs and like then 10 paragraphs later " Oh yeah we should go back now because we are hurt and shouldnt just fight even more" ... and the actuall munchkiny stuff gets kinda scraped and forgotten way to much = / . So this story is not for me.
