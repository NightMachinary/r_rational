  I really liked this chapter!

Thanks! It was fun to write, although I felt like it was a little rushed. Now that I work Saturdays it's cutting heavily into my writing time for the quest.

  I want to see Hazou finally dodge Mari's hair ruffle. I'm guessing that that'll be a big moment for the two of them. You need to allow him an actual dodge roll for that to ever happen though!

We've done the roll a few times and periodically do it again.

  I'm looking forward to see how they'll interact with the other characters in Leaf. Was surprised that they sent the team with 3 noble heirs and the Third's son to escort them, that seems needlessly dangerous.

There's method to the madness. :>

  I'm hoping they'll get to meet Naruto and Sasuke - very curious to see what you've done with those two characters especially. At least one of those characters is /very/ different than canon.

  Edit: Oh, and I vote tremorsense over skidmark if I can do that here, and WOW the thread on SV is already 4 pages along since I read the chapter. I can't keep up with that!

All you need to do to vote in the thread is throw out a post saying: [x] Skidmark
