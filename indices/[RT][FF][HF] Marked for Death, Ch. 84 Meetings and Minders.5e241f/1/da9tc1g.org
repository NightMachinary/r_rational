I really liked this chapter! I found Hazou's speech a bit long last chapter (I wish I could just go on soliloquise like that without anyone interrupting), but I love how the decisions made by people in the forum cause Hazou to be brilliant half of the time and oblivious in the other half. Right now he's my favourite character I think - Mori's my least favourite. She's way too self-centered for my tastes.

I want to see Hazou finally dodge Mari's hair ruffle. I'm guessing that that'll be a big moment for the two of them. You need to allow him an actual dodge roll for that to ever happen though!

I'm looking forward to see how they'll interact with the other characters in Leaf. Was surprised that they sent the team with 3 noble heirs and the Third's son to escort them, that seems needlessly dangerous. I'm hoping they'll get to meet Naruto and Sasuke - very curious to see what you've done with those two characters especially.

Edit: Oh, and I vote tremorsense over skidmark if I can do that here, and WOW the thread on SV is already 4 pages along since I read the chapter. I can't keep up with that!
