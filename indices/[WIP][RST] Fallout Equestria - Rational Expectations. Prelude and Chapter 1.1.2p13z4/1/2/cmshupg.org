Maybe people just aren't interested in reading about the vanilla Fallout world that they've seen only in video games, and need the extra emotional tie to the setting that a crossover into some other medium provides? There are a few vanilla-Fallout stories on FanFiction.net ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/game/Fallout/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&len=40][285 with at least 40,000 words]]), but certainly none of them has gained a following comparable to /Fallout: Equestria/'s, and video games in general [[https://www.fanfiction.net/game/][have a lot fewer stories written about them]] than do settings in other media.
