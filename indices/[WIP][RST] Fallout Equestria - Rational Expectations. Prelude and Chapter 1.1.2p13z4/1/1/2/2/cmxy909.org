Fallout backstory: There was a really bad nuclear war, robots are everywhere but so are cowboys, huge yellow evil mutants exist, radiation zombies exist but some are nice. Some people were locked in Vaults shortly before the war to live out the apocalypse, the Vaults were often secretly social experiments that involved putting people into terrible situations.

That's not spoilers, it's the premise.

You should play New Vegas though :)
