Well knowing FiM is the important thing as all the characters, locations and backstory (revealed through flashbacks) are from the show but many story elements are from fallout.

Basically, it's perfectly readable as you pick up most things nd it isn't particularly hard to figure out the concepts of "raider" and "slaver".
