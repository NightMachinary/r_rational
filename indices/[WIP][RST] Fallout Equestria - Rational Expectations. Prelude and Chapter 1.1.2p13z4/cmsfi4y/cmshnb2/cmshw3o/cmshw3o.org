Righto right here.

The original Fallout: Equestria is responsible for me getting into fanfiction in the first place. And while this story's universe is /mostly/ the same as the original's, it /is/ a separate one, working under my rules and with my characters. Sorta in the same way Methods is separate from HP Canon.
