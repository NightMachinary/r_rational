Assuming we want to actually showcase cognitive skills and not just be a fix fic, a Phantom fic could be an interesting place to introduce things like deliberate practice, spaced repetition, formation of expertise, etc.

Like, the Phantom being a creepy homocidal stalker is basically the point of the story, I think "fixing" that is breaking it. The audience should be aware that the Phantom is a creepy homocidal stalker and still think that he's charismatic and hypercompetent and a tortured artist and he and his brilliant student Christine have amazing chemistry. Christine should motivatedly ignore some obvious signs of homocidal stalking because this is also the point of the story, but the audience should understand her feelings and be proud of her growth as she begins to outstrip her teacher.

Speaking of point of the story, this could also be an interesting place to talk about how Christine might learn to notice and escape this metaphor for domestic violence by using real cognitive techniques. Would a fellow singer notice her changed behavior? How could they intervene / what resources could they point Christine towards?

Obviously this all sounds terribly hard to write and could be crap.
