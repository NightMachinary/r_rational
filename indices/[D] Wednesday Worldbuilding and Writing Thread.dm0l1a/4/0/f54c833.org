1. The heroes are infiltrating the secret underwater base of the First Order. Keeping SDs underwater is good for stealth reasons, it's impossible to tell they're there from a quick scan of the system. Due to powerful First Order ECM and all the scopes a Star Destroyer would have, they can't use diving machines to get down there (and don't have any anyway). Instead they use the local wildlife which are perfect amphibians and great swimmers.

2. The horses aren't just fast, they're also jumpy. A Star Destroyer is full of protrusions, walls and valleys. You need superhuman jumping, climbing and so on to get anywhere on a Star Destroyer's surface. They're going to the other side to rescue a mcguffin, help an ally, bypass unstoppable numbers of stormtroopers, get to a hangar to escape... any number of reasons. I don't think a SD's guns could fire on them, it's probably much safer than fighting through the ship deck by deck.

3. The SDs are in atmosphere because they have no fear of surface-to-space attacks like on Hoth and/or need to precisely target their munitions on a stealthy or fast-moving ground target. It's the difference between bombers at 50,000 feet or doing close air support vs an enemy with no AA.

Why are my horses perfect amphibians and amazingly athletic in atmosphere? Well, they're genetically engineered to be that way by the scientists working on the planet. The Imperials/First Order have been working on a low-maintenance, highly adaptable and stealthy vehicle for infantry attacks ever since the AT-AT and AT-ST programs were shown to be incredibly bad in various ways. Super-space horses have a much better supply chain (they'll eat just about anything), heal in the field and are much cheaper than speeders. Ideal for long patrols and occupations on all kinds of different worlds, after you get past the incredible capital cost of the genetic manipulation.
