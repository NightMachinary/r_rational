But that's just it--if you have cargo carriers, you already have something superior to a ground-based horse for transport, no? They drop you off at one end of the ship, you ride across, and at the other end you're doing ... what? There's not a lot a bunch of guys on horses can do on the surface of a starship, and the stills don't seem to show them carrying anything heavier than hand weapons. Possibly they could sabotage that one ship with thermal detonators or equivalent widgets, since its weapons aren't designed to hit things running on its surface, but then they'd go down with it. And the trailer shows other ships in the background. If those are enemies, they're going to need to be picked up to repeat the stunt multiple times, and if the Resistance is so low-rent they're dependent on horse-sabotage to win battles, wow. If those are friends, their presence keeps the friendly ships from shooting the enemy ship they're on. If all ships are friends, including the one they're on, I don't know why they have to gallop so urgently around.
