Per outside materials (Vanity Fair has a few articles), the horse creatures are orbacks, and a fair chunk of the movie takes place on Pasaana, where the orbacks are native, which has more climates on a planet than usual for Star Wars, including grasslands, desert, and oceans. That's all speculation at this point, but it would make a lot more sense to have a planet with multiple biomes than how Star Wars normally does it.

From there, you just need:

1. Ships operating in atmosphere and
2. Horses on the ships

Ships operating in atmosphere was shown in Rogue One, specifically a Star Destroyer parked in place directly above Jedha City, so that's not a huge leap. Why it's not done more often might need a little explaining, but there are lots of plausible reasons, including energy usage, maneuverability, available weapons, etc. A Star Destroyer parked in place above Jedha seems much more like a symbol or a power move to help keep the population complacent than it seems like it's tactically useful (pretty sure that's true of Star Destroyers in general, which a less symbol-conscious Empire would probably replace with lots of much smaller ships, though it's been a long time since I've done a deep dive on Star Wars canon).

So if you have a bunch of ships rising up from the water, maybe that's because they've been hidden or buried there, put out of active service and not just plopped into orbit or landed on some desolate moon for ... reasons, which would be easy enough to fabricate and depend on a bunch of technology and politics that you could just make up.

So that leaves the horses. There's a good reason to use horses instead of motorcycles or speeders or whatever: you don't have motorcycles or speeders or whatever. Or, if you do have speeders or whatever, you're not trained on them, and can't get enough training to make it worth it. Based off of stills released of the movie, this seems fairly likely to be the case, since they're mostly in the aesthetic of nomads. Star Wars is schizo tech, but you could look to cases of schizo tech on Earth for some justification. Horses were used in various capacities during WWII even by technologically advanced nations, for example. You could make this more sensible by making them better versions of horses, capable of better traction, movement, more responsive, smarter, etc. If the horses can't just walk onto the ship when it's getting close to taking off, then you can drop them with some (stolen?) cargo carriers, if you really want to.
