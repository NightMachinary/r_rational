  The person I was talking to was arguing that due to the very severe vampire weakness to sunlight, they're probably going to not live forever just because one day they'll lose track of time and wind up stranded in the sun and die.

It should be easy enough to cope with indefinitely if you're very cautious, since all that matters is that you're back before sunrise, but all you lose from being back early is some time (and hunting radius I guess.)

Also you could potentially break in somewhere when you see the sky start to lighten, if you don't have the "needs permission to enter" weakness.

  vampire media is full of vampires murdering each other but doesn't really have vampires dying by suicide.
#+end_quote

Doesn't it? I feel like suicide is a pretty common theme in vampire media. Especially the more angsty/romantic Anne Rice-y side of it.

I know Twilight has at least one suicide attempt by Edward, and Buffy has at least one by Angel ... Buffy also has Spike dying via heroic sacrifice although I'm not sure that counts. (Very normie examples I know, I'm not really up on my Vampire media.) TVtropes [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideBySunlight][has a page for it.]]

  I don't think that you can argue that being a vampire makes you less prone to suicide because of your super powers or your age as older people die by suicide as well, and rich and powerful people do too (not sure about the relative rates).
#+end_quote

Suicide rates do vary by demographic, in unintuitive and poorly- understood ways.

The trouble with /population/ statistics is that suicide-ness varies much more between individuals than it does between populations, of course. Are there people so mentally healthy they have a 0% chance of becoming suicidal regardless of age?

  do vampires get mental illnesses?
#+end_quote

Some fictional vampires seem /more/ prone to depression than humans. Vampire: the Requiem for instance talks a lot about how vampires can't feel real pleasure when not sucking blood, they feel dead inside and are just going through the motions.
