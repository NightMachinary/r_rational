Vampires in general likely get mental ilness, as there are plenty of ways that brains can be structured that are technically healthy but maladaptive for whatever social context they operate under. That being said, I'd expect vampires who were better at siring non-suicidal vampires to have more overall success, and pass their knowledge and ideology on to the vampires they sire in turn, so by the modern day I'd think most vampires would be "mentally healthy" in the sense that they'd be well adjusted for their lifestyle, but still extremely divergent from the usual human mental state. Which is unsurprising, considering most iterations of vampires are immortal. You probably wouldn't even be able to discern the behavioral adaptations that surround avoiding mental illness from all the other vampire weirdness.
