I think that the major reason for age-related suicide is probably not the weight of years, but rather the onset of infirmity. The knowledge that your body can't do what it once could and /never will again/ may be one of the worst parts of growing old. And it's a thing that vampires do not have.

Which doesn't mean that vampires in general /won't/ suicide, of course; young people do it, after all. But there's another factor to bear in mind here, which is that vampires don't die of old age.

Consider this; assume that X% of new vampires (for some X) end up committing suicide, and (100-X)% have the sort of viewpoint - or perhaps the sort of mental stability - or a stubborn refusal to give up - or a fear of what's waiting for them after death - that completely prevents them from attempting suicide. If they were human, then (in time) that second group would die of other causes - cancer, old age, lightning strikes, whatever. This may not happen to vampires.

Over time - where 'time' is measured in millenia - those vampires who refuse to suicide will remain, while those who commit suicide won't. So, eventually, you'll have a whole lot /less/ than X% of /existing/ vampires who are potentially suicidal, simply because a big chunk of that X% took a stroll across a sunlit meadow at some point.

Eventually, it will look like vampires are less likely to be suicidal than the general population, even if they aren't.
