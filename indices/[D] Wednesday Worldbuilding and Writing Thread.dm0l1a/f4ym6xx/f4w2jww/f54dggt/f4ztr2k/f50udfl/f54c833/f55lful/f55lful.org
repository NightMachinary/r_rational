I don't know whether to bring up the difficulties of swimming quickly with something on your back. On the one hand, SW doesn't concern itself with physics. On the other, it does concern itself with visual plausibility, and it would be hard to show realistic-looking horses swimming at very high (say dolphin-like) speeds while mounted. Most of us have experience swimming and know that water slows you down, and that it's easier to swim below the surface than on it. Similarly, they can only show them jumping so far before it becomes visually incredible (assuming the horses are not force-using, etc.).\\
I did forget to mention what AW brings up: they're apparently native organisms from the planet where this takes place. Doesn't mean they can't be super jumper super swimmers naturally, of course.
