There is a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plCScjvDOJM][video]] of the main theme of the Phantom of the Opera performed by the lead singer of Nightwish and the guy that plays the Dutch version of the Phantom that has gone kinda viral around here. Which got me thinking, what would a rational version of the Phantom of the Opera look like?

I'm basing this on having a passing familiarity with the songs and having seen the 2004 movie years ago, but iirc my primary issue was that the main character comes across as really dumb for not seeing (or ignoring) some very obvious red flags and that the Phantom is a creepy homicidal stalker that is obsessed with Christine, but the story kind of still wants us to see him as kinda sympathetic.

Both these issues seem very solvable in a ratfic. Thoughts?
