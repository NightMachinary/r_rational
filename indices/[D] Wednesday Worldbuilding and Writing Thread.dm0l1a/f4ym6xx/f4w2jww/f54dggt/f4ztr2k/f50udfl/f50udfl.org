Hopefully this has not been done already, but I am informed that the most recent Star Wars trailer shows our heroes riding some kind of horse analogs across the hull of a spaceship, possibly a star destroyer. I have satellite internet and my bandwidth won't tolerate actually watching the video, but I've seen the stills. Apparently there's evidence to suggest that the ship, and several ships around it, were on or under water at some point, rose out of the water, and are flying through atmosphere when the horse-riding occurs. Your mission:

1. Find a plausible and non-stupid way for all those horses to get onto the deck of a (presumed) star destroyer in atmosphere. You may assume the star destroyer was on or under the water, or over it, at the time of boarding. If the horses were previously inside the ship, you need a good reason for having them there and a way for them to get out.
2. Find a tactically sound reason for riding horses across the superior hull surface of an airborne star destroyer. Presumably they need to get to the other end of the hull really fast. Why?
3. For bonus points, explain why these enormous spaceships are operating in atmosphere, and why we did not see this done before, e.g. during the battle of Hoth in ESB. You do not have to account for the physical implausibility of this feat, or any other aspect of the situation, since this is Star Wars. Assume standard nonsensical SW physics apply.

You are allowed to use any further details gleaned from the trailer, or other trailers for Episode 9.
