[[/u/MagicWeasel][u/MagicWeasel]]'s discussion on vampires reminds me of an idea of my own I like to tinker with.

Imagine a society where vampirism is a recognized condition, but instead of the traditional torches and pitchforks response, society at large recognized vampirism wasn't all bad--it was a mixed bag. Critical to my ideas on the setting is that vampires /require human blood to function./ For vampires to continue to exist, and for humans/mortals to tolerate them, they must sustain a large enough ratio of mortals/vampires that vampires can subsist on blood donations.

Now vampirism has a relatively well-defined limit. Both humans and vampires have a strong motive to keep vampire population from growing too rapidly. Vampirism is /in demand./

Obviously, there would probably be some who defer for ethical/religious reasons, but vampirism essentially represents immortality in peak form. The ranks of vampires would be expanded by skimming off the social elite, the cream of the crop. Being turned young indicates ambition, because you were accomplished enough in your youth to be inducted with little deliberation.

I guess the question would be, how does this class of remarkable immortals fit into society? Are the isolationists? Oligarchs? Feudal lords? Socialist utopia thinktank?
