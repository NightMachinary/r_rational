I've got an omnipotent deity that wants to destroy modern civilisation WITHOUT destroying humanity. It's really lazy, so it's not going to go the effort of deleting knowledge from people's brains or deleting fossil fuels out of the ground. The goal is a permanent industrial era technological stasis somewhere between 1880 and 1945.

It wants to change some of the universe's laws: that's the easiest way to achieve its goal.

So far I've come up with two changes:

Quantum mechanics is slimmed down massively: semiconductors no longer work. Say goodbye to all post-vacuum tube electronics.

Einstein's discoveries are severely crippled: No radioactive decay, uranium becomes a normal metal. Nuclear fusion stays to keep the sun lit. But you need fission to kickstart a thermonuke and I doubt a vacuum-tube civilization could get to sustainable fusion reactions considering how much trouble we're having.

If both of these changes were to happen tomorrow, is there any possible way for modern civilisation to re-emerge? I don't know whether it's possible to skip semi-conductors and make neural network processors. Do they need semiconductors?

Is there another simple change that would help preserve stasis?
