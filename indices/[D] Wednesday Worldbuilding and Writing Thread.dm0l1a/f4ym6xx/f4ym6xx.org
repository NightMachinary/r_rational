I've been toying with the idea of writing a multiperson reincarnation isekai, with the gimmick being that all the people getting isekai'd are grand strategy fanatics of various stripes, being born as the heirs to various nations. (Either in a fantasy world, alt-earth, or earlier in earth's history.) Cue ridiculous jingoism shenanigans. That being said, I'm not sure how I'd sell this idea to an audience considering how ridiculously niche it would be. Does anyone have any marketing suggestions?
