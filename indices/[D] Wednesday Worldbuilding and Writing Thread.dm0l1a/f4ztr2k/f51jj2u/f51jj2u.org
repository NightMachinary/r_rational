The movie Daybreakers deals with this. The film itself isn't super rational, but the premise is: Everyone wants to be a vampire because of super strength & eternal youth, so everyone gets turned & humans are in short supply. Most of the remaining humans (not very many) are kept in matrix-pod-esque blood farms, and all of vampire society is hugely concerned with developing an artificial blood substitute. Vampires can survive on animal blood, but not forever--going without it for too long turns them into feral, vicious beasts who will hunt and kill even other vampires.

It's a pretty good movie. Has some nice rational touches: cars with tint-shifting windows & 360 degree cameras for driving during daylight; all apartments being equipped with timed blackout curtains.
