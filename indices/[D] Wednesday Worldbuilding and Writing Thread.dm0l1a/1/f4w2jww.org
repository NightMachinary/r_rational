OK so I ended up at a biology conference in London on the weekend and had a great discussion about vampires at the dinner.

Three main topics I thought would be interesting to discuss here:

*how dire is sunlight weakness?*

The person I was talking to was arguing that due to the very severe vampire weakness to sunlight, they're probably going to not live forever just because one day they'll lose track of time and wind up stranded in the sun and die. I countered saying that if sunlight is basically the one thing that can kill you, you'd be keeping track of time like a hawk (and mused that perhaps the prizes associated with getting accurate chronometers for ocean navigation were actually by vampires who wanted to know the time).

I then said that people with diabetes are able to eat and give themselves insulin in order to manage their blood sugar, which is much more finicky than something as regular and predictable as sunrise/sunset times, and it turned out my conversation partner actually had type 1 diabetes and proceeded to explain exactly how difficult it is and how frequent close brushes with death are with the condition, so you know. Maybe my analogy was not well-chosen.

*mental health: the vampire killer*

Then we got onto the subject of mental health. Young, otherwise healthy people tend to have death by suicide in the top 3 causes of death, and older people actually die by suicide at a greater rate[citation needed] but they die of cancer/stroke/etc more often so it goes out of the top 5 for that reason. Anyway, death by suicide is more common than death by murder, and vampire media is full of vampires murdering each other but doesn't really have vampires dying by suicide.

Would vampires die by suicide? I have heard it's often an impulsive thing, and when you can die by walking to the middle of a field and waiting for sunrise, or putting a stake through your own heart, or setting yourself on fire, those impulses can be deadly (see: the explanation for the high suicide rate in the US being related to gun ownership).

I don't think that you can argue that being a vampire makes you less prone to suicide because of your super powers or your age as older people die by suicide as well, and rich and powerful people do too (not sure about the relative rates).

Which brings us to....

*do vampires get mental illnesses?*

A standard vampire gets shot in the shoulder, you'll expect to see her wounds to knit together before your eyes as she rips the head off the fool who shot her. You don't expect her to catch a cold or the flu or smallpox or whatever. She's blessed in a state of perfect health.

So, mental illness has a physical cause: plaques in Alzheimer's, serotonin in a lot of other mental illnesses. Can a vampire heal that? Would a vampire turn his dementia-striken mother so that way she'll remember him again? If you have OCD and are turned, do you finally feel your anxiety go away and no longer have the need to turn the light switch 14 times every time you enter the room so your son doesn't get cancer?

If we say "of course your serotonin issues are fixed, mental illnesses aren't associated with perfect health", then, what, does anger get stopped because that's a mental "defect"? Does the brain stay in a constant state of stasis and you can't learn new things, can't form new memories?

Does the vampire magic heal you back to "original" - so your OCD/Alzheimer's/etc is considered to be "you" and is the state you heal back to? Lots of people with mental illness, most notably autism, consider that to be a part of their identity, after all.

Like, with the brain, and healing specifically, you've got a sort of scale of "physicality" in terms of the brain:

(physical brain damage as in like someone cut part of your head off with a sword) > (brain damage like someone punched you real hard) > (primarily physical brain illnesses like MS or Alzheimer's) > (mental illnesses with clear physical components like OCD and anxiety) > (temporary mental things like anger, sadness)

And I'm not sure where changing your personality as you grow in general or forming new memories or learning goes there, but....
