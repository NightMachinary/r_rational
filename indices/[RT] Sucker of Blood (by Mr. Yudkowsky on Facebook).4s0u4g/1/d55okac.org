Nice! I love Eliezer's shorter stuff, and this was almost as good as his take on The Revenge of the Sith. On the other hand, it's shocking that there's a way to probably save a net 2 million children a year and it's not being done because of seemingly minor reasons. I can't even effectively play devil's advocate for the idea, because it's so outlandish.
