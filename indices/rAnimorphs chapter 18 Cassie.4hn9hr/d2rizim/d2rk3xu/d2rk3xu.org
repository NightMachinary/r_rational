I highly doubt this was a munchkinable event. The Ellimist was not /limited/ to the atomic mass of X people, he was just going to have to offer X atoms of transition per meter to his opponent in the future, and so he wanted to minimize any advantage he gave away. He already knew their number and no doubt knew their request beforehand, and he had deemed the risk acceptable.

It also seems to me that this was a single "move"; it was going to happen in that one instant or not at all. They weren't exploring the limits of physicality (the Ellimist is capable of far more than he did), but rather were offered a single non-grid-aligned chess move. Taking (and thus allowing to Crayak) several short hops over a single large one seems to me to be the far more dangerous option to leave for your hyperintelligent superopponent.
