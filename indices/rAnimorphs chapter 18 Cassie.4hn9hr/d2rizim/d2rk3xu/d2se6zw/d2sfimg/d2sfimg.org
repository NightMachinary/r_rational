Considering that the Ellimist himself had this opportunity and didn't just use it to, say, off Visser Three, you're probably right about straight up killing people. It's far more likely to be more like chess: have to use a piece to take a piece. A game of positive actions that put your own pieces in advantageous spots, rather than a game of negative actions that just delete your opponent's.

Which sounds a lot more like the Ellimist than Crayak. I wonder what concessions were made to have him agree to such an ordered playstyle...
