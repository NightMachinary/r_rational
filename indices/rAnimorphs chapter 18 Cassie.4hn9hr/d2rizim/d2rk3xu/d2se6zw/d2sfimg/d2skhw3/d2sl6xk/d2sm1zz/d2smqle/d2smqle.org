Hmm, that's an intriguing thought. The Drode more directly acted than Elfangor ever did. Though perhaps that's a matter of perspective: Elfangor had free will and was persuaded to be the hero when needed with just a nudge here and there. The Drode was given demigodlike powers and specific assignments, with his own initiative here and there. Both really are mirrors of their respective master's values.
