As the Human-Yeerk Peace Alliance [[http://selfdeterminedsymbionts.tumblr.com/post/54183080910/why-do-you-call-v3-a-puppet-visser][points out]], this is arguably Visser Three, even if canon doesn't fully recognize it:

  Now, I'm not saying that Visser Three is a bad military general. That's not what this is about.

  Give him a force of 100 Hork-Bajir-Controllers and tell him to take a strategically valuable spot on a hostile planet, he'd go in, take the spot, blow up two areas valuable to the enemy and come back with 200 new hosts in chains. I mean, he became famous when High Command assigned him to defend the Taxxon homeworld and he took out the Andalite invaders and came home with an Andalite host.

  He took down the Andalite invaders of Earth before they even reached the planet -- do you have any idea how hard it is to ambush somebody in space? There is no cover in space. He's great in a high-stakes warzone, which is frankly weird for our kind.

Though, I guess a true foil to Elfangor in this particular sense would also be aware of the EC Game, which is not true of Visser Three.
