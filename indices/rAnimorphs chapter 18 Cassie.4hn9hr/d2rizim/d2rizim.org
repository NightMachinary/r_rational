It sounds like the move allowance was based on mass * distance. Doesn't that mean demorphed Ax should count as two people then? Same for Grizzly Rachel?

Also, couldn't that math have been hacked to move everyone a short distance away first, morph down to tardigrades out something tiny, and then move them 50 miles out? That would let them move more of the robots (Chi, right?) or other high value people out of the 50 mile radius.

Other hacking opportunities: Instead of moving 8 bodies 50 miles, move 16 bodies 25 miles, with 8 of them being the Chi, and the 8 Chi should be able to transport the other 8 bodies 25 miles in half an hour. If they can't move that fast, then you can do the appropriate math to figure out how many people they can move.

Bring the morph cube over to Marco's dad and Jake's brother, move the yerks in their heads 1 foot away to free them, then give them the ability to morph and tiny creatures to morph into. Now they can morph them into something small and have low mass for low moving costs. Repeat this process with any other humans you want to save.
