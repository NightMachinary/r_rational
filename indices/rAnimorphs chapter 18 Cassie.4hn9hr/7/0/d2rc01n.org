Put aside fear for courage, my friend.

Actually, you should know that I'm trying very, very hard for a happy ending, because I really want one too, but I have precommitted to /not/ guaranteeing the happy ending without doing the work. In other words, I'm just running the calculation, and I'm doing my best to have the good guys win, but if I come up against an insurmountable problem, then they won't.
