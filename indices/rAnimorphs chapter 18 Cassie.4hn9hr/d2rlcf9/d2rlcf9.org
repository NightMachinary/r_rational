Yayy! Update! The only way this could be better is if there was one of them every day.

- I really like how the Ellimist is portrayed. "I dunno. Seemed like the right [face] to use". Priceless :p

- Mhhh... something fishy is going on with the whole teleportation thing. Tobias was safe, away from the blast site, and free to warn the world about the invasion... Though we don't know yet what he had the time to do before being teleported. And I'm probably reading too much into it, but the Ellimists cuts them in a middle of a dicussion, right after Tobias pointed that he didn't belong there.

- By the way, the Ellimist never actually stated he was the good guy in their "order vs chaos" battle. I'm getting a sense of Goddess of Cancer vs Goddess of Everything else from this, and somehow I don't think the Ellimist will be on the side of Everything Else here. The most suspicious line being "One of us would like more of---this [destruction, people dying]. The other, less". Although if Crayak has made Howlers, that probably means that /he/ is... wait. Does the fic actually state who made the Howlers? The Ellimist interlude doesn't actually say who does what, only that stuff is done.

- I thought this was a surprisingly well-explained divine chess match you set up. I think this is a great quality in the fic so far, to take elements of canon as-is and re-describe them in a way that makes /sense/. It's the same impression I had from the pool scene, when Marco says "this is bad... like... Auschwitz-level bad".

- Damn you! This isn't how this episode was supposed to work! The kids were supposed to get some amazing insight from their tour with the Ellimist which would let them win the day by tricking Crayak with the sort of rules-layering that only works in books for 10-years-old children and... I kind of answered my own complaint there, didn't I?

- Anyway, one reason I really liked this episode is I read it right after having a big frustrating debate with a catholic friend about utilitarianism, consequentialism, the trolley problem, etc... So it was really nice to read about Cassie's point of view, and I confess it felt really cathartic when Cassie [spoiler alert]. Like I could mock her and say "See? See? This is what happens when you ignore sensible consequentialist directives and do what your heart tells you instead! Ha!" But I wouldn't do that. Poor Cassie already had a shitty enough life as it is (had?).

- Speaking of frustrating debates with Catholic friends... See? See? This is what actual evidence for God's existence looks like! He writes complex unambiguous messages by moving molecules around, and then just in case it's too subtle, he also stops time to have a nice chat with you.

- Garett's "I'm someone who does the right thing even if it's hard, period" oath may not be the most spectacular or glorious-sounding oath, but it really resonated with me in a simple direct way, more than even the orange lantern oaths. It's something to aspire to.
