  Anyway, one reason I really liked this episode is I read it right after having a big frustrating debate with a catholic friend about utilitarianism, consequentialism, the trolley problem, etc... So it was really nice to read about Cassie's point of view, and I confess it felt really cathartic when Cassie [spoiler alert]. Like I could mock her and say "See? See? This is what happens when you ignore sensible consequentialist directives and do what your heart tells you instead! Ha!" But I wouldn't do that. Poor Cassie already had a shitty enough life as it is (had?).

If you disagree that "A thousand lives lost plus two thousand lives saved just isn't the same thing as a thousand lives saved, period" then I think we need to talk about asymmetric loss functions and the many (MANY) objections to aggregation that have been built up in the literature.

I'm not even sure HJPEV would disagree with this sentiment. If Cassie behaves differently than he would, it's only to the degree that he had plot armor and she does not.

I side with Cassie. Team #trynottobeawarcriminal will live on in our hearts.

Edit: Your other bullet points are all perfect. Although, I'm pretty sure that in canon the Howlers are specifically stated to belong to Cryak.
