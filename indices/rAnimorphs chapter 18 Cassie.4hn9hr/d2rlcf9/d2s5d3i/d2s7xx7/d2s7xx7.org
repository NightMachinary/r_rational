Well, I'm not /that/ utilitarian, though I'd be interested to read about the strongest of the objections you mention. I wouldn't say that "save 1000 lives" is the same as "sacrifice 1000 to save 2000", but they're pretty close to each other when it comes to the decision you have to make if it's a choice between "do it" vs "do nothing".

Anyway, I don't disagree with any of Cassie's points, except for the part where she feels useless to the group: like Rachel pointed out, she's the only one with a moral compass strong enough to remain, um, accurate through horrible warfare, which is kind of important to avoid stuff like dumping thousands of yeerks into space for little tactical advantage.

Re Howlers: In canon, yes. Here? Everything mentioned so far about what the Ellimist and Crayak did has been extremely vague and didn't clearly assign actions or motivations to either of the two. For instance, the fic doesn't actually tell who made Rachel butterfly into existence. Maybe Crayak did it knowing she'd screw the resistance over?
