The interference, I think, isn't between all the people currently morphed from the same template, but between the original acquirer and any copies. With no Rachel Prime human-hork-bajir brain interface broadcasting indiscriminately, the individual Rachel-brain-matter local copies perform just fine.

Now maybe I'm off-base on this, but IIRC none of the tests shown on-screen tested the case where the prime morpher was out of the picture, though I can't imagine this Marco overlooking that.
