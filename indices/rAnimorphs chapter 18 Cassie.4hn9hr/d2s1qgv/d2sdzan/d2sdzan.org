It's worth noting that "silence" isn't the opposite of "noise" in the same way that "order" is the opposite of "chaos".

chaos:noise :: order:signal

I think silence would qualify as a type of signal, but it isn't quite the same as, say, a piece of music or an encoding of the prime numbers.

Also, "unity" and "harmony" aren't generally thought of as opposites. The distinction would be that unity is "singularity", where harmony is "working together".

Personally, I think that this entity, whether Crayak or the Ellimist, is the one that wants more bloodshed. After all, the Yeerks don't seem to want to be bloodthirsty. If they win, they will unite all humans and Andalites into a single hive mind. There won't be any conflict, because in a sense every human will be every other human.

There will, of course, be trillions upon trillions of sapient slaves screaming in their heads, but they won't be killing each other.

If the humans win, it will be a much slower process getting to the point of universal pacifism, but hopefully that would be the end result. Publicise the Yeerk-human conflict and they might even catapult ahead.

But if /neither/ side wins, if they both keep fighting forever and ever, escalating until first the galaxy and then the universe are consumed in perpetual war... well, a non-definitive victory for either side here would be a good first step.
