This seems like an extremely unsubtle move given just how subtle the interlude's description of interventions was.

So I notice I'm confused.

First, it implies the other guy did something equally unsubtle or that our guy has been saving up intervention points for a very, very long time. Both possibilities seem in need of explanation.

Second, it implies that that game is going very differently than our guy expected---otherwise it seems likely he would have pursued more subtle interventions to steer his pieces away from danger (or danger away from them). Alternatively, maybe this flashy intervention was needed mostly for the psychological effect it would have on the pieces rather than for the purpose of saving them? But in that case, it remains to be seen what his purpose was in getting Cassie killed---as something that causally near into the future should have been crystal clear to such a being. ("Maybe he's just really incompetent?" Like r!Voldemort was seen by HPJEV?)
