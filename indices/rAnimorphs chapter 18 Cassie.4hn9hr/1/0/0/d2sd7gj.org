Her reasoning there is correct. The problem is that even when she couldn't propose reasonable alternatives she still wouldn't get on board with the plan.

If she had committed to all the flawed plans, she might have been able to save a few lives by increasing the available resources. The greater the disparity of power, the more the stronger side can afford mercy.

Cassie's Batman-like aversion to murder---as a moral event horizon---had a real cost in lives, both human and non-human. If you can't achieve the ideal of your goal then you should take the best available option, and that's where Cassie failed.
