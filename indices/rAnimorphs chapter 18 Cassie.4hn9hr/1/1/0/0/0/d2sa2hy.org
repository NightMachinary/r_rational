There's a lot of oaths in WTR. There's the original OL oath, the Enlightened!OL oath, the Enlightened!Paulphidian oath, the Renegade!OL oath, and the Yellow!Grayven oath. The 1st and the 3rd are okay, the yellow one is meh, and the 2nd and 4th (Enlightened and Renegade OL) are the most inspiring to me, for opposite reasons.

The OL oath is inspiring in a "build great things, make lots of friends, help many people" way, while the Renegade oath resonates more in a "Fuck this shit, I don't need any help, I'm going to solve everything myself, now shut up and let me fix the universe" way.
