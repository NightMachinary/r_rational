Cassie's dangerous unilateral moves occasionally paid off in unexpected ways in canon:

- She let herself get trapped in caterpillar morph to prove to a yerk, Aftran, that she would be willing to take blindness/deafness/weak form if it meant saving another being. This inspired Aftran to start the yerk peace movement. Of course, we've already seen how Aftran went in this timeline.

- Giving the morph cube to Tom's yerk enabled that yerk to lead a rouge movement against Viser 3. Of course, Rachel died to kill that group once their usefulness was up, but I would count it as still a weak net positive.

  How did she maintain her friendship with Rachel and her romantic relationship with Jake when one was the weapon and the other the mastermind behind some horrible, horrible actions?

- In canon they are able to avoid killing human controllers for some time, and the few yerks that notice this statistical anomaly are ignored. In this AU though, Viser 3 would easily notice that.
