I know I'm commenting again, but I don't remember /that/ much about canon Cassie. How did canon get around her ethical objections to what they were doing? How did she maintain her friendship with Rachel and her romantic relationship with Jake when one was the weapon and the other the mastermind behind some horrible, horrible actions?
