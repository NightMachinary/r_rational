So, I had a brain fart last night:

If the god was willing and able to move the atoms of all the animorphs out of the blast zone, couldn't he also have been able to move the atoms of say, a W-80-1 nuclear warhead up to the KKV to send it off-course? I assume he could jigger with it to activate it, if so, but I just can't help but wonder why he specifically said he was unwilling to /directly/ move the atoms of the thing, when presumably more efficient means were available to deal with the problem...
