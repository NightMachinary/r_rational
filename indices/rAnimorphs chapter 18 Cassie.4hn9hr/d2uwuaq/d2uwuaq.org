Pleasantly(?) consistent with the most irritating thing about Cassie's personality in the original series.

I also found myself remember the original Ellimist Chronicles, about how he puts his life on the line to destroy Crayak to save the galaxy, becomes godlike by accident, and then sits back and waits for Crayak to catch up and become godlike too before doing anything to him.

For the arbiter, I note that they could have used the same unassailable arbiter to broker the universe-halving division while preventing betrayal.

I also note that, in the moral calculus sense (justifying loss aversion), to a starving person the difference between enough money for no meals and enough money for one meal is of much greater value than the difference between enough money for one meal and enough money for two meals. The first half-of-a-universe either filled with or bereft of life matters a lot more (in terms of presence/absence of future potential, too) than the second half does, at least if you value life. Going for double-or-nothing presumably makes sense if the thought of /any/ life existing is torturous, and the last speck wiped out is worth more than all the rest combined.
