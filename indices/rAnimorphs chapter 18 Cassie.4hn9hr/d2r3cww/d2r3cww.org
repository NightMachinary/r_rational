All right, all right, I'm over the 20 min shock and I think I can start asking questions now. First off, holy shit. This is a lot of death. So here are my questions/comments about it:

- Writing-wise, this is an incredibly bold move. Do you plan on introducing a whole ton of OCs later, as the canon Animorphs setting is now gone?

- was this the only Earthside pool?

- does Crayak get to move his own pawns to safety? Who would they be?

- Illim? Tidwell?!?! Aftran... :( THE REST OF THE CHEE.

- CASSIE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

- Are Tom and Marco's dad going to be poofed to safety as free humans, or as Controllers?

- In terms of scope, how do you plan this war to progress? We've already quickly gotten to 'wipe the town off the map with a WMD'. What's next? Quantum viruses?

- What's the end goal here? In canon, it used to be 'get the Yeerks off Earth & defeat V1/V3 = win'. Do you plan on having your Animorphs (or some of them) dedicate themselves to chasing V3 back to the homeworld?

- Do you feel that there's a chance for peace? Quite a number of fanfics out there explore the potential AU of a cooperation between Yeerks and humans, post-war. Or, the possibilities of Yeerks moving away from parasitism to symbiotism. Ie the Iskoort future. From the way this story has progressed so far, it doesn't seem like this is in the cards...or is it?

- With the destruction of the pool, there goes the hivemind and everything it learnt about humanity. Does this mean that a new pool could potentially choose a different direction in terms of how it becomes established?

- Are we going to see V1 step in to yell at V3 for this tactical decision?
