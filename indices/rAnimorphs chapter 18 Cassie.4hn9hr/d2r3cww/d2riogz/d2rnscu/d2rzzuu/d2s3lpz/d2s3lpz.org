We don't know what his goals are beyond winning their game, or how exactly he intends to go about achieving that. I think it's pretty easily argued that the Animorphs mere existence engenders a lot of the chaos and destruction on Earth "the Ellimist" has said he (Crayak) is so fond of. I also think that Visser Three's win conditions are probably not very similar to Crayak's, or rather that the success of the Yeerks is not something I think Crayak is overly concerned with in and of itself.

edit: though the truth is we just don't know and it's probably not possible to really guess at the goals and methods of the story's two near-omnipotent beings.
