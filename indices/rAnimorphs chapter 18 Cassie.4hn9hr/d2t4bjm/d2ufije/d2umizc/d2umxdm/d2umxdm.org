Using Cassie as a projectile may not have been a suggestion founded in seriousness.

Having it be a Crayak plan that got disrupted would be interesting... losing the group conscience seems like it would serve his goals though (maybe it was a Crayak plan that went exactly as intended?), unless it makes the surviving group members abruptly more decisive and effective, or more moral to honour her memory.

Not that it seems /entirely certain/ that she's deceased... we haven't yet read "And then her flaming remains were scattered to the four winds with no hope of recovery" so I guess some hope still remains for further improbable intervention. Maybe.
