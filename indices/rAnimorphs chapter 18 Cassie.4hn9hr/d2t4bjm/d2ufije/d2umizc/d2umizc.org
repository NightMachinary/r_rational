I was going to say that this is not quite canon Ellimist's style in terms of manipulations, but then I recalled the time a passing Andalite ship picked up their bodies in Z-space in a freak accident, so maybe. But still, it doesn't seem to quite fit...

Okay, how about this what if this is actually Crayak interfering... Crayak was counting on them making rational/ruthless decisions but Cassie didn't and now Crayak's plan is thrown off?
