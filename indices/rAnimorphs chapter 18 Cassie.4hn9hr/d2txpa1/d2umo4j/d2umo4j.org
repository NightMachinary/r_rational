I mean an advanced enough species could probably do it eventually, but I would assume in this rationalized AU it wasn't just falling into a blackhole, but some complicated procedure along the lines of embedding its mind into the information on the edge of an event horizon or something else that requires a lot of advanced engineering ability and not just some generic trick that the Ellimist could easily share .

I would also assume that the rules of the game the setup will also confine any other entities that reach their same level, or prevent them from reaching that level in the first place.
