So in canon, Cassie's impulsively stupid pacifistic moves ended up working out okay through dumb luck or incredibly convoluted chains of events (getting stuck in butterfly morph to convince Aftran to give up its host, only to be able to morph again as a side-effect of butterfly metamorphosis; giving up the morph cube to a group of yerks who went rouge and messed up Viser 3's plan in the process; etc.) I was expecting the author to pull a similar move here, even if it wouldn't seem rational!fic because the Ellimist was involved (in canon the Ellimist was good at pulling moves that lucked like one thing but actually accomplished something else: offering to teleport the Animorphs and a select group of humans to another planet to preserve human civilization, while actually showing them the location of the Kandrona ray; getting them to trick the Howler hive mind with feelings of love; etc.) Thus the ending of this chapter was a huge shock and I am hoping there will be some kind of twist, but I haven't figured it out yet and neither has anyone in this comment train, as far as I can tell...

Raising your prior for improbable Ellimist intervention and/or Cassie lucking out, does anyone see anything now?
