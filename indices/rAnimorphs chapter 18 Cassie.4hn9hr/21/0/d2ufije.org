An improbable arrangement of the local terrain channels the force of the meteor impact in such a way that it arrives at the location where Cassie happens to have to come to rest (once you account for her predicted path having seen the child in need of rescue), in a highly improbable shape. As a result she is compressed and propelled.

Shortly thereafter a nearby Controller observing from outside the blast radius at what they believe to be a safe distance is taken by surprise as a diamond bullet passes neatly through their brain, killing them instantly (alternate idea: just gets hit in the face by the body of a snipe imbued with lethal velocity). That Controller was responsible for routine maintenance and they are replaced with someone fractionally less diligent.

This becomes pivotal when a glancing blow against a Yeerk ship's shield just barely exceeds its capacity, because a single relay was overdue for replacement, and thus brings down the shield, the ship and their central command in one lucky strike.

(and I still feel like this is insufficiently improbable to be an Ellimist level of play)
