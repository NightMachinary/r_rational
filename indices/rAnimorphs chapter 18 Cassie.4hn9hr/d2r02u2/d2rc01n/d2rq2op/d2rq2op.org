Cassie died as she lived, ethically conflicted but trying to do the right thing. I guess in the end that's all you can ask the Powers for.

/Though I note that (a) we don't actually see her die, (b) it's not clear which God we saw, and (c) the other one might move Cassie and the kid.../

But probably not. Those who burn so brightly so young don't often grow old.
