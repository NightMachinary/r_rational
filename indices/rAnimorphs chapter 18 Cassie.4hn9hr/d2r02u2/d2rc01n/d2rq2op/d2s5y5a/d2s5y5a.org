Well, Cassie never demorphed, so she and the kid should still be in Z-space. I think I vaguely recall a plot from the canon series where someone stuck like that was actually picked up by a passing ship, Hitchhiker's Guide-style.

A similar ex machina here, however, would seem poorly advised after this sequence of events, even if not *entirely* implausible given the respective deus and diabolus already in play, so to speak.
