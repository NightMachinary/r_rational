Hmm... Sounds like this should work like when Garrett had his construct frozen and he woke up as a disembodied consciousness running on the emulator. That doesn't actually help her out though, there's no link back to reality... unless maybe someone...it'd have to be Rachel... was willing to sacrifice themselves and that could somehow re-establish the link... nah, if you tried this you'd with the already established backup copy trick, which makes more sense given the end of Interlude 4 too.

edit: Actually, no! everyone has acquired copy's of Cassie's morphs, so she probably get gain control of them via the resonance thingee. And they might even be able to do this after a period of time if destroying her construct means her pocket dimension starts running time at a different rate to everything else.
