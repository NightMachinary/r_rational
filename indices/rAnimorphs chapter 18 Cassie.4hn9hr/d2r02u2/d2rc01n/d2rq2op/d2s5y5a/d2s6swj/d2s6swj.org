Can confirm that Cassie and the kid are still in Z-space until the pocket dimension runs out of steam and collapses. However, the meteor strike creates pressures and temperatures that are extreme enough to completely wipe out every trace of the nanotech that maintains the link between pocket dimension and morph construct---there's no "anchor" remaining for any kind of demorph to occur/no machinery left to open a wormhole and start pulling Cassie back into reality.
