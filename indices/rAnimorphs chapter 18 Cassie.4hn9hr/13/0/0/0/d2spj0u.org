I may have been unclear. Silence is an antonym of noise, but it does not imply the same relationship as chaos and order.

Chaos and order describe the degree of structure in a system. An order-loving deity would try to build structure (such as planets, organisms, and societies) while a chaos-loving deity would try to tear it down.

There's a fairly obvious human moral mapping between the two: chaos is bad, order is good.

Noise and signal (treated as antonyms) map directly to chaos and order.

With noise and silence (assuming you mean "noise" as in "not silence"), it's not quite as easy.

A noise-loving deity would be one that tries to create things which make noise (like people, supernovae, and earthquakes). A silence-loving deity would try to eliminate every source of noise.

If you interpret it as "flux vs. stasis", the implication still holds.

Assuming all you knew about a deity was that it loved chaos, would you guess it preferred noise or silence? I'd say noise, as silence is definitely not chaotic by the colloquial definition.

That would imply (by exclusion) that the order-loving deity loves silence. There's a problem there; society and peace and progress are very ordered things, but none of them are silent (literally or metaphorically). Quiet, perhaps, but not silent. You still have to engage in a change of ideas.

My hypothesis is that the two entities are OUS (order, unity, silence) and CHN (chaos, harmony, noise). Neither of these has a desirable human morality mapping. OUS would eliminate us for being noisy and disunited, while CHN would have us constantly in flux. Which is the Ellimist and which is Crayak doesn't really matter, but I'd guess OUS = Ellimist and CHN = Crayak.

So where in canon the Ellimist is basically an all-around good guy that just helps out because his morality happens to line up with human morality, I'm suggesting that neither of them actually cares about us. We're just another battleground, and if ever one should win their game then human society is going to change beyond recognition overnight (either to static perfection or eternal conflict).
