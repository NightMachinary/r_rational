I think you're on point with most of your analysis. There's been a lot of hints that these gods are out to screw us, or at least Not Our Friends, and I'm pretty sure that both of them have goals orthogonal to the long term survival and prosperity of human kind.

It would actually be somewhat close to canon, where the Ellimist comes from a game-centered society, and let Crayak ascend to godhood so they could play an infinite game of chess. The Ellimist often tells the Animorphs things that turn out to be untrue (cough-retcon-cough-KASU), and his strategy when Crayak starts destroying his worlds is "Make so many of them he can't keep up no matter how much he destroys". Yeah, canon!Ellimist definitely was on the CHN side of the game.
