I don't know if anyone will see this so long after the post, but I would really like, even if it is an aside, someone to ask the Eliminist how exactly he and the Crayak happened and, if he tells them about the whole fell into a black hole / sentient spaceship cluster thing, have that person immediately start thinking about how to do that themselves. I didn't read every book in the series, but upon looking into the Eliminist chronicles I couldn't help but think that, if the way he achieved immortality and omnipotence is reliable enough that it worked for him and the Crayak, couldn't a whole species potentially do it, and exist as a race of energy beings? It's not like blackholes are going anywhere, or anything... Thoughts?
