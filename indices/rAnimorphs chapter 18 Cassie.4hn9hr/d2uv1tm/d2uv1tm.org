Quick comment:

- I totally called the red/blue morality aspect of elimist and crayak :D - Interesting to think about how the human scale scharacters should act in these circumstances. When you know gods are playing games with you you could try and second guess their intents, but you also know they could know what you were going to choose anyway, so you get stuck in a morass of recusion. Could be an oppurtunity to introduce some omega style decision theory scenarios

- Cassie is interesting, very self aware in how she is violating her own principles. Reminds me a bit of some characters in worm. -

- On the specialness of the chosen 4, in canon it was because Cassie had some ability to sense changes to timelines, though that was never really explored. It also justified the coincidence of Elfangor's son, Visser 1's son, a natural leader, a fighter, etc all ending up as friends in the right place and time. Elimist was described as "stacking the deck". I don't think we've had any references to Tobias and Marco's family connctions so far, but I don't think its been ruled out either. Imagine r!marco would be less affected by it. Elfanor's earth backstory with time travel, non genetic inheritance, etc would be a bit hard to fit into the story, but I could see him having been on earth before in a diferent way

- Given we now have an animorph presence in DC and a wmd attack by V3 it would be very hard for the war not to go to full escalation right now. Unclear who would win given the yeerks explicitly have more limited forces in this version, but are more clever about using them. Hope the human authoritiies are also realistically competent, as teen books the originals played off 'adults are useless' a lot.
