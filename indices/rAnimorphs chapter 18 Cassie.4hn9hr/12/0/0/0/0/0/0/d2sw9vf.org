This is canon, the Ellimist originally started out as an alien gamer whose favorite game was a competitive butterfly effect simulator. There was different scenarios, but the basic idea was to see of the two people playing, who could further their goal better via one small change, the smaller the better.

In the only game of this we saw, each player was trying to get a species to advance the fastest and destroy the other player's species in the same solar system. It seems likely that the Ellimist and Crayak are now playing a hellishly more complicated version of this game, using reality.

Or actually, since in the original game it was a simulation, our universe could be a simulated universe they're using to decide their conflict.
