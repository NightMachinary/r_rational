Yes, he "has" the Howlers, but I think that's more a matter of them being the perfect storm: they're impossible to beat in combat, their values line up reasonably with Crayak's, and they're super easy to manipulate when it comes to matters of "wipe out everyone on this planet", but really hard to manipulate for Order. This makes them "his" game pieces as opposed to his agents, and even then only in so much that the Ellimist just doesn't get much out of them.
