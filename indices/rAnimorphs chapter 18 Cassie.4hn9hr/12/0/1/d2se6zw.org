If Crayak (or the Ellimist) wants to kill off the resistance, it's now over. Teleport small chunks of lava from the Earth's core into their brains, or teleport small pieces of their spine two millimetres to the left.

There's a lot of ways to kill somebody with unrestricted teleportation even with much stricter limits than "human mass equivalent times a macroscopic distance".

Which means that there are either more restrictions in place than we know about (e.g. can't directly kill a piece on the board) or the other player doesn't want them dead at the moment.
