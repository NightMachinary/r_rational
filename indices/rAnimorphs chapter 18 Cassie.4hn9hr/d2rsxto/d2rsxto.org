Deeply gripping. I wish I could read a new chapter everyday. I love this story so much.

You wrote Cassie's voice incredibly well. I'm stunned.

Also, yes, the bug fighter was still hovering above the building, so what happened should have happened. Stupid yet heroic decisions should not be rewarded lightly. I applaud you for writing simulation---as you put it, running the calculation---rather than writing plot.

I wonder if you could describe in the course of one of the next chapters /why/ Cassie was included among the queens, bishops, and knights?
