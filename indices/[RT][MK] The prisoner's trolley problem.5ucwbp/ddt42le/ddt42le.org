I noticed this while idly checking out [[/r/goldandblack]] and thought it was an interesting problem to solve.

I took a stab [[https://np.reddit.com/r/GoldandBlack/comments/5uag3p/introducing_the_prisoners_trolley_problem/ddssone/][here]] to try and figure it out with game theory, but I'm iffy about how well I did. What do you guys think?
