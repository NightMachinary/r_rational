  I find the story about the rationalist trainer and his scientific exploration of the world of pokemon far more interesting than the more conventional crime and mystery stories that are being hinted at.

I plan to keep this at the center of the story, but I think conflict makes for a more interesting character arc and plot :) Rest assured that crime-and-mystery is still related to the main motivations of the protagonists: Blue's desire to become a world-class trainer, Leaf's interest in learning about pokemon's origins, and Red's passion to understand pokemon and people.
