Semi-agreed. An interlude would normally be "short and sweet", but if it's sweet enough to justify including in the first place, it's sweet enough that this aspect of your story/world should be fully developed and included in the primary, secondary or tertiary storyline. Doing so does require more work on developing characters, locations, devices, etc and giving them full-blown plots of their own, but it's more rewarding for the reader.
