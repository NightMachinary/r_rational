  See: competent criminal. But you look at the 200 dollar novice and say "Well, hitmen just suck, so of course Team Rocket couldn't get away with it."
#+end_quote

Even competent hitmen are often caught.

[[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hojo.12063/full]]

The vast majority of those convicted had just one kill, giving evidence to my claim that murders often get solved.

The sort of killer who they note isn't captured is described as such- geographically mobile, killing their victim from a distance, and having no connections to the victims.

That would be a big issue for your sorts of killers. You want them to kill the person with pokemon (which lack the range of sniper rifles) and to hide the evidence (meaning they contaminate the crime scene) and move the body and not be seen which means following the routine of the person.

You're adding a lot of variables to the kill which make it less likely for them to not be caught. It's a lot easier to just kill someone and run. That is what good hitmen do. You're describing hitmen who tend to get caught by their behavior.

#+begin_quote
  but you're still insisting that any imperfection in the method of the murder or coverup should result in a solved crime. It's simply not the case.
#+end_quote

I'm pushing forward a more limited case- people should be able to tell what happened in the world. If someone is killed, they can tell by what pokemon, they can tell who was killed, they can tell what the job of the person killed was and talk about it with their companions.

If they do overt things like kill everyone investigating them, that is somewhat risky- a reasonably competent police force could investigate the people who were killed and work out what they were doing before death. They do all the basic stuff a reasonably competent cop would do- do an autopsy, ask what the person killed was doing before they died, talk with colleagues.

If people were stalking them for a while, especially in a city, there's a good chance they could discover that.

It would be good to not leave that evidence, hence why killing everyone who investigates them is risky. And like with the mafia, there likely would be evidence of their crimes and the police would be aware of their actions. They just wouldn't be aware they were working for some common purpose, I agree with you on that.

#+begin_quote
  Again, drawing assumptions out of lack of knowledge: what there are pokemon very good at killing in just about every region.
#+end_quote

You need pokemon that can effectively kill people from a distance, or those people are likely to dodge or draw out weapons or call someone. There aren't effective long ranged pokemon in every region. That means you have to get close and personal, that means you have to get the crime scene dirty.

#+begin_quote
  as evidenced by the "the data doesn't back up competent hitmen" generalization.
#+end_quote

I can see why from your perspective I would have flawed judgement, but since I never said "The data doesn't back up competent hitmen" your perspective is inaccurate. You are making up arguments for me, strawmen. This is why I regularly quote you- if you have some disagreement with me it's a lot easier if you express that when I say something, rather than making something up later.

#+begin_quote
  When your arguments are all based on badly applied overgeneralizations of data, and special pleading to ignore any contexts or factors that make your proposed scenarios less likely.
#+end_quote

This statement would be a lot better with concrete evidence. You generally just make vague statements like 'the hitmen wouldn't be discovered if they killed someone as the autopsy would just reveal it was a wild pokemon.' you're giving me somewhat incomplete contexts and factors that don't really follow through fully.

Let's take a hypothetical scenario. Someone goes to Cerulean City, and talks to Bill, he gives them some information on a lost colleague. They then investigate an abandoned house, searching for evidence of a crime done. This house is abandoned because a scientist was taken from in by the crime team, so they want to kill him.

How do they kill him. Do they attack him in a back alley? Do they follow him around for a while to find a good time? How do they avoid cameras? What do they do if he has a pokemon out to protect him? What if he has a companion? Where do they transport him to in the wild when they kill them? Do they fly there or walk, what if one route is monitored? How do they avoid being discovered in the wild? What if he is expecting to meet someone?

There's a lot of variables to that problem. You're not showing me any clear way to accomplish that, you're just saying it happens because competency.

Because of all those variables, that is why master hitmen don't try to conceal their kills. Or if they do, they pick vulnerable people who come to a location of their choosing like an abandoned factory. Too many variables means killing is likely to fail.

#+begin_quote
  And in your continued insistence on ignoring the concept of a competent criminal, you, a usual, ignore the idea that if any of that were the case, they wouldn't have targeted him.
#+end_quote

It is an established part of canon that he has an ex wife, so that ship is sailed. If he died, she would likely want all his stuff so she could have money. That is what relatives do- they try to suck money from you. You being an antisocial person won't stop them doing that.

#+begin_quote
  For the record, incase this isn't clear: "wild pokemon" are indistinguishable from "captured pokemon." You keep bringing it up like there's no overlap, and jumping to the most extreme, absurd examples like "Gyarados hyperbeam" to support your argument.
#+end_quote

I was presuming you meant relatively dangerous pokemon, which don't frequent common areas, not common pokemon which aren't hugely dangerous in immediate ways.

#+begin_quote
  You haven't even seen them in the story. That's part of what makes your arguments so easy to dismiss: you are literally shooting in the dark and hoping you hit the right answer based on your preconceptions of how the world and story work.
#+end_quote

It's not really that necessary, your descriptions are quite clear.

#+begin_quote
  ...Yes... They're paying the utility bill... Obviously that's the only rational path a competent hitman can take on the problem of "how do I not arouse suspicion."
#+end_quote

Paying the utility bill initially lowers suspicion, but later raises it when people wonder why the utility bill is paid when the person isn't there.

#+begin_quote
  Three prepositions based on unfounded arguments based on bad evidence. I think that's your record.
#+end_quote

It's fairly well founded- people are no longer there. There may have been incidents with criminals abducting them. Someone paid their utility bills after they vanished.

#+begin_quote
  Except they're not vanishing, as I've said multiple times, and recently clarified. But you refuse to accept the idea of a competent ciriminal, so back around the merry-go-round we go.
#+end_quote

At some point, they did. They may have reduced their social ties, so they talked to people less, but at some point they, apparently, vanished. I'm not claiming they didn't reduce their social ties, just pointing out that at some point they stopped answering any calls, stopped buying food, stopped ordering things, and people would notice.

#+begin_quote
  Useless without the chance to apply it.
#+end_quote

Suppose there's an 80% chance of killing someone in the first attack. Then that 20% is suddenly a lot more important. Healing increases the failure modes.

#+begin_quote
  Evidence of this in any pokemon game or media whatsoever? I'd love to add it into the story, I just have no idea where you're pulling this assumption from.
#+end_quote

They have instant healing technology, and the ability to upload people into data. They at several times modify these bits of data, with polygon say. Both would imply very good scanning technology, in that they can very easily manipulate flesh and identify problems and the fact that they can convert things into data and then do stuff with that data.

They also have xray glasses that let you see through walls. That would be a great boon for any doctor.
