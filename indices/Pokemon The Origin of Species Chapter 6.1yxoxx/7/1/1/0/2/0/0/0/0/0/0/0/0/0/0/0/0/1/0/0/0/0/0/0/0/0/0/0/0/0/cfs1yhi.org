  The top voted criticism of this chapter is that it's slow and boring (and irrelevant) and that the characters are annoying and depressed. This whole thing arose because people wanted a more exciting story where Red confronted criminals.

Not really, no: there has been a lot of legitimate criticism of the pacing and content of this chapter, which is why I drastically rewrote it. But you are really the only person (and have been for quite some time now) who's making the argument of "I want to read a crime thriller where Red investigates Team Rocket," let alone the various ways you're trying to argue your perspective's unique legitimacy.

The first part is fine; your preference is your preference. It's the second part that I find exasperating, as the angle of your arguments and shoddy data should not fill you with such strong and rigid conviction.
