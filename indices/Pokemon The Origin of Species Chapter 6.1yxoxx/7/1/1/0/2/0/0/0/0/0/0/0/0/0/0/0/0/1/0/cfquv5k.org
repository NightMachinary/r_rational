  All of which require foreknowledge of conspiracy, which means the criminals did nothing to hide the conspiracy's existence.
#+end_quote

I was talking more of, discovering the murder. You were initially arguing that they could kill a person perfectly with no risk- autopsies would reveal nothing, the person wouldn't escape, they wouldn't be leave any messages. We were talking about Red investigating the and getting killed.

If they have left no hints of their crimes, then him trying to investigate them would do little, and he would likely only get small hints that wouldn't lead to death. That would also be fine. You were initially implying that he could investigate them, just that the result would be death.

#+begin_quote
  which is why most people who are murdered do not call the police mid-murder.
#+end_quote

People don't die instantly when someone attacks you. It takes a while to bleed out, and most gun shot wounds don't kill. Your assumption, that most murderers kill somewhat instantly, is false per the statistics I gave you.

#+begin_quote
  What has "never happened?" Killing people and not getting caught? An organization killing people and not being revealed? Seriously?
#+end_quote

What you were previously describing- an organization kidnapping people en masse and murdering anyone who investigates them without people knowing that there are kidnappings and murders.

What you are now describing, an organization that does the above and is discovered but the true crime bosses of it aren't discovered, that is possible.

#+begin_quote
  Gun injuries that we know of. Gun injuries where they receive medical attention, including gun accidents. Not gun injuries by hitmen, a far smaller sample with far higher mortality.
#+end_quote

Whether they receive medical attention is immaterial. If they can limp to a hospital, they can spill their guts out to the police. My point was, people often survive seemingly fatal injuries for a while, which would give them enough time to phone someone.

#+begin_quote
  Furthermore, all of that is irrelevant, as I said before: no guns. There are a number of pokemon that are particularly good at killing people, and those are the kinds of pokemon competent criminals would use to kill someone.
#+end_quote

Using these pokemon would make it obvious in an autopsy. If their body has been blasted by a hyper beam from a gyrados, people will notice.

If they hide the body you have the issue of missing people. Search parties would likely go out, attracting more attention.

Again, with both cases, even assuming their pokemon hits perfectly (and missing is common in pokemon) they are causing more issues that make it likely that a reasonably competent police force would think something was up.

#+begin_quote
  What in God's green earth gives you the confidence to say "a rural area like pallet?" Why would they have killed someone from Pallet?
#+end_quote

Most of the world is rural in pokemon, and Red is normally from Pallet. I read the start of your story a while ago, I can't remember if he is also from Pallet.

#+begin_quote
  You just abused statistical interpretation so badly that I'm swiftly losing any interest in this conversation: you're not only twisting facts to suit your argument, you're not even doing it particularly well. Take the most forgiving statistics without controlling for variables and context, and use them to generalize against an entire slew of situations whose details you either make up or ignore?
#+end_quote

I'm not abusing statistics, I am using them as intended.

They raise a very good point. The police are good at discovering who murdered people. It's not incredibly hard. As such, you shouldn't generally expect murder to go undiscovered, as a matter of course. Especially if it happens a lot. In our world it is very abnormal for murders to go unsolved.

#+begin_quote
  but it seems very much to me that you have indeed been saying something "like that" by implying numerous times that Red could investigate such a thing without getting killed, as it would be stupid of criminal organizations to kill children, even assuming they could muster up the killing instinct to do so
#+end_quote

It would be stupid of them to murder him.

Their first impulse, likely, would be to threaten him. Then to beat him up. Then, if he refused to shut up, kill him. They could kill him, but they likely wouldn't open with it, since murder tends to draw unwanted attention. That is the normal way to overcome your aversion to murder. Escalate until you're in the mood.

#+begin_quote
  Once again, ignoring or forgetting the selective targeting of people who have no remaining social ties.
#+end_quote

Lacking social ties doesn't mean your monetary ties would vanish. Your children and partner would want your property, your money, utilities would want money for bills. Other scientists would want to write papers with you, students would want internships.

#+begin_quote
  ...what? They learn about a conspiracy before they hear about a crime? Do you actually think this way, that conspiracies are unearthed, not from the connection of crimes and information, but by thinking up a conspiracy first, and then fitting crimes to a preconceived theory? Where do you think that they hear about the conspiracy in the first place? Who tells them? Someone has to hypothesize it first.
#+end_quote

You're moving from one issue (can you hide murder perfectly) to another one (can you hide conspiracies perfectly) and are implying that because I disagree with you on the first issue, I disagree with you on the second.

#+begin_quote
  Crimes produce evidence, but not evidence that can be easily found, and not evidence that always points to clear answers.
#+end_quote

No, but when people talk about it they might say "I do not know what really happened, but I fear Voldemort's mark." or "I do not know what really happened, but I fear these dangerous criminals." not I wonder why all these people have vanished and died for no discernible reason. They know that a dangerous criminal did it.

#+begin_quote
  You can't actually think that all murders are cleared 90% of the time. You just quoted statistics that say otherwise: not the ones in rural ares, where the vast minority of people live, but cities, where the majority of murders take place. You do know the difference between per-capita and flat statistics, yes? 90% of 100 is less than 40% of 3,000.
#+end_quote

I don't, just, Pallet is generally considered a rural area, and Red is from there, and he was the one we were talking about being murdered.

  MK Ultra
#+end_quote

They used universities as fronts, they were pretty open about testing on humans, just not about being run by the CIA.

To extend the analogy- it would be clear that someone, or some groups, were abducting scientists, though it wouldn't be clear if they were working together.

#+begin_quote
  Iran Contra
#+end_quote

I don't think anyone has every questioned that the Iranians were aware that they were being sold weapons.

#+begin_quote
  Yes! I know! Which is why, for the fourth time at least, I have said that Team Rocket members making mistakes =/= Team Rocket being revealed as an organization!
#+end_quote

I don't believe I ever said that team rocket making mistakes means team rocket being revealed as an organization. You were originally claiming that they couldn't make any mistakes in murder, and that police investigations would be abysmal.

#+begin_quote
  In our world and our technology it may be 50%, but not necessarily in the pokemon world.
#+end_quote

I dunno, I would expect it to be higher in the pokemon world. Better medical tech, cheaper autopsies.
