  I note how, despite my requests, you didn't reveal any real life criminal organizations that murdered people and abducted people without being discovered. Could you name some, proving your point?

Your request reminds me of this (very funny) bit from HPMOR:

#+begin_quote
  Harry had unthinkingly started to repeat back the standard proverb that there was no such thing as a perfect crime, before he actually thought about it for two-thirds of a second, remembered a wiser proverb, and shut his mouth in midsentence.

  /What do you think you know, and how do you think you know it?/

  If you did commit the perfect crime, nobody would ever find out - so how could anyone possibly know that there weren't perfect crimes?

It does not seem very reasonable to demand examples of organizations that got away with murder. If they really did get away with it, we wouldn't know. It might make more sense to ask how many murders remain unsolved. According to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder#Incidence][Wikipedia]] in 2007 the unsolved murder rate in the United States was 39%.
