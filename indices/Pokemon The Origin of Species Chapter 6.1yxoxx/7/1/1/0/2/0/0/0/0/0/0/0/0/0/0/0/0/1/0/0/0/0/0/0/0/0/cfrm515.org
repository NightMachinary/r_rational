  At this point, your position has substantially softened from your initial one. As such, Red could investigate their crimes and see some stuff and not be killed. He would simply be seen as a conspiracy nut. That is definitely something that would be fun for people to see.
#+end_quote

I would argue this isn't a softening actually, as I definitely said early on that he would HAVE to investigate it if he saw something (which would eventually make him a threat) so I would have to artificially impede his progress to keep him in the "conspiracy nut" category, and I don't want to artificially do that.

#+begin_quote
  Those are a lot of ifs that you can't really control for easily.
#+end_quote

I know, which is why I said it was a particular hypothetical on a particular hypothetical. But you're asking an impossible task if you want me to prove that any crime possible in every potential situation can never be done perfectly, and I see no reason to assume the opposite when you can't even counter the hypothetical I DO present without saying "well what if it hadn't happened that way?" What if it had? I don't need to prove a 100% efficiency rate, just like you don't need to prove a 100% inefficiency rate: I'm just arguing that it's probable, with a lot of effort and competency, to get away with murder, and as the unsolved murder rate that you love to throw around so often (no matter how little it actually applies to the pokemon world) happens to agree with me, I don't really see why you're continuing this argument.

21% in Detroit, 22% in New Orleans. Fair of me to use those statistics instead of your 90%? Of course not, because both are completely irrelevant to the matter at hand. I just wish you'd recognize that, instead of insisting that you have the best grasp of what's possible and likely because you found some statistics to misinterpret in your favor.

  If someone had explicitly said that, that when they called the person's house the person said 'This person moved, they are not there anymore, they moved to x place' that would be a lot less suspicious than them just vanishing. There would be a cover story for them that was entirely plausible.
#+end_quote

You, again, for what, the fifth time now? Continue to use the word "vanishing." But now suddenly it's okay to have a cover story? You can't even admit that you didn't think of that possibility earlier? Nope, incompetent criminals can't get away with murder or kidnappings, gotta go for the most obvious and suspicious paths of crime.

#+begin_quote
  You are misusing the data.
#+end_quote

Sucks, doesn't it? I'll stop when you do.

#+begin_quote
  For example, the federal government counted 840,279 missing persons cases in 2001. All but about 50,000 were juveniles, classified as anyone younger than 18.

  So, the vast majority of missing cases are angsty teenagers. Older males, engineers and scientists vanishing, is much rarer and so is statistically distinct.
#+end_quote

Woah, woah, woah there, Happy McOptimism. Did you just dismiss hundreds of thousands of missing persons "angsty teenagers?" You do recognize that just from the data you listed, there's no way to tell how many of those people under 18 were murdered or sold into sex slavery, right? You're just assuming "Ah, some kid got angsty and ran way from home, that doesn't count." Stop twisting data! I really don't know what you think you're accomplishing by it.

#+begin_quote
  A lot are racial minorities.
#+end_quote

Which is only relevant because it means investigations are less enthusiastic for them, which falls into the "need to have probable cause to commit a full investigation," and "I haven't seen my old friend in a few years, last I heard he moved to another region but I can't find him" doesn't qualify.

#+begin_quote
  Or people suffering from dementia, which these scientists presumably weren't, since they are being recruited for some evil scheme.
#+end_quote

...you do know that assuming missing people are suffering from dementia is a plausible response to their disappearance, right? Meaning it's a perfectly rational reason for why the police wouldn't investigate someone like Dr. Fuji's case, especially if he'd lost his daughter, been left by his wife, and stopped returning contact with all his friends?

#+begin_quote
  So it would be weird. People do take note of rich/middle class people vanishing.
#+end_quote

In the limited reference pool you've just brought up for the sixth (seventh? I lost count) time ignoring the idea of only targeting people who wouldn't be missed, sure.

/sighs/ I said I wouldn't address or repeat things I already have, but I keep doing it.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not sure this would be something you'd need to do. Nidorino can learn tackle and double kick, which would look like this. My main issue with this plan is the high level of luck it requires, and the blood stains coating the cracked wall of their house.
#+end_quote

Point taken on them knowing kicking. But luck can be mitigated against by planning (which is why there are actually things like highly coordinated capers and heists that can go off without a hitch), and I already said that they could clean up whatever blood there might be. Furthermore, you're assuming that he would kick the wall: why not just kick the person and cave their chest in? See how easy it is to play "what if?" from both sides?

But all I'm saying is "this is realistically probable," and you're saying "no it's not."

Which is a far harder burden of proof to meet in something as basic as "can competent people commit pre-planned crimes without getting caught?" Especially when you keep bringing up irrelevant "proof" like "X% of all murders, varying by region, including all the people who get drunk and shoot someone, or people who confess, or people who have absolutely no experience committing crimes and simply act on impulsive anger or jealousy, get caught, therefor it's improbable that your competent preplanned murders can do it without getting caught."

Special pleading, to the nth degree.
