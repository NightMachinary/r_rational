  That isn't what research on hitmen says happens. A lot of them bungle it or fail to do it (as I said, killing people is hard) and those that do it often do it in public. The best generally come in from another region and do it, and have few ties to the region. If you stay in one area to scope someone out you're more likely to get caught.
#+end_quote

Once again, taking specific information and generalizing it in a way that most benefits you. The article you linked to specifically mentions the "class" of hitman, and your arguments might apply if we weren't specifically talking about career criminals with specialized training in murder.

See: competent criminal. But you look at the 200 dollar novice and say "Well, hitmen just suck, so of course Team Rocket couldn't get away with it."

#+begin_quote
  but at the same time you're saying that these hitmen are going to kill their victims in the wild where pokemon live, aka a rural area.
#+end_quote

Wrong: I said they would relocate their bodies to places where it's feasible that a pokemon would commit the act.

And again, sixth time now: evidence of murder =/= solved murder =/= blown conspiracy. I think we've established that last part, at least, but you're still insisting that any imperfection in the method of the murder or coverup should result in a solved crime. It's simply not the case.

#+begin_quote
  Killed by pokemon that are very good at killing, and probably aren't native to that region.
#+end_quote

Again, drawing assumptions out of lack of knowledge: what there are pokemon very good at killing in just about every region.

#+begin_quote
  And in your world, the mary sue organization is much more successful :)

  And improved technology only works for them, no one else can benefit.

  Hence why I am challenging you. I'd prefer to see hyper competent police and criminals, not just hyper competent criminals. It's annoying seeing people hold the idiot ball.
#+end_quote

I would be more inclined to believe this if you weren't so quick to use bad evidence and twist statistics to back your arguments, because you continue to do this, as evidenced by the "the data doesn't back up competent hitmen" generalization.

#+begin_quote
  Have you actually read up on any accounts of real life criminals, or hitmen, or murderers?
#+end_quote

I spent a year and a half studying forensic psychology, so yeah, it's kind of one of my major interests, which is part of why I find your insistence on your misuse of data to back your assertions so frustrating. Especially when you say things like this:

#+begin_quote
  I really think you should read up on actual hitmen. It would help a lot.
#+end_quote

When your arguments are all based on badly applied overgeneralizations of data, and special pleading to ignore any contexts or factors that make your proposed scenarios less likely.

#+begin_quote
  Do you remember what you wrote in your chapter? He lost his daughter, and his wife divorced him. So they can have children and he has an ex wife, who may well want his home if he dies. He could easily have had other children, or children that abandoned him. If not, he could have siblings who didn't talk to him much.
#+end_quote

And in your continued insistence on ignoring the concept of a competent criminal, you, a usual, ignore the idea that if any of that were the case, they wouldn't have targeted him.

#+begin_quote
  But then you forget other parts of your argument, like that they have to be killed by wild pokemon who live in the wild.
#+end_quote

As I explained above, this was your mistake, not mine, because you keep assuming things, sometimes due to misreading what I say.

For the record, incase this isn't clear: "wild pokemon" are indistinguishable from "captured pokemon." You keep bringing it up like there's no overlap, and jumping to the most extreme, absurd examples like "Gyarados hyperbeam" to support your argument.

#+begin_quote
  They might get away with it some number of times, I just wouldn't describe them as competent if murder was their go to tool for solving problems. Their competency is an implied attribute rather than something we see in the story.
#+end_quote

You haven't even seen them in the story. That's part of what makes your arguments so easy to dismiss: you are literally shooting in the dark and hoping you hit the right answer based on your preconceptions of how the world and story work.

#+begin_quote
  So they are paying the utility bill after they vanish? That's also evidence.
#+end_quote

...Yes... They're paying the utility bill...

Obviously that's the only rational path a competent hitman can take on the problem of "how do I not arouse suspicion."

Wait, no, there aren't any of those, I forgot. /sighs/

#+begin_quote
  Other people would likely also be competent and realize what had happened, and other scientists and engineers, being afraid for their lives due to the obvious evidence of people vanishing, would beef up their security measures.
#+end_quote

Three prepositions based on unfounded arguments based on bad evidence. I think that's your record.

#+begin_quote
  No, I just said that people would discover that scientists were vanishing, likely due to criminal activity.
#+end_quote

Except they're not vanishing, as I've said multiple times, and recently clarified. But you refuse to accept the idea of a competent ciriminal, so back around the merry-go-round we go.

#+begin_quote
  And medical tech is better (e.g. magic healing sprays),
#+end_quote

Useless without the chance to apply it.

#+begin_quote
  and the technology to discover evidence is far more powerful too.
#+end_quote

Evidence of this in any pokemon game or media whatsoever? I'd love to add it into the story, I just have no idea where you're pulling this assumption from.
