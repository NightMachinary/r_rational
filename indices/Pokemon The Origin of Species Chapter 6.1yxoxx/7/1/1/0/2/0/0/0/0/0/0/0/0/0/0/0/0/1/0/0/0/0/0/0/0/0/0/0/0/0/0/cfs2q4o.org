This whole thing started with someone else saying.

"Um, why not just let him investigate?"

And.

"Maybe Rational!Red could be smart enough to realize this? I love the scene in HPMOR were Harry tells McGonagall about the spell on the Sorting Hat and what he would do if he would discover the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. If Red would similarly decide not to stick his nose too far into the whole Team Rocket business, I think it could be both funny and an interesting chance to discuss rationality."

Those were the comments that sparked them.

Your many, many contrived reasons why no one can investigate team rocket without dying are a commonly complained issue- people want to see violence, feel fear, see crime. The chapter would be a lot better with more of that and less of "I am sad my husband died."

  The first part is fine; your preference is your preference. It's the second part that I find exasperating, as the angle of your arguments and shoddy data should not fill you with such strong and rigid conviction.

Emotionally, your team rocket is annoying because they make everyone around them hold idiot balls.

People being smart is a big thing of what makes rational stories fun. You see very intelligent evil people do bad things. Then you see very intelligent good people try to counteract those bad things. You see moderately intelligent people in both sides make the best of the options available to them to survive.

Now, your case for your Team Rocket being able to do those crimes isn't very good. For example, you were not able to name any crimes similar to yours where the people weren't immediately discovered. But let's assume it is. Let's suppose they hacked government surveillance cameras, and they can see everything. They can produce convincing doubles with ditto, teleport people out with kadabra.

Kidnapping a person is simply a matter of finding them on the cameras, teleporting in, replacing them with doubles, and telling those doubles to take a train to a faraway land.

If your team rocket was far enough above our world to do something like that then your story would be pretty dull without similarly powerful people on the opposite side. You have given team rocket a death star without giving frodo a lightsaber.

And that doesn't make for a very fun story. It's boring seeing Oak not know what is happening and not try to do much to find out.
