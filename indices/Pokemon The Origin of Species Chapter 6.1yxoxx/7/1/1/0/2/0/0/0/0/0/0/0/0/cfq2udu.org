  There's a huge difference between "they do crimes, such as kidnapping" and "they're an incredibly powerful and dangerous organization willing to kill to keep their secrets."
#+end_quote

There is a huge difference, but not in terms of danger to an eleven year old. They're both going to be dangerous criminals to him.

#+begin_quote
  at most they'd be thinking they're just looking into an isolated incident that might have foul play from a single actor.
#+end_quote

Again, a lack of basic competency from anyone investigating.

Suppose Red investigated after his mother or someone told him about the situation.

A basic investigation technique- call the victim's mother.

"Did Red have any enemies?"

"Well, he was investigating something- a lot of scientists have gone missing."

They could then pull his phone records, see he called a few scientist's assistants, talk to them. It wouldn't be that hard to unravel the conspiracy.

#+begin_quote
  Well now you're attacking a strawman: I've admitted they don't need a 100% success rate: you're just refusing to accept that making mistakes shouldn't automatically result in them losing their secret status, or that this mistakes should conveniently allow an 11 year old trainer to safely find them.
#+end_quote

There's a limited amount you can do, rationally, to cover up murder, kidnapping, and mass surveillance of anyone who investigates you. Those are incredibly overt and obvious actions. What you are describing is a very overt and non secretive organization being secret through competency and the police being stupid.

My preferred change would be that you either bring the organization out into the open or have them display actual competency rather than just having the world twist around them to hide their actions.

#+begin_quote
  By which I mean you seem inclined to insist that this secret criminal organization should not be able to remain secret within a chapter of it being revealed, and rather than wait to see how it will be revealed through the course of the story, phrase your arguments in such a way that your perspective must be the only proper one.
#+end_quote

Actual stealth does require some effort to make things stealthy. If you have people do overtly obvious things like mass kidnapping or murder it stretches credulity. It stretches credulity further when you say that they are such masters at crimes that autopsies reveal nothing. It stretches credulity beyond even that when the police make no effort to investigate this beyond assuming it is all an isolated incident.

It is very possible to do actual things to make it seem more secret- say have there be some sort of front organization that these scientists supposedly join, so they don't seem to have just vanished. They could even be made to call their friends at gun point and leave a message saying they're fine. You're just not doing that.

#+begin_quote
  You just called something a Mary Sue without a single character representing it appearing "on screen," as it were, because you disagree with . Do you think that helps make your argument?
#+end_quote

More because of the way you described it.

#+begin_quote
  I'm sorry to say that even with our modern technology and forensics, there hae still existed highly successful secretive criminal organizations and conspiracies that were not discovered for years later.
#+end_quote

So, by your logic, I am exaggerating the benefits of technology, as similar organizations have existed in our world.

Sure. Could you name an organization that killed people who investigated it and kidnapped some sort of middle class person en masse without being discovered? Or some similar level of crime.

The only thing I can think of is the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, but they actually had a front purpose, treating black people for bad blood.

#+begin_quote
  Once again, in your hypothetical scenario where a person knows they're soon to be in danger and is carrying their phone in their hand ready to dial the police, you fail to recognize the context being anything different than you imagine
#+end_quote

Not really. My issue is more that you seem to assume they instantly and perfectly kill people with no one finding out.

They might manage it once or twice, but if it's their go to response then someone is likely to survive the first attack (perhaps with fatal injuries) and get their pokemon out to defend them for a while, or the shot might miss, or a passerby might help them.

There are a lot of random variables in these things.

#+begin_quote
  God forbid competent villains exist in fiction as they do in reality, where many heads of organized, murderous crime syndicates live successfully for decades before being caught, if they ever do.
#+end_quote

Could you name a crime organization that existed for decades doing a similar level to your one and was undiscovered?

#+begin_quote
  This judgement being based on what evidence, exactly? The musings of Professor Oak based on his idle guesses and worst fears? See again: premature judgements.
#+end_quote

Evidence.

1. Scientists and engineers are vanishing en masse.

2. There is apparently no plausible reason for them vanishing.

3. People who investigate this are murdered.

#+begin_quote
  You're envisioning people being pushed into a truck in broad daylight, or smuggled out of their houses in the middle of the night. I really can't repeat myself enough in this regard: stop jumping to conclusions and not recognizing that you're making judgements off bad or incompletely data.
#+end_quote

Actually, I am envisioning the end result. Someone vanishes, someone who is useful to someone else (e.g. they owe them money for bills), and they kick up a fuss with private investigators and the police to find them.

#+begin_quote
  Be right back, editing my chapter to be 50k words longer and reveal all the major plot-relevant information :)
#+end_quote

There is some middle ground between that and people mass murdering investigators and having no one find them out.

#+begin_quote
  This has been an entertaining and interesting debate up until this last post, where I feel you were no longer engaging in "good spirit." To me this argument has been a fun hypothetical discussion of the way things might be, but it seems you are taking it as license to not just jump to conclusions based on bad evidence, but to insist that any deviation from these conclusions is objectively bad.
#+end_quote

I haven't said anything of the sorts, so I can't really reply to this. If you have some issue with something I say, that's fine, but if you put words in my mouth then I can't guess what you mean that easily. I haven't said "Any deviation from these conclusions is objectively bad." or anything of the sorts so I can't really change my behaviour since you have given me nothing tangible.
