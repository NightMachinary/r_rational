  If he discovered their existence, presumably he'd have some knowledge that they do crimes, such as kidnapping. Because people who kidnap are scary he would feel some emotional fear of getting close.
#+end_quote

There's a huge difference between "they do crimes, such as kidnapping" and "they're an incredibly powerful and dangerous organization willing to kill to keep their secrets."

#+begin_quote
  They would still, presumably, be asking questions about the right sort of thing, and so someone investigating their death would realize that they repeatedly searched some scientist's name before their death or something.
#+end_quote

Sure, but like I said it's not particularly hard to cover up murder in this world, and people don't generally write everything they do in journals for others to find when simply into everything: at most they'd be thinking they're just looking into an isolated incident that might have foul play from a single actor. In such a situation, leaving behind a journal of their suspicions and actions for people to find in case they die is pretty contrived.

#+begin_quote
  Actually, it's more relying on the basic competency of people in general.

  You are proposing a group with a 100% success rate in something, murder, and are arguing to me that anything less than a 100% success rate would indicate that they have the idiot ball.
#+end_quote

Well now you're attacking a strawman: I've admitted they don't need a 100% success rate: you're just refusing to accept that making mistakes shouldn't automatically result in them losing their secret status, or that this mistakes should conveniently allow an 11 year old trainer to safely find them.

#+begin_quote
  When I propose that other groups would have basic competency (e.g. they would autopsy bodies), you argue against that basic competency. I could challenge your points on technical grounds such as how destroying evidence is evidence of its own, but there is one other point that is more important.
#+end_quote

If you want to read it that way, I'm not really sure how else to convince you otherwise: you seem to have made up your mind before even hearing my arguments.

By which I mean you seem inclined to insist that this secret criminal organization should not be able to remain secret within a chapter of it being revealed, and rather than wait to see how it /will/ be revealed through the course of the story, phrase your arguments in such a way that your perspective must be the only proper one.

#+begin_quote
  This is reading a lot like a mary sue character. They twist the world to make no one discover their evil ways, are perfect, and are apparently the real protagonist of the story.
#+end_quote

Seriously? I said this mostly in jest to shake up your perspective of "the way things have to be." If I'd known you'd immediately jump to "Mary Sue," I'd have been more careful about deconstructing your argument without humor.

You just called something a Mary Sue without a single character representing it appearing "on screen," as it were, because you disagree with it. Do you think that helps make your argument?

#+begin_quote
  And perfect characters aren't very fun. It would be a lot more fun to see a rational character interact with them and display some basic competency (which may mean not doing more than the most surface of investigations) than to hear about how their crimes are perfect and undetectable.
#+end_quote

The only reason you're hearing about it in this hypothetical regard is that you continue to insist that the story you haven't read yet is illogical or irrational for not playing out exactly as you think it should... for no particularly logical or realistic reasons, I might add, despite your insistence of realistic representation. I'm sorry to say that even with our modern technology and forensics, there hae still existed highly successful secretive criminal organizations and conspiracies that were not discovered for years later.

I can't really respond to what would be a "lot more fun" to read or write when I haven't even gotten a chance to write the story as I envision it yet. Simply put, your judgements seem premature.

#+begin_quote
  Killing people is psychologically hard, and it takes seconds to speed dial the police.
#+end_quote

Once again, in your hypothetical scenario where a person knows they're soon to be in danger and is carrying their phone in their hand ready to dial the police, you fail to recognize the context being anything different than you imagine, like them a) not even knowing that they've caught the attention of dangerous people yet and/or b) being ambushed while doing something otherwise innocuous.

#+begin_quote
  So again- you have a perfect villain who makes everyone around them incompetent.
#+end_quote

God forbid competent villains exist in fiction as they do in reality, where many heads of organized, murderous crime syndicates live successfully for decades before being caught, if they ever do.

#+begin_quote
  One who takes actions which aren't very secret, and just secrets away any problems.
#+end_quote

This judgement being based on what evidence, exactly? The musings of Professor Oak based on his idle guesses and worst fears? See again: premature judgements.

#+begin_quote
  Beggars disappearing is easy to conceal. Respectable members of the middle and upper classes is harder to conceal.
#+end_quote

You're envisioning people being pushed into a truck in broad daylight, or smuggled out of their houses in the middle of the night. I really can't repeat myself enough in this regard: stop jumping to conclusions and not recognizing that you're making judgements off bad or incompletely data.

#+begin_quote
  Then they'd probably have the same issue we have- they want to learn about the Manhattan project, not about how incompetent everyone but the Manhattan project is.
#+end_quote

Be right back, editing my chapter to be 50k words longer and reveal all the major plot-relevant information :)

This has been an entertaining and interesting debate up until this last post, where I feel you were no longer engaging in "good spirit." To me this argument has been a fun hypothetical discussion of the way things might be, but it seems you are taking it as license to not just jump to conclusions based on bad evidence, but to insist that any deviation from these conclusions is objectively bad.

I'm less interested in a discussion like that, so please try to draw back a bit on the strawmen and ad hominem.
