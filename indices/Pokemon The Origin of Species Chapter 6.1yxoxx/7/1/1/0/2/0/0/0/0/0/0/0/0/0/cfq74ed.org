This entire conversation has spiraled completely away from what it originally was, which was "why isn't Red finding out about these people and investigating them."

Once again, the answers are:

1) That's not the story I have in mind: I intend a couple years to pass at least before Team Rocket's activities are forced into the public consciousness.

2) I don't think it would be realistic for Red to find out, investigate, and not die against an organization as powerful and well run as my conception of Team Rocket.

You've provided no alternatives beyond simply asserting again and again that such an organization couldn't exist. I hate to use the "agree to disagree" line, but at this point it seems the only thing I can do, as this is the best you can bring forth for "Evidence" of your perspective:

#+begin_quote
  Scientists and engineers are vanishing en masse.
#+end_quote

Incorrect: A limited group of scientists and engineers faded from public life about a decade ago, as implied in the story. This is what I mean by you constructing strawmen and leaping to conclusions: you keep taking things I say and then extrapolating them in a way that implies your perspective the only reasonable one to hold.

#+begin_quote
  There is apparently no plausible reason for them vanishing.
#+end_quote

"Apparently" being the key word. This organization has been hinted at by one person in the story, at the end of one chapter: jumping to the conclusions you have from that is entirely premature.

#+begin_quote
  People who investigate this are murdered.
#+end_quote

People who /would/ investigate /could/ be murdered, as I've said. Which is why Red investigating them and surviving would be a pretty poor story for a realistic fiction, and your points of "well he could get away by enemy incompetence" or "it's hard for people to feel a killer instinct" are just not compelling arguments that this wouldn't be making the enemies needlessly incompetent, for no other reason than to force Red into a part of the story he has no reason to be involved in yet.

That his death by a professional hitman might result in Team Rocket being investigated and revealed is irrelevant: he'd still be dead. It's not about the police force being incompetent either: that's like saying the Aurors or the Order of the Phoenix is just incompetent because they didn't stop Voldemorte. The whole point of having a threatening over-arching antagonist is that the status quo isn't able to handle them, however competent.

And while I could jump him into the Team Rocket plot early and just bend the universe to ensure that Red's safe by any number of artificial means (any way you try to slice it, a criminal organization that can't effectively kill a child without revealing itself is utterly incompetent), I don't want to do that, and see no reason to when I could tell the story in what I view as a better way over a longer time line.
