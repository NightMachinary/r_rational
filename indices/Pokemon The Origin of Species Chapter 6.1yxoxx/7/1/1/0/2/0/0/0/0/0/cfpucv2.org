  People generally have an aversion to murder, kidnapping, and criminals, and so when someone says "This person is a psycopath" members of polite society tend to avoid them. It would be like saying "This area has a high crime rate, and several people have been mugged and killed there." The rational response wouldn't necessarily to be to go, as an 11 year old, to that area where people are vanishing or dying. Likewise with a criminal organization.

Again, this is assuming the danger is clearly known from the outset, and the Rocket of my world is not that obvious.

  With phones and such, people tend to stay in contact with their family members. They inform them of the location where they are going. If you try to kill anyone who goes to your area you're likely to have several screw ups.
#+end_quote

Getting into the area would be pretty improbable: far easier to kill them before they get to that point, when they're still snooping around to find it.

#+begin_quote
  People are going to escape, due to strong pokemon or fast pokemon or luck or minions who don't have a killing instinct.
#+end_quote

Again relying on the incompetency of the antagonists to propel the plot.

#+begin_quote
  A basic autopsy is going to reveal that the person didn't die from pokemon local to the area, and probably that they have brain damage from being put in a ball.
#+end_quote

Assuming enough of the body is left to do a thorough autopsy, even putting aside postmortem wounding to obfuscate. Also, the brain damage has to be something you're looking for: just like we don't autopsy everyone who dies without a reason to suspect foul play, why would they autopsy every apparent pokemon death?

#+begin_quote
  Having minions sufficiently murderous to quickly kill anyone who comes close means having impulsive psychopaths likely with a criminal history on your pay, which is risky.
#+end_quote

"Sufficiently murderous" is meaningless in this context: willing to kill people who threaten their health and safety and freedom? Kind of goes along with organized crime. Why would they need to be any more likely to be "impulsive psychopaths?" Do you think only impulsive psychopaths can be cold-blooded killers? Because those are more likely to be sociopaths, and they are not particularly well known for being impulsive.

#+begin_quote
  Also, if a police officer (with strong, well trained pokemon and a gun) makes some attempt to investigate it and gets killed you are risking escalating the situation up to swat teams.
#+end_quote

No guns :) But other than that, the police would need something to investigate first. "Secret" in this sense doesn't mean what it does in Saturday Morning Cartoons.

#+begin_quote
  In an era with mobile phones it's not easy to avoid things being in the open, especially if your first response to an inquisitive child is murder.
#+end_quote

You make it sound like inquisitive children are just stumbling all over the place trying to find these guys, getting murdered left and right. Once again: Secret. Organization. There's no reason any random child would know about them, which is why there's no reason Red should at this point either.

#+begin_quote
  Because the job of an antagonist, generally, is to interfere with the protagonist's goals in some manner. They should generally cross paths and antagonize each other.
#+end_quote

So I should make my bad guys stupid just to ensure the world revolves around Red? Maybe it'll help if you think of it this way: Red isn't the protagonist, Team Rocket is. Red is their antagonist: he just doesn't know it yet.

#+begin_quote
  Also, that's why rich people who want to get criminal aid hire local criminal organizations to do their dirty work. If it all goes wrong they take the fall. It tends to mean a better breed of criminal too. You get good at crimes by doing crimes a lot, and that means sometimes getting caught. If your inner circle of people knows a lot about you when stuff goes wrong and the police catch them everything will go badly for you.
#+end_quote

Calling Team Rocket in my world "organized crime" is actually a misnomer: their acts are criminal, but their goals are not what one would normally associate with most criminals, which means they don't care about being hired by rich people to do crimes, especially when they're being bankrolled already to pursue their actual goals.

  For Japan, for most of the war, yes. Nothing really happened, then they got curbstomped.

If only they'd had access to an interlude...
