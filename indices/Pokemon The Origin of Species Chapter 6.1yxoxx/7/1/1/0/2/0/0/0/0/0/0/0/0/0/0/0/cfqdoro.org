  I described several failure modes for the organization- discovery upon murder, investigation by police or private investigators, autopsies of killed people, the use of phones. Your response was basically to assume the worst possible investigation possible and blatant stupidity (e.g. not leaving notes behind when you go to investigate a dangerous criminal organization).
#+end_quote

All of them the result of gross incompetence by the organization (not a minor slipup, but outright incompetence) or a resolution so easy that the common police force is able to achieve it... leaving what room, exactly, for the protagonists?

#+begin_quote
  That is what you are doing- you are assuming the best of all possible worlds for your criminal organization, even as they risk themselves a lot, numerous times.
#+end_quote

And your insistence that no criminal organization could remain hidden while engaging in acts you have no real knowledge of similarly strains credulity. You keep saying things like "they could just call the police if they're in danger." Right, because every murder victim in our modern age that has a cell phone does that? No, they don't. Even common criminals can murder someone without them getting a phone call off first, but you think it's unrealistic for elite organized criminals to do so.

Again, "agree to disagree" seems the only option here.

#+begin_quote
  There is an obvious alternative. Have a front organization to deflect initial probes that doesn't openly murder people. The more you murder people, the more likely you are to make mistakes and have people die. A smart group would have other options.
#+end_quote

You don't know what their other options are: all you know is what you've assumed based on bad information and my hypothetical response to your "just have Red look around, what's the worst that could happen? It's not like they'll kill him, that's /stupid/."

Since when is killing people who know too much stupid, exactly? Since you assume that obviously it would be figured out. Well, that's assuming the most optimistic of possible worlds for your scenario, as mentioned.

#+begin_quote
  Ah, I misread that. Still, back then, you'd expect these investigations to have been done.
#+end_quote

The point of staggering them over years was so it wasn't as suspicious. Oak only noticed now after over a decade of retrospect.

#+begin_quote
  Actually, you are changing what the story says- no one can get in contact with them- so they did vanish en masse, in a group. That remains in your story. They didn't just fade from public life, they are impossible to contact now.
#+end_quote

You misunderstand: "vanish" implies that they're having a completely normal and social life one day, and are suddenly absent the next. When I say "fade," I mean how long it takes for them to lose contact with friends and family: the end result is the same, but the lead up of isolation and withdrawal makes it far less suspicious.

#+begin_quote
  That is why people investigate these things and find out more. Then apparently get murdered.
#+end_quote

In every investigation of every criminal organization in all of history, there began a moment where the people who eventually unraveled the conspiracy first suspected it existed in the first place to even begin investigating.

This is that moment, as far as the protagonists are aware. You keep trying to insist that it should have come earlier and that other people should be in on it: I've seen no reason why this is the case.

#+begin_quote
  It's not really incompetence to not have perfect surveillance of everything. People see weird things all the time. They would presumably keep the worst of it behind closed doors, but he could find some scary stuff that would scare him off without them being that incompetent.
#+end_quote

Sure, but that scary stuff wouldn't necessarily lead to "there's a secret organization of criminals up to no good," which is what an investigation into Team Rocket would require. Even if he encounters criminals up to no good, that doesn't automatically mean conspiracy. And Red IS going to run into their plots and the symptoms/results of those plots, but he's not going to know from the beginning what's really behind them, and not just because there won't be people wearing black shirts with a big red R on them running around.

#+begin_quote
  Do you remember Quirrelmort invading Azkaban with Harry? Even though he was a super antagonist, his intended result when someone discovered them was to kill them. He was ok with that fuck up and saw it as normal. Till Harry stopped him. Even powerful antagonists make mistakes. People see them. You are proposing something beyond that, a murderous dangerous organization that no one knows about.
#+end_quote

I do remember that: I also remember that Quirrelmort told Harry he had intended to push the man out of the way if he didn't dodge on time, reasonably pointing out that if he'd really wanted to kill him, the would have done so immediately.

Of course maybe he was lying, but KNOWING how much he needed Harry's trust, there's no particular reason to think he was: it wasn't a mistake on Quirrelmort's part, it was a lack of trust on Harry's. Which of course still translates to a mistake on Quirrelmort's part for overestimating how much Harry would trust him and underestimating what, if anything, Harry could do about it if he suddenly didn't.

But it's still not a mistake the way you're painting it to be.

And again, for the third time at least: I'm not saying Team Rocket doesn't make mistakes. I'm saying I see no reason for your insistence that these mistakes be immediately crippling to their secrecy. Clearly they've already made one mistake we're aware of, one that took years to be recognized: if Dr. Fuji hadn't told Oak that he was working on a new project, it would be harder for Oak to conclude that he had been recruited to something, rather than dropping out of his work altogether.

#+begin_quote
  I note how, despite my requests, you didn't reveal any real life criminal organizations that murdered people and abducted people without being discovered. Could you name some, proving your point?
#+end_quote

Even putting aside what relatively few CIA and other national intelligence agency operations have come to public light, since we're talking about criminals: The American Mafia?

With our modern hindsight, it seems like people have always known about the Mafia, and its major loss of power seems obvious. but the Mafia existed in some form for decades, and wasn't even recognized as such as massive criminal conspiracy until the late 1950s.

Obviously police knew that organized crime as a concept existed, but the extent and influence of their crimes took years to even become aware of, let alone investigate and prove. Until then, any time some operation was uncovered or criminal was arrested, they would simply be considered lone actor or at most part of a small crew.

And that's exactly what I mean by "Team Rocket makes mistakes, but those mistakes don't automatically mean their secrecy is blown." Say one of the engineers that they tried to coerce or kidnap (or whatever they did) fought back and was successful: do they necessarily know everything they need to to suspect a massive criminal conspiracy? Of course not: at most they might just be aware that someone had tried to kidnap or blackmail them. Even if the criminals were caught, a basic lie about their motivations and it's a closed case: not a giant red flag that there's a region-wide criminal organization behind the curtain.

So what's the cutoff point for you for Team Rocket getting away with hypothetical murder/kidnapping? 3 times is okay? 5 times? 10 times stretches credulity? How long do you think a secret can be kept? 3 years? 6? Because the Mafia got away with estimated hundreds over fifty years before a bunch of their leaders were found in a room together in 1957ish (Apalachin Meeting I think), which tipped police off of just how big an organization they were, and utterly changed the way law enforcement investigated and approached organized crime.

Providing any such concrete numbers would make your argument a bit more interesting, but without it you are simply asserting an extreme that's not only fairly easy to dismiss, but making assumptions about how long Team Rocket has existed and how many people, if any, it's killed or disappeared, AND its methods for disposing bodies without drawing suspicion.
