  Going to their home to commit the crime isn't a personal connection
#+end_quote

Your plan involved stalking them for a while, finding out where they live, the schedule of their movements, then going to their home at a particular time. That's pretty personal. It's also not what master hitmen do- they don't stick in one area for a long time.

It's not as personal as being friends with them, but it's still higher risk.

  "the person was investigating a crime" isn't an obvious motive
#+end_quote

It's a basic, ask their friends, "Did he have any enemies" sort of motive. "Yes, he was afraid of this criminal syndicate he was investigating that he got too close to."

I>t doesn't matter if some people think someone was murdered: if they have no suspects and no leads, that's called "getting away with murder."

They do have the people who stalked them, and the person who entered their house. If they live in an area without many accomplished hitmen, you have the strange foreigner hanging around the area and stalking a small child.

It's relatively easy to acquire more force than a person, but any time you try to be stealthy you are risking a lot more as it just takes one wrong glance to find you out.

  sighs But Oak DID say something like that: specifically he said that he figured Fuji just gave in to his depression and faded. That was the cover he had originally, and that's why Oak didn't suspect foul play.
#+end_quote

Fading away is a euphemism for dying, and you can easily learn about deaths by reading obituaries. People don't just disappear into the aether when they're sad.

So no, this isn't a cover story.

#+begin_quote
  Good, now you're getting it: taking statistics and twisting them to fit your narrative without considering specifics or contexts is a silly thing to do. So don't do it :P
#+end_quote

I did consider specifics and contexts, they just didn't really favor your side of the argument. Your twisting of statistics directly contradicted what the articles said.

#+begin_quote
  As I said above, I already have such a justification: you just didn't see it or recognize it. Which might be my fault as a writer, but you are the only person who seems to be making a big deal about it, so maybe not :P
#+end_quote

The top voted criticism of this chapter is that it's slow and boring (and irrelevant) and that the characters are annoying and depressed. This whole thing arose because people wanted a more exciting story where Red confronted criminals. My exact criticism is unique, like pretty much everyone else who has their own unique criticisms, but it's along the same line as others- it's more fun to see dramatic scenes and there are good reasons for you to write dramatic scenes.

#+begin_quote
  Not all are a perfect fit because their targets are so public (meaning even though they got away with it, obviously people noticed the end results, even if they had no idea who did it or how to catch them) but #6, #5, #3 and #2 from this list prove the basic point: you can find others online if you want.
#+end_quote

To be precise, none of them are a perfect fit. All of them were public crimes where it was clear what the motive was- steal something and sell it for money or notoriety.

That is what I am saying people in pokemon land could do. Observe the result crimes and deduce what had happened.

It would be best to avoid doing crimes that might expose the conspiracy by their results as such. For example, if Red was investigating them in a bad part of town, it might be better to kill him and make it look like a mugging than try to go to his house and kill him there. Make a clear and unambiguous motive.

#+begin_quote
  A drunk impulsive person wouldn't fall foul to all the risks you listed above, like "what if someone else comes in?" If you don't have the competency to mitigate something like that by shifting observers on a household to get a sense of the person's schedule and habits, you don't really deserve to be called a "competent criminal organization."
#+end_quote

Having a large number of people watching a person's house isn't very stealthy. It also increases the risk that someone will mess up, by involving more people.

There's no real easy to avoid the prongs of this issue. The more you watch someone, the more risk your watchers will be found out. The less you watch someone, the more risk your kill will have. You can try to find a good compromise but it's always going to be risky, and have a substantial risk of something going wrong and exposing you.

  Now you're just being ridiculous. "Several walls?" How about none.
#+end_quote

I don't know how hard your hitmonlee is kicking, or for how long given its extendable legs. Presumably pretty hard, if they're killing with one hit.

#+begin_quote
  Most of the force of the kick is absorbed by the body (otherwise it wouldn't do much damage), and the remainder is what sends them flying back.
#+end_quote

Well, it can do damage and send them flying back. Send a compression wave through a person's body, shaking about their bones, spin their head.

#+begin_quote
  A kick to break a wall might be possible because of how concentrated the force is in a specific area, but unless the wall is made of cardboard, a body is far softer than the wall, and has enough surface area that it's just going to bounce. Maybe there'll be a crack where the head or pelvis hits, but nothing noticeably "human body shaped."
#+end_quote

I was thinking of one of a modern Japanese wall. They often just have a fairly thin wooden wall, which breaks pretty easily.

Still, with a hit powerful enough to kill someone in one blow, you may well get a hole, especially if the wall stops their blow.

#+begin_quote
  Also, Force = Mass x Acceleration. Smaller body = less force.
#+end_quote

Actually, mass1*acceleration

So the hitmonlee has a certain mass and acceleration. They will impart this acceleration to whatever they hit, which will have the same force. The greater the mass of the object it hits, the less it will accelerate.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe someone looks at it and says "Foul play!" but far more likely is the understanding that sometimes, walls have cracks.
#+end_quote

Since he is a kid, and lives with his parents, they would likely remember any cracks.
