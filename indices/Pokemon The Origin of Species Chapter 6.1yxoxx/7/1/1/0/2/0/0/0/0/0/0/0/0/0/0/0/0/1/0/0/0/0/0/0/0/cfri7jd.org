  At this point we're assuming someone is investigating, not just a murder/disappearance, but a criminal investigation. There's no particular reason for them to do so in most cases, as we've agreed that even if someone suspects murder/kidnapping, that doesn't mean there's a conspiracy.

  But let's say they do think it's a conspiracy: the only reason to kill them is if they actually unearth information. Having a lone conspiracy theorist out there isn't a big deal: clearly there are a number, for Oak to have heard of some of them. Most are probably completely off, but some might be right.
#+end_quote

At this point, your position has substantially softened from your initial one. As such, Red could investigate their crimes and see some stuff and not be killed. He would simply be seen as a conspiracy nut. That is definitely something that would be fun for people to see.

#+begin_quote
  So how to murder someone in the pokemon world? Depends: do they live alone? If they do, sneak into their house while they're not home, wait for them in their bedroom with your Hitmonlee, and the second they walk through the door, order a kick strong enough to shatter stone. Chances of survival upon contact are negligible, and even if you survive, you're a broken mess, ready for a finishing blow.
#+end_quote

Assumptions.

They are the first person to come in, not a friend or family member or a pokemon.

They don't hear the person inside the house. This is a very unreliable thing- they may have ultra sensitive hearing or smell, or have a pokemon with ultra sensitive hearing or smell. They may even have a zubat, which sees with ultrasound.

They are the first one in their room. If their pokemon goes in first there will be problems.

Their security systems don't warn them, neighbors don't see them enter.

Their pokemon doesn't leave any marks when they kill the person and are silent. If they smash up the person's house or leave it splattered with blood or make a massive noise they are likely to draw attention. This is why I was assuming you would use a less physical pokemon. This would be a bloody, noisy attack, and very reliant on luck. I wouldn't expect it to have a high success rate.

Those are a lot of ifs that you can't really control for easily.

If they are really unlucky and did that to Red, they might meet Oak.

Who in a cut fight, had the strongest pokemon in generation one.

There's also the forensic issue of pokemon. It will look very weird that their pokemon haven't been beaten up.

#+begin_quote
  Now you put their body in a commonly used box for Containers, absorb the body, and clean up whatever evidence there might be. If you want them to "disappear," drop the Container into the ocean.
#+end_quote

A person has mysteriously vanished, and a white middle/upper class kid too, which will likely spark a manhunt.

#+begin_quote
  If you want their murder to be known, go to a secure, private location (where you can easily clean up any mess) and have your Nidorino (or Arcanine, or Graveler, or whatever) savage the body a bit: crush or bite their head off, trample/chew on their body a bit. Now bring the body to some nearby area where Nidorino/Arcanine/Graveler/etc are found and release the body.
#+end_quote

Fine, except for the smashed/ indented wall in their house, which the hitmonlee kicked them into, the large amount of blood sprayed everywhere which their forensics turns up despite scrubbing, and the decaying corpses of the mother and prof oak who wandered into that room along with the explosions and damage of the home from his fight with them, and his missing friends (see-canon) who died along with him when they came home with him.

This was why I was assuming you'd use a less physical pokemon. Melee confrontations are risky. There are a lot of things that could go wrong with your plan.

#+begin_quote
  That was actually sarcasm >.> Sorry, it was a moment of exasperation and dwindling patience. My actual response is it's far more likely that they simply have one of their associates buy the house or apartment themselves.
#+end_quote

If someone had explicitly said that, that when they called the person's house the person said 'This person moved, they are not there anymore, they moved to x place' that would be a lot less suspicious than them just vanishing. There would be a cover story for them that was entirely plausible.

#+begin_quote
  Okay, but I still think you're heavily overestimating how social everyone must be, or heavily underestimating how little strangers take note of strangers. Again, I'm not saying they could get away with it every time, but about 2300 people go missing a day in our world, and not all of them are ever found.
#+end_quote

You are misusing the data.

#+begin_quote
  For example, the federal government counted 840,279 missing persons cases in 2001. All but about 50,000 were juveniles, classified as anyone younger than 18.
#+end_quote

So, the vast majority of missing cases are angsty teenagers. Older males, engineers and scientists vanishing, is much rarer and so is statistically distinct.

Of those who aren't young people.

#+begin_quote
  About four out of 10 missing adults are white, three of 10 black and two of 10 Latino.
#+end_quote

A lot are racial minorities.

#+begin_quote
  elderly citizens suffering from dementia make up other significant subgroups of missing adults.
#+end_quote

Or people suffering from dementia, which these scientists presumably weren't, since they are being recruited for some evil scheme.

So it would be weird. People do take note of rich/middle class people vanishing.

#+begin_quote
  Definitely an interesting idea though, so thanks for bringing that up :)
#+end_quote

You're welcome.

#+begin_quote
  my Hitmonlee hit his chest and head with the killing kicks? Better make sure my Nidorino particularly savages those parts, so there's all the original damage is overriden by the new one (or the flesh removed altogehter).
#+end_quote

I'm not sure this would be something you'd need to do. Nidorino can learn tackle and double kick, which would look like this. My main issue with this plan is the high level of luck it requires, and the blood stains coating the cracked wall of their house.

#+begin_quote
  and secondly the description doesn't even imply that you could see through things with it: it just happens to be called "x-ray specs" for no particular reason.
#+end_quote

From what I can read, the implication is that when you are in a dungeon with walls you can see in all directions as though there were no walls, hence you seeing all trainers and items.

Anyway, while they are in slightly separate canon, they did have an anime episode. They are a useful guide as to how the creators see the pokemon world technology.
