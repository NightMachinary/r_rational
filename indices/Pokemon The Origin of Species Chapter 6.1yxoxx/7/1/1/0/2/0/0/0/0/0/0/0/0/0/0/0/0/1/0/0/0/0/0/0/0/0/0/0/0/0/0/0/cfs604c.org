  Those were the comments that sparked them.
#+end_quote

Yes, those were honest questions, and I gave my honest answers. Neither commenter followed up, which leads me to believe they accepted those answers and that reasoning.

#+begin_quote
  Your many, many contrived reasons why no one can investigate team rocket without dying are a commonly complained issue
#+end_quote

And your many, many contrived reasons and terribly skewed and spun data for why Team Rocket can only be competent in the specific way that you define as competent, not to mention that anyone not being able to stop them is "holding the idiot ball," all the while strawmanning and dismissing any other interpretation, is simply not making your case.

#+begin_quote
  people want to see violence, feel fear, see crime. The chapter would be a lot better with more of that
#+end_quote

The first part of this is a major assumption on your part. The vast majority of feedback I've gotten says the opposite, so I hope you'll excuse me if I don't follow specifically your preferences as opposed to all of theirs :)

#+begin_quote
  and less of "I am sad my husband died."
#+end_quote

These criticisms I accepted and agreed with, as previously mentioned. The arguments and criticism presented by anakiri and others were reasonable and convincing, which is why I spent a few hours rewriting the chapter. Simply put, yours have not been.

#+begin_quote
  You have given team rocket a death star without giving frodo a lightsaber.
#+end_quote

Sorry, but in this analogy you've seen the first 5 minute of star wars and are already complaining about why Luke doesn't have a lightsaber. Maybe stop jumping to conclusions, basing your arguments off strawmen, and in general acting like you know better than anyone how everything works?

I can't even argue most of your points, because I'm intent on keeping it all hypothetical to avoid spoilers, and you're intent on using each and every possible hint of uncertainty as proof positive that your perspective is the only possible one.

To call it arrogant would be overstating things: in truth you honestly just seem oblivious of it.

#+begin_quote
  And that doesn't make for a very fun story. It's boring seeing Oak not know what is happening and not try to do much to find out.
#+end_quote

And again, you are basing all this off of... the very first chapter that they're mentioned, as a passing possibility of potential concern.

You can insist all you wish what story you'd rather read, and what story others may rather read. Obviously you know your preferences best, and no doubt there are others who may agree with you.

But it's not the majority of the feedback I've gotten, at all. And you are singular in your insistence that the hints of Team Rocket that have been revealed so far are unrealistic or boring: most people have expressed interest and anticipation. I can link to their comments if you'd like, but really, I think I've spent enough time trying to convince you of something you seem intent on not being open minded about.

/shrugs/ Don't really know what else there is to say. I'm sorry if the story as it's been so far is not the story you'd like to read. Hopefully you still find smething to enjoy in it, but "11 year old Red vs Team Rocket" is not and has never been the story I intend to tell.
