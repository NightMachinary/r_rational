  Again, this is assuming the danger is clearly known from the outset, and the Rocket of my world is not that obvious.

If he discovered their existence, presumably he'd have some knowledge that they do crimes, such as kidnapping. Because people who kidnap are scary he would feel some emotional fear of getting close.

  Getting into the area would be pretty improbable: far easier to kill them before they get to that point, when they're still snooping around to find it.
#+end_quote

They would still, presumably, be asking questions about the right sort of thing, and so someone investigating their death would realize that they repeatedly searched some scientist's name before their death or something.

#+begin_quote
  Again relying on the incompetency of the antagonists to propel the plot.
#+end_quote

Actually, it's more relying on the basic competency of people in general.

You are proposing a group with a 100% success rate in something, murder, and are arguing to me that anything less than a 100% success rate would indicate that they have the idiot ball. When I propose that other groups would have basic competency (e.g. they would autopsy bodies), you argue against that basic competency. I could challenge your points on technical grounds such as how destroying evidence is evidence of its own, but there is one other point that is more important. This is reading a lot like a mary sue character. They twist the world to make no one discover their evil ways, are perfect, and are apparently the real protagonist of the story.

And perfect characters aren't very fun. It would be a lot more fun to see a rational character interact with them and display some basic competency (which may mean not doing more than the most surface of investigations) than to hear about how their crimes are perfect and undetectable.

  willing to kill people who threaten their health and safety and freedom?
#+end_quote

Killing people is psychologically hard, and it takes seconds to speed dial the police. So again- you have a perfect villain who makes everyone around them incompetent.

#+begin_quote
  Once again: Secret. Organization.
#+end_quote

One who takes actions which aren't very secret, and just secrets away any problems.

Beggars disappearing is easy to conceal. Respectable members of the middle and upper classes is harder to conceal.

  If only they'd had access to an interlude...
#+end_quote

Then they'd probably have the same issue we have- they want to learn about the Manhattan project, not about how incompetent everyone but the Manhattan project is.
