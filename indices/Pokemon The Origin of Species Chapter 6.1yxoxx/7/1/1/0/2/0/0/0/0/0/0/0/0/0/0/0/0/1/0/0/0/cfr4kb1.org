  One of these days you're going to learn the difference between generalized statistics and specific circumstances, but someone who has the intent to kill you is not going to shoot you once, then sit back and watch you slowly bleed out and perhaps call the police while you're at it.
#+end_quote

And someone who is shot once isn't going to stick around to be shot again. They're going to run away, bring out pokemon. That was my original issue with your argument. You were assuming only the criminals could be competent. The people they attack couldn't be competent and try to dodge the attacks.

That isn't what research on hitmen says happens. A lot of them bungle it or fail to do it (as I said, killing people is hard) and those that do it often do it in public. The best generally come in from another region and do it, and have few ties to the region. If you stay in one area to scope someone out you're more likely to get caught.

#+begin_quote
  That was actually what I was always describing, as I have noted multiple times now: you were simply getting caught up in the optimistic perspective that most crimes are solved and solvable and Justice Finds a Way :P
#+end_quote

It's not really optimism, just statistics.

#+begin_quote
  The entire medical infrastructure and emergency response vehicle system, with trained EMTs capable of helping someone survive an injury until they reach the ER, exists exactly because it helps people survive things like gunshot wounds.
#+end_quote

And that's great for them, though it doesn't really address my point that if people can survive to the hospital, they can survive to make a phone call.

#+begin_quote
  Please just admit you were drawing incorrect conclusions from logic and data that do not apply to the specific situations referred to by this conversation, because at this point you're just sounding silly. I won't think less of you if you say "Yeah, I guess that is a different situation than I had in mind," but this rigid clinging to your overgeneralized conception of mortality rates in the face of deliberate hitmen is making me suspect that you simply enjoy arguing more than you do having an intellectually honest discussion.
#+end_quote

You don't really have any special intellectual credit over me- you are just saying "Hitmen are always or mostly successful" without actually referring to the research on them.

Likely because the research also shows a reasonable failure rate for hitmen too.

#+begin_quote
  Sounds like a stupid criminal to me.
#+end_quote

The issue is that the pokemon that are especially good at killing don't necessarily frequent the locations you are suggesting. For example, you seem to be getting very annoyed at me for saying that the solve rate for rural murders in high when most people live in cities, but at the same time you're saying that these hitmen are going to kill their victims in the wild where pokemon live, aka a rural area. Wild pokemon don't tend to exist much in the cities. Most wild pokemon are often not great at killing anyway (otherwise people would avoid that region) and so if a hitman wants to kill someone in the wild they would have to use a more effective pokemon from another region, which would show up on the autopsy.

#+begin_quote
  Right, and they'd find the body killed by pokemon.
#+end_quote

Killed by pokemon that are very good at killing, and probably aren't native to that region.

#+begin_quote
  "Most of the world" =/= "where most people live," and again you are jumping to conclusions to fit your hypothesis.
#+end_quote

You're suggesting they kill them in a city (where most people live), and then take their body to a rural area where wild pokemon attack and dump it?

That sounds quite high risk. A lot of camera around, and people would know that the person was in the city. It would look incredibly unnatural.

#+begin_quote
  Huge oversimplifications that you just made aside: in our world being the key difference that you insist on ignoring when convenient for your argument :)
#+end_quote

And in your world, the mary sue organization is much more successful :)

And improved technology only works for them, no one else can benefit.

Hence why I am challenging you. I'd prefer to see hyper competent police and criminals, not just hyper competent criminals. It's annoying seeing people hold the idiot ball.

#+begin_quote
  You're really still insisting that when someone is told they need to kill someone, and they study their schedule and movements with the intent to quickly kll them and then hide the evidence, they need to "work up" to it on the scene, maybe "beat them up" a little.
#+end_quote

Have you actually read up on any accounts of real life criminals, or hitmen, or murderers?

Hitmen do have a high failure rate, so working up to it is easier.

It's also good to avoid killing, because killing has a high failure rate, and is often discovered.

#+begin_quote
  Children and partner folks! Unconnected scientists who have children and partners! Yep! That's what that word means!
#+end_quote

Do you remember what you wrote in your chapter? He lost his daughter, and his wife divorced him. So they can have children and he has an ex wife, who may well want his home if he dies. He could easily have had other children, or children that abandoned him. If not, he could have siblings who didn't talk to him much.

#+begin_quote
  So let's just agree to disagree, because if you have such a naive and simpistic view of how crimes work, and are so bad at applying new information to generalizations that you honestly believe a hitman with specific purpose wouldn't stick around and ensure a swift kill of their target, we have nothing further to discuss: we're just living on two different planets for how logic and reasonable hypotheticals work.
#+end_quote

I really think you should read up on actual hitmen. It would help a lot.

#+begin_quote
  I'm exaggerating your argument now, by the way, because it's rather ridiculous, and I'm tired of debunking it again and again and having you insist that the law of averages will always side in the favor of your hypotheticals.
#+end_quote

Debunking it would require you actually making some arguments against it that were coherent- e.g. the solve rate for crimes is much lower in the cities, so they could kill people in the cities more easily.

But then you forget other parts of your argument, like that they have to be killed by wild pokemon who live in the wild.

They might get away with it some number of times, I just wouldn't describe them as competent if murder was their go to tool for solving problems. Their competency is an implied attribute rather than something we see in the story.

#+begin_quote
  Utility companies are so hard to fool, I'll tell you what! Their Super Secret Criminal Conspiracy Radar would go off the second a bill is paid late: No way a competent crime organization would forsee and take care of something like that!
#+end_quote

So they are paying the utility bill after they vanish? That's also evidence.

#+begin_quote
  Which is why Oak had multiple guesses, and didn't automatically believe the third. Next!
#+end_quote

Other people would likely also be competent and realize what had happened, and other scientists and engineers, being afraid for their lives due to the obvious evidence of people vanishing, would beef up their security measures.

#+begin_quote
  Not the argument :) Next!
#+end_quote

As I've said, I have no issue with the conspiracy remaining hidden, just with people vanishing and no one realizing, or people being murdered without being discovered.

#+begin_quote
  You surely did make that connection in your multiple disparate threads of argument a number of times.
#+end_quote

No, I just said that people would discover that scientists were vanishing, likely due to criminal activity.

#+begin_quote
  Pokemon are more lethal than guns, and the technology to hide evidence is far more powerful.
#+end_quote

And medical tech is better (e.g. magic healing sprays), and the technology to discover evidence is far more powerful too. It is an arms race, and both sides have new advantages.
