  Contradiction. If it's obvious that he would die, then it would be irrational to investigate them.

You're assuming he would know that it was obvious when he started investigating.

  The obvious solution is for him to learn this, carefully try to investigate them without exposing himself, and see someone else who tried to investigate them get brutally murdered by pokemon, and then back off.

Sounds somewhat like an incompetent secret criminal organization to me, neh? An 11 year old boy finds out about them and gets close enough to witness something like that without being taken out himself?

The bottom line, from my perspective, is that my conception of an intelligent Team Rocket run by a real criminal mastermind is not one that would go around in the open doing dastardly deeds. The only reason Oak is suspicious of one is because he's in a unique position to have known one of the people affected (as implied in the chapter, they only target those that wouldn't be easily missed) and is in a position to have learned of other such disappearances.

Which isn't to say he's the ONLY person who suspects such an organization may exist, but he's one that's close to the protagonist :)
