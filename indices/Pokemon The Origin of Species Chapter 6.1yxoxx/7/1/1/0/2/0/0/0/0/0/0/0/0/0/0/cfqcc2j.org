I described several failure modes for the organization- discovery upon murder, investigation by police or private investigators, autopsies of killed people, the use of phones. Your response was basically to assume the worst possible investigation possible and blatant stupidity (e.g. not leaving notes behind when you go to investigate a dangerous criminal organization).

That is what you are doing- you are assuming the best of all possible worlds for your criminal organization, even as they risk themselves a lot, numerous times.

There is an obvious alternative. Have a front organization to deflect initial probes that doesn't openly murder people. The more you murder people, the more likely you are to make mistakes and have people die. A smart group would have other options.

  A limited group of scientists and engineers faded from public life about a decade ago, as implied in the story.
#+end_quote

Ah, I misread that. Still, back then, you'd expect these investigations to have been done.

#+begin_quote
  This is what I mean by you constructing strawmen and leaping to conclusions: you keep taking things I say and then extrapolating them in a way that implies your perspective the only reasonable one to hold.
#+end_quote

Actually, you are changing what the story says- no one can get in contact with them- so they did vanish en masse, in a group. That remains in your story. They didn't just fade from public life, they are impossible to contact now.

#+begin_quote
  "Apparently" being the key word. This organization has been hinted at by one person in the story, at the end of one chapter: jumping to the conclusions you have from that is entirely premature.
#+end_quote

That is why people investigate these things and find out more. Then apparently get murdered.

#+begin_quote
  People who would investigate could be murdered, as I've said. Which is why Red investigating them and surviving would be a pretty poor story for a realistic fiction, and your points of "well he could get away by enemy incompetence" or "it's hard for people to feel a killer instinct" are just not compelling arguments that this wouldn't be making the enemies needlessly incompetent, for no other reason than to force Red into a part of the story he has no reason to be involved in yet.
#+end_quote

With the lack of a killer instinct, that would be a rational thing. If you avoid killing lots of people then you risk your organization less. It is useful for most.

It's not really incompetence to not have perfect surveillance of everything. People see weird things all the time. They would presumably keep the worst of it behind closed doors, but he could find some scary stuff that would scare him off without them being that incompetent.

#+begin_quote
  It's not about the police force being incompetent either: that's like saying the Aurors or the Order of the Phoenix is just incompetent because they didn't stop Voldemorte. The whole point of having a threatening over-arching antagonist is that the status quo isn't able to handle them, however competent.
#+end_quote

Do you remember Quirrelmort invading Azkaban with Harry? Even though he was a super antagonist, his intended result when someone discovered them was to kill them. He was ok with that fuck up and saw it as normal. Till Harry stopped him. Even powerful antagonists make mistakes. People see them. You are proposing something beyond that, a murderous dangerous organization that no one knows about.

#+begin_quote
  any way you try to slice it, a criminal organization that can't effectively kill a child without revealing itself is utterly incompetent
#+end_quote

I note how, despite my requests, you didn't reveal any real life criminal organizations that murdered people and abducted people without being discovered. Could you name some, proving your point?
