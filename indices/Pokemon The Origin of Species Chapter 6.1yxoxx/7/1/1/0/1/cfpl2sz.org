  Because unlike the video games, in the world I have in mind an inexperienced 11 year old trainer would meet a swift end if he really started poking around to find a secret criminal organization's hideout :)

Maybe Rational!Red could be smart enough to realize this?

I love the scene in HPMOR were Harry tells McGonagall about the spell on the Sorting Hat and what he would do if he would discover the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

If Red would similarly decide not to stick his nose too far into the whole Team Rocket business, I think it could be both funny and an interesting chance to discuss rationality.
