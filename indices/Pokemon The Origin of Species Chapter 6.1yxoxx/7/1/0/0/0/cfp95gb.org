  It has Lung and Bakuda in it, two of the best characters in Worm, Lung for his tension-enhancing power and Bakuda for her clear, vibrant tone in a story that is too grey and flat.

This is purely subjective: I liked Lung, but Bakuda was nowhere near what I'd consider one of the "best characters in Worm." She was bland and stereotypical and predictable, and I much preferred interludes with Armsmaster/Defiant and Dragon, whose character arcs I think were beautifully written even through just a few interludes spread out over the story.

  It has an actual self-contained story and isn't just minor characters spoiling the plot because the author has too much freedom.

I think you're confusing "spoiling the plot" and "setting up the plot in a way people might be able to predict." Without any set up at all, many of these plot points, when they arrive, would seem completely out of nowhere and arbitrary, like a fired Chekhov's gun that appeared nowhere earlier in the script. There's a careful balance between surprising your audience with a plot twist and pulling a scooby-doo plot twist that there's absolutely no way they could have seen coming. I don't know about you, but the latter angers me as a reader :P

Without a common reference pool it's hard to draw good examples, but we could use my own story, as it would be a good learning experience for me: what do you believe I've spoiled from my story from this chapter?

  Bakuda is trying to bust out of the prison. That's the plot. It's an actual story. A character is trying to do something

I'm not denying that interludes as self-contained short stories aren't engaging, I'm saying limiting oneself to only those types of interludes is like leaving a tool in your toolbox. I'm not quite sure how you're distinguishing between an "interlude" and just having perspective shifts every few chapters, like many books do. Those shifted chapters are often part of their own character arcs and are still related to the main plot, but you seem to be saying that any deviation from the main character that isn't a self-contained plot is unnecessary. I couldn't disagree more.

I know you've said that publishing authors would be forced to cut more than web-serial authors, and in many respects that's true, but I'd argue whether that's always necessarily better. If you've read The Stand by Stephen King, you might be aware that there are two version, the originally published, and the uncut version released years later with a lot of extra content King couldn't originally include due to publisher limits.

The original is about 800 pages I believe. The uncut is over 1100. Some people like the cut version better: perhaps you would be one of them. To most though, reading the cut version is like watching the non-Extended Lord of the Rings movies : a streamlined bit of entertainment that's missing the details and character development that fills out the heart and soul of the story.
