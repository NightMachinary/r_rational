Or imagine if we were getting chapters from HPMOR's Quirrell or Lucius Malfoy's perspective. Or even Dumbledore--there's a reason it's usually McGonagall when important things are being discussed. We get brief scenes from Snape's perspective, but they're a) brief and not meant to be a full chapter and b) serve to add another layer of meaning and significance to a storyline that has /already begun/ and /can exist on its own without those scenes/.
