  Think of it this way: suppose that at some point in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix there was chapter from Voldemort's perspective that

  a) Had no tension, no action, nothing was happening, just Voldemort chatting with some people, and

  b) They were talking about Horcruxes.

  Wouldn't that have really sucked, added absolutely nothing to the 5th book, and made the 6th book worse?

Yes it would. Unfortunately for your argument, this analogy is in no way comparable :)

  but you'll notice that /no author uses them the way they're used in Worm or this fic./

I'm sorry, but you're just wrong there. As I mentioned, Stepehen King is one of the most successful authors in the world, and he regularly switches perspectives from main characters during most of his stories. And Goerge RR Martin does this as well, devoting whole chapters to characters we've never seen before and sometimes never see again, just to give us an added bit of worldbuilding, a new perspective, or foreshadow something from the plot.

Many authors do this. I understand that you personally dislike it, but implying that all authors "know better" or that it's a universally, objectively bad thing is just not supportable.

  in a way that just serves to undercut and reduce the impact of the natural development of the story from the protagonists' perspective is a bad idea.
#+end_quote

Implying that there is one "natural" way for a story to progress when you don't even know what that story is seems a bit rash :)

Also, you still haven't mentioned what you believe this interlude spoils, and I'm starting to feel like if I hadn't used the word "interlude" your objection would be far less vehement.
