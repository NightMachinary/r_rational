Think of it this way: suppose that at some point in /Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/ there was chapter from Voldemort's perspective that

a) Had no tension, no action, nothing was happening, just Voldemort chatting with some people, and

b) They were talking about Horcruxes.

Wouldn't that have really sucked, added absolutely nothing to the 5th book, and made the 6th book worse?

You make it sound like these interlude things are a necessary or just useful tool, but you'll notice that /no author uses them the way they're used in/ Worm /or this fic/. Because spending a chapter /not telling a story/ in order to give ham-fisted exposition /before that information is even interesting/ in a way that just serves to undercut and reduce the impact of the natural development of the story from the protagonists' perspective is a bad idea.
