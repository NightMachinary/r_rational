Hooray, the voice of dissent!

Okay, so I can understand this perspective, but it's one I personally don't agree with at all :) More of something I love is more of something I love, and while obviously I'll have preferences of some parts of a story or characters over others, the whole is made stronger by all of its parts. I don't think extra characterization or world building are ever unnecessary, as long as the writing and story and world are compelling.

Of course, there's the crux of the matter: I'm no Stephen King or GRRM, so maybe I just wasted everyone's time with a badly written interlude that most people will find boring. But that's more my failing than the nature of interludes as a concept.

I do feel these interludes are integral to the story though, which means if I've got readers who find them boring and unnecessary, then I'm doing something wrong, and I need to figure out what it is.

  As it is, web fiction authors tend to use these "interludes" to...fill space? Provide "bonus" content?

Maybe the latter, but not at all the former. Writing is /hard./ I've never met a writer that wanted to spend hours of their life just "filling space." If they write something, it's because they think it's important, even if they get it terribly wrong.

But it's not always just "bonus content" either. Stories written from only one perspective inevitably suffer, I feel, from bias and limited scope.

The whole point of writing from more than one character's perspective is to provide another view on the events and world that the first character wouldn't notice or care about, which should, when done well, make the story feel more "real."

One of the many reasons HPMOR feels so much more "real" than the canon Harry Potter series is that it jumps to other perspectives. And not consistently either: EY doesn't use the word "interlude," but there are clear instances where we are basically getting a one-shot perspective from a character who may be important, but not important enough to be a "main character."

Even stories from one perspective that I love, like the Dresden Files, I feel are improved by added perspectives. My favorite Dresden File short stories are the ones from Thomas and Murphy and Marcone's perspectives, because no matter how much you love Harry, the wise-cracking wizard's voice can get old after awhile. Staying in only his head can start to feel repetitive: you begin to already anticipate what he's going to think for a given situation, how he'll react to a bit of information. New characters can refresh the whole world by giving you new eyes to look at it through, and while these examples are "complete stories" as you mentioned, the could have been just as effective in the main Dresden File books as lone chapter shifts if it didn't happen to be written from a first-person perspective.

So all that said, in my case specifically, I wrote this interlude because there's just too much about the world and story to tell from Red's perspective. If I don't occasionally jump to others' perspectives, getting some of this information would require incredibly convenient happenstances or drastic shifts in narrative tone.

Furthermore, it's hard to foreshadow from one character's perspective when you intend that character to be intelligent: there's just no way I can imagine Rational!Red would hear about certain things during the normal course of his adventure, and even if he did, the rational response would be to immediately begin investigating them until he figured them out, which means I would have to put artificial barriers in his way to make him give up and go back to moving the story at a decent and coherent pace.

Instead, this way there's the main story arc of Red's adventures, but I can flesh out the world he lives in and its various layers while also introducing some of the other major characters that won't necessarily be with Red throughout his journey, because they're part of the wider story arc.

Does any of that make sense?
