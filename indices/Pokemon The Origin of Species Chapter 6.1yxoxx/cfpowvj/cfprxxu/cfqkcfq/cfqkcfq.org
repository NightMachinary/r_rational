Reading this kinda ruined it for me. As I see it, the "energy" pokemon are converted to /obviously/ is not electricity or heat or momentum or something, but rather about as stable and dense and useless as matter, and only qualifies is it in the sense that matter does, not the common usage. If these also tend to self assemble into their original configuration with only a little nudging needed to make sure the crystallization only starts in one place and isn't mirrored or something, it solves all the problems.
