Yes but I'm saying that if it was capable of taking the matter then spawning it without retaining heat like:

#+begin_quote
  Wouldn't they come out inert, which would be dangerously cold for most living things?
#+end_quote

That wouldn't happen. It wouldn't come out inert, it would come out and not exist in the way we know, because if you can't make the atoms move then you can't make the electrons (or anything else) move.

But if you can make electrons move, and thereby not destroying the structure of the atom and making it collapse, then where would the difficulty arrive in moving the whole atom?
