My understanding of body heat is that it comes from a different mechanism than merely the acceleration of atoms, but at the same time I know that ultimately that's what all heat boils down to, so I'm not really sure what distinction I'm trying to draw :P Can you help me understand how the two are related or how the distinction is irrelevant?
