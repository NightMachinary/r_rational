Generation of body heat is certainly different from heat, in that you are correct that it requires molecular processes and the such.

However, that's not my point.

My point is that dealing with molecular processes is the least of your worries if you understand me. When Oak says that they managed to do it before but couldn't retain the heat that doesn't really make sense.

Because if they couldn't retain the heat it was because they couldn't retain the movement of atoms (since if they could all the molecular processes would still be going and generating heat, never mind ambient heat).

But if they couldn't retain the movement of atoms then how would they be able to retain the movement of electrons (and all the other things that happen in an atom)? (and when we get down to it this issue happens with molecules and atoms too when they stop moving because even solids vibrate)

And if they couldn't retain the movement of electrons then the atomic structure is going to collapse, and instead of getting something that is cold, you get something that no longer resembles anything coherent (I'm not actually sure what would happen if an electron lost all movement, a quick google gets this [[http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080826080342AAiT67G]]).

On the principle of the thing, why can't they retain the heat? Why do the processes stop?

I hope I did that well enough
