I don't like Laura. It's sad her husband died, but that keeps interrupting her other thoughts, to the point where I'd recommend therapy. She worries about him more than she worries about Red, and she doesn't even seem have have any good thoughts about the guy!

I could understand "The house hadn't felt this empty since Tom's death."

I could understand "Red had been so excited about becoming a professor - some of his father's zeal coming through."

What you've got is "Red had been so excited about becoming a professor. It reminded Laura of losing her husband. She'd worked as a reporter once. It reminded her of her husband, who she lost. Sam had always been a good friend to the family. Like when Laura lost her husband. The death of Sam's daughter had been so sad. Maybe Laura could have avoided losing her husband. She thought about how her only living child is doing out in the wilderness - it made her miss her lost husband."

Christ, girl. Worse, this is /the only thing I know about her/. It's the only notable character trait I've seen. She talks about other things, but missing her husband is the only thing she /does/.

Daisy is worse. She doesn't do anything. She just provides pages and pages of meaningless small talk. She steers the conversation through school and taxes and she has so much screen time, and it feels like none of that is going to pay off. As soon as something interesting happens - Koga's deflecting allegations that he might be what? It's common knowledge that a storm might signal an attack? What's that about? - the plot drops that significant exposition in favor of taking us back to Daisy's small talk! Daisy is a /vampire/.

This is kind of a problem throughout. The key things I took away from this chapter: Containers exist. Laura misses her husband (more than she misses her son). Daisy prattles on for an eternity. Laura will be traveling as a reporter. Foreboding storm all the characters know about but I don't. Something is going on with a mysterious Dr. Fuji. Those last three points are actually interesting, but they have next to no screen time compared to the character development that makes me hate everyone.

I'm also not really feeling the worldbuilding in this chapter. The Container is fair enough. But I'm expected to think that a million million megajoules of mass is the easy part, but ten megajoules of thermal energy is supposed to give me pause? Either their mass-energy conversion factor is different from ours (possible, but not shown), or that actually makes the world make /less/ sense.

There's talk of Pokemon on the news, which makes sense. Pokemon are immensely important. So much so that it should be really difficult to write a chapter where the only Pokemon that actually appears is a cooked bird! Is there a compelling reason Laura didn't wait at an intersection for a passing /rhyhorn/? Or why Oak doesn't have a tangela around trained to grab the dishes? Laura stops to chat with neighbors on her way - is there no friendly neighborhood raticate? (Why no, there's nothing unusual about a friendly giant rat that can rip out the sidewalk, why would there be?) A news report about tentacool can't support the universe by itself.

As others have mentioned, there's some problem with the flow. I think a large part of that is that every little thing makes Laura think of Tom for no obvious reason, but there's lots of little things too. I think you need to take care to spell out exactly how characters' thoughts lead to one another, in general, on a moment-to-moment basis. It's also good form to isolate most related exposition into distinct chunks, unless you want me to think their mind keeps going back to it. So this chapter is... kinda weak all around.
