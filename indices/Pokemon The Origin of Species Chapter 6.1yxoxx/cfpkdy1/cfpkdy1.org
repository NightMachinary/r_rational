Thank you DaystarEld, like the previous installments, I really enjoyed this chapter.

I think the interlude is valuable if only for highlighting that the world does not revolve around the protagonists and that Red's mom has a life of her own. I found the characters sympathetic and enjoyed their conversation and the glimpses into the functioning of the pokemon world it offered.

I find the story about the rationalist trainer and his scientific exploration of the world of pokemon far more interesting than the more conventional crime and mystery stories that are being hinted at. So I hope the story's focus will remain on the former (I think it is interesting enough not to be made subservient to the Team Rocket storyline and also that it is far more unique).
