Definitely is, thanks! I'll see about reducing the awkwardness of some of the lines.

#+begin_quote
  Also, there are a few weird spots with "she'd" or "she had" where really is should probably be "she has" to fit with the present tense.
#+end_quote

Not necessarily :) It depends on what's being referred to, just like a past tense sentence sometimes has present tense, like "He ran for the door, heart hammering" instead of "He ran for the door, heart hammered."
