To give an example, the best interlude hands down in /Worm/ (up through arc 15), is the one from Canary's perspective. There are two reasons for this:

1. It has Lung and Bakuda in it, two of the best characters in /Worm/, Lung for his tension-enhancing power and Bakuda for her clear, vibrant tone in a story that is too grey and flat.

2. It has an actual self-contained story and isn't just minor characters spoiling the plot because the author has too much freedom. Bakuda is trying to bust out of the prison. That's the plot. It's an actual story. A character is trying to do something --> There are obstacles --> The character tries to get around the obstacles --> The character loses (in this case). As a result, it's an actual interesting read and one that doesn't even need to spoil the plot to hook the audience's attention.
