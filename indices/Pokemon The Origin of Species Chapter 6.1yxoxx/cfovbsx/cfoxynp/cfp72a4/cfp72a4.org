Switching perspectives is fine. That's different from...whatever these interludes are, exactly.

First of all, there's the problem that many of these interludes (I'm thinking /Worm/ and this) simply don't work as self-contained stories. But they're also not part of the ongoing narrative. As a result, they tend to lack any kind of real emotional impact (and the effect they have on the plot is even worse, but I'll get to that).

If you compare it to the interludes in Gaiman's /Sandman/, the interludes are all /really cool and interesting stories/. They work as standalone tales totally separate from what's going on in the main storyline, which isn't to say that they don't contain interesting and important information that is relevant to the main plot. The interludes in /Worm/, however, and apparently here as well, are more like unnecessary conversations between minor characters. It's...neat, in a DVD extras sort of way, but if you had to turn these web fictions into books, imposing a word and page limit, those interludes would get cut and cut fast, and the story wouldn't suffer in the slightest. /Sandman/, on the other hand, would be much poorer without the standalone stories.

Then there's the unfortunate effect the interludes have on the main plot, which is, they tend to /steal the main story's thunder/. I'm thinking specifically of the Slaughterhouse 9 interludes, which for the most part were totally unnecessary and /reduced the impact of the real introduction of the Slaughterhouse 9/. The author's choice to reveal the Nine's goals and powers in a way that was cut off from anything resembling tension or emotional engagement made it more or less impossible to /feel/ the Nine's arrival. Between that and Skitter's pwning of Mannequin, the Nine quickly lost the feel of being a particularly special or dangerous threat.

Two other problematic interludes have been the interlude from Alexandria's perspective in arc 15 (I think), and the interlude introducing Armsmaster reborn as Defiant from Triumph's perspective (also 15?). The former sets up a future plot point (presumably), but in a way that tells me most of the plot /before the actual plot has gotten to that point/. I am sure that when whatever Alexandria and the Doctor are up to becomes relevant, it will have much less impact than if the author himself hadn't gone out of his way to /spoil the plot/ for no benefit. The Triumph interlude, similarly, basically just spoils the arrival of Dragon and the impending battle between Coil's team and the local heroes + Dragon.

Then there's simply the issue of reducing the average quality of your work. I'm having trouble with this myself--by my estimate, I get to about 300-400 pages of writing in my [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-legend-of-korra-book-4-a-matter.286353/][LoK fic]] /before/ the first arc really even begins. This isn't because my world is that huge or my characters that complex. It's because nothing I've written is /so/ bad that it /demands/ to be cut. And since I'm not /compelled/ to cut by physical limitations, the result is a work that goes on for far too long, with character and plot development occurring very inefficiently and a low average quality even if there are good moments here and there. But at least I'll know to avoid the temptation of interludes. The format of web fiction makes it too easy to dilute one's own work.
