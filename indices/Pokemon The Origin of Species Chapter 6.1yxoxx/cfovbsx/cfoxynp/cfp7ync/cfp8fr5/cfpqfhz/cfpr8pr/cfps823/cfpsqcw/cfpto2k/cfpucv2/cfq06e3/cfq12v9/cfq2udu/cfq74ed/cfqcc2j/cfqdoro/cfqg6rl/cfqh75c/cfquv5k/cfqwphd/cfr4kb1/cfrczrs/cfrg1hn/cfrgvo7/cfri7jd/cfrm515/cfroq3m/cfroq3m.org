  I would argue this isn't a softening actually, as I definitely said early on that he would HAVE to investigate it if he saw something (which would eventually make him a threat) so I would have to artificially impede his progress to keep him in the "conspiracy nut" category, and I don't want to artificially do that.
#+end_quote

There are other ways. For example, you mentioned that the solve rate was lower in drug filled/ gang areas. The evidence for the crime could lead to one of those, and he could rationally decide, perhaps after a bad experience, that it was too dangerous for him to go into and investigate further.

#+begin_quote
  But you're asking an impossible task if you want me to prove that any crime possible in every potential situation can never be done perfectly
#+end_quote

It's not really that, it's that your crime idea is one of the riskiest crimes he could possibly do, and is incredibly different from what real world competent hitmen do. In story it is incredibly likely that it would go wrong- if his mother walked into his room or one of his friends walked up or if one of his pokemon got cold feet it would go very badly for everyone.

It is about as stealthy as leaving a mine on a sidewalk and hoping it kills him, except less so since the owner is there.

#+begin_quote
  I'm just arguing that it's probable, with a lot of effort and competency, to get away with murder.
#+end_quote

But their actions aren't competent- they are waiting in a somewhat public place for someone to come to them. This looks a lot more like one of those rural murders than a city murder. Like some angry partner waiting in the person's room with a shotgun, waiting to blow out the brains of whoever enters first.

#+begin_quote
  21% in Detroit, 22% in New Orleans. Fair of me to use those statistics instead of your 90%?
#+end_quote

If you follow the explicit conditions mentioned in those statistics, sure, that it is cities with a lot of drug and gang warfare.

They can't have any personal connection with the person (which means no going to their home) they can't have an obvious motive like that the person was investigating a crime, and both users have to be drug users/ gang members so the police probably don't care. It has to be a drive by pokemon shooting style kill.

Acceptable terms?

#+begin_quote
  You, again, for what, the fifth time now? Continue to use the word "vanishing." But now suddenly it's okay to have a cover story? You can't even admit that you didn't think of that possibility earlier? Nope, incompetent criminals can't get away with murder or kidnappings, gotta go for the most obvious and suspicious paths of crime.
#+end_quote

I did. I considered a way to do it. That you have the scientists supposedly recruited by an organization so that people would 'know where they were' just not be able to reach them due to bureaucracy. I didn't think you'd want suggestions.

It's great to have a cover story. The fact that the criminals didn't in your story, that he just vanished without anyone knowing where he went, was a sign of the gang's incompetence. If the gang was more competent Oak would have said something like "Yeah, everyone said he went to Unova to become a pokemon master. Poor guy. I think he finally snapped."

#+begin_quote
  Woah, woah, woah there, Happy McOptimism. Did you just dismiss hundreds of thousands of missing persons "angsty teenagers?"
#+end_quote

Unrelated, but no, I just called them angsty teenagers, since teenagers tend to be angsty.

That said.

#+begin_quote
  About half of the roughly 800,000 missing juvenile cases in 2001 involved runaways, and another 200,000 were classified as family abductions related to domestic or custody disputes.

  Only about 100 missing-child reports each year fit the profile of a stereotypical abduction by a stranger or vague acquaintance.
#+end_quote

The vast majority don't look hugely like them being sold into sex slavery, they look like family disputes. I'm not twisting data, it states that explicitly in the source.

Also, I doubt it's that common to sell old scientists into sex slavery. Your irrelevant diversion doesn't change my point- most of those who vanish in America are not the sort who vanish in your story, they are younger people.

#+begin_quote
  Which is only relevant because it means investigations are less enthusiastic for them, which falls into the "need to have probable cause to commit a full investigation," and "I haven't seen my old friend in a few years, last I heard he moved to another region but I can't find him" doesn't qualify.
#+end_quote

You should edit in this justification which you have just now come up with and are using to beat me over the head with as though it was your intention all along. It would make your story a lot more rational.

#+begin_quote
  ...you do know that assuming missing people are suffering from dementia is a plausible response to their disappearance, right? Meaning it's a perfectly rational reason for why the police wouldn't investigate someone like Dr. Fuji's case, especially if he'd lost his daughter, been left by his wife, and stopped returning contact with all his friends?
#+end_quote

More so if they actually had evidence. Fuji could have acted increasingly deranged in his later times when he was replaced by the Ditto or whatever, and Oak could mention that as a possible reason for him vanishing.

#+begin_quote
  In the limited reference pool you've just brought up for the sixth (seventh? I lost count) time ignoring the idea of only targeting people who wouldn't be missed, sure.
#+end_quote

When people do that they normally pick people with no reputable contacts in the world, like prostitutes and homeless people, or runaway kids. The sort who no one cares about People who are moderately wealthy inherently have contacts to the world which aren't easily removed even by being antisocial.

You can't just extend the "Serial killers can easily kill prostitutes" meme to middle class scientists with them just being antisocial.

[[http://boston.com/community/blogs/crime_punishment/2011/04/why_killers_target_prostitutes.html]]

?For a number of reasons, prostitutes are the most frequent victims targeted by serial murderers. Foremost is their easy accessibility to these predators. A sexual sadist can hunt the streets of the city or browse the ads on Craigslist, seeking out an available woman (and sometimes the man), looking selectively for the one who he finds most appealing, the one who can best satisfy his violent fantasies. And for money or drugs, the unfortunate prostitute will willingly participate in making his dream a reality, until it becomes too late to escape.

#+begin_quote
  From the killer's perspective, it is also psychologically easier to prey upon those he devalues. Seeing them as "sex machines," programmed to please, he feels little hesitancy or remorse. By dehumanizing his victims, he is killing someone that he views as beneath humanity.

  Most important, however, is that the killer who victimizes prostitutes can count on a slow response from law enforcement and minimal attention from the general public. Were he to abduct and kill some middle-class co-ed, the police response would be intense and immediate. But the disappearance of a known prostitute is not necessarily considered foul play, at least not until the remains of several victims are discovered in a remote dump site.
#+end_quote

Prostitutes have unique characteristics, like homeless people, that make them harder to investigate- a social stigma, high mobility, a lack of a home, the willingness to come to a particular location to be abducted- you can't emulate those characteristics just by making the scientist antisocial. He will still be a relatively respectable member of middle class Kanto who isn't normally mobile and isn't going to go to a crime filled area to be abducted, and who likely will have people being financially dependent on him.

#+begin_quote
  But luck can be mitigated against by planning
#+end_quote

Competency isn't a cure all magic band aid.

The more you plan and stalk a person to find out how to kill them, the more evidence there is that you were stalking them and trying to kill them. It's better to just kill them.

#+begin_quote
  which is why there are actually things like highly coordinated capers and heists that can go off without a hitch
#+end_quote

This would be a lot easier if you named these well publicized capers and heists that no one knew about till later. When I asked you before you just named the mafia and intelligence agencies that did crimes in the open but didn't reveal their hidden leadership. You didn't name any hidden crimes.

#+begin_quote
  Especially when you keep bringing up irrelevant "proof" like "X% of all murders, varying by region, including all the people who get drunk and shoot someone, or people who confess, or people who have absolutely no experience committing crimes and simply act on impulsive anger or jealousy, get caught, therefor it's improbable that your competent preplanned murders can do it without getting caught."
#+end_quote

I would understand it if you learnt from the lessons of master hitmen, and so got yourself in their reference class. Your suggested crime was basically to wait in their room with a loaded shotgun (loaded hitmonlee) and wait for the best. That is the kind of behavior of drunk impulsive people.

#+begin_quote
  Furthermore, you're assuming that he would kick the wall: why not just kick the person and cave their chest in? See how easy it is to play "what if?" from both sides?
#+end_quote

If you kick someone hard enough to cave their chest in they will fly back and smash into the wall or floor, depending on how powerful the kick was. They might smash through several walls of the house if it's a strong enough kick and they are a small kid who is much lighter than the normal people the pokemon kicks.
