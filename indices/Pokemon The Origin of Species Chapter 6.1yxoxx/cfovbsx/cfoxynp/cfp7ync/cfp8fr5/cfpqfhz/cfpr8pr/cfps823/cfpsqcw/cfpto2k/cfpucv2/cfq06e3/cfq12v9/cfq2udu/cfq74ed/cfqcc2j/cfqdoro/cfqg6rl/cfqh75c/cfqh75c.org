  discovery upon murder, investigation by police or private investigators, autopsies of killed people, the use of phones. Could you describe to me how any of these need gross stupidity?
#+end_quote

All of which require foreknowledge of conspiracy, which means the criminals did nothing to hide the conspiracy's existence. And you keep mentioning cell phones. I don't know why, presumably your cell phone has a nigh-magical auto-dial-on-event-of-life-endangerment, but as I've explained multiple times, having a cell phone is meaningless if you're killed before you can use it, which is why most people who are murdered do not call the police mid-murder.

#+begin_quote
  Because it has never happened.
#+end_quote

What has "never happened?" Killing people and not getting caught? An organization killing people and not being revealed? Seriously?

#+begin_quote
  1/6 , perhaps less, of gun injuries lead to death. Humans are tough to kill. The majority of people who are shot survive to tell their tale-a phone isn't even needed. Murdering people is hard.
#+end_quote

Gun injuries that we know of. Gun injuries where they receive medical attention, including gun accidents. Not gun injuries by hitmen, a far smaller sample with far higher mortality.

Furthermore, all of that is irrelevant, as I said before: no guns. There are a number of pokemon that are particularly good at killing people, and those are the kinds of pokemon competent criminals would use to kill someone.

#+begin_quote
  It would be higher for a rural area like pallet.
#+end_quote

What in God's green earth gives you the confidence to say "a rural area like pallet?" Why would they have killed someone from Pallet?

#+begin_quote
  So yes, it does stretch belief using murder and people not investigating much. There is a 9/10 chance they'll be found out by statistics.
#+end_quote

You just abused statistical interpretation so badly that I'm swiftly losing any interest in this conversation: you're not only twisting facts to suit your argument, you're not even doing it particularly well. Take the most forgiving statistics without controlling for variables and context, and use them to generalize against an entire slew of situations whose details you either make up or ignore?

#+begin_quote
  I never said anything like that. Please don't make things up.
#+end_quote

I really don't want to get into a "he said she said": I'm sorry if I've misunderstood or am mischaracterizing your argument, but it seems very much to me that you have indeed been saying something "like that" by implying numerous times that Red could investigate such a thing without getting killed, as it would be stupid of criminal organizations to kill children, even assuming they could muster up the killing instinct to do so.

#+begin_quote
  See earlier, statistics.
#+end_quote

Sorry, you spinning them in the most favorable way for your argument doesn't work against people who have actually studied the statistics even a little bit.

#+begin_quote
  I am not implying anything- people care where others are. If nothing else, they want to divide up their possessions. Once these people did vanish they would still make an effort to find them for money purposes, for friendship. If someone is missing you can't get their stuff easily.
#+end_quote

Once again, ignoring or forgetting the selective targeting of people who have no remaining social ties.

#+begin_quote
  That moment is generally just before they hear about the crime, which provides evidence to their existence.
#+end_quote

...what? They learn about a conspiracy before they hear about a crime? Do you actually think this way, that conspiracies are unearthed, not from the connection of crimes and information, but by thinking up a conspiracy first, and then fitting crimes to a preconceived theory? Where do you think that they hear about the conspiracy in the first place? Who tells them? Someone has to hypothesize it first.

You need to look into how actual police work is done, my friend.

#+begin_quote
  I might think that initially, but the centaur incident made me distrust him- it looked a lot like he killed him and made him into a blank eyed inferius. He could lie because he wanted harry to trust him. Either way, there would be evidence of his crime, a dead or unconscious auror. That is what crimes produce. Evidence.
#+end_quote

Crimes produce evidence, but not evidence that can be easily found, and not evidence that always points to clear answers.

#+begin_quote
  Unless he is a body double, that is his mistake. If he is a double, I mean with the high risk murders that fail most of the time and are cleared 90%+ of the time.
#+end_quote

You can't actually think that all murders are cleared 90% of the time. You just quoted statistics that say otherwise: not the ones in rural ares, where the vast minority of people live, but cities, where the majority of murders take place. You do know the difference between per-capita and flat statistics, yes? 90% of 100 is less than 40% of 3,000.

#+begin_quote
  Such as?
#+end_quote

MK Ultra, Iran Contra, dozens of WWII and gulf war activities... look it up :P

#+begin_quote
  That is exactly the sort of thing I would like to see in there that would sound rational. I suggested it earlier on how to do crimes and get away with it. The central organisation uses local criminals who are expendable. Everyone knew the black hand ( I think that was what they used to be called) was doing crimes, but they didn't connect them to the larger organisation.
#+end_quote

Yes! I know! Which is why, for the fourth time /at least,/ I have said that Team Rocket members making mistakes =/= Team Rocket being revealed as an organization!

/sighs/ Now we're getting somewhere, I hope :P

#+begin_quote
  You are talking of separate issues. People were aware someone was killing and abducting people. They weren't aware some people were having meetings or phoning each other. Murder is more open than friendly conversations. It has an over 50% solve rate.
#+end_quote

In our world and our technology it may be 50%, but not necessarily in the pokemon world.
