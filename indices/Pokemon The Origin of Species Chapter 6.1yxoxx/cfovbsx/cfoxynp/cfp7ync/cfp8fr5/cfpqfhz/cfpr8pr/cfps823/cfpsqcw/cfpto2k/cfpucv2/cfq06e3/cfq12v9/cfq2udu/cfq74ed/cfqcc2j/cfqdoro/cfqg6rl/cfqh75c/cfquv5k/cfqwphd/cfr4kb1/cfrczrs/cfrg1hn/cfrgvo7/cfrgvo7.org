  Let's take a hypothetical scenario. Someone goes to Cerulean City, and talks to Bill, he gives them some information on a lost colleague. They then investigate an abandoned house, searching for evidence of a crime done. This house is abandoned because a scientist was taken from in by the crime team, so they want to kill him.
#+end_quote

Abandoned house answered below: an innocuous member of the organization lives there now. "When did he sell it to you?" "About a year ago." "Did he say where he was going?" "Don't quite remember, somewhere in Unova I think? Sorry I can't be more helpful."

  How do they kill him. Do they attack him in a back alley? Do they follow him around for a while to find a good time? How do they avoid cameras? What do they do if he has a pokemon out to protect him? What if he has a companion? Where do they transport him to in the wild when they kill them? Do they fly there or walk, what if one route is monitored? How do they avoid being discovered in the wild? What if he is expecting to meet someone?

At this point we're assuming someone is investigating, not just a murder/disappearance, but a criminal investigation. There's no particular reason for them to do so in most cases, as we've agreed that even if someone suspects murder/kidnapping, that doesn't mean there's a conspiracy.

But let's say they do think it's a conspiracy: the only reason to kill them is if they actually unearth information. Having a lone conspiracy theorist out there isn't a big deal: clearly there are a number, for Oak to have heard of some of them. Most are probably completely off, but some might be right.

So how to murder someone in the pokemon world? Depends: do they live alone? If they do, sneak into their house while they're not home, wait for them in their bedroom with your Hitmonlee, and the second they walk through the door, order a kick strong enough to shatter stone. Chances of survival upon contact are negligible, and even if you survive, you're a broken mess, ready for a finishing blow.

Now you put their body in a commonly used box for Containers, absorb the body, and clean up whatever evidence there might be. If you want them to "disappear," drop the Container into the ocean. If you want their murder to be known, go to a secure, private location (where you can easily clean up any mess) and have your Nidorino (or Arcanine, or Graveler, or whatever) savage the body a bit: crush or bite their head off, trample/chew on their body a bit. Now bring the body to some nearby area where Nidorino/Arcanine/Graveler/etc are found and release the body.

Is it foolproof? No. Maybe someone notices inconsistency in the marks. Maybe someone notices less blood than there should be. But "I think this person might have been murdered" is a whole new hurdle to jump: I'm just presenting one possibility of countless.

  Because of all those variables, that is why master hitmen don't try to conceal their kills. Or if they do, they pick vulnerable people who come to a location of their choosing like an abandoned factory. Too many variables means killing is likely to fail.

  Paying the utility bill initially lowers suspicion, but later raises it when people wonder why the utility bill is paid when the person isn't there.

That was actually sarcasm >.> Sorry, it was a moment of exasperation and dwindling patience. My actual response is it's far more likely that they simply have one of their associates buy the house or apartment themselves.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not claiming they didn't reduce their social ties, just pointing out that at some point they stopped answering any calls, stopped buying food, stopped ordering things, and people would notice.
#+end_quote

Okay, but I still think you're heavily overestimating how social everyone must be, or heavily underestimating how little strangers take note of strangers. Again, I'm not saying they could get away with it every time, but [[http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/forensics/americas_missing/2.html][about 2300 people go missing a day]] in our world, and not all of them are ever found.

  They have instant healing technology, and the ability to upload people into data. They at several times modify these bits of data, with polygon say. Both would imply very good scanning technology, in that they can very easily manipulate flesh and identify problems and the fact that they can convert things into data and then do stuff with that data.
#+end_quote

The idea of uploading a corpse into data and analyzing the code is interesting, actually, and not something I considered before, but it still requires a) suspicion of foul play (going back to the "we don't autopsy every corpse" idea, not all deaths are treated like homicides without apparent reason first) and b) is still something that can be accounted for: my Hitmonlee hit his chest and head with the killing kicks? Better make sure my Nidorino particularly savages those parts, so there's all the original damage is overriden by the new one (or the flesh removed altogehter).

Definitely an interesting idea though, so thanks for bringing that up :)

  They also have xray glasses that let you see through walls. That would be a great boon for any doctor.
#+end_quote

Okay, there are definitely no x-ray specs :P First off, that item is from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, which isn't even canon in the standard canon, and secondly the description doesn't even imply that you could see through things with it: it just happens to be called "x-ray specs" for no particular reason.
