  People don't die instantly when someone attacks you. It takes a while to bleed out, and most gun shot wounds don't kill. Your assumption, that most murderers kill somewhat instantly, is false per the statistics I gave you.
#+end_quote

One of these days you're going to learn the difference between generalized statistics and specific circumstances, but someone who has the intent to kill you is not going to shoot you once, then sit back and watch you slowly bleed out and perhaps call the police while you're at it.

Even less likely would someone with a deadly pokemon merely have them take a bite out of you then call them off, especially when they need to dispose of your body afterward.

#+begin_quote
  What you were previously describing- an organization kidnapping people en masse and murdering anyone who investigates them without people knowing that there are kidnappings and murders. What you are now describing, an organization that does the above and is discovered but the true crime bosses of it aren't discovered, that is possible.
#+end_quote

That was actually what I was always describing, as I have noted multiple times now: you were simply getting caught up in the optimistic perspective that most crimes are solved and solvable and Justice Finds a Way :P

#+begin_quote
  Whether they receive medical attention is immaterial. If they can limp to a hospital, they can spill their guts out to the police. My point was, people often survive seemingly fatal injuries for a while, which would give them enough time to phone someone.
#+end_quote

It's really, really not "immaterial," and I can't even begin to understand what makes you think this. The entire medical infrastructure and emergency response vehicle system, with trained EMTs capable of helping someone survive an injury until they reach the ER, exists exactly because it helps people survive things like gunshot wounds.

And, again, as should have been obvious from the beginning, criminal hitmen who have the explicit intent to kill someone do not merely injure them then walk away and hope they don't 1) go to a hospital or 2) call the police.

Please just admit you were drawing incorrect conclusions from logic and data that do not apply to the specific situations referred to by this conversation, because at this point you're just sounding silly. I won't think less of you if you say "Yeah, I guess that is a different situation than I had in mind," but this rigid clinging to your overgeneralized conception of mortality rates in the face of deliberate hitmen is making me suspect that you simply enjoy arguing more than you do having an intellectually honest discussion.

#+begin_quote
  Using these pokemon would make it obvious in an autopsy. If their body has been blasted by a hyper beam from a gyrados, people will notice.
#+end_quote

Sounds like a stupid criminal to me.

#+begin_quote
  If they hide the body you have the issue of missing people. Search parties would likely go out, attracting more attention.
#+end_quote

Right, and they'd find the body killed by pokemon.

#+begin_quote
  Again, with both cases, even assuming their pokemon hits perfectly (and missing is common in pokemon) they are causing more issues that make it likely that a reasonably competent police force would think something was up.
#+end_quote

...What? "(and missing is common in pokemon)?" Seriously, now? You're using a game conceit to justify your absurd premise and dogged insistence on your version of hypotheticals?

No, missing isn ot commong in pokemon. The vast majority of pokemon moves are 90-100% accuracy, and only the most powerful moves miss often, and there's no reason whatsoever to use a Hydro Pump to kill a human when you can just bite their head off.

This isn't remotely interesting anymore: your arguments are becoming weaker and weaker.

#+begin_quote
  Most of the world is rural in pokemon, and Red is normally from Pallet. I read the start of your story a while ago, I can't remember if he is also from Pallet.
#+end_quote

"Most of the world" =/= "where most people live," and again you are jumping to conclusions to fit your hypothesis.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not abusing statistics, I am using them as intended.
#+end_quote

No you're not, you're misapplying data to un-similar circumstances and constructing your own conclusions that they don't support.

#+begin_quote
  They raise a very good point. The police are good at discovering who murdered people. It's not incredibly hard. As such, you shouldn't generally expect murder to go undiscovered, as a matter of course. Especially if it happens a lot. In our world it is very abnormal for murders to go unsolved.
#+end_quote

Huge oversimplifications that you just made aside: *in our world* being the key difference that you insist on ignoring when convenient for your argument :)

#+begin_quote
  It would be stupid of them to murder him. Their first impulse, likely, would be to threaten him. Then to beat him up. Then, if he refused to shut up, kill him. They could kill him, but they likely wouldn't open with it, since murder tends to draw unwanted attention. That is the normal way to overcome your aversion to murder. Escalate until you're in the mood.
#+end_quote

Holy Raptor Jesus, you're really still using this argument. You're really still insisting that when someone is told they need to kill someone, and they study their schedule and movements with the intent to quickly kll them and then hide the evidence, they need to "work up" to it on the scene, maybe "beat them up" a little.

I can't tell if your perspective is that warped by literature and movies meant for children, or if you just don't want to admit that you're wrong that badly. I really don't care which it is anymore: you're wasting my time with strawmen.

#+begin_quote
  Lacking social ties doesn't mean your monetary ties would vanish. Your children and partner would want your property, your money, utilities would want money for bills. Other scientists would want to write papers with you, students would want internships.
#+end_quote

*Children and partner* folks! Unconnected scientists who have children and partners! Yep! That's what that word means! Utility companies are so hard to fool, I'll tell you what! Their Super Secret Criminal Conspiracy Radar would go off the second a bill is paid late: No way a competent crime organization would forsee and take care of something like that!

#+begin_quote
  You're moving from one issue (can you hide murder perfectly) to another one (can you hide conspiracies perfectly) and are implying that because I disagree with you on the first issue, I disagree with you on the second.
#+end_quote

No, see, you keep conflating the two: I'm the one that has been telling you *from the beginning* (go back and check if you'd like) that making mistakes in one does not automatically imply the other.

But you keep insisting that you can't get away with murder, that police are supermen and humans are made of adamantium steel, and that as long as you can come up with a hypothetical situation where murderers have to beat up their targets first and then just walk away and hope they die, perhaps making a call to the police or getting to a hospital along the way, then clearly everything's smooth sailing for the Forces of Good.

I'm exaggerating your argument now, by the way, because it's rather ridiculous, and I'm tired of debunking it again and again and having you insist that the law of averages will always side in the favor of your hypotheticals.

So let's just agree to disagree, because if you have such a naive and simpistic view of how crimes work, and are so bad at applying new information to generalizations that you honestly believe a hitman with specific purpose wouldn't stick around and ensure a swift kill of their target, we have nothing further to discuss: we're just living on two different planets for how logic and reasonable hypotheticals work.

#+begin_quote
  No, but when people talk about it they might say "I do not know what really happened, but I fear Voldemort's mark." or "I do not know what really happened, but I fear these dangerous criminals." not I wonder why all these people have vanished and died for no discernible reason. They know that a dangerous criminal did it.
#+end_quote

Again, ignoring previous parts of our conversation to insist on your original premise. Next!

#+begin_quote
  I don't, just, Pallet is generally considered a rural area, and Red is from there, and he was the one we were talking about being murdered.
#+end_quote

And yet he's not there now. So you think he's going to go back for some reason before being murdered? You think "being from a small town" is some kind of magic aura that surrounds a person their whole life, so that if they're murdered their homicide is that much easier to solve?

Quick answer: that's not how statistics work. Or magic auras, for that matter.

  They used universities as fronts, they were pretty open about testing on humans, just not about being run by the CIA.

  To extend the analogy- it would be clear that someone, or some groups, were abducting scientists, though it wouldn't be clear if they were working together.

Which is why Oak had multiple guesses, and didn't automatically believe the third.

Not the argument :)

  I don't believe I ever said that team rocket making mistakes means team rocket being revealed as an organization. You were originally claiming that they couldn't make any mistakes in murder, and that police investigations would be abysmal.
#+end_quote

You surely did make that connection in your multiple disparate threads of argument a number of times.

Next!

#+begin_quote
  I dunno, I would expect it to be higher in the pokemon world. Better medical tech, cheaper autopsies.
#+end_quote

Pokemon are more lethal than guns, and the technology to hide evidence is far more powerful.

Well this has been a fun use of 20 minutes, but if you insist on continuing it, fair warning: I'm going to ignore any parts of your response that simply repeats yourself or raises a point that I've already addressed :)
