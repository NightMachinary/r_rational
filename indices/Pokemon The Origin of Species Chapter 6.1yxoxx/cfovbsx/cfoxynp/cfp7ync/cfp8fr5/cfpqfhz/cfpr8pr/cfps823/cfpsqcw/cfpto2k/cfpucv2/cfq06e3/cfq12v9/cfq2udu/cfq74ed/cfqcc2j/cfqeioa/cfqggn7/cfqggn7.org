  It does not seem very reasonable to demand examples of organizations that got away with murder. If they really did get away with it, we wouldn't know. It might make more sense to ask how many murders remain unsolved. According to Wikipedia in 2007 the unsolved murder rate in the United States was 39%.

That rate is biased by high crime urban areas.

Rural areas have a much higher solve rate.
