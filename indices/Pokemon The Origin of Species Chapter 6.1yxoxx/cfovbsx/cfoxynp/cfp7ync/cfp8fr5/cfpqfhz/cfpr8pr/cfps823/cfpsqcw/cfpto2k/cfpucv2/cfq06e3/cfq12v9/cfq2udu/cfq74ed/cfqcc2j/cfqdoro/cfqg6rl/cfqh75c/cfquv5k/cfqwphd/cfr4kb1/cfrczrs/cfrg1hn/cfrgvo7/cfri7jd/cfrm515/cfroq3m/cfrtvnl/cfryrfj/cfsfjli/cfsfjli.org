  The top voted criticism of this chapter is that it's slow and boring (and irrelevant) and that the characters are annoying and depressed. This whole thing arose because people wanted a more exciting story where Red confronted criminals.

Top voted critic here: Nuh-uh. Every one of my criticisms was addressed, and I got what I wanted. Since my [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1z8f2r/major_update_for_pokemon_oos_6/cfrlznq][unabashed praise]] of the revision of this chapter received just as many upvotes as my criticism here, plus or minus fuzzing, I'd guess several people agree with me.

Without going too far into the specific issues either of you have raised, Red confronting criminals would be a difficult story for me to believe. Personally, I'd prefer to see /Laura/ confront criminals, in a mostly non-action way. But I wouldn't be disappointed if it goes in a different direction. The ride has hardly started!
