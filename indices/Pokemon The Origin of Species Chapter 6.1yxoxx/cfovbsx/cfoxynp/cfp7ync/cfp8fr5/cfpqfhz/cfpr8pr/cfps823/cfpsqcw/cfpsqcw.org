  It is fairly obvious.

In the hypothetical scenario you've mentally constructed as the only legitimate one, sure :) If you'd like to share it, that might help, but my conception of Team Rocket is not that blatant in their actions.

  Murdering children is already a sign of an incompetent secret criminal organization. Killing people prompts huge investigations. It's like a spy who tells everyone he's James Bond.

It's 2: In this world, disposing of bodies is as easy as putting it in a box and and sucking that into a Container ball.

Also, wild pokemon kill people fairly often: not hard to deposit the body in the wild and let people make the natural assumptions.

  Fuck ups from minions are possible with either.
#+end_quote

Sure, and I'm not going to have every single minion never fuck up. At the same time, I don't see how the whole thing coming to light because of a convenient minion-fuck-up is particularly compelling :)

  Anyway, criminals tend to need to do dastardly deeds in the open. They need cash, are impulsive, and often act psychophysically.

And those criminals tend to get caught. Why on earth would I make the major human antagonists of the story that poor a breed of criminal?

#+begin_quote
  It doesn't sound like a very interesting organization then. One only scientists encounter.
#+end_quote

Yeah, the Manhattan Project was totes uninteresting ;P
