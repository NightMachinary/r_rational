  You're assuming he would know that it was obvious when he started investigating.

It is fairly obvious.

  Sounds somewhat like an incompetent secret criminal organization to me, neh? An 11 year old boy finds out about them and gets close enough to witness something like that without being taken out himself?

Murdering children is already a sign of an incompetent secret criminal organization. Killing people prompts huge investigations. It's like a spy who tells everyone he's James Bond.

I'd as such assume one of two things.

1. Their secrecy is "investigate us and you die." and they're open about it.

2. They have alternate ways of avoiding investigation.

Fuck ups from minions are possible with either.

  The bottom line, from my perspective, is that my conception of an intelligent Team Rocket run by a real criminal mastermind is not one that would go around in the open doing dastardly deeds.
#+end_quote

Except wanton murder of children apparently.

Anyway, criminals tend to need to do dastardly deeds in the open. They need cash, are impulsive, and often act psychophysically.

  The only reason Oak is suspicious of one is because he's in a unique position to have known one of the people affected (as implied in the chapter, they only target those that wouldn't be easily missed) and is in a position to have learned of other such disappearances.

It doesn't sound like a very interesting organization then. One only scientists encounter.
