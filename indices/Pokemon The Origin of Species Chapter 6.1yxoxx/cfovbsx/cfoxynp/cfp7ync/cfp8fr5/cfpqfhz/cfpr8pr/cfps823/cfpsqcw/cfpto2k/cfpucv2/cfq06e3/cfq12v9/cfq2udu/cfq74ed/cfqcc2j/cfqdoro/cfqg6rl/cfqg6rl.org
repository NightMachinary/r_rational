  All of them the result of gross incompetence by the organization (not a minor slipup, but outright incompetence) or a resolution so easy that the common police force is able to achieve it... leaving what room, exactly, for the protagonists?

  discovery upon murder, investigation by police or private investigators, autopsies of killed people, the use of phones.
#+end_quote

Could you describe to me how any of these need gross stupidity?

#+begin_quote
  And your insistence that no criminal organization could remain hidden while engaging in acts you have no real knowledge of similarly strains credulity.
#+end_quote

Because it has never happened.

1/6 , perhaps less, of gun injuries lead to death. Humans are tough to kill. The majority of people who are shot survive to tell their tale-a phone isn't even needed. Murdering people is hard.

#+begin_quote
  even common criminals can murder someone without them getting a phone call off first, but you think it's unrealistic for elite organized criminals to do so.

[[http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_rate]]

Over 50% of murders and aggregated assaults are solved. It is unusual for murders to go uncovered. That average is dragged down by bad areas in cities. It would be higher for a rural area like pallet.

[[http://blogs.mprnews.org/ground-level/2012/07/why-do-rural-police-solve-more-murders-than-urban-police/]]

Over 90%

So yes, it does stretch belief using murder and people not investigating much. There is a 9/10 chance they'll be found out by statistics.

  You don't know what their other options are: all you know is what you've assumed based on bad information and my hypothetical response to your "just have Red look around, what's the worst that could happen? It's not like they'll kill him, that's stupid."
#+end_quote

I never said anything like that. Please don't make things up.

#+begin_quote
  since when is killing people who know too much stupid, exactly?
#+end_quote

See earlier, statistics.

#+begin_quote
  "vanish" implies that they're having a completely normal and social life one day, and are suddenly absent the next. When I say "fade," I mean how long it takes for them to lose contact with friends and family: the end result is the same, but the lead up of isolation and withdrawal makes it far less suspicious.
#+end_quote

I am not implying anything- people care where others are. If nothing else, they want to divide up their possessions. Once these people did vanish they would still make an effort to find them for money purposes, for friendship. If someone is missing you can't get their stuff easily.

#+begin_quote
  In every investigation of every criminal organization in all of history, there began a moment where the people who eventually unraveled the conspiracy first suspected it existed in the first place to even begin investigating.
#+end_quote

That moment is generally just before they hear about the crime, which provides evidence to their existence.

#+begin_quote
  Even if he encounters criminals up to no good, that doesn't automatically mean conspiracy.
#+end_quote

That is good, and sounds fun. It is exactly what I wanted with regards to red interacting with them.

#+begin_quote
  Of course maybe he was lying, but KNOWING how much he needed Harry's trust, there's no particular reason to think he was: it wasn't a mistake on Quirrelmort's part, it was a lack of trust on Harry's.
#+end_quote

I might think that initially, but the centaur incident made me distrust him- it looked a lot like he killed him and made him into a blank eyed inferius. He could lie because he wanted harry to trust him. Either way, there would be evidence of his crime, a dead or unconscious auror. That is what crimes produce. Evidence.

#+begin_quote
  Clearly they've already made one mistake we're aware of, one that took years to be recognized: if Dr. Fuji hadn't told Oak that he was working on a new project, it would be harder for Oak to conclude that he had been recruited to something, rather than dropping out of his work altogether.
#+end_quote

Unless he is a body double, that is his mistake. If he is a double, I mean with the high risk murders that fail most of the time and are cleared 90%+ of the time.

  With our modern hindsight, it seems like people have always known about the Mafia, and its major loss of power seems obvious. but the Mafia existed in some form for decades, and wasn't even recognized as such as massive criminal conspiracy until the late 1950s.
#+end_quote

That is exactly the sort of thing I would like to see in there that would sound rational. I suggested it earlier on how to do crimes and get away with it. The central organisation uses local criminals who are expendable. Everyone knew the black hand ( I think that was what they used to be called) was doing crimes, but they didn't connect them to the larger organisation.

#+begin_quote
  "Team Rocket makes mistakes, but those mistakes don't automatically mean their secrecy is blown." Say one of the engineers that they tried to coerce or kidnap (or whatever they did) fought back and was successful: do they necessarily know everything they need to to suspect a massive criminal conspiracy? Of course not:
#+end_quote

That is totally fine, and sounds rational. It is far better than assuming autopsies don't work.

It would be very worthy of an intermission. A story from an engineer of beating up some criminals, a lie from them as to their motives. We readers would only see a tiny bit of the picture and most would not see through the levels of the conspiracy.

#+begin_quote
  So what's the cutoff point for you for Team Rocket getting away with hypothetical murder/kidnapping? 3 times is okay? 5 times? 10 times stretches credulity? How long do you think a secret can be kept? 3 years? 6?
#+end_quote

You are talking of separate issues. People were aware someone was killing and abducting people. They weren't aware some people were having meetings or phoning each other. Murder is more open than friendly conversations. It has an over 50% solve rate.
