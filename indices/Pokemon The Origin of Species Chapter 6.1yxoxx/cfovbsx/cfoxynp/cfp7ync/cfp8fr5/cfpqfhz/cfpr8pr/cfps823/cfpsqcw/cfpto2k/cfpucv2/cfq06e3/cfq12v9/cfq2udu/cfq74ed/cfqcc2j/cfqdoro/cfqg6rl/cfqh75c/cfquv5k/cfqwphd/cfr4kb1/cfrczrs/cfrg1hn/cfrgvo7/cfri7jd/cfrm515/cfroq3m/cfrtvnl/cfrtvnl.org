  They can't have any personal connection with the person (which means no going to their home) they can't have an obvious motive like that the person was investigating a crime, and both users have to be drug users/ gang members so the police probably don't care. It has to be a drive by pokemon shooting style kill.
#+end_quote

Going to their home to commit the crime isn't a personal connection, and "the person was investigating a crime" isn't an obvious motive: we're still talking about the difference between suspicion and solving, remember? It doesn't matter if some people think someone was murdered: if they have no suspects and no leads, that's called "getting away with murder."

And having a pool of people with no connections at all to the person they're going to kill is something of an advantage for large crime syndicates.

  The fact that the criminals didn't in your story, that he just vanished without anyone knowing where he went, was a sign of the gang's incompetence. If the gang was more competent Oak would have said something like "Yeah, everyone said he went to Unova to become a pokemon master. Poor guy. I think he finally snapped."
#+end_quote

/sighs/ But Oak DID say something like that: specifically he said that he figured Fuji just gave in to his depression and faded. That was the cover he had originally, and that's why Oak didn't suspect foul play.

It was only after years later of putting together other such dots that he questioned the original premise: that Fuji sank into a deeper and deeper depression and eventually just cut everyone off. Now that Oak suspects otherwise, he's questioning how much of that apparent depression was real, and how much was a carefully constructed cover.

  Also, I doubt it's that common to sell old scientists into sex slavery. Your irrelevant diversion doesn't change my point- most of those who vanish in America are not the sort who vanish in your story, they are younger people.

Good, now you're getting it: taking statistics and twisting them to fit your narrative without considering specifics or contexts is a silly thing to do. So don't do it :P

#+begin_quote
  You should edit in this justification which you have just now come up with and are using to beat me over the head with as though it was your intention all along. It would make your story a lot more rational.
#+end_quote

As I said above, I already have such a justification: you just didn't see it or recognize it. Which might be my fault as a writer, but you /are/ the only person who seems to be making a big deal about it, so maybe not :P

#+begin_quote
  This would be a lot easier if you named these well publicized capers and heists that no one knew about till later. When I asked you before you just named the mafia and intelligence agencies that did crimes in the open but didn't reveal their hidden leadership. You didn't name any hidden crimes.
#+end_quote

Not all are a perfect fit because their targets are so public (meaning even though they got away with it, obviously people noticed the end results, even if they had no idea who did it or how to catch them) but #6, #5, #3 and #2 from [[http://www.cracked.com/article_18399_7-real-world-heists-that-put-oceans-11-to-shame_p2.html][this list]] prove the basic point: you can find others online if you want.

  I would understand it if you learnt from the lessons of master hitmen, and so got yourself in their reference class. Your suggested crime was basically to wait in their room with a loaded shotgun (loaded hitmonlee) and wait for the best. That is the kind of behavior of drunk impulsive people.
#+end_quote

A drunk impulsive person wouldn't fall foul to all the risks you listed above, like "what if someone else comes in?" If you don't have the competency to mitigate something like that by shifting observers on a household to get a sense of the person's schedule and habits, you don't really deserve to be called a "competent criminal organization."

I appreciate that you're probably just trying to get me to think of and include more specifics of how such a crime would work, but if that were the case you should probably stop bringing up ridiculously obvious problems as "handwaved competence." Anything that takes less than 10 seconds to think of a solution to is not a "handwave" to call competence, which is what makes it a catchall term for the thousands of possible scenarios and factors that might go into any given crime.

Also, you bring up bizarre things like this:

#+begin_quote
  If you kick someone hard enough to cave their chest in they will fly back and smash into the wall or floor, depending on how powerful the kick was. They might smash through several walls of the house if it's a strong enough kick and they are a small kid who is much lighter than the normal people the pokemon kicks.
#+end_quote

Now you're just being ridiculous. "Several walls?" How about none. Reality isn't like cartoons or movies, where a body is going to smash into a wall and just keep going. Most of the force of the kick is absorbed by the body (otherwise it wouldn't do much damage), and the remainder is what sends them flying back. A kick to break a wall might be possible because of how concentrated the force is in a specific area, but unless the wall is made of cardboard, a body is far softer than the wall, and has enough surface area that it's just going to bounce. Maybe there'll be a crack where the head or pelvis hits, but nothing noticeably "human body shaped." Maybe someone looks at it and says "Foul play!" but far more likely is the understanding that sometimes, walls have cracks.

Also, Force = Mass x Acceleration. Smaller body = less force.
