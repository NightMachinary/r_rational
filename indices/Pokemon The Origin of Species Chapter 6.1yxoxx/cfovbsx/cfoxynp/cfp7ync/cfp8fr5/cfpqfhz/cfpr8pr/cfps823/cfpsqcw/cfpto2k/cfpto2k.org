  In the hypothetical scenario you've mentally constructed as the only legitimate one, sure :) If you'd like to share it, that might help, but my conception of Team Rocket is not that blatant in their actions.

People generally have an aversion to murder, kidnapping, and criminals, and so when someone says "This person is a psycopath" members of polite society tend to avoid them.

It would be like saying "This area has a high crime rate, and several people have been mugged and killed there." The rational response wouldn't necessarily to be to go, as an 11 year old, to that area where people are vanishing or dying. Likewise with a criminal organization.

  It's 2: In this world, disposing of bodies is as easy as putting it in a box and and sucking that into a Container ball.

That isn't the main issue with doing crimes effectively, body disposal.

With phones and such, people tend to stay in contact with their family members. They inform them of the location where they are going. If you try to kill anyone who goes to your area you're likely to have several screw ups.

1. People are going to escape, due to strong pokemon or fast pokemon or luck or minions who don't have a killing instinct.

2. A basic autopsy is going to reveal that the person didn't die from pokemon local to the area, and probably that they have brain damage from being put in a ball.

3. Having minions sufficiently murderous to quickly kill anyone who comes close means having impulsive psychopaths likely with a criminal history on your pay, which is risky.

Also, if a police officer (with strong, well trained pokemon and a gun) makes some attempt to investigate it and gets killed you are risking escalating the situation up to swat teams.

  Sure, and I'm not going to have every single minion never fuck up. At the same time, I don't see how the whole thing coming to light because of a convenient minion-fuck-up is particularly compelling :)

You wouldn't necessarily have the whole thing come to light, just that if you investigated it you got beaten up.

  "In the open" being the more relevant part of that :P
#+end_quote

In an era with mobile phones it's not easy to avoid things being in the open, especially if your first response to an inquisitive child is murder.

  And those criminals tend to get caught. Why on earth would I make the major human antagonists of the story that poor a breed of criminal?
#+end_quote

Because the job of an antagonist, generally, is to interfere with the protagonist's goals in some manner. They should generally cross paths and antagonize each other.

Also, that's why rich people who want to get criminal aid hire local criminal organizations to do their dirty work. If it all goes wrong they take the fall. It tends to mean a better breed of criminal too. You get good at crimes by doing crimes a lot, and that means sometimes getting caught. If your inner circle of people knows a lot about you when stuff goes wrong and the police catch them everything will go badly for you.

  Yeah, the Manhattan Project was totes uninteresting ;P

For Japan, for most of the war, yes. Nothing really happened, then they got curbstomped.
