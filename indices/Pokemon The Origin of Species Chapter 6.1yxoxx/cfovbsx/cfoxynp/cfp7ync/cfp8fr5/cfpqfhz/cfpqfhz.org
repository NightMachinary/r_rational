  there's just no way I can imagine Rational!Red would hear about certain things during the normal course of his adventure, and even if he did, the rational response would be to immediately begin investigating them until he figured them out

  Because unlike the video games, in the world I have in mind an inexperienced 11 year old trainer would meet a swift end if he really started poking around to find a secret criminal organization's hideout :)

Contradiction. If it's obvious that he would die, then it would be irrational to investigate them.

The obvious solution is for him to learn this, carefully try to investigate them without exposing himself, and see someone else who tried to investigate them get brutally murdered by pokemon, and then back off.

That would be a fun scene, would explain their character very well, and would remove the need for artificial stupidity.
