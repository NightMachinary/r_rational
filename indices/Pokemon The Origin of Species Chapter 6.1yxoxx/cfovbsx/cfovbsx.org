I think all these interludes and the like that you see in web fiction like this and /Worm/ are generally a bad idea. They're usually either totally irrelevant to the overall plot and slow down the action, or, even worse, they reveal important information in a way that would be much less effective that how an author would do it if there was a strict or semi-strict limit on the word count (while still slowing down the action).

I think it's a temptation that should be resisted unless you have a wholly contained story to tell that would actually be interesting in its own right, like the standalone stories in the /Sandman/ series. As it is, web fiction authors tend to use these "interludes" to...fill space? Provide "bonus" content? I've never seen it used effectively, or rather, if it is used effectively, it should feel like something more than a mere "interlude."
