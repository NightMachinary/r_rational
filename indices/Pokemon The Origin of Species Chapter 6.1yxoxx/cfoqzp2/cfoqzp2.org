Not sure the interlude was successful. I wasn't really interested, and the present tense writing struck me as awkward in a way it usually doesn't. For example lines like "She doesn't want...", "She misses him.", and "["I hope everyone is hungry"], They are.". Also, there are a few weird spots with "she'd" or "she had" where really is should probably be "she has" to fit with the present tense. I admit that the sentences sound weird either way though. Some of what I perceived as boringness can be forgiven as it's clearly a foreshadowing chapter, but I think it's still worth knowing I got that impression.
