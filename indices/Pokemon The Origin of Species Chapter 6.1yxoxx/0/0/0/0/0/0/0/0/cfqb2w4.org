You did thanks :) I guess my conception was always that atoms move just as a matter of being, so there's no real way to stop that just because the atom got reformed, but that the heat that results from the chemical processes of digestion wouldn't be retained or continued. I might just take it out though and keep the handwave-by-omission.
