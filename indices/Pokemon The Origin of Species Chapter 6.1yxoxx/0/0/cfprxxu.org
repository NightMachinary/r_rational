Alright, this is the kind of feedback I was looking for :) I try to refrain from voting on comments in my posts, but I'm making an exception in this case and upvoting yours to bring more awareness to it.

  I don't like Laura. It's sad her husband died, but that keeps interrupting her other thoughts, to the point where I'd recommend therapy. She worries about him more than she worries about Red, and she doesn't even seem have have any good thoughts about the guy!

Good to know: I'll try to put in more redeeming qualities about her and their relationship. I actually cut back on some of her worry about Red, because it felt like too much: clearly I didn't see how much that unbalanced things :)

  Daisy is worse. She doesn't do anything. She just provides pages and pages of meaningless small talk. She steers the conversation through school and taxes and she has so much screen time, and it feels like none of that is going to pay off. As soon as something interesting happens - Koga's deflecting allegations that he might be what? It's common knowledge that a storm might signal an attack? What's that about? - the plot drops that significant exposition in favor of taking us back to Daisy's small talk! Daisy is a /vampire./

Hahaha. Okay, I definitely didn't think of it that way originally, but now I can see why that would be so annoying. You're right, she needs more presence: I'm going to overhaul the post-dinner conversation completely.

  I'm also not really feeling the worldbuilding in this chapter. The Container is fair enough. But I'm expected to think that a million million megajoules of mass is the easy part, but ten megajoules of thermal energy is supposed to give me pause? Either their mass-energy conversion factor is different from ours (possible, but not shown), or that actually makes the world make less sense.
#+end_quote

The perspective I had on it was that, if you have the ability to transmit matter to energy/data and reconstruct it into matter afterward, that the "million million megajoules of mass" is a "given." I can't really mess with that without removing one of the most singular aspects of the pokemon world.

But it still struck me as odd that, even if you have that data to reconstruct the molecules and cells and synapses, that the matter would come out containing exactly the same heat/energy as it did when it was copied. Body heat, after all, is the result of our metabolism, the chemical processes by which we burn our "fuel" like sugars. Why would those processes also be frozen and resumed exactly as they had before? Wouldn't they come out inert, which would be dangerously cold for most living things?

So yeah. It struck me as weird, so I put it in incase anyone else wondered about it: it could be that by mentioning it I'm just drawing attention to an issue most people wouldn't even have thought of, and maybe it's unnecessary either way :)

  There's talk of Pokemon on the news, which makes sense. Pokemon are immensely important. So much so that it should be really difficult to write a chapter where the only Pokemon that actually appears is a cooked bird! Is there a compelling reason Laura didn't wait at an intersection for a passing rhyhorn? Or why Oak doesn't have a tangela around trained to grab the dishes? Laura stops to chat with neighbors on her way - is there no friendly neighborhood raticate? (Why no, there's nothing unusual about a friendly giant rat that can rip out the sidewalk, why would there be?) A news report about tentacool can't support the universe by itself.
#+end_quote

Yes, this was basically something I tried to do intentionally that in retrospect might have been a mistake: while obviously pokemon are going to be the subject of news and conversation, they don't have to be a part of every single social interaction, the way they are in the games and anime. I'll probably roll this change in with the changes I make to Daisy.

#+begin_quote
  As others have mentioned, there's some problem with the flow. I think a large part of that is that every little thing makes Laura think of Tom for no obvious reason, but there's lots of little things too. I think you need to take care to spell out exactly how characters' thoughts lead to one another, in general, on a moment-to-moment basis. It's also good form to isolate most related exposition into distinct chunks, unless you want me to think their mind keeps going back to it. So this chapter is... kinda weak all around.

Duly noted. I'll get to editing soon, and post when it's updated. Thanks for all the great feedback!
