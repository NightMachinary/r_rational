Thanks!

And yes, I completely get the present-tense aversion :) It's one of those things that many people just aren't used to, so it takes some acclimating.

Personally I've read so many books in both present and past tense that I barely notice switching between them when reading... but when writing, it's a /huge/ stumbling block to switch back and forth, as I would be doing if I didn't write this in present tense (the novel I'm editing for publication is in present tense). I actually wrote the first chapter of this in past tense originally, but both it and my novel became so riddled with tense typos that it swiftly became easier to just rewrite the first chapter in present tense and continue in present.

In any case, I hope it doesn't spoil the enjoyment too much, and hopefully the next time you encounter a story in present tense it won't be so jarring :)
