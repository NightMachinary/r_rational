Here's a tip: Go back and read through it again, this time looking for commas.

No, it's not that you have too many of them. Or too few. Thankfully you're better than that. But, they are all being used the same way. Almost every sentence will go "Something something something*,* something something something something."

Almost every time.

Still a good story though.
