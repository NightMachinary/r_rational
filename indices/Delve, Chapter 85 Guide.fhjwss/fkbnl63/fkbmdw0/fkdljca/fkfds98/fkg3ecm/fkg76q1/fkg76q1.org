Dynamo isn't that good, sure you get to cap skills fast (stamina would be even faster) but that's not what limits adventurers (including Rain himself) mid to long term. He's great against low level mobs in the area immediately around him, which is awful in the combat meta of the world. Although every party or at least town should have their own aura guy to fuel them.

Edit: Although a decent Dynamo/Stamina build should have unlocked tons of skill tiers and informed their government/group.
