The same reason kids want to grow up to be their sports heroes. Note that their role models really aren't that competent, either - even going back to the start of the story, adventurers are mostly loose canons.

High Clarity / low Focus tends gives Rain a tendency to over-analyze, which he must constantly pull himself back from. High Focus / low Clarity has the opposite effect, making for poor impulse-control. Add to this the fact that truly powerful people rarely feel consequences for what they do.

Pretty much every role model these kids have is like this, as is Velika.
