I think you've missed some of what I'm trying to say. They're raised in an environment where they personally* don't have that power sure, but they can borrow that power at all times and are basically untouchable because at any moment they're bothered by an unawakened they either have unawakened guards who are trained and armed, or can call down their family's version of Velika to turn people into paste. They're raised and trained specifically to inherit their family's build, so from birth they have the knowledge that they will* 100% become one of those badasses.

That's a perfect recipe for overconfidence imo.

Also Kettel but lard in himself to fight slimes and protect from acid, but also decided to fight slimes in the dark, with no knowledge of how blues work, while simultaneously harassing and belittling an adventurer who just saved his life. He's guaranteed a fucking moron. If rain was even 10% of the person Kettel had accused him of being, Kettel would've got punched in the face after demanding his cloak and left to die in the sewers. If rain had been any other adventurer, Kettel would've killed himself by opening his mouth lol.

Plus his constant bothering of the nobles. He's doing this with Rain nearby so presumably he feels safe, but in any other scenario??? Rapier noble would've spit roasted him and the worlds keeps spinning.
