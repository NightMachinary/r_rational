Come on. The majority are unawakened and all of those guys were adults or late teens. No unawakened adult in an awakened world thinks they are the shit when all the monster killing since written history has been done by superhumans. The idea that an unawakened adult goes into a dungeon and expects it to be a cake walk is ludicrous for anyone who didn't either grow up superduper sheltered or fell on the head a few times too many. And in Rain's kindergarden group there's two at best who aren't completely clueless morons. Despite them having been chosen by lot.

Also, how did that archer girl become that good at hitting moving targets under stress without having gained any respect whatsoever for monsters? Is she a pigeon shooting noble that has some disorder that makes her not feel fear?

So yes, kids want to be their sports heroes. But how many teens and young adults think they already /are/ their sports heroes, even when literally being coached by a pro athlete?
