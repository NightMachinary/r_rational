Just listing tools, not the actual strategy:

- Medusa lamia have a "glare that makes living creatures unable to move, as if they've been turned to stone". That sounds like a ridiculously useful safe tazer for police work et al, plus, if it works via a live feed then could be potentially */awesome/* as a "stun /everyone/" tool (ridiculously dangerous if other people get their hands on the stun-video though). Also: Have a companion that can be quickly turned into a medusa, and you have yourself a great surprise-stungun.
- Normal slimes are "exceptionally fast learners". Obvious application is obvious.
- Eel mermaids can use their mucus for cosmetics, which is a good source of money. Also, /in theory/, mermaids could be cheap scuba divers, but there's no indication that they can survive depths. If they /could/, though, then there might be utility in using them to map out ocean floors (which are something like 90% uncharted). Super important that they keep an eye on the 24-hour timer though, if they revert in the deep-sea then they're fucked.
- Backbeard cyclops have hypnotism powers. That sounds permanent-ish, and might be a useful and easy tool for either power or therapy. Secretly hypnotise world leaders for easy world domination, easy peasy.
- Arachne web could be useful for construction and whatever the material is useful for.
- Does zombie race actually resurrect people? Because, free experts right there. ET Jayne, Einstein, etc. Except it only lasts 24 hours, bugger. Still, /ridiculously/ useful if that works.
