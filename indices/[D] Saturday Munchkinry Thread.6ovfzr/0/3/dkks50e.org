I don't know what a "Liminal" is, so I assume you can transform people into any of the species listed in the link you gave.

First, transform yourself into a sentient undead, now you are immortal. Now there are a number of ways to take over the world.

The fastest is to transform someone into a mindless undead. Effectively triggering a zombie apocalypse and turning all of humanity into mindless undeads, except you who is a sentient undead. Since you are the only sentient being left, you automatically are the leader of the world.

A slower, slightly more peaceful method is to make loyal minions into merpeople. Most of the Earth is oceans, so the merpeople will reproduce and become a major superpower, stronger than all of the land-based countries. Declare war against humanity for their pollution of the oceans, rallying the merpeople behind you. The land-based countries cannot win: nukes don't work well on deep underwater targets. So surrenders/pre-emptive peace treaties are desperately negotiated and signed, letting you usurp power and become the leader of a world government.
