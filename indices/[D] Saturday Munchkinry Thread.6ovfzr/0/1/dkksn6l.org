Huh, that's not the kind of time limit I expected, but it does present some interesting possibilities.

First off, the fact that it's only temporary will be a boon, for most people. You'll have a massive contigent of people who will want to be a liminal for a day, just to try it out. You could sell your services by saying "Today I'm making people into weres" or whatever, then have people pay to line up while you sit in a jeep and drive past them, making skin contact with each person. Estimating ~10 mph as a safe speed to stick out your hand and have people get slapped as you drive past them, and pretending people are about a foot long end to end, you could touch 10 * 5280 = 52800 clients in an hour, in an absolute best case scenario, although you'd probably have to do it twice to catch the people who didn't manage to get touched the first tim.e

There's probably a better way to do this, but that's an engineering problem. More than likely, on any given day, you won't see anywhere near that many people who want to be touched anyways. After all, to get this kind of conversion rate, you can do, at best, a few lines of people a day, which means you'll have to rotate which liminals you offer.

But then, that's assuming people only want to stay liminal for a day. More than likely, you could find a contigent of people who want to /stay/ liminals, and these people would rely on you to touch them daily, which would give you massive amounts of leverage over them: displease me, and you're back to being a regular, ordinary human. That puts you in a /very/ good position to start a personality cult. After all, regular cults already get a lot of mileage out of giving/withdrawing affection to make people emotionally dependent; "being a liminal" is the next level of "incorporating cult teachings into your self identity."

After you establish your cult, then you can basically use [[/u/infernovulpix]] 's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/50tqsf/mk_you_can_turn_people_into_catgirls_take_over/d76ylaa/][solution]]. Implementation details would differ, but the path would be pretty similar.

Alternatively, you can use the power only on yourself to become a harpy, claim to be an angel (most people won't know the difference), and leverage that into even-increasing power. As a bonus, you don't need to be an angel full time: just make a visitation every few months or so, give out some decent but obvious advice, aquire a shitload of disciples, and start affecting political change. Bonus points if you make visitations in a place that already has religious significance.
