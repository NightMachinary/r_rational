  Samples from two-dimensional probability distribution by the looks of it. Different pictures demonstrate different relationships between the pair of random variables.

Yep. I finally fixed the code to "clamp"/condition on a single value for the top-level hyperparameter so that I'm actually graphing /joint likelihoods/, as I'd really wanted to test my hypothesis.

(It's weakly confirmed, but really needs more examination since the precise details of the hypothesis aren't at all clear yet.)

  EDIT: Also, [[/u/eaturbrainz]][1] , can I have a look at the code and then steal it for my own use?

Which bit? I literally just generate some arrays via sampling and then feed them into Seaborn's =jointdist()= function to generate the graphs.
