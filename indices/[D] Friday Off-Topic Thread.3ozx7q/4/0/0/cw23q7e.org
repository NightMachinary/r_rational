Don't forget: 4. Die with an /excellent/ alibi. Life insurance providers are assholes. My aunt got diagnosed with metastasized cancer of the gall bladder a few years back and given three months to live. Insurance company tried to weasel out of paying before she was even dead, from calling up to offer a Great Deal if she changed her policy (although of course the new policy wouldn't cover any pre-existing conditions) to 'accidentally' sending her bill to the wrong address for the first time. She died after four months and they had to pay out, but they seriously tried to back out of the policy the second they found out that a customer they had had for three decades had inoperable cancer.
