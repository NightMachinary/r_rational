Fucking fuck I can/not/ get any long-term goals done inside a single year. /That is why they are long-term/.

And if the time-frame gets longer, then really, it's mostly the same as being alive the regular way. After all, I still have to support myself, right? I'm already living "on-target" in the broad sense.

I guess if it got up to five years, I might quit my job and join my desired PhD program /immediately/ rather than trying to make the strongest preparations I can.
