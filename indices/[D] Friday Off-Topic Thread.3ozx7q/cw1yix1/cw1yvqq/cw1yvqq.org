I believe you have rediscovered logarithmic scaling. That's how I would approach it. Although I would want to make the unit speed 0.5c. It is the only actual Schelling point involved, I would think.

As for names, call it subwarps, or sublights. (Please note that a unit of 0.5c would better be described as semilights, and that people in your setting could go around talking about how big each ship's semi is.)

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_velocity][Proper velocity,]] or celerity, is an option. However, the problem you're trying to solve already has been. It's called [[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/relativ/einvel2.html][Einstein velocity addition.]] For your railgun addition problem, input 0.45 and 0.45 into the relativistic projectile calculator (and then add that to another 0.45). Your projectile is actually going about 0.90c relative to the planet.
