I've been trying to find/make an intuitive way to describe relativistic speeds, and I've come to the conclusion that it's hard to do, and everything has tradeoffs because our intuitions don't line up with reality very well. That being said, the best system I came up with is a set of units I call the "Light" (and I need a better name for it) 1 Light is defined as "The speed at which an object has 3*10^{8} as much momentum as it would have at 1m/s."

This has the advantage that you can simply add numbers together to see how fast something is going. For example, let's say there's a spaceship traveling at 0.5 Lights (~0.45c) relative to a planet. It shoots a fighter-drone out of its front at 0.5 Lights, which then shoots a railgun round out of its front at 0.5 Lights. How fast is the railgun round going relative to the planet? 0.5+0.5+0.5=1.5 Lights (=~0.832c)

I used [[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/relativ/relmom.html][this website]] for the numbers. (enter 9.99999999999*10^{-1} for mass, and whatever you want for momentum, then look at the velocity at the top)

- 0.5 Lights = 0.45c
- 1L = 0.71c
- 1.5L = 0.832c
- 2L = 0.895c
- 3L = 0.949c
- 4L = 0.970c
- 5L = 0.980c
- 10L = 0.995c
- 20L = 0.99875c
- 50L = 0.999800c
- 100L = 0.999950c
- 1000L = 0.999999501c
