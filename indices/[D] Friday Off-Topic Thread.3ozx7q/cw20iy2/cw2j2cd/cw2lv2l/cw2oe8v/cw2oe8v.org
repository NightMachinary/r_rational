Leave a notarized will well in advance, registered with the police, saying "I have had a vision that I will die at X time and I therefore intend to be on the table."

Of course, that may not play well with the "take out gobs of life insurance" someone proposed below, which seems like a great plan.

Oh, I should also be sure that my will leaves a chunk in an account for me in case I manage to come back.
