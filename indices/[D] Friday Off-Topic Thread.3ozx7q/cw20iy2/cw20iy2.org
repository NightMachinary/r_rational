Suppose you found that you were going to die in a set amount of time: one year. The cause of this death is absolute, and can be neither avoided nor delayed. Until your death you will experience no symptoms nor inconveniences from your condition. In exactly one year you will die immediately and painlessly.

What do you do? Does your answer change if the timeframe is two years? Five?
