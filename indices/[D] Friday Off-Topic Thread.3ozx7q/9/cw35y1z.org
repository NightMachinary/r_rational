*Know someone who can edit fonts?*

In my story "S.I.", I've mentioned an alternative to standard English spelling. I'd like to have a font-file, so artists using GIMP or Photoshop can simply paste some appropriate text in with as little effort as possible. Do you know how to edit a font file, or know someone who knows someone who knows how to edit a font?

(I provided some further details when I asked elsewhere in Reddit, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/typography/comments/3p0zza/seeking_font_for_nonstandard_orthography/][here]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/3p13gq/seeking_font_for_nonstandard_english_orthography/][here]].)
