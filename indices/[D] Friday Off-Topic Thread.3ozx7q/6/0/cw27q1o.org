I was looking over CR's new flock of anime this season and I actually read the description and was interested, but about 45 seconds into the show I stopped because the art was that bad. It's possible this is a good anime, but if I just want a good immersive story I usually read. I go to anime for things I can't get elsewhere, for a beautiful multimedia experience. I do not have patience for anime that neglects the visual or auditory.
