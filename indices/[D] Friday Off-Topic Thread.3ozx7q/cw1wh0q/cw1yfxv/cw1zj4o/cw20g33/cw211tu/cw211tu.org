Oh man, I hadn't even thought about the Sun. Some quick math:

#+begin_example
  f=g(m*m/d^2)
  f=(gravitational constant)(((mass of the sun)*(mass of a person))/(distance from the sun to the earth)^2)
#+end_example

[[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=f%3D%28gravitational+constant%29%28%28%28mass+of+the+sun%29*%28mass+of+a+person%29%29%2F%28distance+from+the+sun+to+the+earth%29%5E2%29][WolframAlpha spits out the unhelpful]]

#+begin_example
  f = 1.2 x 10^32 kg^2 G/au^2
#+end_example

[[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.2%C3%9710%5E32+kilogram+squared+Newtonian+gravitational+constants+per+astronomical+unit+squared&lk=1][Which turns out to be]]

#+begin_example
  0.36 N
#+end_example

So that's not too troublesome, unless my math is terrible, which it might be, or my good friend Wolfram has done me wrong, which he might have.

And yeah, lots of people die and life gets hard. But what better way to set up for a "humanity, fuck yeah" story?
