This is a dramatic violation of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle][equivalence principle]]. You might say, "okay, we've always seen inertial, active gravitational, and passive gravitational mass be equal, but would it be so bad if they weren't?". But the stronger forms of the equivalence principle state something deep: in freefall (i.e. in deep space, or orbiting the Earth, or orbiting the Sun, etc.) you can't tell where you are, unless you cheat by looking outside.

With your counterfactual object, if you're holding it and you let it go in deep space, you'd think it would slooowly drift away from you. If you're orbiting the Earth, you'd think it would fly away quickly. /But how does it know to do that?/ Remember, you're also orbiting the Sun and the galactic center. As soon as you break the equivalence principle, you're basically reintroducing the concept of absolute space.

Greg Egan is one of the few authors I've seen who was able to actually explore the consequences of tweaked physics, and he flipped a single sign. (Asimov's The Gods Themselves dealt with the strong force, a little, but not nearly as rigorously.)
