Newtonian absolute space combined with limited speed of light doesn't make sense. And not in a subtle way either, the problems would be catastrophic. I've seen a nice web page with a couple of striking examples, but I can't find it now.

So, you'd have to scrape the limited speed of light; that immediately gives you a combinatorial explosion of causality (since things interact instantly no matter the distance) and the whole universe falls apart (or maybe it doesn't, but it would certainly not resemble our universe all that much).
