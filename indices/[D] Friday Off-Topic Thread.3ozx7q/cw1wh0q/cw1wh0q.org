Physics question:

The gravitational strength on the ISS is something like 89% compared to the gravitational strength on the surface of the Earth. An astronaut inside the ISS is subject to 0.89g. However, they don't actually feel the effect of this because the ISS itself is accelerating "downward" at 0.89g. These effectively cancel out, so the astronaut experiences weightlessness as a consequence of perpetual freefall (same as you'd experience on the vomit comet).

That I mostly understand.

However, I was trying to wrap my head around the idea of a (counterfactual) object with negative gravitational mass but positive inertial mass. If you're holding onto that object on the surface of the Earth and let go, it would accelerate away from Earth at a rate of 1g, subject to air friction. But on the ISS ... my guess is that an object with negative gravitational mass would "fall" opposite the direction that the ISS was traveling. A hypothetical negative gravity apple would appear to the "floating" astronaut to be accelerating at 0.89g (or possibly 1.78g?) until eventually it hit an interior wall of the ISS, where it would stay pinned in a similar way to how a positive mass apple would stay pinned to the surface of the Earth.

But I have no idea whether I'm working this problem out in the right way or whether what I'm imagining lines up with what physics has to say on the subject (I know that negative gravitational mass isn't really a thing, but the equations must give some sort of output if you include a minus sign on that term).

All that aside, let's say that you're sitting at your computer one day and all of your gravitational mass suddenly has a minus sign in front of it. I would think that gravity's not really holding things together much, so you wouldn't immediately explode. If two molecules have negative gravitational mass do they repel or attract? Assume for the sake of argument that inertial mass stays the same. Are there any other effects (aside from falling towards the ceiling) that I'm missing?
