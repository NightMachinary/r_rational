I believe it's engine (and drivetrain) friction, plus material limits. I don't know anything about cars, but I do know about physics. A car is not a rocket, where only air resistance and rolling resistance would need to be analyzed. The engine is pushing the car, and there are losses inside of the engine. Those losses might be nonlinear, but there's another consideration - stuff can only spin so fast before breaking apart. (CDs maxed out around 50X and hard drives maxed out at 15K, although the latter wasn't as close to material limits.) You can change the gear ratio so that the engine doesn't have to spin as fast to turn the wheels, but then it delivers less torque, and you need a certain amount to overcome the air/rolling resistance, much less to accelerate.
