For people, the answer is, as usual, gravity. imagine you're going however fast. Imagine trying to move your legs fast enough to stay upright. Yeah, it doesn't work. The long and short of it is that we can only move our own bodies so much without getting damaged.

For planes, aside from the whole vibration issue (I don't think it's as much of a problem here) air resistance is a much bigger deal because they're much larger than cars and going much faster. Plus, the engines for the turbofans or propellers can only move so quickly, and at some point they're just not going to be moving those blades relative to the windspeed fast enough for acceleration.
