For most people, the primary problem for fiction writing is word count. An experienced, successful writer is doing work a LOT like a coder does. Scenes are modules. Everything is put together in this way or that to make a story as opposed to a compiled project.

That said, writing variables are a lot more slippery than coding variables, and code is far more exact than writing.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChandlersLaw][Chandler's Law]] isn't that bad because if your lead is doing things to make them enemies, it's entirely plausible for enemies to attack them.

As for a program to recognize plot, characterization, setting... I would say that this would need something very close to a general AI, unless you are talking about 'Tip & Spot' children's books.
