  The second is that National Novel Writing Month starts in about two weeks. NaNo pushes word count hard, which is one of the things that's begun to annoy me about it; once you set word count as the one and only goal, that's what everyone focuses on to the detriment of everything else.

The point of NaNoWriMo is to get people to complete the draft. The biggest hurdle most new writers have is that they don't finish the project -- they either just abandon it, or they keep polishing and polishing instead of writing. NaNoWriMo says "write it first, edit it later."
