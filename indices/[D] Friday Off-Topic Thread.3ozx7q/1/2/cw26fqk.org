try using SMBC's filler-finding method- just count up the nouns. Generally speaking, the more nouns you have, the more things are happening (As more subjects are involved.) On its own this won't produce much useful data, but you can compare your writing in terms of noun density to books you respect to see if you're in the same ballpark. It'll at least stop you from spending too long telling instead of showing.

It should be codable with just a simple script and word bank.
