Relatively speaking, however, it's a lot less important to know

#+begin_quote
  The dog was brown.\\
  The dog was quick.\\
  The fox was lazy.
#+end_quote

Than to know

#+begin_quote
  The dog jumps over the fox.
#+end_quote

In fact, a summary of what a reader would find most important with the sentence could merely mention that there was a fox and a dog. So what fundamentally happens in the sentence (the showing, rather than the telling) can be summed up as an interaction between the two nouns.

Nurbling therefore isn't in any way a perfect or even optimal way to gauge text quality, but it quickly and dirtily gives an estimate of what the readers actually care about-- how often tangible things are mentioned or exist, and therefore how likely they are to interact.
