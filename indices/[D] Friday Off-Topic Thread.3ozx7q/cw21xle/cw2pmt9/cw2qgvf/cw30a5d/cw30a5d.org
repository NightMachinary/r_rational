I tend to agree with you on a personal level, but a lot of writers who are successful generate a lot of scenes that never get used. They free write and then come back later and pick and choose what they want to keep. For free-writing authors, having the guy enter the room with a gun is just to get things moving. It might never make it into the final cut.

Personally, I do not do this much. When I write a scene, it generally stays in the story, though it might get altered significantly.
