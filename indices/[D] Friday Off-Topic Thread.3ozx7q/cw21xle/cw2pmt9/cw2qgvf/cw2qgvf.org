The problem is that there's a lot of shitty advice floating around which emphasizes word count over having a usable draft. Advice like:

- If you're stuck, switch viewpoints to a new character
- If you're stuck, have someone enter the room with a gun
- If you're stuck, skip ahead to the next thing you know happens
- If you're stuck, write out a dream sequence

And these are all great pieces of advice for meeting that 1,667 word per day target, but they're /terrible/ for actually producing a draft. Worse, advice like that helps to train in bad habits. But if you chime in on the NaNo boards to say, "We can't just sacrifice quality entirely, and if you just introduce new plots while forgetting the old ones, you're not any better off than if you'd just dropped one story and began another" then people give you the stink eye.

This will be my fifth year doing NaNo. I do like the concept of getting things out there. I just feel like there's a segment of it that just so of revels in word count and word count alone. People will post things like "here's my great strategy for padding word count" and it just goes unremarked on even though padding word count with filler does nothing more than creating more work in editing while not actually accomplishing anything that gets the text closer to being a first draft.

I do understand the point of NaNo, I just think that focusing solely on word count can severely undercut it.
