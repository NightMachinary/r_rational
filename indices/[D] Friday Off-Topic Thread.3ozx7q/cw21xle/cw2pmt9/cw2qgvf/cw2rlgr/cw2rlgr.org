  I do understand the point of NaNo, I just think that focusing solely on word count can severely undercut it.

Sure, no argument; there are definitely people over-focusing on word count. I would say that's on the people, though. They've lost track of the fact that the goal is (should be) to write a /good/ novel. NaNo could maybe do more to remind people of that, but it's still ultimately on the writer to care about quality, with NaNo there to help provide motivation.
