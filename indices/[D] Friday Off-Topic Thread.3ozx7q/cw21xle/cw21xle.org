This is mildly on-topic (since it's been about writing fiction) but I really wish that there were a better way of getting metrics for the written word. As an author, the best way that I can measure productivity is by "words per day" ... but this is about as helpful of a measurement as "lines of code per day" is for a software engineer. (I have been under managers who seemed to be of the opinion that cleaning 500 lines of code down to 50 represented negative velocity.)

There are two reasons that this comes to mind. The first is that I just finished up a book (minus a few tangential bits) and wanted to see how well I kept my pace. The second is that National Novel Writing Month starts in about two weeks. NaNo pushes word count hard, which is one of the things that's begun to annoy me about it; once you set word count as the one and only goal, that's what everyone focuses on to the detriment of everything else. You start getting advice like "well, if you don't know where things are going, just have someone come in shooting!" which is decent for getting more words in place but terrible for writing something that anyone would want to read.

I'm left wondering whether there's a better way to qualify authorial output. Reviews are probably one way, if you could get enough of them, but that assumes that you can even get /one/ person to read what you've written, which can by itself be difficult. You could maybe make a new metric that takes into account word choice, integrating the Fleisch-Kinkaid Grade Level or Reading Ease Score, but that follows the same problem of having a metric that's not really indicative of quality, only this time instead of /quantity/ we'd be emphasizing /complexity/. Anytime you introduce a metric that doesn't precisely measure what you want, you risk shooting for the thing that's being measured rather than the original goal.

What I'd really like (and what I'd try to write if I thought it was remotely possible using existing linguistics libraries, which I don't think it is) is a computer program that would at least look for things like Characterization or Plot or Setting. I /don't/ think doing this is a problem you'd need general AI for, at least if all you wanted was an actually-useful result, but I do think it's complex enough that it's a great deal of man-hours away (and beyond my programming and linguistics skills, which are only at a bachelor's level).
