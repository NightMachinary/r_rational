In Scrivener (which is basically like an IDE for novel writing) I break whatever I'm writing down into chapters and scenes, so I guess the only thing left would be sizing if I wanted to apply agile methodologies to it.

The problem is that the comparison breaks down. Writing isn't really about getting through plot points, though you do have to do that. Writing is about trying to make someone feel something. So the thing you really want to measure, if you could measure it, would be "did I make someone feel something".

So if I get to a point in my outline where it says "Joseph sees that his fiance is cheating on him" then sure, it's easy enough to get some words in place, but the actual equivalent to story requirement is that I want to reader to feel like they've just gotten punched in the chest right along with Joseph, with all the indignity, emasculation, etc. that entails. Or the outline says "David begins to eat the fingers of his left hand", which is again easy to put down on the page, but hard to get so that it actually provokes a squeamish sense of lust (or horror, or whatever else the intended effect is). And more than being hard to do, it's hard to assign points to, or split into smaller tasks, or even to judge whether it's been done correctly at all.
