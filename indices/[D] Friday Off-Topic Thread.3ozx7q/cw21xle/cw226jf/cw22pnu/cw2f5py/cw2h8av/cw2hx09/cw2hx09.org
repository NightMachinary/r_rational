I agree, Doing my MS in Computer Science, my BS in English, you can only do so much to asses how hard something will be or how many rewrites it will take, like an over-complicated module, that should be refactored, but you can give yourself a best guess of how much you can finish in a given period. I don't write except, academically and professionally, but I do code, and I usually like to try to plan what I'll do next session at the end of a given session and comment out some skeletons. As a possible suggestion dividing your work up into more managable chucks of what is being, planned, written, and revised so you are working on three pieces of writing each sitting may help give you more hedons and avoid ugh fields. On a practical level this gives you more time to "marinate" on each piece, it lets you touch everything three times and puts you in a position to gain distance from your mistakes so you can recognize them.
