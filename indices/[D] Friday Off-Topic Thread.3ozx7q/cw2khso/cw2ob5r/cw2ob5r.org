At some point, the force provided by the engine becomes equal to the force of the various frictions (air friction, friction between the road and the car wheels, friction between internal components, friction between axles and the rest of the car, etc.)

Plus, at high speeds, cars not built to tolerate those speeds will begin to vibrate as their internals shake, and that slows them down more as energy is transformed into oscillation.
