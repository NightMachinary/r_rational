Thinking of a running human, we can simplify to:

1. Push off ground with one foot.
2. While that foot is not in contact with the ground, move it forward.
3. When it makes contact with the ground, push again.

So, the foot needs to be moved forward before it makes contact with the ground. As you get moving faster, you have less time to do this.

If you image running in lower gravity, pushing off will cause you to spend more time in the air, giving you more time to move the foot forward, increasing top speed.

(This is conjecture).

EDIT: Another limit: The foot can only stay in contact with the ground for a limited amount of time, during which the push needs to happen. As you go faster, time of contact decreases. If you're moving at 1000mph, and have a stride of one meter, your foot will only be in contact with the ground for 2.2ms.
