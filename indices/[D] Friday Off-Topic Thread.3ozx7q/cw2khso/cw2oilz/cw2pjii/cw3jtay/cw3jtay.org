When you push off the ground, how much energy is converted into your overall velocity, and how much is absorbed in the foot/ground collision? At a certain point, the energy you're putting into your movements will equal that being absorbed by the ground. Your max speed is that at which your peak physical output is in equilibrium with the ground.

This kinda suggests that terrain, shoes, wind speed, etc, all play a role. I'm not sure how big a deal they are in practice; I mean, running shoes exist, and athletes train in particular environments, but I'm not sure if the advantages are marginal (enough to decide who wins gold and who wins silver, or who wins the "not eaten by the bear" award) or noticeable on a mundane level.

(I wonder if a specially shaped track--say, slanted treads or something--could facilitate higher speeds, assuming the spacing perfectly matches the runner's stride. I doubt it'd be much if any gain; if anything, perfect friction on a flat surface would probably be better, so that it can be modeled as a perfectly elastic collision. On that note, angle: what direction does the energy go? DO you optimize for pushing forward? Or is an angle that gets more airtime better, so long as it isn't too high? I imagine someone's found a way to estimate the optimal angle. Actually, there's probably plenty of information out there for competitive runners that can better explain the inefficiencies.)
