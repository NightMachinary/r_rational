Think about what's involved in running. You have to contract muscles to propel yourself forward, but they can only contract so fast and with so much strength. Then you need to expend more energy to swing your leg in front of you for the next step. A huge amount of energy needs to be dumped into the legs just to stay at constant velocity, unlike a rolling car which has small rolling and air resistance. Since we have a limit to how much energy we can expend, that limits our top speed.
