In the process of writing Induction (my superhero novel) I'm dealing with a lot of characters that can apply forces or acceleration to something in an unusual way. This got me to the question "why do things have top speeds?"

A human can accelerate at X m/s^{2,} but stops accelerating long before air friction would be the limiting factor. Cars ditto -- what stops your average Toyota from accelerating past ~100 mph? (That might actually be a built-in speed limiter; not sure.)

I feel like I should know this, but I'm not coming up with an answer.
