Okay, so if my story starts with:

#+begin_quote
  One day, all humans had their gravitational mass become negative.
#+end_quote

Then things pretty much follow from that as I would expect? People accelerating up into the sky, landing on the ceiling if they're indoors, etc.? We /probably/ don't end up with them dying for other reasons or some weird stuff I was reading on Wikipedia about infinite acceleration?

(Appreciate the help, by the way. Physics is not my strong suit.)
