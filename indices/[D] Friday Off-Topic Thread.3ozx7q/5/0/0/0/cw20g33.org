A massive (heheh) chunk of people would die, some from falling up into the sky, others then starving from being unable to go outside. Think in terms of one billion and more.

On the dayside of the planet, people may simply be crushed from the sun's antigravity, and people watching a sunrise or sunset might be thrown sideways. It depends on the strength of the sun's gravity (this is exactly like an apple and the ISS: we don't feel the sun's gravity because we are in orbit), which I would have to calculate. On the nightside, anyone outside would definitely fall into the sky.

The acceleration alone may be enough to kill everyone immediately, and then there's the sun's part, not to /mention/ the galactic center's. You can handwave that away for the sake of the setting; after all, you already have negative mass and spontaneous human sign-swapping. However, 'infinite acceleration' is not at all a problem. Many humans would very swiftly become dead astronauts.

Given survival of anyone inside, carports with roofs would be the only viable method of transport, and the only means of getting food. Any conceivable way of weighting yourself down or tethering yourself to terra firma would be used. Mountaineers would have an advantage. :o) The third world definitely would not. There would definitely be people surviving for months afterward, but long-term does not look good. There would probably be small pockets of people surviving for years afterward, but I would have to think harder to figure out who. Robots would become very popular, assuming research and development could continue.

There is a story about spontaneous weird gravity, sideways gravity, posted here. It was very good.
