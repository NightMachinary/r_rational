A negatively massed apple would accelerate at 1.78g (the antigravity, and then the centrifugal acceleration of the orbit), with whatever (little?) Coriolis effect there is, to the space-side wall of the ISS.

Gravity does not hold together small objects like humans, and it does not pull together individual molecules. Magnetism, the strong force, and the weak force are ridiculously powerful compared to gravity. It's safe to say the effects would be negligible (although I wouldn't want to test this without a good theory of quantum gravity).

Negative masses would attract each other. F = G ⋅ m_1 ⋅ m_2 / r^{2} . Change one mass, and you have a repulsion. Change both, and you have an attraction. So it's really not /negative/ mass, it's more like left-hand vs. right-hand mass.
