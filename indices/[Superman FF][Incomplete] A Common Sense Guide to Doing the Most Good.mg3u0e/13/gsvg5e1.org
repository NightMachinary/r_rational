So it occurs to me that the central conflict here is not Clark figuring out the solution to the ethics dilemma. The conflict in this story about Clark Kent and Lex Luther is the (secret, hidden) one between Clark and Lex. The ending presents us with a plausible scenario in which Lex Luther has hijacked Superman, but with just enough hope (not only dislike on Clark's part which Luther likely knows, but some covert surveillance of Lex which plausibly Lex may not have control over) that there's tension. I don't expect AW to expand on this, but if he were to, I think that the natural locus for the plot is Clark's slow downward spiral into, and eventual attempt to escape, a hell guided by Lex Luther.

This reminds me of portions of the television series Hannibal, in which Hannibal provides the protagonist therapy. Or of HPMOR - when I first read it, I had a pdf which ended on a chapter somewhere in the 90s, after the shocking-character-death and before trolls and unicorns, and I thought the last chapter in the pdf was the actual ending, with Harry unknowingly the apprentice to the Sith Lord and the implications clear enough to end it on that note.
