Great fic, I'm a sucker for "somewhat implausibly good, motivated and powerful person changes the world" stories.

Deciding what the heck to *do* with MoSI's resources kinda reminds me of issues EAs are having right now with how to spend the [[https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/20/22335209/sam-bankman-fried-joe-biden-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism][ludicrous]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Ventures][amounts]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation][of money]] now circulating in the space of EAish charities. Fun to think about what you would do with a trillion dollars or more of resources and an extremely unique set of skills.

I liked the theme of how much you try to work out yourself, versus deferring to experts whose analysis you can barely understand - and who may have their own agenda. Again it shadows what goes on in EA spaces.
