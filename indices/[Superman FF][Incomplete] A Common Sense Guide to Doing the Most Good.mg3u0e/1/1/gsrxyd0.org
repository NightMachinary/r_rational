I think it's worth noting that there are limits on what outcome Luthor can manipulate him to. Not /big/ limits, but unlike normal patsies to installing a power hungry dictator if Clark stops wanting to support Luthor and instead tries to topple him, well, that's it, good game Lex. He /can/ put the ai back in the box, albeit not costlessly. And there's a lot you can do with the sunk cost fallacy and rationalization but that only goes so far, especially since Lex can't stop Superman from speaking to others unless superman agrees to it.
