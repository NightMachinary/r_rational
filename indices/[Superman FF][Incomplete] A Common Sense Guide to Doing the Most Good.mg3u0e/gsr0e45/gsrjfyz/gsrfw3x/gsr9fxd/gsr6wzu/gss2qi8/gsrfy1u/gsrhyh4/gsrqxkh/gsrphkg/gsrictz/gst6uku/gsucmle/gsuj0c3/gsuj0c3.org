Possibly a good motive for Luthor in this story is to find a way to take or copy Superman's powers for himself, rather than simply killing Superman.

Killing Superman because he /might/ become an existential threat (cf AW's /The Metropolitan Man/) becomes an increasingly stupid motivation, as the number of Superman-level entities proliferate. I mean, why the fuck not kill Green Lantern too? Same reasoning applies. Once there's a dozen or so of them, killing Superman would achieve /nothing/ to make the world safer, and would obviously make the world /less/ safe since many of those S-class entities are obviously far less moral (and from Evil's point of view, manipulable) than he is.
