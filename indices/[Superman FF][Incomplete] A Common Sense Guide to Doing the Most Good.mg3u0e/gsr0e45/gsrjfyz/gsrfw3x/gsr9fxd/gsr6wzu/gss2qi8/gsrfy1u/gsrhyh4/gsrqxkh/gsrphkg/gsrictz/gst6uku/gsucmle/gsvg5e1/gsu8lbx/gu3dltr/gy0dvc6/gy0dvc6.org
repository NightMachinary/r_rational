It would be useful to do a test run landing an asteroid on the moon in a spot that would be useful for constructing a moonbase.

Successfully landing the asteroid would put Supes at ease for the real thing, provide useful data to make the real thing more effective.

An asteroid conveniently placed on the moon also has economic value either as a place to extract resources from it, or as storage for it to be later moved to Earth.
