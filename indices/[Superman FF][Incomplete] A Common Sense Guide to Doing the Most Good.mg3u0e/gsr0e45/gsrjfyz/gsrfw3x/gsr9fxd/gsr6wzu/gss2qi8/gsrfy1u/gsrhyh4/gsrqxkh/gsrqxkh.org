I really enjoyed this, though the big missing part of the effective altruism argument is, obviously, personal satisfaction: Jon Kent gained great personal satisfaction from selling popcorn. Of course you know this, but it's not quite loud enough in the story. This version of Superman is completely denying himself personal satisfaction.

I think you can progress it further by introducing at least one, probably two, other perspectives: Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince. Barry Allen (cf The Ballad) and J'onn Jonzz (what use is personal INT when you can leverage /everyone's/ INT; imagine a Martian Manhunter as smart as the sum of everyone in a 50m radius) might be interesting to add in too, especially if that “asteroid” turns out to be a similarly INT-boosted Brainiac.

Which just seems to be the obvious-as-hell foreshadowing: Brainiac is the perfect adversary for INT-boosted Superman, because Brainiac canonically is ten times smarter than Superman, Luthor, or Batman, and yet /still/ has reasoned that the best way for it to act, is to be a dick to everybody. (And perhaps it is correct; iron sharpens iron, and He Who Comes Next ... DARKSEID ... the most effective possible anti-altruist ... needs to be fought by experienced heroes, not noobs.)

Have you read Ted Chiang's /Understand/? That, for me, is the gold standard of writing super intelligent characters.

Also (re)read the classic Astro City story with Samaritan and Winged Victory having a conversation on a date.
