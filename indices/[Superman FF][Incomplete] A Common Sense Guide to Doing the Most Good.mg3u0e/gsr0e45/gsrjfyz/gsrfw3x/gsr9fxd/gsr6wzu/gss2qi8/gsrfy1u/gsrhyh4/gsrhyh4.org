So first of [[/u/Roneitis]] is entirely right---writing an ending for this would mean coming up with a conclusive answer, and that would completely change the nature of the piece.

I do have...uh, it turned into a cluster of related additional arguments...to contribute, here. I'm pretty sure I've heard forms of this in the rationalist community before---I'm afraid I can't say where, I'm less well-read and less involved in the community than I might be, and I don't habitually keep citation notes of things I pick up by osmosis. That said, lemme try to attack this from a few different angles---and these may not all be aimed at precisely the same central point, though I hope they're at least circling the same region of concepts:

I basically don't buy that if the quants actually did their job right, the choice would be as clear-cut as Lex thinks and Superman fears. Trust is difficult to quantify, and critically /being observed quantifying trust breeds mistrust/. I suspect that if the quants did, on running all their analyses, come down on Lex's side and MoSI went ahead, they'd look back 5-10 years later from either a pseudo-benevolent 1984 scenario or a starkly divided world of MoSI and a sort of "give me liberty or give me death" opposition coalition and wonder where it all went wrong...

/Perhaps/ ---perhaps! This is not certain!---MoSI's scientists and ethicists and quants can do a better job than the rest of humanity at deciding how the world should be run. Certainly they can do a better job than the worst of the worst, the dictatorships and such. But they cannot act on that without also, in a certain sense, legitimizing /everyone else/ acting like /they/ know best how the world should be run. The amount of backlash that kind of intervention is likely to provoke from well-meaning moderates who don't actually know what they're doing seems to me like it might /far/ outweigh the benefits of wiping out the obvious evils.

Re: both of the above, of course they would do their best to do as much as they can subtly. The thing about that is that /secrets always come out eventually/, and the more of them you have the angrier people get when they find out. (Or, well, maybe I have a little too much fiction on the brain saying "always", but, "often", and the backlash is potentially enormous.)

Short and pithy but, I think, not worthless: Don't be Cauldron. What good is saving humanity if you give up your humanity to do it? "It's for your own good", 'nuff said. Etc. etc. etc. (Yeah, the Cauldron example specifically is more extreme than I think even Lex wants MoSI to be, but I think some of the same lessons, about how "making hard choices" can so easily turn into "being a colossal power-tripping asshole---/or being perceived that way and reacted to that way even if it's not true/" still apply...)

Note that I don't think the implied path Superman is on right now is correct either. For instance given the example with scouting for Tomahawk missiles, a proposal: Assign whatever the actuarial value of a life is (/not/ the incremental cost-to-save-a-life, which is much lower) to each person killed by a military operation, and have MoSI "fine" that military accordingly (not to take the fine money by force, but to refuse to work for anyone associated with them until it is paid). Alternatively, just declare the killing people is /not fucking okay/ and if you fire missiles Superman will shoot them down. Then offer the service of "enforced negotiation"---honestly it would probably take Superman less time to just go /capture/ the people who would have been killed by the missile strikes than the cost of the missiles (15min of Supes' time is a /lot/). Then bring them to a neutral location under the guarantee that both sides get to go home unharmed if they can't come to some agreement.

Mind you this is only the barest beginnings of a start and would fail horribly as written---I leave it to MoSI's crowd of ethicists, political scientists, diplomats, etc. to hammer it into working order :). But the basic idea is, simply put: /act like heroes./ Be /smart/ about it, do all the EA stuff too, but when intervening in politics, don't do so as politicians. Be transparent, even if it allows your "enemies" a clearer picture of your actions---but be quick to demand transparency in return and hammer the point home if people refuse. Draw clear bright lines in the sand, even if /in this case/ you might get a better result by bending them. Set an example, expect others to follow, and protect them from those who would try to hurt them for doing so.

--------------

Oh, I also think this piece downplays the impact of market disruption, both on MoSI and on everyone else, specifically when discussing the asteroid thing. When operating on that kind of scale, money is barely even relevant. The question is, what can be /done/ with those resources, and what benefits will those actions provide? Who will need to be involved in them and what else could they (/would/ they) be doing instead? Will those changes end up actually /hurting/ the people you're trying to raise money for charity to help? Because I feel like they really might... Blech, I'm grasping at something here that I don't fully understand---maybe someone with more economics background can do better?
