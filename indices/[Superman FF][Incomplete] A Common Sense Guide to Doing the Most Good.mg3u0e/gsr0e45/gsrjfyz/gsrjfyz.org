You say that this doesn't have an ending. I think it might imply an ending after all, and a rather tragic one at that.

We know---from a meta perspective---that Luthor is evil, although Superman in-text only knows that he dislikes him. Luthor admits that:

1) He would lie, kill, and destroy if he had Superman's powers, supposedly to create a greater good.

2) From his point of view, there should be essentially no difference between him having Superman's powers and Clark having Superman's powers. They should both be doing the same thing, which is what Luthor wants (ostensibly improving quality-adjusted-life-years as a metric)

We know that Luthor is smarter than Clark. We know, based on Clark's observations, that Luthor's charitable impulses prior to joining MoSI were a sham, used primarily for leverage and virtue signaling.

The very obvious conclusion is that Luthor is going to manipulate Clark into following a moral framework that suits Luthor's ends. And, if we draw an unfortunate parallel to the AI-In-A-Box experiment, we have to assume he will succeed. Luthor is Clark's psychologist and has executive powers to decide when he talks to Clark, and for how long.

In that alone, he has far more success than canon Luther ever did, and far greater destructive potential. The opportunity to befriend and manipulate Superman should have been the first thing a power-hungry Luthor thought of, not something reserved for fanfiction.

Admittedly, the difference in intelligence is not as large it is in the AI-Box experiment---Luthor is only mortal, after all.

...but it just might be enough. And I think the implication, as the story closes, is that it /will/ be enough.
