I was doing a usual overview of stuff that's in my drafts folder, and saw this sitting there for the umpteenth time, still without a proper ending, or really even a plot to speak of. I think when I wrote the first bit of this, maybe five years ago, I was intending it to be a companion piece to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17356310/chapters/40838042][/The Metropolitan Man/]], dealing with epistemic humility and dealing with experts when you, yourself, are not an expert, and the toll that always pushing yourself to do the most good can have, and ... it's kind of not there, and nothing that I want to try to salvage for spare parts in any future project. Because there's no proper plot, I'm fine with putting it up, especially because it has a particular kind of density that I like. However, you should be duly warned that there's not a satisfying wrap up to this.
