Bringing in some of the larger Superman-related DCCU, BrainiAC makes the logical end-villain, Supergirl and Kandor would change MoSI's outlook dramatically, and the asteroid being Kryptonite would add a more immediate drama than the existential issues Luthor raised in this chapter.

One thing this Superman has avoided is being seen as the wrestler to beat to be the big dog. Anyone who tries to take him out is obviously a total jerk wad and bad guy.

What it has cost him is being an inspiration, as opposed to being merely a good man. And just as it looks like he might be heading back toward becoming the symbol, Luthor seems to be ready to convince him to be the full utilitarian.

Surely this Clark has read books of wisdom and morality, and has come across the theory that traditional moralities exist with some ridiculousnesses because they solved rare side-effects in opaque ways. If so, he has grounds to refuse Luthor's path heading into less moral utilitarianism, even if he can't prove it the best idea.
