feels like tagging this as incomplete or playing up that side of it is a little silly, because if not for that you really wouldn't know, and it seems a shame that people might be put off and miss out. It sounds like the story turned out differently to how you intended, but I don't think "there isn't a satisfying answer" is the same as "there isn't a satisfying ending"; I found the ending satisfying simply in resolving to sit down and try to solve a problem that seems unsolvable. Any presentation of an actual considered solution would undercut that theme imo!
