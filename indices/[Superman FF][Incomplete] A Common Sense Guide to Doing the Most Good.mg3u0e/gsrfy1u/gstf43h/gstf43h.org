My experience with posting shorter, more ambiguous stuff that doesn't follow a conventional plot structure is that I'll always get comments wondering where the rest of the story is, or people feeling that there should have been another 80K words to round out the story. In this case, I think there's quite a bit of merit to it, but I did post it because I thought it /kind of/ worked on its own, or at least had some interesting explorations of ideas. I don't know, I would rather that people don't get their hopes up and be pleasantly surprised.
