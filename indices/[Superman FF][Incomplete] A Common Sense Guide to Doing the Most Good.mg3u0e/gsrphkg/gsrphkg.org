One thing I found interesting about the piece was the way, intentionally or not, that it ignored second-order effects. Superman has destroyed the spaceflight industry (or rather, has replaced it with himself)- presumably there is no quantification of the benefit to humanity to develop new spaceflight technology, either in terms of "Superman will do it forever" or "there's no issue with having to restart spaceflight decades later with a bunch of satellites you can't reach or replace". The asteroid, as well- it may make MOSI a hojillion dollars to spend charitably, but it will also essentially eradicate the mining industry in the rest of the world. Possibly that would shift MOSI's spending to help the communities that now abruptly have no industry, though there's no acknowledgement of that.

More nebulously, MOSI is essentially replacing the "welfare" role of governments (at least governments where the problems are "low-hanging fruit") due to their larger resources and efficacy- what does it do to have governments that don't have a need to take care of their constituent people even if they could because MOSI will do it and do it better? Can that be quantified?

This is all, of course, getting far afield from what the piece was trying to do, but I can't but draw the parallel between the likely effects of MOSI's dominance in the areas they focus in and comic book-Luthor's cry against Superman- that by solving problems for us, he makes humanity reliant on him instead of humanity improving. MOSI has a plan for keeping Superman running- do they have a plan for what to do if he dies?
