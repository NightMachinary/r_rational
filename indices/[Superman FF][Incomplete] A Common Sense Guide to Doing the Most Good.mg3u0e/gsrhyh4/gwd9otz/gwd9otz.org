  I basically don't buy that if the quants actually did their job right, the choice would be as clear-cut as Lex thinks and Superman fears. Trust is difficult to quantify, and critically being observed quantifying trust breeds mistrust . I suspect that if the quants did, on running all their analyses, come down on Lex's side and MoSI went ahead, they'd look back 5-10 years later from either a pseudo-benevolent 1984 scenario or a starkly divided world of MoSI and a sort of "give me liberty or give me death" opposition coalition and wonder where it all went wrong...

Yeah, my reaction when reading this was that it MoSI sounds like it has some institutional problems; I would not take the word of the quants as gospell.

For instance, the quants seem to be pushing for direct landing of the asteroid instead of space-mining because it has lower capital costs, but... come on. They're talking about an asteroid that can give them more value than the entire US GDP; that will give them so much money that it's hard to predict what the economy will look like once they start introducing that much money in it, and they're starting to think about what to do once they hit diminishing returns on the very idea of "spending money".

With all that in mind, they want to pick the option with increased X-risks because it's cheaper? I'm extremely skeptical of the thought process there.
