Hey everyone, welcome back! This chapter was written with the help of the Penny Dreadful soundtrack, particularly [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxs3wR1J8Xo][Street. Horse. Smell. Candle]], starting at the line, "We shall go together." I often wish I could add music cues to certain parts of the story, and think I might try to do it on my website, where I have more control of the formatting. I've been working on adding more content to my site anyway, particularly blog posts. Feel free to check them out, if you haven't already.

Thanks for reading, and the continued support of my patrons. As usual, all feedback welcome!
