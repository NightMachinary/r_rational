Setting the stage for Mewtwo's escape! I like it. I don't think Giovanni is the kind of person to try and cripple a being created to destroy the stormbirds by forcing it to be dependent on the medication. There's far too many risks involved when creating Mewtwo had used up so many of his resources already.

Secondly, I forsee Giovanni being more comfortable with Mewtwo in the future and moving the tank to a higher location, nearer to the surface for him. If Mewtwo is ever to fight the songbirds then it needs to have its full power about itself.
