I suspect that Dr. Fuji may be Mewtwo's "father." His kindly demeanor from the games lends itself towards a sort of "I always wanted a child of my own" sentimentality, and would explain his termination from the project, as Giovanni found him to be getting too attached.\\
Not that Fuji could only have had ethical qualms about the Mewtwo project if he was related to Mewtwo, just that it might be a path towards regret.
