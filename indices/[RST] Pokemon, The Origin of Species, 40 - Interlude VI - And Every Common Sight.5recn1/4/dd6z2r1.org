Alright I have a theory*. Remember how Mewtwo was made from DNA taken from a human donor? What if it turns out that Red's dad was that donor? Then Red and Mewtwo would be kind of like siblings or something. Could lead to Mewtwo feeling a bit less lonely.

There is absolutely zero evidence for this, but there also isn't any real evidence against it. It balances out, so I estimate a 50% chance that this is true. Coincidentally, this is also my estimated probability for me winning the lottery.
