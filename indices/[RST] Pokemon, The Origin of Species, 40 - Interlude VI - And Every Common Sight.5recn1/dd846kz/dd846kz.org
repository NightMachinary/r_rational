Cannot wait for the Mewtwo plotline to enter the main picture.

Though I am still frustrated that Giovanni dropped the Mewtwo ball as hard as he has. He gave that whole "yo, we gonna end death together as bros, you with me?" speech and I was so hyped, he was like the best parts of Quirrel and Harry combined. And now Mewtwo despises him.

Mewtwo is ridiculously empathetic in this chapter, I'll give you that. But I fear what he's gonna do when he gets out of the box.
