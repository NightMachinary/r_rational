It's chapters like this that have me chomping at the bit for Red to progress in his psychic training. Psychic powers seem to offer such a unique perspective, as befitting of a whole new sense, and I can't wait to see how Red's own views shift once he begins to be able to sense the minds of other humans and Pokemon.

Will he begin to detest battling, being capable of feeling the pain of battle alongside his Pokemon? Or will his ability to sense the apparently vast gap between the minds of men and the minds of beast only strengthen his belief in the humanity's right to dominion?

What does the mind of a legendary (e.g a Storm Bird) feel like? Are they 'too big' to affect by ordinary psychic means, massive mental behemoths capable of being felt from miles away? Or are all non-psychic legendaries dark, meaning they can't be tamed by purely mental means? Will psychic pokemon be nicer to him, given that to their senses he is more similar to them than other humans, or will they consider him an even greater threat?

For that matter, what are the ramifications of his abilities on his standing in normal human society? We've seen from Misty's interlude that psychics are treated, to some degree, as specalists (a psychic being required to finalize the trial of a Renegade) but are there any downsides? Any discrimination? Is Red even allowed within a square mile of a casino?

I've seen so many Pokemon fics that deal with telepathy just decide to make Pokemon just voiceless sentients, capable of purely coherent, language based thought. I've seen even more basically ignore telepathy to focus on telekinesis, or teleporting or stuff like that. But the way you write Mewtwo gives me hope that you are going to handle the topic so much better than that, and I can't wait to see what you do next :)

Keep up the good work!
