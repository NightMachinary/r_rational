The duplicate was here:

#+begin_quote
  Day 5 Bombing groups A-AA: Cover the advance of the armored units. Bombing groups AA-AD: Await orders."
#+end_quote

As to making it more clear, maybe something like this?

(Regular) All H-class battleships: Begin shelling at 0200 to cover landfall, focus initially on AAA batteries.\\
All bombing groups: Begin airstrikes at 0300.

(Italics) Sir, forward recon reports a major enemy push coming. We've sighted a naval force, mix of battleships and transports; looks like they're trying for a land assault. There's a bomber group immediately behind them, and at current speed they'll arive an hour after the ships.
