Thanks for the feedback!

I'll be a bit shameless and mention that I've written another story for this week's challenge, so you should check it out. :)

And as far as a novel goes, if I were to expand, it would have to transcend any domestic threats. It'd probably become more about inter-Organization conflict or external threats. As it stands, the local country is their territory. And there's nothing to be done. Only reason it isn't out of hand is because of the one per person rule and the implicit unknown payments. It's easier for a noble to hire some mercenaries than to make a request. You don't want to know what happens if you don't pay the Organization.
