A great story. (found it through EY's post history, not surprisingly) Thank you so much for writing it! I hope you'll publish this one and many more after it.

Found one typo, "we can get going Gavin" - comma missing.

It would've made a fine beginning of a fine novel. Or, rather, as someone Gavin-like might've put it -

Too bad it probably wouldn't make a novel. The protagonists are too powerful; nothing could ever be a challenge for them. Indeed. Such a pity. Sigh. I could be a good beta-reader for that one, too.
