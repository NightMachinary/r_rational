The current conversation surrounding Go and AI made me recall this short story I read once. "Rational fiction" wasn't a thing in 2003, but I'd call it that from my perspective now.

Admittedly, it requires a bit of willing suspension of disbelief beyond just the setting elements (e.g. that all the informational updates to the board state can be modelled as updating a single purely-local battle, rather than finding an entirely new isomorphic matrix projection for an "infinite" updated digraph.) Assuming they manage that somehow, it's a cute story.
