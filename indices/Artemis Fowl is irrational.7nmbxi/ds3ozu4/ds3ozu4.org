I remember AF as being the first time I noticed a "smart" protagonist not actually being smart. There are a lot of convenient/unbelievable coincidences, and if even one of those failed he would be left looking a lot less smart and a lot more dead. Like if he was wrong about [[#s][]] in the first book, his method of escaping being something that makes no sense from a physical perspective. It's a shame, because the premise is similar to a rational work.
