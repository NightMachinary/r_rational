  That might work, though they would need to vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies to be inaudible as well.

The page you linked to doesn't support this. As noted by the OP, they would need to vibrate with an amplitude greater than their body width, and the linked page concludes that would basically reduce them to paste within fractions of a second.
