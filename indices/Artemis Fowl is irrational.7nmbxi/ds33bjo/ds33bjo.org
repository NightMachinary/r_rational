You have a problem with fairies vibrating to become invisible, but not with HJPEV having an invisibility cloak that doesn't render him blind? Come on, you have to make some allowances for fantasy. Even HJPEV does (after ranting about witches turning into cats).

After all, if the author knew an actual, scientifically sound method to become invisible, he would be pioneering its development instead of writing about it (according to Lucius Malfoy atleast).
