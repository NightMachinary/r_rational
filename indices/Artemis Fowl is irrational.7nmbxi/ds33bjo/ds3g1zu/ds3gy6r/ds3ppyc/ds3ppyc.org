What if they vibrate in such a way that their surface sort of bunches up into a visible light metamaterial? Like a standing wave across their entire skin which causes it to route light around them somehow? Almost certainly impossible, and if it is possible it would require truly staggering amounts of processing power to figure out exactly how to vibrate varying parts of the body to constantly produce the effect, but it at least uses known physical phenomena.

The one upside of this is that magic is already shown to have insane processing power and the ability to affect nanoscale physical changes. Healing someone back to life from cryonic stasis would never work otherwise. Actually, that suggests an additional mechanism of action as well. The magic could just be physically manipulating the skin and carried objects of the subject to create the metamaterial effect, and it just feels like vibration due to rapidly shifting skin/other surfaces.
