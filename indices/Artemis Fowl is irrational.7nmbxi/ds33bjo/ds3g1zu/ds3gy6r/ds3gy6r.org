Pity. A dude can only try his best at rationalizing a book he's never read---if canon decides to fuck it up, ain't much I can do about that. If I really wanted to stretch it, I could try saying that the fairies are multi-dimensional in nature, and enough of their vibrations happen to be taking them out-of-phase to limit their opacity, but that's a reach. Well, really the whole thing was a reach to begin with. Oh well.
