But there's the problem, while in HPMoR magic's left as a black box for HJPEV to explore, Artemis Fowl goes out of its way to explain magical effects...and does so poorly. Shielding, the vibration-to-be-invisible effect, was even explained as a /biological/ phenomenon by fairy hearts pumping blood really fast and making their bodies shake.

Also tag [[/u/seylerius]], since their explanation is unfortunately contradicted by canon.
