Yeah. It was in one of the later books, and honestly the neutering of magic is something I never liked in the series. In the first one, it's strongly implied that fairies have lots of powers and the two that Artemis runs into are on their last dregs of magic, almost running on empty. After that, it's stated that the three or four we saw are the only ones. It takes several books for warlocks to be introduced, and after that the only warlock character is kept to the side for being too powerful.
