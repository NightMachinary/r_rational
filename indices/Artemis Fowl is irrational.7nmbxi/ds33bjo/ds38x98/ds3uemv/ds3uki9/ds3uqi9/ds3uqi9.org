Yeah, but I get the impression that the cloak is supposed to be more impressive than that. It's not just hard to see. It's next to impossible. All the fanworks I've seen that talked about tracking it did so by tracking the area of nothingness because the cloak was too good. Also, you can have three different people under the cloak looking in three different directions and still see out.
