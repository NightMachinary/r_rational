I recall a TV series ("The Invisible Man") which solved this issue rather neatly; the invisibility in that story was provided by a material which bent visible light around the person, while at the same time allowing him to see by converting /ultraviolet/ light to visible for his eyes.

(The protagonist could also be seen in either ultraviolet or infrared while invisible).
