The difference is between handwaving it and providing a verifiably bad explanation. Only way the vibration theory holds up is if it's a multi-dimensional vibration that pops them in and out of phase with 3D reality, I'd wager, but that would create other problems. With the handwave on the cloak, you're free to sub in different ideas until one /works/. Maybe the cloak duplicates photons temporarily? Maybe it teleports all photons except the ones which would hit your eyes, and duplicates those for you to see with?
