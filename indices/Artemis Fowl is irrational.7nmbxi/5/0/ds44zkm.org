Agreed. I've only read the first book, but I remember being frustrated by that induction chain: [[#s][]]

I remember being unsatisfied by other aspects of the book, but my memories have blurred too much to remember anything concrete. A theme I see running through (some of) the comments under-this thread-starter: the question of whether pseudoscience is incompatible with a work being rationalistic. Let's see... Deus ex machinas are an issue, when the non-character world itself behaves abnormally for no (/or a narrative-driven) reason. Other than that, for a world treated as consistent, I've thought of rationalism as dealing with the choices characters make within that world. Pseudoscience can put one's teeth on edge, but if we treat it as the narrator reaching into the world and the minds of the characters like Descartes's demon--or, put it another way, if we treat the world as a similar-but-very-different alternative universe where the pseudoscience is actually how that universe's physical laws work--there isn't much difference between it and a black box, or rather the blackness of the box just hides from our eyes what the author might unsatisfyingly choke on otherwise... it's of course preferable when an author can write an internally-consistent system which is elegant in its simplicity, but an internally-consistent system which makes no sense can still be navigated by reasoning characters, whether noticing themselves that it makes not sense or inured to it through familiarity. Once the system stops being internally consistent, something which worked once not working (for no reason every discovered/explained) that's a problem with the world's rational-fiction status, and if the system has allowed something which characters then never make use of again despite a need for it then that's a problem with the characters...

Considering now that one could arguably have enjoyable fiction with rational characters trying to survive/progress in a crazy nonsensical world, trying and failing to make sense of anything (and maybe giving up), but the 'enjoyable' part would be very hard due to the inherent frustration and/or futility, depending on whether there were /any/ dependable rules that the characters could cling to and leverage. (Even rules about what happens to other rules...)
