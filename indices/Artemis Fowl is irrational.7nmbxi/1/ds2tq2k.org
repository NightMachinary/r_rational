  Artemis discovered fairies from rumors off the internet. Isn't there a scientific way?
#+end_quote

I don't see what's wrong with using whatever evidence Artemis has available. What kind of "scientific method" do you want to see here? The experiment "test whether fairies exist" involves going looking for what the rumours say and he did that.

That [[https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/274354/can-a-human-sized-object-vibrate-so-fast-it-appears-invisible-to-the-human-eye][might work, though they would need to vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies to be inaudible as well]] (edit: though see comment below pointing that this source also says this is infeasible). Also, because of temporal aliasing, the fairies would likely be visible in cameras that sample at 30 Hz, or on cameras that sample at 29Hz, or at some frequency.

  The most unbelievable part is the "Time-stop" put around Artemis' mansion, which makes Artemis' watch stop working, and supposedly "traps him in the past". so that "anyone entering the building would find it deserted", although somehow in the plot that occurs afterwards time seems to go at the same speed for both Artemis and the fairies.

I agree. Some of the parts it you can explain: the fairy police van is /also/ inside the time stop. "anyone entering the building [...] deserted" seems fine though, if we accept that the fairies can do some sort of time stop area magic. Bodily functions and watches being suspended while everything else isn't is quite weird. Still, you can accept this as a rule of the magic, and the fiction's internal world does not become inconsistent because of it.

Ultimately, I think the first book of the series is pretty rational. Characters (mostly, I won't go read the book again to check that it always holds) do things because of their beliefs and values; neither the fairies nor the Fowls are good or evil; characters try to solve things through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources; and the rules of the world are consistent.

I'm not sure whether this still holds in the rest of the books, for example I think I remember that [[#s][]]; and the rules of the world might be at some point bent or expanded (perhaps they revived someone with magic? Is that actually forbidden?)

It is certainly not rational/ist/ fiction though.
