imo, Fowl's arrogance is maybe the major theme of the entire series. His actions usually do major harm, despite his attempts to think things through perfectly---mostly because he doesn't even think of wiser options due to aforementioned arrogance.

That, and being a child. /Without/ Riddle brain-patterns to draw from.

So yeah: definitely not a flawless or even mostly-flawless rationalist. Which seems to be the point. The universe as a whole does start out fairly rational, but gets less and less so as the series progresses, which is a shame.

I loved the books for the emotional throughline, and did enjoy that they were unusually smart, and usually punished/rewarded the characters for rational reasons; that, and a tunneling gnome fighting an 8ft. master martial artist in a suit of armor, using only his speed and dirt-fueled super-flatulence, was incredibly fun. There's definitely a reason the author got picked to pen a final Hitchhiker's book.
