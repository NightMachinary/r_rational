(The description of checking rumors on the Internet as an unscientific way to make a discovery brings to mind a passage, quoted below, from Lovecraft's 'Out of the Aeons'.)

"As matters stood, they pointed out that the man who had held the hieroglyphed scroll---and who had evidently thrust it at the mummy through the opening in the case---was not petrified, while the man who had not held it was. When they demanded that we make certain experiments---applying the scroll both to the stony-leathery body of the Fijian and to the mummy itself---we indignantly refused to abet such superstitious notions. Of course, the mummy was withdrawn from public view and transferred to the museum laboratory awaiting a really scientific examination before some suitable medical authority."
