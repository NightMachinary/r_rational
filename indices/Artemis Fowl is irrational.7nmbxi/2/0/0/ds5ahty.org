I like this explanation.

The thing that marks Artemis as not a "rationalist fiction" protagonist is not that he looks for fairies, it's that his entire plan hinges on a desperate supposition like this sleeping pill trick, with no testing beforehand or alternatives in case of failure. It would serve as a last ditch effort to escape if everything else has failed, but he should have had a better plan or at least a few options to try first before knocking himself out.
