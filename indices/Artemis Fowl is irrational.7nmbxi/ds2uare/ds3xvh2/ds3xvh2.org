It's shown that magic in this series has access to stupendous amounts of processing power and the capacity to affect nanoscale changes to reality over a wide area. If this were not the case, healing magic would not be possible. This suggests a possible mechanism of action for the time stop: simulation.

I propose that the time stop spell really takes a snapshot of everything inside the field and simulates everything which goes on in the "time stop" at a 1:1 timescale with the outside world. This solves the problem with all of the mechanics of the time stop seeming really wierd: they operate based upon the expectations of the mages who created the spell however long ago. People don't digest food but are capable of moving or bleeding out because they wanted to create a spell with those exact properties.

The simulation continues until the field collapses, at which point the magic applies all of the changes it simulated to reality inside the field. This mechanism allows for the time stop field to be impenetrable from the inside while also allowing things to be inserted from the outside at any point along the time stop: the simulation just makes it so. However, this makes the whole "change your state of consciousness to escape the time stop" bit seem really silly. Therefore, I propose that this is meant as a sort of failsafe. In case something happens in the field which means you need to escape, you just find a way to knock yourself out to leave it.

Of course, that leaves the question of how Fowl figured out the failsafe and why nobody else knew about it, but considering how insane all of this is to begin with I imagine nobody has bothered to really explore what the time stop spell does aside from finding means of extending the effect.
