  Artemis discovered fairies from rumors off the internet. Isn't there a scientific way?

This is retconned later in the series, for what it's worth.

  The most unbelievable part is the "Time-stop" put around Artemis' mansion, which makes Artemis' watch stop working, and supposedly "traps him in the past". so that "anyone entering the building would find it deserted", although somehow in the plot that occurs afterwards time seems to go at the same speed for both Artemis and the fairies.

This is something I had to think about for some time. The only conclusion I could come to is that it works by packing a lot more time into the area (including the LEP command post), so an hour around the mansion is a few minutes outside. This matches up with the clouds zooming around outside, and Mulch being available very quickly after Root ordered it even though it took hours from his point of view.

[EDIT: No, wait, that doesn't make sense - it should be the other way around, with the outside world being relatively frozen from the inside's point of view. The best I can come up with, then, is that it somehow splits the area off into its own reality (like Mother of Learning), then merges it back afterwards.]

The comments re. the mansion being deserted afterwards, have to be justified as the narrator talking around what the Council was /really/ planning to do after Holly was free, i.e. kill everyone and clean up.
