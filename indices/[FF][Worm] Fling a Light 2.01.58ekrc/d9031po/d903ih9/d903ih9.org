I don't think there was a 1.06 or 1.07. 1.x is between 1.04 and 1.05, the old 2.01 is still somewhere by popular demand, but I insist on maintaining the trivial inconvenience of not telling anyone where so as to keep the timeline as unmuddied as is possible under the circumstances, and 2.x is buried slightly deeper than the old 2.01.

Statistically, I retcon about one in three chapters. However, I generally only retcon things that suffer backlash from multiple independent sources. Given that I've started delaying and reviewing chapters before publishing, I expect to retcon less in the future.
