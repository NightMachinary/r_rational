I honestly don't mind rereading revised chapters. I enjoyed going back to previous chapters to remind myself of whats happened and discovering something knew and improved. The conversation with EP at the start of the previous chapter definitely goes quite well with Accord's parting words at the end of the chapter.

The fact that I'm reading a story in the middle of development has always been my assumption when reading fanfiction/web fiction published a chapter at a time anyway.
