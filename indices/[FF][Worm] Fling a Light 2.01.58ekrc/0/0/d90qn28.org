I do promise a not-insignificant amount of bloodshed and suffering by the end of the arc, if that helps. Arc 1 was meant to be an intro (and I admit it dragged a bit longer than it needed to), with arc 2 being the beginning of the primary conflict, plus the entrypoint for the last few primary actors. With the plot going a bit faster, now, I'm also getting into the bits that I've had planned since the beginning as opposed to since thirty seconds before the update goes live, and which are kind of necessary to the resolution of the plot, which (hopefully) will limit the retcon load.
