Like the others I'm always a bit sad to see that previous chapters have been revised or retconned, but I'm of the opinion that every revision has ultimately been to the good. I wonder if you would improve more quickly as a writer if you set some of the perfectionism aside and just continued onward, but I myself would be sad to see the story fail to live up to its potential.
