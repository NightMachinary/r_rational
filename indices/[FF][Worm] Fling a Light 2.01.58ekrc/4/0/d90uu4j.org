I only really improve when I recognize a mistake and work out how to consistently correct it, which the retcons usually involve. I also tend to get a bit incoherent if I don't revise for a few days before posting, something I hadn't realized until recently. Fortunately, as I've mentioned, my plans are a lot more concrete now that the intro is over.
