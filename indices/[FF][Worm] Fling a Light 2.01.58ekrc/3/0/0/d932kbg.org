A friend of mine publishes in serial form on another website, and has had exceedingly good results setting up a 'beta' mailing list where he posts 5-6 chapters ahead of his "committed" work to get such feedback.

This avoids thrashing for the majority readers for whom retcons are a complete deal-breaker, while granting those who are incredibly passionate about the story a way to provide feedback, spot typos, complain about your economy, point out that that particular brand of microcomputer wasn't available on that date, or what have you.

This does require the discipline to work a few chapters ahead without feedback.

That said, his workflow is actually to write out 100 3k chapters or so, getting feedback from a trusted editor as he goes, and /then/ go through in a detail pass like I just described, while he works on the next project, but the lead time on that is horrendous.
