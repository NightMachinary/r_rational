Like ... if you thought that the /format/ of reddit was awesome, with nested replies, upvotes, downvotes, subreddits, etc. but you thought the /management/ of reddit was terrible (admins, not mods). Every time reddit (the corporation) does something that people don't like, some amount of people get driven elsewhere, and for the most part, that "elsewhere" is voat.co.

If you haven't noticed anything, you can just ignore all of this.
