I second [[/u/fuguofanotherworld]]. How fair or intelligent your point/request comes second to how respectful you are. I too agree with the argument that v/rational isn't ours to claim, but being rude or callous towards people for any reason--let alone the minor inconvenience of their disagreeing with you--makes me completely distrust your motives, and compels me to fight against your receiving of any power, however minor. You might still succeed in convincing me to agree with your point, but you'd also violently repel me from accepting you as a person who should have any control over what happens.
