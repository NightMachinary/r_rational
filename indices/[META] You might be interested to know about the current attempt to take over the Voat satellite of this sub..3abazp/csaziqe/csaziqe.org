So far as I'm concerned, they're free to it. If this community ever needs to move somewhere else, and voat is the logical place for us to move, we can just grab /v/rationalfiction. I understand the impetus to make voat into an exact mirror of reddit, but I don't think that's going to work out well, and they're right that /v/rational is prime namespace (even if I don't think that namespace counts for much if you don't have a way to drive users).
