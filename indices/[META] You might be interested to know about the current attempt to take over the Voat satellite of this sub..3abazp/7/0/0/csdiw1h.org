So... Does the subverse holding policy differ from Reddit's subreddit first come first serve policy then? Because as far as I know it is nigh impossible to take away a subreddit from the top founder/moderator if said person doesn't want it. If it is similar over there then there seems to be nothing to 'fear' regarding the loss of /v/rational.
