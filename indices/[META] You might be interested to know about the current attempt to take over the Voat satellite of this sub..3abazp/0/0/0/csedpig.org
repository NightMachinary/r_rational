I have to ask, well actually I don't have to but I do feel like it: do you think your current way of dealing with this issue is an effective way to get what you want? So far as I can tell you're making this whole thing rather pointlessly adversarial. Generally speaking if there's something you want that you can't actually pressure someone into giving you it's a lot easier to try being nice first then switching to other tactics like asking mods or whoever.

Implying that said person's reasons are bad and they're just being stubborn in a public place they will likely read is a bad idea /irrespective of whether or not they are being stubborn/. If they aren't, they'll feel wrongly accused and defensive making them less likely to go along with their thing. If they are, they'll just dig their heels in further.

You're playing to the crowd, but the crowd have no vote.
