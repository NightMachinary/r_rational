I'm the guy who registered the name. I'm mildly disinclined to losing the sub in case the reddit exodus broadens, but I cede the point that there really isn't much need for a subverse right now. I've replied to the thread and made a few posts to the subverse, but I agree we could just take a different name if it came to that. So... thanks for the heads up. And as the subverse sidebar says, if anyone from here wants to make more of an effort making it into an active sub, I'm happy to hand it over.
