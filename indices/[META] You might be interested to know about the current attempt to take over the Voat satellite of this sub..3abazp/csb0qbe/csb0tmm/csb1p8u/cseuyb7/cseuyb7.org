Speaking for myself, I'd want to point out that I hadn't heard anything about any controversy, and that my first exposure to VOAT's existence was this thread. As soon as I saw that it was a thing, I began wondering whether it was an attempt to be reddit-but-better, and started considering moving there.

So I'd have to believe there may well be a third group of people who'd move to Voat: those finding out about it simply due to its current visibility, and seeing if it might be a viable improvement over reddit.
