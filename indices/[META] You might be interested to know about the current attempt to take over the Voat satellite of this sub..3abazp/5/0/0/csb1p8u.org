There are two primary reasons not to migrate to voat, one of which is always going to be an issue, and the other which is more dealing with current events:

[[/r/rational]] currently has 3,100 readers, and most of them wouldn't make the transition. You'd end up with a smaller community, fewer submissions, less discussion, etc.

Voat is experiencing growth right now because of the whole [[/r/fatpeoplehate]] thing. If you have no idea what that is, you can [[http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/39bzdf/why_was_rfatpeoplehate_along_with_several_other/][read about it here.]] There are two general sorts of people who are migrating. The first are the free-speech people who think this is a symptom of reddit losing its focus, spitting in the face of so-called transparency, doing exactly the sort of thing that goes against what made it the place to be in the first place, etc. The /second/ sort are the people who populated subs like [[/r/fatpeoplehate]] and want to continue having a place for mockery, harassment, and ... well, hate, like it says in the name. There were about 150,000 subs of [[/r/fatpeoplehate]], with more who frequented it but weren't subbed, and a fair amount of them went over to voat (it's the 17th largest subverse there, and from what I can tell, comprises about half the userbase). In my personal opinion, it doesn't seem like the sort of site that I would go to /right now/ in the hopes of getting intelligent, thoughtful discussion, because a lot of the people you'd be talking to would be the sorts of people who take joy in mockery, harassment, etc. Not all of them, obviously, but enough. And worse, voat itself is profiting from this whole thing, which means that they're going to have a strong incentive to not upset their majority of their userbase.
