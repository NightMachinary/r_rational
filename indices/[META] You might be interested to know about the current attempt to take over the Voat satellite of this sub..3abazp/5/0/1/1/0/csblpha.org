I recommend you research that topic on your own, following the link above or maybe looking at the sticky in the Kotaku in Action sub. This is not really the place for that imho.

If you search for it you will probably find the same screenshots I did of some users and even at least one mod of the sub harrassing outsiders. Apparently quite a few people got private messages from users or mods of the sub, which many didn't like. Some subscribers also doxxed people, despite that behaviour having been banned in the sub.

Most of this is hearsay and users of the site trying to justify the decision. As far as I know the Admins didn't provide any evidence of their claims nor offered they a detailed justification for what they did. Contentious points are also a) why the banned the whole sub for the actions of relatively few of the 150k subscribers, b) why they banned all related subs, not only the offending one, c) why they didn't ban any similar â€˜hate'-subs d) why they didn't ban any of the other subs that are shown to have sizeable population of harassers.

Regardless of what their reasons are or whether it was justified, significant parts of the population of voat come from various subs on reddit having been banned. This supposedly leads to quite a different 'site culture' if that makes sense.

Edit: Also, Neogaf was also banned. It was a tiny sub about a forum of the same name, made to critize the perceived mod-abuse on that site.
