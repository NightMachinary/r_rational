So, voat is guilty of what? It's free speech. Unlike the censored speech that we have access to here on reddit.

There are plenty of other subs on voat that are not as toxic as those, and they keep to themselves and don't bleed over into other subs.

If you want an insulated and padded room where nobody you dislike can ever talk to you, then you're free to not participate. I can quite confidently say that someone so afraid of interacting with those that they disagree with is likely not going to contribute anything of value to the conversation anyway.
