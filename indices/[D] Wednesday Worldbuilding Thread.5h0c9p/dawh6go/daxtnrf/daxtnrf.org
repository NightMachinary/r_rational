One of the Discworld books has the magical computer HEX able to speed up calculation massively because it can cast the same scrying spell, with minor variations, /several times a second/ - far faster than any human wizard (and then translate the results into a very accurate human-readable form), thus turning a fuzzy and uncertain picture of the future into a far /less/ fuzzy and uncertain picture of the future.

So, let us consider, for example, a simple spell that tells you where an atom, randomly selected from within a range of three centimetres the point the caster designates, will most probably be one week from now.

Tom the Mage, without a computer, can cast this spell on an opponent (aiming for his centre of mass) and get some idea of where the opponent will be next week.

Marvin the computer-aided mage can have the spell cast on a thousand points spaced out over his opponent's skin (or just under it), and tell not only where he'll be in a week but have a very good idea of the pose he will be standing in.
