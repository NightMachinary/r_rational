Entropy can be decreased locally as long as it is accompanied by an increase in the system as a whole. Electricity typically creates a bunch of heat as a byproduct. Also, I believe that's the primary counterweight of human metabolism too.

Consider a person eating food, digesting it, and then using that energy to push a cart. This happens in real life, everything is fine.

Now consider a person eating food, digesting it, and then using magic to push a cart (at a distance) with the same force, requiring the same amount of energy, and have some sort of organs (maybe part of the brain) consuming the energy and giving off heat or whatever happens in real life anyway.

Maybe the magic isn't super ultra useful if it requires the same amount of energy to do any task as just doing it manually would be, but now as an author you can modify it in various ways. I don't know how efficient the process of using muscles to exert force is, but you can make the magic system some amount closer to 100%. You can apply it at a distance. You could make it possible to store up more energy or unleash it in bursts so that a human could lift something ten times heavier than normal given ten times as long to prepare for it or rest afterwards. Or throw tiny objects with very fast speeds and/or high precision.

Also you'd need to address Newton's third law and stuff like that, but that's not particularly difficult. I think the key is just having some sort of biological basis. It doesn't have to be super well explained, but just that every energy that gets exerted comes out of the metabolism stockpile along with all of the other energy that humans use to do things.
