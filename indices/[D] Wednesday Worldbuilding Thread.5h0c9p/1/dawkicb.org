Magic systems are hard and trying to come up them can get frustrating. Something I've been trying to formulate recently is a magic based an a finite state machine. Basically magic would have a few simple operations like force coupling and then allow for states determine which was invoked with state transitions relying on another small set of rules. The biggest problem is I really don't want to violate thermodynamics, but I'm not sure how to add this without violating at least entropy.
