I did some back of the envelope calculations and decided it could be powered by the glycogen stores in the body for most stuff that I thought was reasonable in my magic system (basically the kinetic energy of the biggest tank bullet is about 1/200th the glycogen stores in the human body). So casters will end up literally worn out as if they had just run a marathon after prolonged casting.

Getting it directly from the red blood cells is even cooler in a way, and allows for bigger spells!
