If you read part of the chapter about the summoning ritual, it only names HPJEV as the person being summoned at the very end. So a writer could simply have the OtherWorkCharacter be summoned right before Tracy names /who/ she's trying to summon and leave everything else about the summoning ritual unchanged.
