I have an idea of a HPMOR RatFic (a crossover with other work) branching on chapter 74, where Tracey's summons actually work, summoning an other work character.

I feel like it'd be good in the quest format, so that readers control Harry and I describe others characters snippets (Quirell, Dumbledore, and OtherWorkCharacter) -- that also helps to gauge the readers' interest and abandon it if there are no votes anymore. Also, it gives the freedom of action -- players can either spend time investigating Rules of Magic, risking not to foil villains' plot in time; or focus on the plot, risking that somebody else will be ahead of Harry in magic knowledge.

I also feel that I know how to consistently merge HPMOR's vague magic model with OtherWork's magic model... basically make the OtherWork a prequel of The Times Before Merlin.

The thing is, I've never written a line of fiction in English and am not sure if I'll be ready for turning my inconsistent set of pre-made worldbuilding connections inside my mind into actual writing.

Also I feel that I lack dedication to write things.

I could find a willing co-author here, perhaps?
