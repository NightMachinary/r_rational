  What gaps would a magic system need to have in order to be made better by hooking it up to a 1970s microcomputer (e.g. Apple II)?

Put yourself into the shoes of any magician. What part of your job sucks?

- Do diabolists have to draw tediously complex pentagrams in salt to summon an imp? Can a computer + CNC machine inscribe these shapes and forms perfectly, every time?
- Do spells require exact timing (can only operate at midnight on the first blue moon of the year)? A computer can serve as alarms or watchdog processes.
- Do potions require exact temperatures, exact content mixtures? Can a computerized thermometer aid the process? What about mass-production of potions in a factory?
- Can mana/magic be stored in a vessel? Can computers access and release it? Check the storage level? Use it as a battery or other input?
- Can mystic chanting be recorded and replayed over speakers?
- Could you use a spell search engine? A potion database?

Automate the parts of magic that are limiting factors for humans.
