What if the logic/conditionals isn't a feature of magic, but rather a feature of making it match what people intuitively think?

For example, what if magic spells were dependent on predictable horoscope-like features? /Fireball/ shoots towards Jupiter unless you use direction-changing metamagic, (which has a coordinate system relative to something else, like the plane of the ecliptic).

If you wanted to shoot someone to the east of you, your spell set would be [Fireball] + [Aim +27 degrees forwards from Jupiter] + [Rotate aim point 75 degrees clockwise (with the axis on Jupiter)]. This is useful for a human in a siege situation, but not in any context that requires quick action.

This could also be used to reduce already-known rituals to their base components and enable generalized use. "Ritual magic" is magic that people have only solved for one set of conditions, like a full moon that is occluding Mars, or when the sun is directly above the equator at your longitude. This would also likely mean that there are ritual /sites/ scattered all around the world, where individual spellcrafters made spells designed for the local conditions.
