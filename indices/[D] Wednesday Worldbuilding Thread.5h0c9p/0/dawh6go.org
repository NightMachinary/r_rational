I am trying to figure out what's essentially technobabble for a story. It's the 1970s and you're a wizard. Your magic has some kind of way to interact with the new era of computing which allows for new and interesting things to be done.

*What gaps would a magic system need to have in order to be made better by hooking it up to a 1970s microcomputer (e.g. Apple II)?*

So far I have */logic/* and */memory/*, which means that one of the things that a magic spell can't normally do is operate on conditionals (complex or otherwise) and another thing it can't do is store and retrieve information for later. Magic then essentially acts as a peripheral that you can hook up to your computer (as prior to computers, this was done entirely by hooking a mage up instead).
