Gero in canon is seen for a very short time, and it's years later, after he's been further driven into obsession by the defeat of the Red Ribbon, he's basically just focused on revenge and has transformed himself into an android, so he'd just be a different person at that point anyway. He's definitely kind of anger-y, so I'm playing off that, but we don't see much of him otherwise. I'm basically imagining how he could have been /before/ here, which is also a way to make him slightly less despicable, since in DBZ he's crossed the moral event horizon as far as the whole "human experimentation" thing goes (in fact, I've also referenced here that he didn't build his android 8 yet... in canon, android 8 is fought by Goku when he's a kid during the Red Ribbon saga, and it's the first example of a sentient android who's basically used as a slave against his will; I'm changing Gero's path right before he commits /that/ rather heinous act).

Also, in DBZ he's built another android, number 19, to put in charge of transforming /him/, so that's where I took the idea that he wouldn't let just any random surgeon mess with his body. There's also some word-of-God info that's never mentioned in the manga that says his son was a soldier in the Ribbon and got killed during Goku's attack and that's why he's so vengeful, and his android 16 was built in the image of the dead son. That intrigued me and I considered it, but in the end I decided to avoid incorporating that because it made things even more complicated. On the other hand, Lapis and Lazuli are indeed 17 and 18's human names according I believe to the Kazenshuu... again, not material from canon, but word-of-God.
