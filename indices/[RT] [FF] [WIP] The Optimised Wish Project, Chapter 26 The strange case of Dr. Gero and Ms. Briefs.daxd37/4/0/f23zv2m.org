I thought it might be a bit too rushed, unfortunately it's a balancing game between introducing detail and moving the plot at a brisk enough pace. I don't like writing massive infodump chapters - they feel boring to /me/, first and foremost, which then slows my work down.

I guess I could have introduced it somewhere before the summer party chapter. The notion was already there before the Tenkaichi - the bench that broke Bulma's arm - it's just that now it's made portable. I feel like the technological pieces were all already there, in theory, the data gathered from the Tenkaichi was the only real missing piece, so I didn't think it needed to be justified too much.
