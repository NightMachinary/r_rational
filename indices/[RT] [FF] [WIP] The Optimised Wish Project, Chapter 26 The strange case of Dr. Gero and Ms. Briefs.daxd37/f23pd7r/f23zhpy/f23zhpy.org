Thanks! Well, can't say much about it except to spread the word I guess if you get the chance :). It's already the most popular on FF.net in the Dragon Ball section - but that's a bit cheating since the DBZ one is really where it's at, and I won't get there for a while (I do plan eventually to split it and make the later arcs a sequel, though probably without a pause or anything).
