I wonder if we'll get a timeline divergence where Nappa and Vegeta get to meet them when they first come to Earth...

/Nappa/: Oh look at these two dolls, aren't hyooman cute little things ?

/Vegeta/: Ha, they don't even register on the scouter. Just how pathetic can they be ?

/Lapis/: Hey sis, how about we play 'encounter of the third Newton's Law' with the aliens ?

/Lazuli/: Sure. You rock, I roll.
