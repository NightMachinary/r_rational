Great chapter, I've been waiting for it so long.

Love the Bulma/Gero interactions and I hope there will be more of them, and more of science/lab stuff.

I have only one suggestion - the fragment with "The device was a electrostimulator......" in my opinion should be few chapters earlier. You just introduced this 'ki knob device' and Bulma just used it to show of for Gero in the same chapter. This feels a bit rushed.

I'd also like to see a bit more of inner workings of Red Ribbon and maybe some kind of fight between mundane soldiers and some ki warrior (Piccolo spawn or anything)
