I like that you found a believable way to work 17 and 18 into things. I watched a lot more Dragonball Z than Dragonball (and I don't think I'm alone in that) so it's nice to see some familiar faces here, especially when I wasn't expecting them to show up for a VERY long time.

I'm... less excited about Roshi starting to play a larger role. I really hate the "haha, he's such a pervert, how funny!" thing. Seriously, the man is a pedophile and an unrepentant sexual predator, none of that is funny. I'm glad you're tamping down on that trope a great deal, but I think his presence will always be something that I at best /tolerate/. That's not your fault, the source material is to blame on that one.
