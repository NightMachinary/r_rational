TBF I was pretty okay with Roshi's shtick in the OG Dragon Ball, insofar as, tasteless as it was, he was at least mostly the Wile E. Coyote of sexual assault - he'd just get owned every time in new ways. Still, not exactly the peak of humour, so I've toned that down as you said. In DBZ that whole side of him gets sidelined a bit (well, really, his entire character does). The latest Super episode that focused on him at Tenshinan's dojo was /the worst/ though.

Still, I'm just trying to sideline that aspect entirely, but obviously Roshi is kind of important to the Piccolo arc, and at this point he /is/ one of the strongest people on Earth, so it's unavoidable that he plays a role. I'll just try to keep it tame.

About 17 and 18, Lapis and Lazuli are indeed their canon human names (if you didn't know), and my headcanon is that in the original story when Gero kind of went completely off the deep end after the destruction of the RR he used them to experiment, possibly keeping them in some kind of stasis/preserved condition for a few years, to account for the discrepancy in their age (they don't look much older than 20-ish in canon after all).
