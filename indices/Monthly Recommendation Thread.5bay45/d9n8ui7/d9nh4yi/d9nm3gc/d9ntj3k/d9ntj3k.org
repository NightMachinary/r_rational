I just read DKA just this last week, with only light exposure to Sailor Moon. Way better than I was expecting. Definitely in the category of With This Ring, Worm, or Time Braid; something super long that I basically couldn't put down, with plenty of meaty analysis and high powered super-heroics. I did end up watching a few youtube videos about DK so I could visualize things better. Not nearly as dark as Worm or Time Braid, but more so perhaps than WTR (although the idealism of Ami shines through a bit more than with Paul from WTR, who is a decent bloke but has to frame all of this ideals through a self-interest filter).
