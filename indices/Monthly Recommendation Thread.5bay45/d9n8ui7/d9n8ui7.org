[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-of-love-and-justice-dka-au-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper.32279/]] Dungeon Keeper of Love and Justice, a recursive fanfic of Dungeon Keeper Ami I've been liking. It isn't anywhere near as far along, but it's well written and creative. Unlike most fics, it has gone so far as to actually break the status quo by loosening up the masquerade, and it doesn't do so in a way that seems forced at all. The characters behave consistently, which is another big bonus.

If you haven't read DKA (and I highly reccomend you do), it involves Ami Mizuno, Sailor Mercury of Sailor Moon, being transported to the world of the dungeon keeper game.
