[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches: Revenge is Best Served Raw]]. Updates semi-regularly, novel-quality plot AU. Writing is decent but not novel quality. Defies the low expectations the first few chapters engender.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/1/Growing-Up-Black][Growing Up Black]]. Completely novel quality, but unfinished. Also the most British piece of online fiction I've ever read.
