  Hermione stared.

  "A house elf costs 400,000 pounds?"

  "Around that."

  "How?"

  Daphne frowned. "Yes, how? I mean, when we talked about this before I just accepted it, but it does seem a lot."

  Harry paused in his tapping. "Well, look at it this way. A house elf can do the work of two full adult wizards. A normal adult wizard's salary for menial work of the kind that house elves do is around 15,000 pounds a year, that's about three hundred Galleons. Following?"

  Hermione and Daphne nodded.

  He continued. "And a house elf can work for upwards of fifty years. That means that when you buy a house elf you're buying around one hundred years of labor in advance."

  Hermione frowned. "But wouldn't that mean that a house elf should cost 1.5 million pounds then?"

  "No, because the value of one years worth of labor in fifty years is much less than one years worth of labor now."

  "But, how do you figure that out?"

  Harry smiled. [[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp]["Remind me to give you a book on basic finance when we get out of here."]]
