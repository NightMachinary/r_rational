Assuming market equilibrium, house elf labor should be driving down the cost of wizard labor, which means that even if house elfs aren't getting paid we should be able to figure out the price of their labor in dollars per hour.

Like if we lived in a world where you could buy automatic haircut machines, they would drive down the price of human-cut hair until they reached equilibrium with auto-cut hair, which we could then use as information about how much it cost to create the automatic hair cutter (or at least, how much it was being sold for, which in a competitive market should be only slightly higher than the build cost).

In other words, if it cost tuppence to "make" a house elf, menial labor done by a wizard wouldn't be worth 300 galleons a year. (Barring, as you said, a house elf monopoly, regulatory schemes, etc.)
