  Like if we lived in a world where you could buy automatic haircut machines, they would drive down the price of human-cut hair until they reached equilibrium with auto-cut hair, which we could then use as information about how much it cost to create the automatic hair cutter (or at least, how much it was being sold for, which in a competitive market should be only slightly higher than the build cost).

Or, alternatively, having your hair cut by a human would become a status signal and the price would go up (but only rich people would be doing it, and everyone else would be using automatic hair cutting machines). Or humans would stop cutting hair, and change to more rewarding jobs. (probably both).

I guess I'm mostly finding it unlikely that there's still wizards competing with house elves for menial households jobs.
