No, it's been only /eleven months/ since [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3vk7ku][the first thread]]. We have to wait for the /thirteenth/ thread before celebrating.

I found /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72199][Off Armageddon Reef]]/, the first book in [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/58713][the /Safehold/ series]], to be fairly entertaining. The premise is as follows:

#+begin_quote
  For millennia, an alien species has been exterminating every other species that rises to technological prominence in the galaxy. It detects and destroys most of human civilization, but not before the humans manage to establish a hidden colony, named Safehold, with instructions to avoid sending out any radio transmissions for about 400 years, before reaching a technology level high enough to destroy the aliens in one fell swoop. (As far as can be told from outside, the aliens haven't made even a single improvement to their spaceships in literally millennia, so there's no danger of the aliens' outpacing anything that the humans could do.)

  However, there's a snag: The administrators of Safehold turn out to be megalomaniacs. While the colonists are in stasis, the admins brainwash them to think that they've never known anything but a medieval existence, and that the admins are the archangels of a religion whose principles include the avoidance of certain technologies (ones that would attract the aliens' attention with radio signals). Without any knowledge of the aliens, these humans will eventually break the religion's precepts and attract the aliens' attention without actually having grown powerful enough to defeat the aliens--or never break the religion's precepts at all.

  One dissenting admin manages to hide on the planet a robot (that looks perfectly human, but has greatly-improved abilities) that contains a copy of the mind of a friend, along with some supplies. The robot's duty, when it wakes up 750 years later (centuries after the admins have died--and after Safehold /should/ have become technologically-advanced again): To break the hold of the rogue admins' religion on the Safeholdians, and to prepare them for the alien threat.

Rather irksomely, all the characters' names are spelled weirdly, to represent how the English that all Safeholdians speak has drifted over the centuries--=Erayk= for =Eric=, =Zherald= for =Gerald=, =Haarahld= for =Harold=, etc. Still, the story is fun enough.
