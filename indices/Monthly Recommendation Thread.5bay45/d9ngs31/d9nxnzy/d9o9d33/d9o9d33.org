I don't think it makes that much sense to compare /seasons/ with each other, given that episodes are so disconnected from each other. I thought that season 3 had some very good episodes, though some of them were too close to things I had already seen (in particular, /Nosedive/ was too close to the Meow Meow Beanz episode of Community, and /Men Against Fire/ was too close to the short film [[https://vimeo.com/147365861][Uncanny Valley]]). I loved /San Junipero/ though.

Highly recommend that you watch it without spoilers, and even the episodes I liked /less/ were still high quality. Also, from what I've seen there's not that much agreement of how to rank the episodes.
