Yeah, that's fair. While it's not impossible to understand without reading, the story certainly doesn't try to spell out either crossover, so if you don't have passing familiarity with either you're out of luck. If you ever get around to playing/watching/reading either of those, I'd recommend checking it out again, but I'm not sure its worth going through canon just so you can understand.
