The only influencer here is Eliezer.

Are you irritated I didn't induce you were already following the above strategy? I apologize for upsetting you, but please realize that I would have been making a rather large assumption had I thought by "sharing" you meant, "I am tweeting this to influencers who are likely to read my tweet, watch the pilot, and then retweet the pilot at influencers with greater sway over those with power in the media industry."

Next time someone gives you advice to do a thing you're already doing, please just respond, "Thanks, I'm actually doing just that." If you don't, and respond in the above fashion, you'll rather ungraciously signal, "In the future, make the assumption that I am already doing whatever you were going to suggest even if I've given no such indication." Of course, if unsolicited advice peeves you, and you'd rather never receive unsolicited advice even at the risk of missing out on valuable opportunities or information, disregard this paragraph.
