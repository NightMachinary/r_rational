A pilot for a possible cartoon series, one that has the potential to have a fully level-1-intelligent main character. (And a female one, no less.) Which is /especially/ interesting given that it seems to be at least partially for children.

I am sharing it because further views and discussion make it more likely that the show will actually get made, and I /really/ want it to get made.
