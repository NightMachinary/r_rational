Mostly just the fact that the radical left has been very disoriented for the past N decades, so actually orienting us around a coherent manifesto concerned with defining progress and taking power to achieve progress, rather than a loosr grab-bag of subaltern butthurts, constitutes a major achievement. I also tend to cheer anything which helps to restore materialism to its central place in leftist thought.
