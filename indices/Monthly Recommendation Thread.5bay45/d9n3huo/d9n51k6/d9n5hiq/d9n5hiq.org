The main character is a young woman who's a Paladin of the deity of justice, war, and feminism. She enrolls in a school led by one of the most powerful, and willfull, adventurer-mages. Together with the rest of the class they go on adventures (sometimes controlled by the professors of the school, sometimes not), and in the meantime you and the characters learn a lot about the surrounding world.

That's the intro, the rest is partially spoilering, partially less about the plot and more about how the events change the world views of the characters and help them grow.

Also, the humour. A couple characters are genuinely funny, in varied ways.

Generally the first chapters are a bit slow (though still enjoyable to me), and the plot really picks up in the second part of book one. So if you're enjoying the setting but want more action in the first 5-6 chapters, you'll probably be satisfied with the rest of the story.
