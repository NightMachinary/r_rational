That web serial is not for everyone. There's a scene in book 3 that basically goes like this:

#+begin_quote
  A and B: "Let's try to rape this girl because suddenly we're rapists now."

  C: "No, rape is bad. You shouldn't do that."

  /Feminist shows up, scares away A and B./

  Feminist: "You're a good guy, C."
#+end_quote

I'm not even joking. In fact, this a recurring problem with the whole thing, all the men are either "evil rapist" or "good feminist ally". Worse, the author seems to think this every few chapters:

#+begin_quote
  Oh, shit. I've been too focused on writing the story that I've forgotten to harp on feminism in a while. Better add some hamfisted rant or cringeworthy scene to make up for it.
#+end_quote

Another problem is that nothing permanent will ever happen. [[#s][]] and nothing changes. [[#s][]] and the one time an interesting development happened a god showed up and fixed it all with a wave of his hand.

If you can stomach all that it's a decent story. Not a great one, but decent.
