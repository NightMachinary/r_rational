  I also feel like you're conflating the world as viewed by Trissiny, and the world as the author actually builds it.

Obviously I caught the fact that Trissiny is supposed to be "too judgemental". The author isn't actually subtle about any of his points. That doesn't change the fact that the only guy in the whole story who is allowed to be critical of feminism (without suddenly becoming, or having been an evil rapist all along) is the transman (I guess he has enough "oppression points"). The female characters are of course allowed to criticize whatever they want.

Related to the above, the only people who are even allowed to believe that men and women can be different is a cult of the worst strawman "internet misogynists" you could find. They are, of course, proven morally wrong somewhere in +chapter+ book 10.

  I'm enjoying watching the characters grow up and evolve.

That's the only thing making this story decent. I just wish the plot would start moving along before we all die of old age.

Edit: book, not chapter.
