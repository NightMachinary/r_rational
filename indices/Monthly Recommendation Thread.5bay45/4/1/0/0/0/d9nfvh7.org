The school isn't very prominent, it mostly features early on as a plot device to bring the characters together and sometimes as an opportunity for exposition dumps via the professors between arcs. The meat of the story tends to take place away from campus entirely. TGAB is pretty much a cross between RWBY and Practical Guide To Evil, definitely recommend reading it.
