I think you're oversimplifying the first situation significantly. The woman in question being a dryad and probably not really considered a person by most of the humanity is certainly relevant.

I also feel like you're conflating the world as viewed by Trissiny, and the world as the author actually builds it. Yes, Trissiny is naive and judgemental for at least the first 10 books. The other characters balance it out somewhat, but she is the main PoV. I don't think that's necessarily an issue.

I guess it mostly depends on what an interesting development for you is. I'm enjoying watching the characters grow up and evolve.
