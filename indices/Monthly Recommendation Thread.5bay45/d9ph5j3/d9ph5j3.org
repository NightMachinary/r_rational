[[http://kissanime.to/Anime/Ajin][AJIN]]

It's an anime which i think people here would like. It's a CGI anime so it might be a bit different but you'll get used to it. The anime is really good with a rational MC. The MC finds out that he is one of these AJIN, immortal beings who can't die and it starts with him escaping cuz AJIN are persecuted by the government...

I don't think anyone'll be convinced with this cuz I'm not good at this but trust me this is exactly what we love here in this sub. Hope you guys give it a try and sorry for the horrible explanation.
