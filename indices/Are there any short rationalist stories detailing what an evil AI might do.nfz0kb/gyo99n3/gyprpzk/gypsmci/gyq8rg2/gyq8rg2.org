What do you mean by "notion of upload identity?" Do you reject the idea that the software of a human brain can run on electronic hardware? Do you think that, even if it can be run on such hardware, a living human brain cannot be copied with sufficient fidelity onto a computer to be the same person? Or is it a version of the teletransportation problem, in which even a copy made with perfect fidelity, running on perfect emulation hardware, is philosophically not the same person as the one that was copied?
