Maybe you can elaborate on that fundamental difference. Surely you don't mean everyone/everything besides /you/ has to be a p-zombie?

And if there's no magic soul and I'm just a specific pattern, in the same way any copy of a mp3 file is the same song regardless of the medium it's on, I wouldn't consider any sufficiently accurate copy of my mind more privileged than the rest.
