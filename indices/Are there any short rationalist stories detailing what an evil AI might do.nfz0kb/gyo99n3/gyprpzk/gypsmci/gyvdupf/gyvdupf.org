While I know my body and my mind are pretty inseparable, if every part is near perfectly simulated, then I fall on the identity as process / percpetual continuity side of the Ship Of Theseus [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus]] argument, thus neither the original nor post upload version is more or less real. I'm also at heart a hedonist - life is inherently meaningless but for what ever meaning we impose on it, so greatest pleasure / happiness for greatest # of people is probably a net win. For me probably the biggest "oops me made an evil AI" is that they didn't put rules for dealing with / preserving non-human biologies / sentients so it is going to wipe out any thing else it runs into (or be exterminated and take humans with it if it runs into a better Singularity / Sufficiently Advanced Culture.
