Do you think there's a difference between mind upload, creating a perfect clone of yourself (atom-for-atom), teleportation, and waking up from general anaesthesia?

Which of those is "another entity that thinks it's you", and which one is "actually you", and why?

There's no continuity of consciousness in either case, and in the end the person who wakes up is identical to you in every way.

I don't actually know what to think about this and don't have a strong opinion either way, but I wonder where other people here draw the line.

My best guess is that we should probably think of humans and minds more like software than physical entities. This question is similar to "What happens when you copy paste a bunch of code? Is it the same code, or does it just look, 'think', and act in the exact same way?"
