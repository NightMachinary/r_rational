Exactly. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation_paradox][teletransportation paradox]]: is a perfect copy of you the same person as you? And does that answer change when the copying process destroys the original?

They're questions that depend heavily on your definition of "identity" and "self." And since I'm not interested in having the discussion devolve into pedantry, I'm leaving my end of the debate at "I don't see the teletransportation problem the same way."
