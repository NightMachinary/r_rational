I think there's a fundamental difference between entities that experience consciousness and qualia and those that don't that makes it useless to talk about them in the language of bulk atoms or code and makes instance a meaningful signifier. Otherwise, you might as well claim none of us "exists" because there's no way to tell two carbon atoms apart.
