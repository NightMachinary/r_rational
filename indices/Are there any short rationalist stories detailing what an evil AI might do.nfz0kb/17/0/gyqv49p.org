My understanding is that "governance" and "public policy" /are/ things which are talked about but those are hard enough to Google that I don't have any links for you.

When it comes to climate change I believe the majority opinion is that climate change is very important but it's also very well funded, just the US federal government is already spending billions on it. It would be difficult for the EA community to have much of an impact so their attention is better spent in more neglected areas: [[https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/]]

This description isn't exactly contradictory to what you're saying, but by rephrasing it hopefully I've made the position seem more sympathetic.
