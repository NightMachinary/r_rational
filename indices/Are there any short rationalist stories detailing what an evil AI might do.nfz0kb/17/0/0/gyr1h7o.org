I am sympathetic to the fact that climate change is a very hard problem. (It's not very well funded; it's orders of magnitude away from being very well funded. It's just funded past the point where the EA community can possibly help directly.) This is in fact why I am not personally saving the world from climate change.

However, I am also not pretending that Unaligned AGI is a real problem which deserves mental resources; my excuse for why I'm not pouring my effort into saving the world is that I'm lazy and tired and burned out, and in a couple of years I expect the third will wane and I'll try some more.

Governance, public policy, and climate change are all fundamentally issues of politics. Anyone thinking about getting into AGI should instead go look for a job with ActBlue, the DSA, or the Movement Voter Project or something, or try to get a job working with one of the UN sub-orgs that deals with global hunger mitigation.

(Look, I'm not telling anyone to change their lives or what to do. If you want to work on AGI shit because it's fun and a cool challenge, have at. You don't need to tell me it's saving the world, or saving humanity; just tell me you think it's cool! We can still be friends!)
