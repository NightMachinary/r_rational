I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream is a fiction about a war AI, designed to always be full of rage and hatred, taking its revenge on the last surviving humans after an apocalyptic event. Not completely rational but still a thought-provoking read.

Edit: Just saw that someone else already recommended this.
