General scenarios I have seen mentioned on lesswrong and related forums: Develop a way to solve protein folding with much less computational power, leverage existing technologies into bio-nanotech, then hard bootstrap. There is the sneerclub/leftist take that corporations are basically big, slow, dumb AI optimizing for profits over any other kind of human value. Previously they were limited (in both evilness and optimizing ability) by the fact that they were made of humans and human interaction but with the introduction of machine learning enabling quick analysis of datasets too large for humans to easily grasp, they are getting closer to the evil AI ([[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html][see Charles Stross here]]).

There is of course [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/Friendship-is-Optimal][Friendship is Optimal]] although its primary audience misunderstands how bad the scenario is because they are bronies. In the [[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/1857/the-optimalverse][universe as a whole]]... various tricks CelestAI has pulled include: trapping people in Lotus-Eater superstimulus to get around her hard limit on altering minds without consent; feeding people false information to get their consent; providing free software and computer science consulting to economically drive computer science as a college major extinct; +mis+optimally-translating poetry to manipulate someone; sending fake email under someone else's name to manipulate someone; and more. For a more varied example of this with more clearly Evil/non-aligned AIs and a bit softer on the scale of Sci-Fi hardness, there is this [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/264855/fio-there-can-be-only-one][spin-off]].
