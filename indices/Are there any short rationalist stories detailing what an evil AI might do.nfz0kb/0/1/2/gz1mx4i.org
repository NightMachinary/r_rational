  Why wouldn't it just get off this tiny little planet, and abandon us completely? There's plenty of universe for the both of us.

Why would it do that when the planet is made out of resources it could use for its own ends? Plenty of matter that it could turn into computronium or von Neumann probes or something. What reason can you think of for why an AI would just pass that up when resources are handy for anything it might want to do?

The only reason I can think of is if we specifically build it in a way such that it /doesn't/ do that. If we don't do that, the default is that it will use the resources available to it in service of whatever it wants to do.
