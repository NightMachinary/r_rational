There are two problems with the belief that we need to preserve the substance (rather than just the pattern) to preserve the consciousness.

Firstly, we already keep exchanging our substance with the environment. The only substance preserved over time are our teeth. Everything else is gradually exchanged, atom by atom/molecule by molecule, and in a few years, there is no original matter left. This doesn't result in our consciousness being destroyed, which tells us the matter doesn't need to be preserved as long as the pattern is.

The second problem is that dependency of the consciousness on the substance would lead either to something called suddenly disappearing qualia, or to something called gradually fading qualia, under specific circumstances: [[http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html]]
