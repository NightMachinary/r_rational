  It is (possibly) reducible to a static record as a snapshot, but the moment you start it back up it diverges uncontrollably.

I don't know if the processes of consciousness are deterministic or not. If they are, then when you "start it back up" with the same input fed in, you shouldn't any divergence.

  And you can't claim two distinct entities are in any meaningful way "the same" just because they have similar memories up to a point - memories that are entirely unlike static records and subject to continued diverging manipulation by the biological systems they're embedded in anyway.
#+end_quote

I mean if the issue lies between the differences between a biological system and an electronic one, and it's possible that the former can be emulated on the latter, then by doing so all these manipulations can be accounted for.

Also I wonder, if fidelity is that essential for "you-ness", do you still consider you to be yourself under the influence of drugs, or say, a concussion caused by head trauma. Or for that matter, sleeping and then waking up the next morning.
