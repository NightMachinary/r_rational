  Maybe you can elaborate on that fundamental difference.

I'll get back to you on that once we figure out what consciousness and qualia actually are. But at a lower level, a computer file is a static record, whereas a mind is a tangled hierarchy of software, data, computing substrate and biology. It is (possibly) reducible to a static record as a snapshot, but the moment you start it back up it diverges uncontrollably. And you can't claim two distinct entities are in any meaningful way "the same" just because they have similar memories up to a point - memories that are entirely unlike static records and subject to continued diverging manipulation by the biological systems they're embedded in anyway.
