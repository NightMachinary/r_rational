Question: how does an evil AI go from upgrading its own software, to upgrading its HARDWARE?Even if the AI somehow hopped onto the internet (how?? It would be thousands of GB of data at least!) then what? Its not like it could build or print itself a better hardware to run on, there is just no such technology. Not to mention, the Internet is SLOW. An AI that escaped into the wild wastes of the Web, would just become a glacially slow behemoth, not a super fast god.

I just don't see how the Singularity could happen without constant and slow labour from actual physical humans at every turn. An Ai could *theoretically* be able to boostrap itself from sub-human to massive superhuman intelligence, but to *actually* get components made to run on, it would have to wait like any other client.
