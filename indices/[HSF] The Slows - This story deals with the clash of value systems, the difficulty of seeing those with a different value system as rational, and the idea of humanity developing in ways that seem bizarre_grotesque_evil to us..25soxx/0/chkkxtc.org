I do not see how this could be a development that could be considered grotesque/evil. Bizarre, yes, though it would most likely not be by the time such a concept would have been developed. I understand the fact that some people would find having a child growing/maturing extremely fast abhorrent, but there should be much less people who would do so at that point in time.
