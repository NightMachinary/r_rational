What I was saying is that natural emotional responses are *unknown*. We are not in a position to separate them from the mess of other processes happening in a child's life, so there is no basis for clearly saying 'X emotional response to Y is natural' -- most of our knowledge is more like 'X emotional response to Y is considered natural in Z culture'.

(that is, there is no 'correct', 'emotionally healthy' claim to be made here. All you can do if you want to improve outcomes is to measure outcomes.)
