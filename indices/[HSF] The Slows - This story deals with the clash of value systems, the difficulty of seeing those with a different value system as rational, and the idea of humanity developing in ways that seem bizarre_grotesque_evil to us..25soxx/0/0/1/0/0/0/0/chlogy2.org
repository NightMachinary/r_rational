I agree except for your final statement. This is why they cannot reasonably measure emotional response as the basis of the comparison. If they do, they are essentially disagreeing on the /definition/ of 'good outcome', not on whether the outcome /is/ in fact good. The situation has left the realm of trying to understand things, and entered the realm of manipulation and politics ("your opinion sucks, mine is better, no, I'm not providing any supportable reason").

I suppose on reflection that could be rational, if the other party has shown themselves unmoved by reasoning. Otherwise they need to first agree on what a 'good outcome' looks like in order to proceed rationally.
