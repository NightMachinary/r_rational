Yes, they are disagreeing on the definition of "good outcome". That's what a utility function /is/. Disagreement on that level is not unreasonable.

Yes, I acknowledge that according to your definition of "good outcome", it would be suboptimal if I killed everyone by disassembling the Earth to build a quadrillion Buddha statues. But according to my definition, it sounds lovely. I'm going to do my best to steer the world towards what /I/ think is the best outcome. And if you disagree when I start doing it anyway - I don't /care/. Yours isn't the definition I'm using.
