True. People should be aware of where their disagreement actually lies. Accelerated Offspring Growth can be AOG-good but not Slow-good, because those are two different things. I am only saying that if those two populations vote on whether A.O.G. should be forced on Slows, they will vote differently. The fact that their votes are different is not caused by stupidity or irrationality in either party, and there is no way to reasonably debate them into changing their vote. (Assuming they know what they want and they know how to get it. Which is basically never true in the real world, unfortunately.)

I think we're just quibbling over each other's ambiguous wording, and we actually agree.
