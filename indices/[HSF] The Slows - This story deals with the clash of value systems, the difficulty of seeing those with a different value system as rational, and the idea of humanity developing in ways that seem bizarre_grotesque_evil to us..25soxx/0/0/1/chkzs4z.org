Is it? You could consider emotions 'dulled' if the level of emotional response was reliably insufficient to get the right things happening for the current situation. But the necessary levels themselves seem to depend on individual psychology.

You could with equal validity postulate that in Slow childhood, the child forms unhealthy biases towards particular emotions, leading them to overly seek out some emotions and avoid/repress others. (ie. Slow -> permanent emotional trauma)
