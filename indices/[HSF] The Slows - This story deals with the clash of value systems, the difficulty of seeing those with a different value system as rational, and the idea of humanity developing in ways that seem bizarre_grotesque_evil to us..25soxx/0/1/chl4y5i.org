  I do not see how this could be a development that could be considered grotesque/evil.

When it comes to values, it's sometimes really hard to understand other people's and cultures' point of view. There are people in today's world who think it's evil that homosexuality is allowed and women are free to choose whom they have sex with. It's far easier to understand why people would cling to the traditional way of raising kids because usually people cling to traditions even in far more controversial subjects.

  I understand the fact that some people would find having a child growing/maturing extremely fast abhorrent, but there should be much less people who would do so at that point in time.

When it comes to new developments, it's always possible to see similar numbers of people opposing those developments. I don't think it's that implausible.

And yeah, I'm not yet sure if I'm ever going to be a parent, but something about slowly raising a child seems really fun. Seeing a few kilos of pooping and crying meat /really slowly/ becoming one of the most effective general-purpose machines on Earth sounds kinda interesting.

Incremental progress is really cool. If you've ever played [[http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/][Cookie Clicker]] you would understand.
