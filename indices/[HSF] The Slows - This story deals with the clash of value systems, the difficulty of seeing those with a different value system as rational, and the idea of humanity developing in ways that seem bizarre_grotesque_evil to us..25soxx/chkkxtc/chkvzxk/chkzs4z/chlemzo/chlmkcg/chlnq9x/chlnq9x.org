By "natural", I just meant "Non-A.O.G." Sorry, I assumed that was clear from context.

Take as large a population as you want, and divide it into two groups by random lottery. Consistently apply Accelerated Offspring Growth to one group, consistently deny it to the other. Do this for several generations. Subject individuals to tests designed to draw emotional responses. Have judges (or an algorithm, or something) rank each individual's degree of emotional response, without knowing which group they came from. Put all your data together.

The story strongly implies that the A.O.G. group will have weaker emotional responses than the non-A.O.G. group. Relative to the A.O.G. group, the non-A.O.G. group has exaggerated emotions. Relative to the non-A.O.G. group, the A.O.G. group has dulled emotions.

/After the outcomes are measured, after controlling for the unknown mess of other processes/, the procedure dulls emotions /relative to a non-A.O.G. population/.

It is not irrational for the two populations to disagree on which had the improved outcome, if they have different utility functions.
