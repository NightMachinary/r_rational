Do notice that it is implied that the procedure dulls emotions. The narrator finds it distasteful how the Slows "twist their faces wildly". and believes their rational thought is diluted by their "emotional exaggeration". A.O.G. evidently also removes "the swollen protrusions on [Slow women's] chests", which plenty of people of all genders might object to. If there's anything to be read into the black and green makeup the Slow wore in the narrator's honor, it might do pretty bad things to your complexion too.
