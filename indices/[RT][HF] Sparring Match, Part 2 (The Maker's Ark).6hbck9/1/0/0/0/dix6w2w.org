Mechmaster is a smart, talented, monomaniacally-focused normal. He can keep up with Doc on mechs because they were just a minor hobby for Doc--which is the original source of his jealousy: "How dare he be almost as good as me when he's just a casual dabbler at my life work!" 8-) He was only in the Box because normal jails aren't good at coping with genius-level tinkerers who are determined to keep escaping.

Mad Hatter is a magician, like Journeyman. His special talent was for making enchanted clothing and he specialized early on headgear because of personal preference. He is more benignly monomaniacal--what broke him was Brainwave mind controlling him and forcing him to make the augment helmet--which was a constant drain on his power and sanity for as long as it existed.
