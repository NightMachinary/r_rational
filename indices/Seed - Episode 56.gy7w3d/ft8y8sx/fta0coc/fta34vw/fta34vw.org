Nanites would be kind of an asspull, we haven't seen anything like that in the story so far. It tries to stay very grounded. If that is really Turry taking actual control of this guys cybernetics my guess is simpler that being hit by an EMP forced a reboot or something where the limb connected to the net and Turry was able to use that to introduce malware. Even more likely though is IMO that he wasn't even the target. Turry could not have known for sure that he would open the package.
