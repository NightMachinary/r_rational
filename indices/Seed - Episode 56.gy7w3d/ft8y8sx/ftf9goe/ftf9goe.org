Oh no. Prosthetics, in this world, seem to work off of the arm nerves directly, rather than being controlled by the contraction of some unrelated muscle.

Even with the obligatory protections to prevent short circuits from shocking the nerves/brain, I could easily see Turry using low-voltage stuff to make the victim feel "on edge," possibly making them tend towards violence/escalation earlier.
