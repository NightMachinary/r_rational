Hi all! I know, I know, it's been a while. But in my defence, I spent about a zillion hours looking for a new job after my last one suddenly got shipped to India, and ho boy does being rejected take a lot of energy out of a guy. Anyway, all of this is a leadup to me kinda sorta letting you all know that I have created a Patreon page, here: [[https://www.patreon.com/Sophronius/overview]]

Bear in mind that I'm a frugal kind of guy who saves a lot, so it's not like you should feel any moral obligation to save me from starving to death or anything. But just in case some of you are swimming around in bitcoin cash and you have no idea what to do with any of that sweet sweet dough, you know, I'm just saying the option is there. :p

Thanks to everyone who has been waiting for an update all this time!
