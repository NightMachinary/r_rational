Thanks for the feedback! The opening scene is supposed to be a direct continuation from where the last chapter left off:

#+begin_quote
  Naruto dispelled himself, and when he opened his eyes again he was sitting at the kitchen table, trying to explain to Jiraiya what had happened that day and feeling twice as exhausted as he had before.
#+end_quote

This is probably more confusing than it would otherwise be because of the huge time gap between chapters. Sorry about that. Did anyone else find this segment jarring? I'll have to change it if so.

Anyway, he refers to killing Gaara as "getting into a fight with a boy at school" as a way to sardonically contrast academy life with what he's being forced to do now. I agree it's a bit strange though, because the academy in NTBS would never have been all that mild and peaceful in the first place, so it does feel a bit like Naruto is drawing on real life knowledge which he should not have access to.

"The professor" is the canon nickname of the Third Hokage, so that part makes sense I think if you continue directly from the last chapter.
