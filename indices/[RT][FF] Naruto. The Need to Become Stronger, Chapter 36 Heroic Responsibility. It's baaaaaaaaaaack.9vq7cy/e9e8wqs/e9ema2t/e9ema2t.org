It is great to see this story resume. I look forward to seeing how the story progresses now that Gaara died and the Chuunin exam has ended. I am really curious to see whether Sand decides to invade.

Here are just some of my quick thoughts.

The very first paragraph seems like it is very disconnected from the rest of the post and the story in general. Is this supposed to be a flashback to the scene in the beginning of the story where Naruto got into a fight with Sasuke? Is this supposed to be some kind of metaphor for how Naruto perceives his actions towards Gaara?

On another note, This might just be my personal quirk but the use of the word "professor" makes me think of a college or modern school and doesn't seem to fit the genre. The idea of Naruto referring to a teacher as "Professor" just seems really weird and jarring.
