Rationality, as I see it, has 2 key components. 1) understanding reality (map v territory) and 2) optimizing behavior to achieve some outcome (system 1 vs system 2 decision making)

Rational fiction has other sub goals like having character actions match their goals...etc but I think the community pretty quickly realized that those are kind of generally good characteristics of any book. However, just because the badguys backstory is more than "he's evil" doesn't mean that story would fit in with this community. There's a general flavor that goes with rational fiction and it tenders to involve heavy uses of the two themes from the first paragraph.

Now consider progression fantasy. Given the above points about what makes a work "rational fiction" it may start to become clear why so much of rational fiction is also classified as "progression fantasy". Any GOOD progression fantasy will have 3d characters and action/goal consistency while at the same time, the entire genre focuses on the two pillars of rationality I mentioned before. Those is because most fantasy naturally explores the mechanics of its magic and world, while progression fantasy in particular has an explicit focus on optimization based on this knowledge since it tends to focus on goals that can only really be achieved by personal strength. Further, there's only so much satisfaction that can be had by saying he can move x% faster so exploring/exploiting those world/magic mechanics tends to be important.

Thus, I think the heavy lifter here is actually good progression fantasy being heavily crosslisted with rational fiction.

From progression fantasy it's only a short jump to litrpg. The good ones don't chang much from progression fantasy, simply using numbers to put a slightly harder edge on the world/magic so they can be better quantified. The bad ones just show numbers increasing which still loosely ties them to progression fantasy (they're getting stronger) and therefore rational fiction.
