For a couple months I've had a post in my blog's drafts folder that addresses this very subject, and seeing this post made me decide to finish that post and hit publish. [[http://kineticliterature.com/the-strengths-of-litrpg/][Here's the full post]] (which is too long for me to copy/paste into this thread without hitting the Reddit character limit), but to summarize the broad points:

- LitRPG tends to have more consistent systems. (Also, the characters tend to "meta-game" those systems: even in a story without wild munchkinry, LitRPG characters are more likely to at least meta-game on basic level of choosing equipment or abilities that are well-suited for a particular fight.)
- Most movie fight scenes act as though characters have "hit points," because viewers seem to prefer this kind of action scene, even though this isn't how real fights work. LitRPG actually bothers to quantify the "hit points" thing and set up a world where it's consistent with the world's rules for two characters to just punch or throw fireballs at each other until one of them is finally defeated after taking a certain number of hits.
- LitRPG is (usually) honest about characters' power levels, as opposed to speculative fiction like e.g. the MCU where the universe absurdly pretends that Black Widow (a woman with a glock) and Thor (a literal god) are anywhere close in terms of how much they bring to a fight.

Also, another point that's less explicitly "rational," but more a trait of good storytelling in general: LitRPG tends to offer a clear sense of progress for the reader. Often, stories will have to shoe-horn in certain elements to make the reader feel like they are making progress toward a goal (like "this character needs to collect six infinity stones"), but LitRPG lends itself to quantified progress much more naturally as characters regularly "level up" (and grow stronger in other ways that are common in video games but rarer in other types of stories, like learning new skills, gaining better equipment, and so on).

There's also the fact that LitRPG and "rational fiction" are both relatively young genres that have both sprung up in the past 10 years, and tend to largely exist in in web serial form, so they tend attract readers from among the same cohort of individuals who are interested in (or willing to read) serialized web fiction, which is a tiny fraction of the total number of people who read fiction.
