For me, it's a "cultural affinity" as much as anything.

Most stories follow a "[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted][Like Reality Unless Noted]]" pattern. (Content Warning: TV Tropes)

So, if someone's writing a Science Fiction story with a Galactic Government, then we'll be informed of some things like "This government is a monarchy under the King of All Cosmos", but the low-level background details, like if the characters would be on a first-name basis with their Space-Postman, are assumed to be the same as in reality.

Only, we can't say "The Same as In Reality". Not really. Different regions have subtly different expectations for mundane stuff, like 'do you know your postman?' or 'is it normal to ask a cashier about their family'. So, really, authors default to reality-as-they-perceive-it or reality-as-they-want-it-to-be.

This means that the same story, by a Cosmopolitan British Author will end up subtly different than the story by a person from Rural Manitoba. They might both describe a ticket-seller as taking money, making accurate change, and handing over a ticket. But the Brit would see that as efficient and respectful of the buyer's time, while the Canadian might see the seller as cold or rude.

To me, LitRPG hints at a cultural affinity. It's basically a flag that says, "This author is a nerdy analytic type! If you're not a nerdy analytic type you will HATE this!" And that's interesting because I feel like most mainstream authors come from a different place.

Good rational fiction also waves that flag. Now, the flag is no indication of quality. But, it's a similarity in the same way that "Both of these books are written by Canadians" is a similarity.
