  Well yes. The main difference though is that on pure might makes right terms it seems that not only do adventurers outnumber nobles, but a lot of adventurers are also more powerful than nobles. At the very least I assume that any successful adventurer essentially can start a new noble dynasty if they want.

Remember that Delve world, the awakened adventurers /do already control everything/: the Watch, the Adventure's Guild, the DKE, and the Empire are all shown to be the main global powers, and they are all made up of high level ex-adventurers.

Nobles seem only to preside over the local peasants.
