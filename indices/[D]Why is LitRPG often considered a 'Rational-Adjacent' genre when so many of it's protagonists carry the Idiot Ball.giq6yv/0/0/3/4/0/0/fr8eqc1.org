the new world has absolutely atrocious min maxing decision making in the beginning though; mc is way underleveled, kills a bat and gains several levels, does math to figure out they need to kill thousands more, then promptly ignores all the % experience boosts available even after they already have powered up to the point that hunting carries almost no risk yet they still need hundreds more.
