The main female sex interests (massive spoilers ahead, you've been warned):

1. The literal high priestess of the goddess of poison, necromancy, and witchcraft (specifically partaking in blood sacrifices)

2. A homunculus designed to seduce a prince

3. A chambermaid from 12th century europe

4. The high priestess of Bastet, Egyptian goddess of fertility

Sure, it's got a lot of sex, and I can't blame you for disliking the harem aspect. But can you honestly tell me that those characters would be out of place being sexually promiscuous with the most powerful wizard they've ever heard of?

Nobody complains when a Game of Thrones character bangs all the chambermaids. I don't see why it'd be a problem here, other than the fact that the book spends a little more time describing the sex.
