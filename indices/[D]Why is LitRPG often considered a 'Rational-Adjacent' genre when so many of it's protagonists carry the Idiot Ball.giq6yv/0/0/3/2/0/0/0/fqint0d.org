I'm not claiming the female characters are as complex as Cercei. But most of the chambermaids or secondary flings in GoT barely have more than an introduction, most don't get names.

The two main love interests get pretty detailed backstories and motivations. And very little of it revolves around sex. But if you bounced off the first book you may not have gotten to it.
