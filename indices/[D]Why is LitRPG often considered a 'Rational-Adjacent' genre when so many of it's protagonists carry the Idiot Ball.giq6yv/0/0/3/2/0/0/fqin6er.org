  Nobody complains when a Game of Thrones character bangs all the chambermaids. I don't see why it'd be a problem here, other than the fact that the book spends a little more time describing the sex.

The difference is that Game of Thrones is known for it's portrayal of complex, believable characters. Martin's female characters are all unique and end up on multiple different sides of a war that tears a nation apart. They have roles and personalities that define them as more than just their sexual relationship with a male character. Honestly, it's a little disturbing that you can't tell the difference between that and the 2-dimensional portrayal of women throughout Fimbulwinter in which the depiction of almost all women boils down to a) is hot, and b) has the hots for the protagonist.
