do you not see how ironic it is for you to say that after attempting to defend the novel by saying that of course those women would be promiscuous. "the novel treats women as masturbation puppets" "well no, its just that those women would be naturally promiscuous" "why should they be promiscuous" "you shouldnt expect for the novel to be feminist"

i am in no way surprised that you found the novel engaging.
