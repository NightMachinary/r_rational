Splitting up isn't inherently stupid. Armies, police and firefighters do it often, generally they still keep in groups of 2 in case they need back up but that's it.

​

There are feel situations where 3 people rather than 2 would be that much of an advantage in a normal dangerous situation irl. Combat IRL is faster, and very high damage, even without guns. It's generally better to encircle or close escape routes than to just pack up bodies and be easily avoided or miss the mission target altogether.

​

It's only seen as 'stupid' in RPGs and other derived works because it annoys DMs, by making their job harder which in turn means the players get punished for it.
