Having the powerful party member do nothing but pull large groups then disappear doesn't seem contrived to you? Sure does to me. But even then Those are followed by "Hey I'm going to use this aura at 13% so I don't give you soulstrain.

And we still have the issue of half of those being combat scenarios where he can't contribute because his one useful trick requires the entire party having high clarity. Or lacking multiple party roles so he can use the useless abilities he picked up so he could overpower his one trick beyond the point of usefulness
