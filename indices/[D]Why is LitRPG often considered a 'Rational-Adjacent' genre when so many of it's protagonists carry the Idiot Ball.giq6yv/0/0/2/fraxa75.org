To be fair to properly minmax an RPG you need to play it. To really do it well you need to play it over hundreds of thousands of episodic playthroughs to learn the actually optimal strategy. (Which may not be "put all your points in int for maximum magical power", unless the game is very poorly balanced)

Alphastar doesn't Zerg rush every StarCraft 2 match.

In most lit RPG scenarios the character has to "live" it, with no respawns. Ergo things that improve durability or ability to dodge or escape are probably optimal, given the character usually gets only one life.

On several good rr fics, the character wants to be a Batman wizard but the system offers them an Uber rare melee class. So they have to play it as this is the optimal strategy available. (Defiance of the Fall on RR is one I read)
