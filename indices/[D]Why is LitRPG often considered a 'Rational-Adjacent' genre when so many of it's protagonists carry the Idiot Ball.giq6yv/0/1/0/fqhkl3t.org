The only time I've seen a litrpg manage to avoid this trap (mostly) is worth the candle. Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty gets an honourable mention because it plays with the trope of RPG rationalist having to navigate a suddenly much more complex world and system.

I think part of it is demographics. Both writers and readers skew male, young, and tech-y. If you say “pick 2” you probably manage to capture 99% of the community. We like rpgs, they're systems we actually know pretty well, and they have aesthetic choices we like. Most of us are humanist leaning, some trans-humanist, which actually narrows our scope of what we would accept as rational.

Take a story in which the Christian god is real and the protagonist is already Christian and made aware of this, they then rationally work to convert as many people as possible. I don't know if I would read this, probably not.

My point is that “Rational” fiction as a category is significantly defined by the aesthetics of its audience, to the point of exclusion of what might objectively be called rational fiction in other contexts, ie, fiction with smart, reflective characters that have different value sets than our own. It might be hard to even identify from an outsiders perspective. Do I recognize the protagonist of a harlequin romance as being unusually rational in her attempts to woo the paramour? It's hard to imagine, partly because (and here I'll admit a major exception to my thesis) the tropes present in the genre don't demand smart characters. It's not like there are countless other rational works just with different value sets scattered around your library, but there are probably a few we just might not recognize immediately.

I'd love to read some of them actually.
