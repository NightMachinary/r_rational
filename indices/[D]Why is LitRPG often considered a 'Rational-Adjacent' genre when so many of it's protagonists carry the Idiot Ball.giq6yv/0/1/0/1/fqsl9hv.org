As someone who doesn't identify with that "pick 2" list, I appreciate this comment. :)

I like reading about rational characters. It's fun and interesting, and if I had a choice I'd prefer my characters to be intellectuals because in all likelihood they'd make the plot more intriguing too.

But you know what I don't particularly like? Game fics. Characters constantly munchkining everything. Smut fics with some rationality sprinkled in.

Guys: not all rational fiction needs to be a litRPG, high fantasy, or fanfiction rewrite. You're missing out on a lot of great options. What about a rational horror story? The rational character thinks they have the mystery solved until...turns out the villain was just smarter than you. Or what about a rational comic with sarcastic characters? Historical fiction dealing with difficult scenarios that are difficult to resolve, even using the characters' combined intelligence? Heck, you could even write children's literature! Create a character who describes rational thinking in simple ways.

Write one of these things and ping me, I'll read it.
