LitRPG as a genre is so flooded with poorly structured stories that it's easy to consider that the definition of the genre - "getting stronger" is a viable substitute for character development, if your book is free and your readers are bored. But it isn't 'genre-adjacent', because rational fiction *isn't a genre*, it's a writing style, and one that can be applied in any genre (though some are tougher than others).

There's also a general conflation of rational writing with /rationlist/ writing - munchkinry is a degenerate form of rationalism, and is a *lot easier* than writing a truly rationalist character, so it tends to get overrepresented. A *lot* of litrpg attempts to be rationalist - the sort of people that want to invent an mmo system are the exact people that are interested in min-maxing a d&d character. Unfortunately, that group is also frequently unaware of the importance of plot and character depth to a story.
