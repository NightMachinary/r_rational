Litrpg has a specific and explicit "System" with rules, numbers, and exploitable mechanics so is more likely to have genuine consistency and consequences than a standard new magic/physics system. This lends itself well to munchkinry, and generally scientific / rational exploration of novel mechanics (which may be complicated, but are much more susceptible to exploitation by a rational actor than new physics). They still often fail in this regard, but usually fare better than standard fantasy of the same quality level.

Also I think its just that people who enjoy rational fiction are more likely than other groups to enjoy litrpg as well. Rational fiction readers are more likely to enjoy gaming tropes and progression fantasy than the average reader.
