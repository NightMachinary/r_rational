Especially annoying to me is munchkinry based on facts the character doesn't know. Delve has this. The character calls himself a munchkin but starts with a super suboptimal build that only becomes remotely viable because it opens up a rare class. But he didn't know that class existed, so he's just bad at minmaxing and lucked into a strong synergy build.
