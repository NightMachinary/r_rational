his dubious build preferences aside (I wouldn't do what he did either, but hey, that's why he's the mc and not me) he's been doing everything he can to optimize the mana drain mitigation from his build choice with a unique and unorthodox solution. This is why everybody that realizes what he's done goes all googly eyed.

Remember, optimization doesn't happen in a vacuum, you need a goal to optimize towards. To say something is suboptimal without context to measure it by is a vacuous statement. What I expect you mean by suboptimal in this context is resource efficient, which yeah tbf the Delve mc is anything but that. But again, that wasn't his goal, so measuring him by a metric he doesn't care about is somewhat dubious.
