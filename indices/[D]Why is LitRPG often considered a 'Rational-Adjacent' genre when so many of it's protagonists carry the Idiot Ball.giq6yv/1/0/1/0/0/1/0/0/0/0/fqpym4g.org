I 100% agree with what you just said; he had no context for what was good or what was bad in the early parts of the story. As such, I have no idea how it's possible to judge anything he does as optimal/suboptimal (again, we have no context for how effective any of the abilities are, for all we know getting the animal handling skill could be super op). That is why the only possible metric we can judge his skill choice by is the one he chose to specialize: mana regeneration. Based on this, he made a very optimal build since he has the best mana regeneration available to him. The reasons WHY he wanted to spec mana regen could totally be up for debate, but that isn't really debating the rationality of the story anymore, so much as it is debating the personal characteristics and motivations of the character.
