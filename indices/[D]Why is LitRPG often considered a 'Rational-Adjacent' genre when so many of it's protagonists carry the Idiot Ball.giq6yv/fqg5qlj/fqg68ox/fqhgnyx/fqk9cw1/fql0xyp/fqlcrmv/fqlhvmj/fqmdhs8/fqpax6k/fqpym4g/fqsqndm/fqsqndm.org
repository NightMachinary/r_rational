He had one point of reference: his own stats. When you have a mana pool that'll burn through in 10 seconds and takes 2 days to recharge, picking the highest mana consuming ability that does less damage than other skills is not rational. That is compounded by the fact he just almost got mauled by a wolf, and chose a skill with a 1 metre range that deals damage over time, requiring him to survive a melee fight with a wolf for potentially minutes, even assuming he reaches his goal of ever making auras sustainable. (Again, he did not know about range increases in auras yet)
