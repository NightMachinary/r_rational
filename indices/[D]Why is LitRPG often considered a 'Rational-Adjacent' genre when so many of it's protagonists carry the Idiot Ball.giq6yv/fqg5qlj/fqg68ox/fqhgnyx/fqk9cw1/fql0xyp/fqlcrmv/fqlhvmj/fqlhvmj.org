Looking at an aura that deals less damage than firebolt, costs more mana and has a range of 1 metre and taking the aura (with no way of knowing whether the range would ever increase) seems very suboptimal to me. As does looking at an aura that eats through his entire mana in 10 seconds and thinking "i should invest all my stats for the next 20 levels to make this slight inconvenience to anyone around me sustainable". Remember, his entire mana pool would have been enough to deal half the health of a level 1 character in damage. Again, he had no information on skill changes with level up.
