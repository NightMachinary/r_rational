I don't really disagree. There's a lot of litrpg in which the system is just "throw awesome sounding stuff at MC." I think requiring some specifics, some mechanics is still helpful compared to similarly low quality non litrpg stories. Eg Xianxia where most of the time the MC just really wants it hard and has an unspecified "Overcome Impossible Odds" ability.

I think most of the popularly recommended litrpg stories on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] are fairly consistent mechanically and some have a decent amount of munchkinry. EG Two Year Emperor, worth the candle, delve, so you should really talk about specific books rather than the entire genre (for one thing I've never heard anyone recommend the whole genre).
