The idiot ball goes beyond mere stupidity though. It's when a character does something stupid /despite/ his characterization and specifically in a stupid way that doesn't fit. The classical example is "Let's split up" when everyone is clearly scared shitless and one of the characters has actual experiences of being in horror movie situations. Even a relatively dumb person wouldn't be okay with it. Another one is when someone uses some cool skill all the time, except that one time where it would obviously and easily solve their problem, thus negating the need for some plot thread.
