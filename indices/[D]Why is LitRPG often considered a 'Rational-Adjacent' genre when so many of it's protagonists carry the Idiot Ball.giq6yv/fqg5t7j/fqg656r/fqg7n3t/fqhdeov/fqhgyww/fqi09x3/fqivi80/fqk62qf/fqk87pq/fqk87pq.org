I was more thinking of horror movies or adventure stories set in "horror" settings like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Like, "there are definitely monsters here that are hard but not impossible to defend against and that like using ambush tactics (we know because we've been through it multiple times now) so let's split up to maybe find a random doodad a tiny bit faster". That kind of stuff.
