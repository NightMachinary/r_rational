All these categories are fuzzy and can readily lead to type categorization errors.

A big part of it is that the concept of “idiot ball” isn't inherent to a story, it's produced through a readers analysis. If I never pick up on stupid decisions made, I never think the characters are stupid. Stupidity is also a little bit subjective, so I think between those two things recommendations that someone thinks are barely passable for them, are completely unreadable for someone else.
