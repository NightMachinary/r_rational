Fimbulwinter (Daniel Black Book 1) treats the female characters like masturbation puppets, though. I tried reading it and got really skeeved out after a while. It's a sort of ultimate Nice Guy fantasy: I do good things for these women so they all pay me with sex!

Insert "decent human being" tokens, get blowjobs and titty fucking from people with less power. It creeped me out.
