The Gam3 is basically a sci-fi litrpg, where spacefaring races play a RPG as a way to have a virtual war so the real world doesn't get annihilated in conflict

The New World is a system-apocalypse style. Gamelike mechanics come to the modern world, and it ends society. The main character ends up minmaxing his constitution score to survive, and eventually gets to truly ridiculous levels.
