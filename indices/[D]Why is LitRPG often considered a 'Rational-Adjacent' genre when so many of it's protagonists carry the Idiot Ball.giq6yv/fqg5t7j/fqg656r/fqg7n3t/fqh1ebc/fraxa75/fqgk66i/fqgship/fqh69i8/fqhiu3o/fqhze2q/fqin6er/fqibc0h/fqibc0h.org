It was the context of some of it. It's not out of place because the writer made sure it wasn't out of place. The writer also wrote in personalities who were totes OK and rational about poly and totes ok with getting reshaped to be hotter and totes *grateful* for all the *modern goodness*, despite living in a society and being culturally adapted to a completely different set of rules. But oh, the rational hero shows up and just is so much better than all the other guys, and has zero problems with the power imbalance. It just felt a bit like there was an excuse for everything. Rationalizing, so to speak, when the characters are literally just there to act out sex fantasies. They're not people, they're fuckpuppets. And fuckpuppets are fine! It's cool. But I get the feeling that as a book, it gets some rational love it doesn't deserve from folks who have their boobgoggles on.
