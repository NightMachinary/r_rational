People not minmaxing doesn't mean they necessarily have an Idiot Ball.

Remember, the Idiot Ball is when someone who is normally smart and/or thoughtful does something stupid solely to make the plot move forward. If a cautious character suddenly decides to walk down a dark alley in the bad part of town for no reason, that's an Idiot Ball. If that same character is in a desperate hurry because they are trying to save their friend's life and the alley is a shortcut, that's rational.

Minmaxing your build is the rational thing to do for people who are thoughtful, measured, understand game systems, have the math skills (it's usually math) to identify synergy, and have time to consider. There are plenty of reasons why someone might not do this. Maybe they don't have enough information. Maybe the Game Master frowns upon it and will smite you. Maybe a level up requires you to make all choices within a few seconds and you don't have the information to make choices in advance. Maybe it's a question of personality -- characters with terrible impulse control won't sit and read through a hundred skills to find the perfectly optimal one. Maybe the chapter doesn't /want/ the perfectly optimal one -- magic is the better choice, but a devout and observant Christian will still go sword-and-board because witchcraft is forbidden. Etc
