In Delve you could argue that the main character's firdt choices were done without much thought, but he was actually happy with it and pretty much stuck to a great build centered around said first choices.

Something I also really enjoyed was the actual existence of a language barrier at first, even though it is clear from how he describes translation and learning new words that the author has never been passably fluent in any second language and hasn't really researched the topic either. But that's pretty much just a personal pet peeve of mine, and one that I was ablew to overlook.
