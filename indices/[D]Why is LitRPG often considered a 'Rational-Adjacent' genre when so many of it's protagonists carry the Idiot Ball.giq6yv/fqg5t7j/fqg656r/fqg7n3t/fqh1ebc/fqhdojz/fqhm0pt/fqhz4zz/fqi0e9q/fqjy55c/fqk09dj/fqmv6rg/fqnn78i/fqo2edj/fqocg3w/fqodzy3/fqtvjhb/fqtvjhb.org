Are you reading the same story I'm reading? Because what you say does not reflect what I see on the page. For example, when has Rain ever said "I'll use this at 13% so that I don't give you soulstrain?" There has been one occasion I can think of where he used Essence Well at a reduced level *because the mana transfer is more efficient that way*, but I can't recall him ever needing to slow it down in order to avoid soulstrain.

Besides, even if you were right and Rain could cause soulstrain...cool. That sounds like a pretty darned effective attack: It disables the person without killing them or damaging their gear, and the fact that he has IFF means he can do it to anyone he likes within dozens of meters without affecting his friends. Still, I don't think he can do that and I would like to see a citation.

As to "the powerful party member do nothing but pull large groups then disappear[ing]"...are you talking about Velika leading Rain and the group of unawakened into the Fells? The whole purpose of that was to awaken a bunch of 'dulls' (as she calls them). She didn't want to be bothered with the 'dulls' so she was leaving all the work to Rain; she did the fun part (drawing aggro, killing whatever she felt like killing, making fun of the dulls, making them entertain her with their attempts at combat) and had him do all the actual explaining, protecting, ensuring that the unawakened each did damage to the essence monster so that they could get awakened, etc. She wasn't disappearing as a contrivance, she was disappearing because she's a bored princess with the attention span of a goldfish and the morality of a murderhobo.
