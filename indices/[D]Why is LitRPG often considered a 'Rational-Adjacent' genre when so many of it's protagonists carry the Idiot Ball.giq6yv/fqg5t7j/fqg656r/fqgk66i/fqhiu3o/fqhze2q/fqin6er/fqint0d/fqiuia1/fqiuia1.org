Actually, I picked up the series during a point in my life when I didn't have as many options for enjoyable reading material. Thus, while I recognized a lot of elements in the book as TRP inspired fantasy of earning the perfect waifus, the other aspects of kingdom building were interesting enough that I was willing to push through those parts and keep reading all the way to the end of the second book.

I gave up when the main character's method of saving a chronic rape abuse victim was to grow his penis to dimensions larger than his own body and fuck her with it until she howled from orgasm in order to show her that sex isn't bad and she doesn't have to hate all men.

Before that point I was tentatively willing to accept the protagonist's portrayal as a Nice Guyâ„¢ who is uncomfortable with having all of these women in a subservient role to him but goes along with it because that's what their society has normalized for them. And yes, like most harem fantasies, the waifus have different backstories to justify why they devote so much of their thoughts and abilities to making the protagonist happy. That thin veneer of justification doesn't change the fact that the story is a blatant harem fantasy and the women were invented to fill their roles in that harem.

/That's/ the difference between Martin's named female characters and E. William Brown's.
