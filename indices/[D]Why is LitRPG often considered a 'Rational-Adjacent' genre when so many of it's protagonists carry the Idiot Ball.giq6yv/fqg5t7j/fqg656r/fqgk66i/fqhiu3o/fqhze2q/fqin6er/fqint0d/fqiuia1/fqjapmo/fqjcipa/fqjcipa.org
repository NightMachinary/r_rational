I won't argue with that. It is what it sets out to be, and it's a genre that many people enjoy reading. I only jumped in to point out the absurdity of the Game of Thrones comparison.

Personally, I don't think Brown's series would qualify as rational due to the flat characters and deus ex machinas involved in the wish fulfillment plot structure. But that's just my opinion. As other people have explained in this thread, the rational fiction community is a loose conglomeration made up of people with different, somewhat-overlapping preferences. Each person has different tastes in regards to which aspects of a story they are willing to forgive/overlook if they think the rest of the work has rational characteristics.
