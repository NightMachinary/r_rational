You did not mention it. Did you mean to add something in an earlier post but forgot?

  he's gone too deep into [Winter/Essence Well], to the point he gives anyone soulstrain by using them at full power
#+end_quote

Recent chapters disprove this, but I don't recall if they are currently Patreon-only or not. Suffice to say, he uses these abilities on bronzeplates without hurting them and everyone considers him the only reason that they are surviving.

#+begin_quote
  Every other ability had to have extremely contrived circumstances to be even remotely useful

- "Hey, I burned up all my mana fighting the big thing in the last room and there's another big thing in the next room."
- "Hey, I want to train more so that I can level up my skills ASAP, but I'm out of mana."
- "Hey, my magical gear has run out of juice and I don't have Mana Manipulation so I can't power it up."
- "Hey, we're stuck in the woods during a blizzard and I'm freezing to death."
- "Hey, we need water and the only stuff around is filthy and/or toxic."
- "Hey, I think this wound is infected."

Those don't seem terribly contrived.
