Idk it kinda made sense. He went looking for things that all worked together, cause he dint want to have to speck into a lot of different meta magics. He thought he had an optimal build because it would require less skill points over all to make it good. Of course he later learns is that 1 his chosen path is a lot weaker then other choices, 2 his limited information of the available skills made him lose out on paths of advancement that had op combinations. Its like most rpgs, the more hidden information, the harder it is to create optimal builds.
