I didn't get this while reading it. If anything, the MC puts himself down /for subpar combat capabilities for his level/.

For example, a huge plot point is him getting the full suit of armor and then developing a complex about taking it off, because the MC knows that he is a totally squishy.

The MC sees other people fight, and realizes that he has almost nothing that is comparable: he does a bunch of math to try to figure out how to bridge the gap between his own damage output and the output of the people around him, and he figures that he is just better off embracing the support role, because the gap is just too big.

If anything, the MC is only happy about the intangibles that his build brings. Going all clarity let him learn the language and modify the screens.
