I would argue it is bad writing, because the character is proud of choices he should be able to tell are bad (he has the skill descriptions and his own stats to base assumptions on), but is vindicated after the fact for reasons. Would we call that a deus ex machina? A plot armor from bad choices? Probably need to get on tvtropes to find the correct term...
