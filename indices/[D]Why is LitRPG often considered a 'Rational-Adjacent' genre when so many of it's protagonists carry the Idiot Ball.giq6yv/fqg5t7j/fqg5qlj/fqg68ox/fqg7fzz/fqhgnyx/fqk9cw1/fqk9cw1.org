I mean in Delve I think it's understandable. He was in a spot where he couldn't really converse with anyone or increase his knowledge of the system in any meaningful way. It would be pretty unrealistic if he magically figured out the unlock condition for some super rare class. After actually getting his class, he's much more scientific in learning more about how the system works and making optimal choices.
