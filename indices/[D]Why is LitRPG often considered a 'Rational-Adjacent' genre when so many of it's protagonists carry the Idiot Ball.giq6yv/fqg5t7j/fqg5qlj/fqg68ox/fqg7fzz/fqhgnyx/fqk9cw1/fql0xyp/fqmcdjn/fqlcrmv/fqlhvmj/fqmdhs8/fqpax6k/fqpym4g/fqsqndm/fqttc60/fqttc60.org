I thought you were using hyperbole when you said "eats through his entire mana in 10 seconds " but you've said it twice now, so I went back to ch.6 to double check the stats. The lvl 1 skill was 7-8 dps per 5 mps. He starts with 200 mana with a regen of 100 per day. With his entire mana pool he can sustain for 40 seconds. That's 280-320 damage with his full mana pool.

Now lets look at the context of when he chose the skill; he was in a sewer surrounded by slimes. He fought a slime before, he knew what it would take to kill it. He was reassured by Ameliah and the receptionist that he could handle the quest on his own as a lvl 1 skilless scrub. So he went with his preference of AoE > targeted damage. Was it mana efficient? No. Was it damage efficient? No. But it was good enough for his short term goals.

Long term he was expecting to be in a party acting as a support caster with the expectation that he would be desired more quickly as a party member if he can help buff his team mates rather than put out pittily low level damage.

Again, I think you're conflating resource efficiency with optimization. In this case I don't think they are the same thing.

Ironically, in a story heavily focused on number crunching and optimization, the mc is choosing skills that fail at maximizing his damage output.
