I think we may have hit an impasse here. I think from the easily visible info on the stat screen and skill descriptions, it was obvious from the beginning his build was subpar. I base this on the fact i thought so when I first read the chapters, and i had the exact amount of information the mc had.

You seem to think he had a reasonable excuse to think his build was strong. I don't see one, but you do you.
