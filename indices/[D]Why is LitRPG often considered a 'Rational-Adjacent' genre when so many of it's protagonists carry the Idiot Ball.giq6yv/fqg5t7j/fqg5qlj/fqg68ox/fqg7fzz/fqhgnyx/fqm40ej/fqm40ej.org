That's generally what people are /looking for/, but it's like taking drugs - you're always looking to recreate your first hit, which lowers your standards.

For me in particular it was Harry Potter and the Natural 20, and I largely got into LitRPGs because I read (I think?) the first Chaos Seeds book and thought "oh this kinda reminds me of Nat 20, but it's a complete story - I wonder if there's more?"
