To add on to the stuff about progression. In more classic stories it feels like there more big jumps of power then more realistic slowly getting better. Dude finds magic sword, big power up, training Montague, big power up, hidden heritage that grants op ability gets unlocked, big power up. All of those events make the Mc stronger suddenly and sometimes little build up. In well written litrpgs, it feels more reasonable. Mc does something, gains a level. He upgrades his equipment with a slightly better sword. Makes it feel more realistic and slow.
