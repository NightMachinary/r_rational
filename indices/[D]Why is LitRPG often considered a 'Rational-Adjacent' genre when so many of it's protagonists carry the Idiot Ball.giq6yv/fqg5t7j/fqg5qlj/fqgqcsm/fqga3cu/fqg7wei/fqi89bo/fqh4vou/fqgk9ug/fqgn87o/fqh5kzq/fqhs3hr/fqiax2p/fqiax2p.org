There's a fair amount of stuff that shows up on this forum that's not rational fiction, but more, "People who like rational fiction seem to predictably also enjoy..." That includes LitRPG, Xianxia, stories about planning paying off, stories about progression, and knowingly trope-heavy works. Liking these things isn't going to be 100% true of everyone in the community (e.g. I don't get Xianxia), but we're just using that prediction to make media recommendations, which are already expected to be hit-and-miss.

I actually think this is a great feature of the community. Having a specific focus and letting people be off topic add breadth and texture to the discussion, but ensures some degree of shared tastes.
