I wouldn't consider LitRPGs as a whole to be rational or rational-adjacent by any means. I consider rationality in fiction to be a spectrum, however, not binary - and I'd consider several LitRPGs to have some elements that are rational (or rational-adjacent, if you prefer).

There are certainly more than five stories I'd consider to be rational-adjacent. Here are six to start with.

*Some examples:*

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083SC2CNV/][*Log Horizon*]] does a better job than most LitRPGs of portraying the kind of social dynamics you'd see in a "transported to a MMO" scenario. It has a min/maxer protagonist who spends most of his attention on improvements to the quality of life for people there, politicking, and making peace with the natives to the world they're transported to. Because of this focus - and the game itself feeling more genuinely MMO-like than most of the games out there - I think this is a reasonable example.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve][*Delve*]] is popular in the rational community because it goes into significant depth with the character's min/maxing. It also shows a great deal of the protagonist's thought process when he makes decisions, which helps give it a rational feel.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare][*Threadbare*]] has some min/maxing, but I mostly consider it rational-adjacent because it has strong transhumanist themes.

[[https://www.amazon.com/WORLD-PRIME-5-Book/dp/B07H9D3P8F][*The World of Prime Series*]] is rational-adjacent in that it involves a mechanical engineer from our world being transported to a D&D-style setting and trying to use his knowledge to uplift society. It isn't perfect, but one of the best rational-esque qualities I liked is how little the protagonist actually remembers in terms of how to reinvent things - he doesn't have any easy time of slapping together the renaissance in Rome like some protagonists do.

[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/kono-sekai-ga-game-da-to-ore-dake-ga-shitte-iru/][*Kono Sekai ga Game da to, Ore dake ga Shitte Iru*]] involves a protagonist being transported into a game that is absolutely riddled with bugs. The rational-adjacent part here is that finding and exploiting bugs is a huge part of the story. This is a parody, and thus, not 100% rational.

I consider my own [[https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Defeat-a-Demon-King-in-Ten-Easy-Steps-Audiobook/B086R2N27Y][*How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps*]] rational-adjacent because of the min/maxing involved, as well as the protagonist using lateral thinking and exploits to try to break things. The extensive use of foreshadowing also lends a rational-adjacent quality, since being "fair play" is generally considered a component of rational fiction. Like the above, this is a parody - the characters involved are (deliberately) archetypical, similar to something like Maoyuu or Yuusha Yoshihiko. This is actually probably /less/ rational than any of my other books, due to the shorter length, simplicity, and comedic elements - but I'm mentioning it because I wouldn't consider my other books LitRPGs.
