Here's the bulleted list from this forum, along with my thoughts about litRPG's correlation.

- Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

/The word *creative* is salient. Characters might win solely through grit, but without at least an occasional win using wits, it is very difficult to assign any work into this genre. It's for this reason that Log Horizon with its political interplay is Rational, while Sword Art Online is not./

- Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

/This one tends to be a weakness in litRPG. The character goals are nearly always "defeat these monsters" - which can get repetitive. The genre's powers and skills have a decided tendency to be almost entirely combat-related. Subversion of this can make for a great Rational story, but this doesn't happen often./

- Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

/Mother of Learning, a non-litRPG, had an ending that truly embodied this. It's rare in litRPG for there to be happy endings that are earned by great acts of plot engineering./

/Even in Rational stories, this tends to be uncommon. The climax in a story usually involves sacrifice, character growth, or something similar. It's really rare outside of detective stories that the resolution is a Rational epiphany./

- Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.

/This is probably the most problematic Rational facet for litRPG. If a character aspires to be more canny, many works will portray the main character bumping up mental stats in order to do so. This can feel unearned, and brings up questions of the characters' agency. When subverted, though, this can be a thrill to read. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249][Worth the Candle]] plays with this fairly successfully. At one point, a secondary character realizes that she'd gain a mechanical benefit by changing her attitude, and immediately does so, horrifying the main character./

- Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

/This particular facet is pretty common in litRPG. There's some nice world-building around RPG mechanics. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WanderingInn/][The Wandering Inn]] is set in a fantasy / medieval world where gender equality exists pretty much universally because class differences vastly overshadow gender differences./

Having said all this, I'll add that Rationalism isn't simply binary, nor does it necessarily lead to more enjoyable stories. There are some great litRPG stories out there with very sharp protagonists that simply aren't Rational.

One final thought for now: this subreddit has moderate traffic, and a number of interesting posts to read, admittedly including material that doesn't come across as wholly Rational. Zealous gatekeeping is to our detriment unless the noise to signal ratio here gets a lot worse.
