For some people minmaxing is equivalent to rationality. If you simplify a setting down to just game mechanics, then sure, making smart moves mechanically is easy; but rarely are settings that pared down. It's much harder to write a character that improves themselves by thinking clearly about problems and addressing personal problems than to just make arbitrary numbers get bigger and pretend that's self improvement while ignoring everything else, and people are lazy so they want to write the second one.
