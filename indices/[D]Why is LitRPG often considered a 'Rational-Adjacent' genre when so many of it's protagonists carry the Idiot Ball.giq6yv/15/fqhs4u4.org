I use rat-adj explicitly where I /don't/ think the literature is rational, but might otherwise appeal to that sort of demographic. A rational litRPG is just rational.

Idk if I'd call litRPG rat-adj, simply because of how much garbage the genre gets, but I agree with others' points that it can be conducive to similar themes.
