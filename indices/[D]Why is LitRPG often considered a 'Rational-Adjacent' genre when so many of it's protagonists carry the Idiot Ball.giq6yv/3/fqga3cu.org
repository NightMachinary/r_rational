I don't think a protagonist holding the idiot ball is inherent to the genre itself. I think that happens so much because of some combination of novice authors, competing pressures from mixing in other tropes (like power fantasy and wish fulfillment), and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw][Sturgeon's Law]] (it sounds like you read a lot so you're probably gonna hit a lot of shit books).

As for calling the genre itself "Rational-Adjacent", look at the adjacent tropes list in the sidebar

if you consider "what RPG build is best to go for?" as the mystery and the author shows the individual abilities/choices the protag has to make. Then this is essentially fulfilled.

pretty natural to go from RPG to exploiting the RPG's rules

The other 3 don't really seem essential to the genre to me, but 2 out of 5 just for being in the genre seems pretty good to me.
