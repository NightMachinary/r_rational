I'm back after a long break with another comic. I've been sitting on this one a while, but it applies Touhou abilities to an imagining of the actual progression of time on the universal scale; the title is quite self explanatory. This is not a "fair-play whodunnit", but readers familiar with Touhou might like to try and anticipate some of the solutions presented.

I know that this is might be outside of the usual comfort zones, but I hope that anyone looking for a short rational sci-fi manga with fantasy elements will get a kick out of this. Please leave a comment if you liked or disliked the story to help me learn for my next recommendation. :)
