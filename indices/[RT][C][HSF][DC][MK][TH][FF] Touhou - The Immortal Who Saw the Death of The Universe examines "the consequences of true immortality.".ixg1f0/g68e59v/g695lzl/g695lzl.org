Yes, the intermission pages in particular seemed a labor of love, explaining how the powers function and addressing issues like "depression after existing alone on a lifeless planet for billions of years". And the EEG brain wave scans made me laugh.

Just to clarify, I did not work on the comic and I did not work on the translation, but I'm glad you liked the recommendation. Hopefully I will find more examples of rational manga to share!
