So far, I just read world customize creator. Rational stuff is supposed to have them using weak powers to a great extent. It looks more like the main character is nearly omnipotent and not doing much with his powers. Also, he seems to just assume that everyone he interacts with is the good guys. It looks like he's been lucky so far, but it's not a good strategy. You can't just make someone an artifact because they told you that they're giving it to someone that they tell you is on your side.
