Ah, I'm actually past the end of the manga and reading the translated novel version at this point.

I still think it's a fun read, but the further I go the more it appears our protagonist's moral compass isn't quite human, or at least wouldn't match up with our society's.

On the other hand maybe it never was. He did say that he literally cannibalized villainous people in his original life to feed his power.
