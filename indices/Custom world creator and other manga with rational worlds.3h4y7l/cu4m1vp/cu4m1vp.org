I liked the second two. World creator is crap, though. Just pandering to the gamer audience with minimal effort.

Re:monster is wish fulfilment, but it's the kind of wish fulfilment that's self aware enough to not be grating, with a decently interesting plot. I saw the main character described as a turbo-sue, and have to agree, but that's half the fun.

Tsuyo is fun because it's basically a peggy sue fanfiction, comic-fied. Not particularly rational so far (enemies are just evil for evil's sake) but does a decent job nob being incredibly cliche and just having a believably, but not massively OP hero.
