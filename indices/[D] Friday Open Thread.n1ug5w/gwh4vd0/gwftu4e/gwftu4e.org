I noticed that [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-intermission.787978/][Companion Chronicles]] has started updating weekly again.

It's not especially rational, and never quite recaptured the magic of its initial Worm jump, so I'm hesitant to bring it up in the monday fiction thread. But since I first came across it here, I thought some people might appreciate knowing that it's off hiatus.
