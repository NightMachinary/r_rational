I stumbled on this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4][video]] in another subreddit and thought the people here might enjoy. Essentially it's a Sudoku solving video with extra constraints and a seemingly impossible starting position. The narrator's sheer delight at engaging with the puzzle is really fun to watch.

I recommend skipping to about 3 minutes in when he actually starts trying to solve it.
