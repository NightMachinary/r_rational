The end of the Worm arc actually deals with that. Basically Taylor never forgives the MC for not intervening and preventing her trigger event, and the MC realizes how the just wanting to hang out with her favorite characters is messed up when they're real people and you don't help them so that they become the characters you know them as.

So I would say it's plenty self-aware. I can't actually remember the motivations of the MC in that jump though so I think that part is probably a valid criticism.

Also I skipped the Dragon Quest jump because the setting wasn't to my liking, still enjoying the interludes though - Scion is a companion!
