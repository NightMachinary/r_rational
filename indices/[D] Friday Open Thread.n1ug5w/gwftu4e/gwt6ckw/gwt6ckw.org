I love how every story arc is adapted to the genre conventions. I.E. in Worm things escalate and get worse, in Star Trek basically every story act has an episodic structure with beginning, middle, end, and moral lesson, and in some JRPG that I've never played the main character occasionally suffers from Cut Scene Incompetence.
