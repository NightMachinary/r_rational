As an AI-mind, a virus would present itself as something that you're running as a subprocess, which consumes your resources but doesn't do anything that you find useful or rewarding. But given that it's successfully infected you, it would find some way to justify itself as serving your instrumental goals so that you feel reluctant to turn it off, for example labelling itself as being for 'fun', even if it doesn't actually achieve that result.

The AI protagonist examines their process list, and finds a program that feeds them tidbits of news/interest from Reddit and occasionally posts something - equivalent to a human browsing Reddit, if we were able to do that as a background thread. That turns out to be the virus.

Implication, minus the clever story: browsing Reddit is a waste of time that superficially feels rewarding/fun without actually achieving anything useful to your overall goals. You too are infected with the virus.
