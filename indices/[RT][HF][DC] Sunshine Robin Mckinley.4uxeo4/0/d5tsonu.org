Years ago, I heard about the movie /Sunshine/, where the sun goes out and a group of people take a spaceship there so they can nuke it and hopefully start it up again. I saw something in a magazine that made me think it was based on a book, so I went to the library, found this was only book in the catalog titled /Sunshine/, and checked it out.

It was not exactly what I expected.

I finished it anyway. I probably never would have read it if I knew what I was getting, because I was predisposed against vampire romances. I remember liking it far more than I expected, even though I can't recall many specific details or scenes. Still haven't seen the space movie.
