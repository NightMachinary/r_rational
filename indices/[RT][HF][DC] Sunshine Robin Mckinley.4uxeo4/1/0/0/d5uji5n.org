hmmm yeah sorry, twilight and anne mcaffery as a cultural phenomena sort of bleed together for me.

So I actually read it when it was new because Mckinley was a bit of a staple of my childhood (family reading/pre bed story time) and my brother recommended it to me . I guess it was midway/near the end of the pre-twilight anne-mcaffery vampire craze, and magic realism/urban fantasy was rather strong too at the time too.
