This is a very good story that on reading it struck me as being a quite rational and intriguing set of world building. I'm almost certain it was done as a 'take that' deconstruction of either Twilight or Anne Rice novels (I suspect the later).

The protagonist is a baker in a mostly modern world that happens to also have magic and this is handled quite solidly.

The author did very effective research into what working in restaurants and kitchen professionals are like and captured "the feel" of that kind of work as a realized character.

It is not rationalist, but I would say the world is rational.
