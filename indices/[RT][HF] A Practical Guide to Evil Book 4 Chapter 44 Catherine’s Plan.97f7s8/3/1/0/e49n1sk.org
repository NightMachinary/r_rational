Catherine's plan was to hit reality so hard it dented, and then have Masego drill a hole in it, to get out of a broken pocket dimension. Then she sent her first two (not her last two, the first allies she relies on: the enemy who gives her more power, and her trusty thinky wizard) , because the wizard was tired and needed a bodyguard, and Cat still needs to go murder, someone who has previously made mutually beneficial deals fey nobility, well mutually beneficial, aside from empowering Cat.
