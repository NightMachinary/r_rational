I think "Catherine's Plan" was hinted at by the quote at the beginning of the chapter. Akua's Plan was 17 different plots at once. Catherine's Plan is the Indy Ploy: No plan whatsoever.

That's a good question about the Skein. I had thought that it smashed the wheels in a "taking you with me, collapse-the-pocket-dimension" attempt. And appeared to have succeeded. When it collapsed, though, it left Cat, Akua, and Masego all in the same void. Akua and Cat can be explained away via Winter mantles and chains, but not Masego. So if all parties present were not shunted into their own personal voids, shouldn't the Skein have been right there with them? Or maybe it was, but lacking wings or any other propulsion, it just floated with no way to pursue? The text should have at least made a passing mention of it, though.

EDIT:

It occurs to me that, as the keeper of the Threefold Reflection, the Skein may have been the unique actor, and so he was affected by the collapse differently than the visitors.
