  If Malicia were intelligent - and I have no reason to believe that she isn't - she'd have sent a meat puppet to Keter, which throws into question what Cat's gonna do then. Succession doesn't mean much if the person you're deposing is still alive, at the end of the day.

I think it's a question of etiquette more than intelligence. Malicia desperately needs the Dead King involved in the crusade and might not be willing to risk giving offense by not appearing in person. Especially since she's already put plans in motion that require the Dead King's intervention. If he were to refuse her she'd be absolutely boned.
