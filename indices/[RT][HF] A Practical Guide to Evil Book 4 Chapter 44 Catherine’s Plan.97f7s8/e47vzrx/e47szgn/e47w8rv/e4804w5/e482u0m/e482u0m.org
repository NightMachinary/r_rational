  If Malicia were intelligent - and I have no reason to believe that she isn't - she'd have sent a meat puppet to Keter, which throws into question what Cat's gonna do then. Succession doesn't mean much if the person you're deposing is still alive, at the end of the day.

That still works out for Cat, somewhat. It's the lesser victory because she still has Malicia breathing down her neck (Malicia probably won't outright retaliate though because she also has her back pressed to the wall by crusade, so she needs Callow as a buffer), but it still removes Malicia from negotiations, making Cat's terms the only ones available for Dead King to take up on. And that was the main goal of this assassination plot to begin with.

Cat must've missed the memo on that one ;D
