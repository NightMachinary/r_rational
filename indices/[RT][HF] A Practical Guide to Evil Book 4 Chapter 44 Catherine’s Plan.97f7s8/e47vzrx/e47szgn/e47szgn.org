I swear to god, I haven't been continually blue ballsed this hard since I picked up Worm. Goddammit, EE.

Unless I'm missing something, Cat still has her 'invisible crossbow,' whatever that means. More likely than not, that's referring to Archer - though I wouldn't put it past Catherine to have a literal invisible crossbow slung across her back. We've also got Hakram and Viv (with a blade of stolen starlight) out there, doing who knows what. With the decoherence of the Threefold Reflection, I assume Hakram's job of finding his way to Malicia got all the more easier. Expect a last minute intervention by one or all three of them, when Cat inexplicably finds her back against the wall.

If Malicia were intelligent - and I have no reason to believe that she isn't - she'd have sent a meat puppet to Keter, which throws into question what Cat's gonna do then. Succession doesn't mean much if the person you're deposing is still alive, at the end of the day.

Speaking of, Akua seeks to become Catherine's Chancellor. In other news, water is wet and people die if they are killed. Judging from Cat's reaction to this 'revelation,' she doesn't have any way to deal with that Story if it were to become set in stone. I'm assuming that would have been (one of) Akua's endgame(s) here? Set herself up to be the dependable and loyal sixth ranger? Play to the narrative and become a sidekick? The Black to Cat's Malicia? I'm not exactly sure what'd stop Catherine from just shredding her soul if it ever got to that point, but I dearly hope she doesn't take that route. Diabolist is far too entertaining. Like a better, more plot-relevant Larat. (What would win? A spit-signed oath, or the power of the Story? One would argue they're one and the same, actually.)

I wonder what kind of powers Malicia could bring to bear against Catherine, if she was dumb enough to actually be present in Keter. She doesn't play a particularly combat oriented Role, but Names are Names, and treating them as anything less is a surefire way to get yourself killed. She has Speak as an explicit Aspect, no? "Catherine, dear, do me a favor and kill yourself?"
