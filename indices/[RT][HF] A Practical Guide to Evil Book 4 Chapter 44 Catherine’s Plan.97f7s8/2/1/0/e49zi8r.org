That sounds about right to me, depending on what you mean by exposure.

He seems in a way more content than almost anyone else in the story. It's probably more that he's just learned that big, bold, dramatic actions typically have the kind of unpredictable consequences that Cat has been struggling with in her rise to power. As a result, he prefers to win by slowly and inexorably building his power base, taking as few risks as possible.

I don't think he's trying to minimize his exposure in Creation, just that he only bothers to involve himself when he sees the opportunity to take advantage. He's got no skin in the game of the rise and fall of empires and isn't bothered by Calernia being ruled by either Good or Evil for a few centuries.

So, if by exposure you meant that he's just trying to make sure nothing in Creation spills over into his realm too much without a massive potential upside, then yeah that sounds about right. If you meant that he wants to simply have as little to do with Creation as possible regardless of his expectation of the outcome, then no, I don't think that's right. He was the one that reached out to Cat in the first place, IIRC.
