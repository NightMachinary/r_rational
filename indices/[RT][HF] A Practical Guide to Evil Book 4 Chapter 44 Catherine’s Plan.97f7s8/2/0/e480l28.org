It's kind of counter-intuitive but I think that the redemption story will be what forces Cat to become the Dread Empress.

Thinking about it, there's only really two Roles that kill a Dread Empress - claimants or heroes. If she does kill Malicia by stepping into a heroic Role she will be playing into the Grey Pilgrim's redemption trap that culminates in her death. The only other Role available to her would be to kill the Dread Empress as a claimant.

To be honest, I'm hoping she'll dodge both of these but she's not really considered how this debacle reflects on the narrative as a whole, so it's hard to say if she has a deeper plan or not.
