Oh right, I completely forgot that Malicia was just a means to an end - very good point there. Plus all this chicanery makes for a good spot of practice when it comes time for the real thing.

Though, imagining Cat strolling into the Dead King's palace, boisterous, loud and smiling wide, still covered in blood from last night's successful murder is hilarious to me.

"Neshie! Old buddy, old pal! Heard what happened to Malicia last night. Terrible, that. A real, /real/ tragedy. I can't believe the entire Threefold Reflection went up in flames; like, all three of them, all at once! Oh well, what can you do - life, sometimes, you know? Anyways, what do you say we get a head start on all this boring diplomatic nonsense? I've got some new terms I'm sure you'll find /very/ agreeable, this time around."
