This is probably just wishful thinking on my part, but I can't help but see this whole arc as the beginning of Catherine's redemption/transition to at least anti-hero rather than outright villain.

Sure, she's in Keter ostensibly to ally with one of the Bigger Bads, but she's now found out that he primarily just summoned her to there to recognize her as one of the true players in the game. Now she's marching into the stronghold of the Dread Empress, with the last of her allies having been left behind to convalesce from the exertion of carrying her to this threshold.

Seems like a pretty classically heroic story line, especially considering she spent some time immediately before embarking on this speaking with the ghost of a long-dead and righteous King, and has it looming over her head that she's transitioned out of the Name of Squire but not yet taken up a new, defined Name/Role. She's a nexus of power via the mantle of Winter, but that's clearly a power source very much in transition itself.

If I'm being cynical, EE will have Catherine crash through the Empress' guards, get properly fucked up in the doing of it, possibly evolving her powers in a minor way in doing so, then it'll just a flesh-clone of Malicia at the end. Malicia won't take it personally and Callow will remain in a heightened state of cold war with the Empire, leaving Catherine just enough breathing room to focus on Procer while knowing the Empire is probably going to be working to actively destabilize Callow as opposed to simply stymieing its attempts to grow more stable. All this while now having to deal with the Dead King being a more active player and the fallout of whatever Black does in Procer.

If I'm being optimistic, confronting Malicia will cause Catherine to crystallize her understanding of the difference in approaches between her and Malicia/Black. Ultimately, those two are just trying to play the game as well as possible by taking into account the meta-level knowledge that they are in a game with a semi-reactive Creation trying to guide things along certain paths. (Sort of like adding another player with a somewhat intelligible utility function, but not really attempting to modify the payoff matrix in any significant way).

Catherine is laser focused on the maximization of her own goals and is willing to play on the meta-meta-level that if the rules and players of the game don't permit such an outcome then those rules and players can be changed, /including/ the enforcers of the narrative. This isn't really conscious on her part yet, but I'm hoping continued conflict with Malicia will bring it into focus. I doubt that this will result in her taking another discrete Name or Role - that would be simply playing along with the game. The closest analogue I can think of is Ryoka in The Wandering Inn refusing to take Classes/Levels since doing so makes her dependent on the game system of that world.
