You can't expect characters in Worm to act truly rationally due to their outside influence. It's like saying you can write rational characters on LSD.

Unlike the LSD case, the shards have an agenda and they influence their hosts, who have their own agenda. You can extrapolate to their combined actions, to some degree.

I'd argue that the original work is a Rational fiction already. There's less arbitrary stupidity than there is in HPMOR (magical Britain in general outside of the main characters).
