I suspect that you can read Memorials prior to Worm, though you'll probably miss a few of the details. Give it a shot, you don't stand to lose anything 'sides a little time.

Memorials isn't quite as grimdark as Worm itself, but conflict and loss are some of the main themes. It depends on what you consider grimdark -- if you're put off by Worm's body horror, then Memorials has much less of that (Bonesaw doesn't make much of a appearance); but if you dislike the general theme of the Worm-verse then I doubt you'll like Memorials.

All that being said, Memorials doesn't have nearly the same defeatist attitude Worm does. Our main character is a hero, so there's more of a positive outlook on the world.
