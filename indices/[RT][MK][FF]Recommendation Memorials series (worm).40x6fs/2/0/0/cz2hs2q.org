Thanks for advise.

What I consider grimdark the most is a feeling of despair. Despair of seeng a new Endbringer form just after you defeat one. Despair of Tyranid hive fleet casting shadow on your world. Despair of being chained up for a crime you did not commit.

P.S. Body horrors are wonderful things actually)
