Given that the influence of shards over parahumans, is not widely known, it seems likely that the effect is minor. It accounts for a personality tone shift, not a massive alteration of everything you are.

Furthermore, the shards act towards creating the most conflict. Memorials does not remove conflict, rather the opposite. Even acting rationally does not remove conflict. If you're goals are in direct opposition to anothers, then the best course of action is conflict.
