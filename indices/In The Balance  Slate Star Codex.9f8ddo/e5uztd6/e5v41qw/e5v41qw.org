Additionally, supposing that one determined that the Artifact should be used at all, it seems likely that the demons are presenting a false dichotomy. All of this confusion about order, chaos, balance, excess, etc, seems intended to distract from the thought that perhaps the Artifact could be used along different axes of choice, rather than following demonic guidance. For one thing, it may be worth considering whether to get rid of all of the demons.
