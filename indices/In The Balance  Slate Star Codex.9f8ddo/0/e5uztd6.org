But wait! "What's that?" you will say. And there will appear a vision of ''̡'̸'͟'҉'̸'''''̶'̸''̸''''̡'͟''̕''͡'̧'''͢'̀', Archangel of the Domain of '͡''̵'̸'͡'̴'҉''̧'', who doesn't appear in a physical form at all, but whose voice resounds in your head with such a strength that it feels like it should still qualify as a vision. '̷''̨''͟'͡''͡'̧'͝'̴ will invite you to consider the possibility that an artifact that causes this many demons to suddenly appear with a bunch of conflicting advice is an artifact you shouldn't use at all. '̷''̨''͟'͡''͡'̧'͝'̴ will ask you to step away from the artifact and to reseal the chamber you came through on your way out.
