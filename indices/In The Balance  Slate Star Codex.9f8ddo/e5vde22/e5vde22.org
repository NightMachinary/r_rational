I'm firmly on team MLOXO7W. We are trying to straightforwardly maximize a third variable (let's call it "good") and we want "order" and "chaos" in the exact amount of "balance" that maximize it.

I am also on team PAHANUP.

PAHANUP suggest that there is a /correct/ level of meta here (not a /random/ level of meta like GOSAGUL says) and additionally, appears in a hole in space exactly three inches deep, suggesting that the third level of meta, MLOXO7W, is the correct one. (ZAMABAMAZ, IYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY, and MLOXO7W represent the first, second, and third level of meta)

  you refused to take more than about three minutes figuring out what to use it for, because that would have been annoying.

But, more pointedly, because IFNI told you that it could take an arbitrarily large amount of time to correctly calculate the number of meta levels, which is true, but misled our protagonist into assuming it would take an eternity... when in actual fact the arbitrarily large amount of time in this case happens to be "three minutes".

Of course, a-priori, there is no way you could have known it would take three minutes. It's easy to say "why not just spend three minutes on that" /in hindsight/, but the amount of time you choose to invest in trying to find a solution for a given amount of time is determined by the maximum value of the expected likelihood of finding it in a given time times the value of the solution minus the value of the time....and should you have calculated /that/ value before choosing to begin? And if so how long would /that/ take you?
