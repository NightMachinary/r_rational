So I did see that /but/ I didn't want to use it because...

the problem was that /by the logic of the story/, it seems to me that we /should/ have one unreasonable demon arguing for spending zero time thinking about which level of meta and picking at random, one unreasonable demon arguing for spending /forever/ calculating the level of meta, one reasonable demon suggesting that we spend the /balanced and correct/ amount of time determining how long we should spend calculating the level of meta, and /only then/ should MEGAHAHA have come in claiming that we should either spend no time, or infinite time.

Scott didn't write it that way. It bothered me that he didn't because it broke symmetry. IFNI and GOSAGUL should be combined into one, really. GOSAGUL doesn't even disagree with IFNI, just improves upon her methods.

Anyway, for the symmetry to work, <GOSAGUL+IFNI>, who represent /extremity/, should have suggested an /arbitrary/ level of meta rather than three in particular. Whereas MLOXO7W was arguing not for an arbitrary level, but for a specific level.
