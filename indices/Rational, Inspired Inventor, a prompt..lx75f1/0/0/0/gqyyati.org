it's your promt that's nebulous, you said it gives you a specific subset of knowledge and then immediately exceeded that ability with your example. Augmentation is extremely vague, complete understanding of cybernetics and how to create them and the ability to make complex medical grade machinery with garbage is far outside the scope of just having "a specific subset of knowledge". And apparently the ability can be used to get knowledge that humanity doesn't possess, because we don't know how to cure cancer.

Just saying, you gotta clean up your own mess before you start throwing around words like souffl√©.
