Nimona (the comic) looks fun. Shame it's only available by nautical means now. I got a real Bite Me! (If you haven't yet read that, go read it) vibe from the first chapter (primed of course by your context), but this was quickly replaced by more of a Japanese psychological horror crossed with Doctor Horrible vibe by the end of chapter 3.
