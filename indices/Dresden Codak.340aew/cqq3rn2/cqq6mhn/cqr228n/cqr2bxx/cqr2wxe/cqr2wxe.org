i do! As i briefly mentioned, the Hob storyline in general has this problem, but the Dark Science storyline less so. There are less "fanservice poses", and in addition, the plot of Dark Science very much has a focus on Kim's body, and how she relates to it (specifically the prosthetics). There are many shots of her body, but are generally constructed in such a way that any sexual nature would be secondary to the primary focus of the shot, such as here: [[http://dresdencodak.com/2010/07/26/dark-science-04/]] (the focus is on the emblem, as well as highlighting the artificial lines on her back). i think his tumblr even has a post saying things similar to what ive typed at some point, so he is aware.

A note to make though btw is that "2007" might seem like a long time ago, but Dresden Codak has a very slow update schedule; The ones we linked are only like 50 something strips ago, and Kim only has 2 storylines plus older vignettes (that suffer just as much from the sexualizing problems). So for any given reading, seeing 50% or more of the storylines being fetishy means its easy to think of the whole strip being that way.
