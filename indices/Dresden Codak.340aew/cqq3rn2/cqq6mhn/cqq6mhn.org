  It seems like a series of thinly related vignettes in only vaguely related settings, with reused characters and sparsely explored backstories and plots.

That's how it started out, but it's gradually moving towards longer story arcs. There's two of them so far: /Hob/ starts [[http://dresdencodak.com/2007/02/08/pom/][here]] and lasts for 27 pages, and /Dark Science/ starts [[http://dresdencodak.com/2010/06/03/dark-science-01/][here]] and is still ongoing. /Hob/ and /Dark Science/ are thematically very different, but they share a canon. The vignettes don't.

I'd never really thought about Kim as a fetish object. Her high intelligence, robotic skills, and tendency to philosophise, I can see that much should appeal to us nerds. It's the heroic mad scientist archetype, the same that HJPEV and Agatha Heterodyne are pulled from. Definitely nerd-appeal. But I assume you mean "fetish" in a non-sexual way, unless socially awkward amputees are considered attractive these days.

I don't want to sleep with her, I want to /be/ her.

Edit: Okay, okay, point made. I can see it now, there's a lot of fanservice around Kim, I just got overly defensive of a comic that I really like. Thank you all for correcting me.

Second edit: Regarding continuity, it seems I was wrong. [[http://dresdencodak.tumblr.com/post/4031311313/is-there-any-in-story-chronological-order-to][The author explains that all the strips "actually happened"]], but don't overthink it - Hob and Dark Science are self-contained stories, and neither requires any prior knowledge to fully appreciate.
