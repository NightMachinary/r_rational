I've followed this comic since the beginning. Never read anything outside the actual comics, so I have no idea what context it exists within or anything about the author/artist. It has had various quiet periods and odd update schedules (like I'm one to talk) and I kind of lost track of what was happening in it.

Capital S Sci-fi themes, but it seems like a series of thinly related vignettes in only vaguely related settings, with reused characters and sparsely explored backstories and plots. Almost like more of an art character study or experimental thing, especially compared to other high-quality, and contrariwise high-ish volume color webcomics like Girl Genius.

Like a lot of the art, but the main female character is tripping along the border of being a nerd fetish object in several different ways and particulars, which is a little /ehhh/. Not that I don't /like/ that sometimes, but it seems borderline gratuitous for a story-based comic, and combined with flimsy plot makes it seem exploitative without being brave enough to really own that. This is from someone who personally writes smut and liked Michael Poe's work (if that helps any old-schoolers, context-wise). Perhaps that's unfair, but it was my reaction at the time.

Feel free to correct anything I've gotten wrong here. It isn't something I've spent much time studying, and I get the feeling there might be more to it from side channels I simply haven't followed.
