He's an artist, who has to be good at drawing the human form. It's normal to practise your skills with character studies of your character in different poses and states of dress.

Would you be saying the same if he'd done a male character study?

EDIT: Actually he did publish some 'pinup' sketches of Kimiko. I think his explanation makes sense though:

  Inspired by a couple of amputee pinup photo shoots, I wanted to put together something similar with my own amputee character. This is obviously not the sort of thing that would be in the Dresden Codak comic (which is at most PG-13), but I found it a fun exercise. I hate it when people with prostheses or those who are otherwise “disabled” are portrayed as incomplete in some way. It's simply not true, and something I hope I successfully address with my work in general. People are much more than the sum of their parts.

  I originally posted these a month or so ago, but it accidentally got caught in a deletion craze I got in with the archives. I wanted to repost it because I didn't want to give the impression that I didn't stand by the work or something like that. In reality, I've gotten such nice thoughts and comments from various people, including amputees, and it would be a shame to not make the set available again.

Now you could read those and make excuses for why he's still the pervert you currently think he is, but for me the evidence is against that.
