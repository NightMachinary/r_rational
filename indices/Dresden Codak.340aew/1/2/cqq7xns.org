  the main female character is tripping along the border of being a nerd fetish object in several different ways and particulars, which is a little ehhh. Not that I don't like that sometimes, but it seems borderline gratuitous for a story-based comic, and combined with flimsy plot makes it seem exploitative without being brave enough to really own that.

I've been trying to sum up my thoughts on the matter for a while, but now I don't have to because you've done it better then I could.

It's kind of weird how he does that and occasionaly spouts the feminist party line, but I suppose that it makes sense when comic geeks are getting upset about Thor being female. Just wish he wouldn't conflate defending strong female characters with censoring comments critical of your ideology and all the other "ends justify the means" tactics that modern feminism seems to have made a part of their identity.
