Someone who is vocal about supporting empowering women might believe it, or might be doing it cynically for signaling value. His other behavior is not terribly consistent with him believing it, so it's more likely that he's doing it cynically. Signalling it cynically is possible regardless of his beliefs, but is more likely in worlds where he is self-aggrandizing and doesn't care about empowering women than in worlds where he just has no strong opinion.

Basically, if he believed it, I'd expect his comics (and particularly his publicly-shared non-comic art) to match his statements, and if he had no strong opinions, I'd expect him to less vigorous about paying lip service to it (something more like "Yes, empowering women is important, but sometimes it has to give way to the needs of the art"). Neither of those is what we see, so that's weak evidence toward 'Aaron Diaz is cynically using feminism for self-aggrandizement and doesn't care about it as a philosophy'.

I don't particularly care either way; if he /is/ using feminism for cynical self-aggrandizement, he's not anywhere close to being the most obnoxious or the most exploitative of the people who are (Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn, respectively, have him beat, off the top of my head), and I'm not going to object to titillating art of awesome women.
