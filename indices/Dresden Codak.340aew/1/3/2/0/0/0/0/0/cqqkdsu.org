Well in final defence of Kimiko's portrayal as 'sexy', then:

- Dresden Codak has interesting storylines with an interesting setting none of which rely themselves on Kimiko being sexy
- Kimiko is an interesting character in ways that aren't to do with being sexy
- Kimiko isn't comically, unrealistically sexy, like so many over-sexed female characters
- Isn't an interesting, intelligent female character /allowed/ to be at all sexy or to have onscreen relationships? Is being sexy permanently mutually exclusive with being anything else? I think this is what Aaron was going for when he deliberately sketched pinups of Kimiko without hiding her prosthetics.

Maybe I just didn't let myself see the 'pandering', but I feel that if I wouldn't complain about a fic with a good-looking straight male character who the author has sketched topless, then I shouldn't complain about such a female character just because I was concerned about some nerds getting their rocks off about it. If she was an obviously over-sexualised, paper-thin character then I'd be with you.
