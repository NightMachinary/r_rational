Oh, it's not free online anymore? That sucks... that really sucks.

Well I brought it up because it has an interesting female main character, but she isn't 'sexy' like possibly Kimiko might be considered to be (although I find myself wincing at the idea of rating a character's sexiness, as if there's only one interpretation of that). At least I don't think people would accuse Nimona's author of pandering to 'nerd fetishes' (if even /that's/ a fair category to propose!), at least not the sort you're talking about.

But maybe you could argue it's still doing it, just for a different sort of fetish? But you could say that about literally everything? So why are we doing this again?

Anyway, Nimona has a female lead who doesn't spend much (any?) time undressed, is never in any sort of romantic situation, and is short and plump and has shaved hair. ^{Therefore not sexy, right? :/} It also has two male characters who appear to hate each other but have this interesting relationship and were fairly probably once in a relationship, but their sexuality is not, I don't think, ever actually confirmed or made a big deal of.

All in all it does somewhat contrast with Dresden Codak.
