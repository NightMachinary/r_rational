It's interesting to read how everyone seems to have gotten this vibe from it. It's tempting to dismiss it - to write it off as some guys projecting their own insecurities unfairly on the writer of one of the few good stories out there with an interesting female protagonist - but I guess that would be unfair. Maybe there's something in it.

But I love Dresden Codak, and I enjoy reading the author's blog. He really does post quite a lot in support of more diverse and empowered depictions of women in popular culture.

Have any of you read Nimona? Does that feel different?
