Oh, I meant it in a /very/ sexual way. Fetishistic display of robotic limbs is a thing, as are robots themselves, mad science, steam punk-isms of lace and chrome, and even just awkward nerd-girl-isms (even /genuine/ ones with strong grounding and world building support). It is all about the presentation.

Don't get me wrong. Agatha is still presented as a innocent virgin sex-symbol, tight corset and bodice and hip-hugging skits and all, but it isn't the /primary/ selling point for the work. It's just more character exploration, and it helps in explaining why the cute boys go ga-ga over her while not hiding the pandering. She also doesn't get physically abused in loving slow-mo panels, or spend valuable time emotionally presenting to camera, which is something I get more than hints of in Dresden Codak.

But again. That isn't a bad thing, in and of itself. It's just that I wish it /owned/ that more, made it something front and center, instead of making me feel like it was bait or something sneaked in to trick readers into liking a work that's really about something else.
