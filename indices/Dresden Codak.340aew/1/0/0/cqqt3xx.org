  But I assume you mean "fetish" in a non-sexual way, unless socially awkward amputees are considered attractive these days.

Socially awkward is nerd catnip, if done in the right way. A girl that no one understands, who gets into social trouble because she's really enthusiastic about her areas of interest? There's a reason that the term "adorkable" was coined. A /properly/ awkward girl is approachable, tugs at the instinct towards protection, and gets points for defying stupid social norms. It's an endearing quality in a character. (In real life, socially awkward comes with a lot of downsides.)

Also, "amputee" in this context means "has wicked cool robot limbs", which is a definite plus in my book.

Edit: I don't think there's anything wrong with making a character that pushes a lot of people's buttons like that, for the record.
