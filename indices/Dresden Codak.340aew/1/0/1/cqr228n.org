it may be a bit overtalked, but i want to take a stab at the general "fetishized" point, because i thought it was always a mild weakness of Dresden Codak; though these days i dont think it happens very much, so perhaps its a past problem. There is nothing wrong with characters being sexy, having sex lives, or even striking sexual poses; but to be non "fetishy" that should come from the character's internal motivation. i think the linked "dating" strips are actually poor examples, because there Kim is actively thinking about romance, so would act in something approaching a romantic way. if in those strips she were to strike seductive poses, that would be fine, cause she /wants/ to be.

However, the Hob storyline also has strips like these: [[http://dresdencodak.com/2007/11/04/the-impasse/]] [[http://dresdencodak.com/2007/06/30/in-the-company-of-science/]]

Where we have random butt shots, and a logic defying semi nude welding/mechanic outfit. im pretty sure that Kim, the character, has no intention of being sexy at all, yet the "audience view" is presenting in such a way as to draw attention to her sexiness. So we are meant to think about her in a sexual/romantic manner in scenes where the focus should be on the words/plot/whatever. So its less about being a "cute nerdy girl" then the way the "camera" focuses on her cuteness/sexiness at awkward times, when the character herself is very much not trying to be that way.
