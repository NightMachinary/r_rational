[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35429993-fall-or-dodge-in-hell][Fall; or, Dodge in Hell]] by Neal Stephenson is upload fiction. I'm half way through and enjoying it so far. It has a definite mythological feel to it, with the new digital souls forging a new world and, due to fractured memories, not really understanding what they are doing. As a result, they tend to act like primordial creator gods.
