Destiny's Crucible. Definitely

Similar story to Release that Witch and A Heroes War, just without any magic. IMO written 10x better. About a chemical engineer that is displaced to a world with medieval tech.

Children of Time also comes to mind. Its about the bio engineered inhabitants of a terraformed planet where evolution is accelerated. Tbh I did not enjoy it as much as destiny's crucible, but still highly rated on goodreads.
