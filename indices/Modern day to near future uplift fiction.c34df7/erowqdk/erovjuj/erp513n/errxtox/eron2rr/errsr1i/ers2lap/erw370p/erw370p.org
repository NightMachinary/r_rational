I think you might really like the story I've been working on for the past two years, but sadly I haven't published it yet. It's a series of rational/scifi novellas called "Earthlings: People of the Dawn". It's about an alternate Earth very similar to our own in the near future, where authoritarian regimes are taking over everywhere and the threat of human extinction is drawing near.

I've already gotten most of the story written up through *Episode V: The Healer's Hand*, and I'm hoping to finish the series before the end of this year (not including the happy ending version of *Episode VI: the Ancestor's Legacy*, since that's the extended epilogue and is going to need a total revamp.) I'm pretty sure that *Episode I: the Ambassador's Voice* and *Episode II: the Seeker's Quest* are already totally done though.

Here's my planned inside cover blurb for *Episode I: the Ambassador's Voice*:

/“I notice that I am surprised. Reality has violated my expectations. That means something I believe about reality is false or incomplete.”/

/The Year is 2020 C.E. The advent of technologically-assisted public deception combined with mass surveillance and a sophisticated psychological operations arsenal has granted governments and corporations an unprecedented informational advantage over the public. Knowledge is power, and whoever possesses the most knowledge will control the world-- assuming that it doesn't get destroyed first./

/As authoritarianism spreads around the globe and the threat of human extinction draws near, one socially awkward musician must rise to the challenge and stand against the darkness. His name is Bertie Stern, and the secrets he bears could save the world.../

/Or destroy it./
