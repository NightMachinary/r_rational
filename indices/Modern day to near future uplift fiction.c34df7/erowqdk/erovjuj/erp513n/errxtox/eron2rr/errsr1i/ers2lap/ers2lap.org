bit of an odd one, but I feel like it fits the bill:\\

Its a sort of (dys-/u)topian near future fiction that explores various current societal problems, and how people are overcoming them. It is a bit crazy, but I found it a really fun read. NSFW, but the sexual content is more along the lines of "everyone is bored and has lots of weird sex to pass the time" than erotica.
