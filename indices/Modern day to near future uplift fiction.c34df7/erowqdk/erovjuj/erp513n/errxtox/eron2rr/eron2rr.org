The earliest example that I can think of is Poul Anderson's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Wave][Brain Wave]], which starts with everyone living on Earth suddenly becoming superintelligent.

The linked Wikipedia article says that it was "one of many science fiction works written at this time on the theme of heightened intelligence", which is true enough, but I can't think of any other contemporary novel-length book which explored the consequences of planet-wide superintelligence.

Note, however, that it doesn't "focus on the specific technology or magic involved".
