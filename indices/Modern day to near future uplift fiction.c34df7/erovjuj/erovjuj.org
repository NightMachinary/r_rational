[[https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html][Accelerando by Charles Stross]]. Follows several generations from from the near future as humanity masters upload and space technology. Some character drama, but it's more about hinting at the sort of things people have drama over in the future. To give one minor, spoilery example, dude and his girlfriend (both uploaded) swap genders to have sex, just to try it, and there's maybe 2 sentences of the dude feeling uncomfortable about it.
