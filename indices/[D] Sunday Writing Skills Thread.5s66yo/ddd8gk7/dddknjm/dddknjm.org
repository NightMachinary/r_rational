This is so true. My advice to GMs is to make the mystery so obvious you think you're treating them like children, and then make it still more obvious. They still won't get it.

Another thing I read somewhere long ago is that part of what makes a mystery movie enjoyable to the viewer is they get to feel smart / smug when they get the mystery before it's "revealed" to the audience - and ideally you want them to get it very close but still slightly before it's revealed (seriously, next time you watch a film with a twist and you twig onto the twist, notice how the reveal more likely than not happens almost immediately after you get it).

So if you make it so obvious that the player figures it out before they're "meant" to, they enjoy themselves because they get to feel very very clever.
