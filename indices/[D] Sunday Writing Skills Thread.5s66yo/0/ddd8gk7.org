[[https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/5riibl/how_to_drip_feed_information_before_your_big/][There was a thread]] on [[/r/writing]] the other day about how to drip feed info for the big mystery, and it got me thinking, namely that mysteries in stories can and sometimes should work exactly like mysteries in real life. Basically just pick a mystery and

  Then make absolutely no effort at all to conceal these facts. Absolutely do not leave false trails for the reader, besides any misdirection that antagonists may realistically employ to deceive protagonists. Don't try to obscure hints and clues that you think are too explicit. Don't worry about the reader figuring things out too early. Just let the facts cast whatever blatant huge shadows they want, so long as the story doesn't literally, explicitly blurt out the actual truth right there in the text.

Eli Yun Kowskoby frames this in the context of the [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/solvable-mysteries][illusion of transparency and how you're probably overestimating how likely the reader is to pick up on the clues.]] But there's another way of looking at this strategy, which is that this is how real mysteries work. And, if you're writing a character uncovering a mystery, then this is how the mystery should look to them. And, if the audience is meant to be immersed in that character's perspective, then this is how the mystery should look to the audience.

Take the mystery of a table. I don't know how the table I'm writing this on got made. This is the "important and plot-determining background facts that your viewpoint characters won't know and that the text is not going to state explicitly until the end of the story." No one's even trying to hide it, I just don't know and there's not an obvious way to immediately find the answer. But the consequences of the fact of how it was made are shown openly throughout the world in the logical manner of whatever those facts are. These facts create a breadcrumb trail that I can follow if I'm smart and determined - find out the company that sold the final product, call them about who they got it from, track down various people related to the unfolding supply lines and question them at knife-point until I can piece together how a table is made in a global economy.

I think a lot of writers probably think of a mystery as something that involves hiding information, which is kind of true since a mystery does require some missing information or a missing explanation for the information. But in real life, sometimes the greatest mysteries are the ones that are plainly happening all around us, like gravity, or other people having sex somehow. And when someone is hiding information, that's also a logical part of the mystery, like a murderer hiding the murder weapon, not because The Great DM In The Sky is trying to make things harder for us.

The problem of writing a mystery as things just being the way they are, only no one's entirely sure why or how, are a) you have to totally understand and think through the mystery and all its consequences, and b) you have to really get in your character's head and understand what they would do in response to the clues, which is rarely what is most convenient for the story. But that's kind of the point: if your mystery isn't something that's actually befuddling your character, then it's not really working, is it? If your only goal is to keep the reader guessing, that's one thing, but it won't be the same as being carried through a mystery within a character's perspective.
