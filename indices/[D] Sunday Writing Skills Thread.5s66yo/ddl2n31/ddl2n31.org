I don't know if this is the right place for this question, but here goes: how can I learn to write Slytherin (i.e. political & plotting) characters? I'm mostly Hufflepuff with a side of Gryffindor, I barely understand politics and I can't plot to save my life, so naturally I have a very hard time modelling these types of characters. It limits my creativity. Is there any hope for me?
