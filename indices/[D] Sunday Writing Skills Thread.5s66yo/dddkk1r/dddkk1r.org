How do you deal with characters speaking foreign languages in your stories? By the middle of my story, my viewpoint character speaks English and is decent enough at French, so when he makes a new friend they proceed to speak French to each other for the rest of the story. I introduce her as speaking French and mentions he replies to her in French. The fact they speak French to each other isn't important, it's just the logical conclusion of an English/French speaker and French/Italian speaker becoming friends. Should I just assume the reader will know that they speak French together? Should I not bother mentioning it because if the reader thinks they're speaking English it's not important? Should I scour their dialogue and replace words my English/French speaker may not know with simpler versions, and/or mention him not able to find the words?

(Yeah I know I'm overthinking this...)

Also, any advice on the bechdel test? My story is vampire yaoi so it has a male viewpoint character and the other major character is also male. I have a scene where I have some female characters together that I can expand a bit to give them some dialogue, but to be honest as much as I love the bechdel test I hate the idea of pandering to it. My go-to example of pandering to the bechdel test is [[http://www.discordcomics.com/comic/shades-of-a-091/][this page of a comic strip]] (this is an absolutely excellent comic though!) - the characters are talking about their dogs for one panel that was included purely for the bechdel test (the author states as much). The characters never come back, the dog never comes back, it's all just completely pointless. I'm worried about my "opportunity for bechdel" scene being similarly pointless, though when discussing it with my husband he said "what is actually happening in the scene though?" and I replied "well, the characters are bored. they've done this a hundred times, and it's become routine". So I suppose I can have the characters discussing whether they think it's going to be a long time until they're finished, maybe doing some gossip, etc. It would provide a lot of contrast to the main character's thoughts which are full of panic and nerves because he's never been involved in this particular ritual before.
