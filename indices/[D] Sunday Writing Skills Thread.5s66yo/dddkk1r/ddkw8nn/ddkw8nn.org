There have been a handful of books out there that have major dialog in two languages. My favorite incarnation had Chinese conversation being just normal English, while English conversation was italicized. So long as you only had two (or possibly three) languages and it was important to convey when different forms of communication are occurring, this is a fine way to portray that.
