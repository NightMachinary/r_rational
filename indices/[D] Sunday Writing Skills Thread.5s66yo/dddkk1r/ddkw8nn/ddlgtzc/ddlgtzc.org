Hmm, something like that might be good. Unfortunately, I have dialogue in English, French, and Italian (probably 90%, 8%, 2% or something).

That said, it isn't important to convey when different languages are being used - if everyone spoke in English all the time it would be exactly the same. So I might stick to mentioning it once or twice. I also changed some sentence construction in parts of dialogue that were in French (e.g. French doesn't really have the gerund, so I removed most gerunds that would not have an obvious French equivilent from the originally-French dialogue).
