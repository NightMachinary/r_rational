Thanks for the suggestion! My French is decent though it's only a happy accident that they ended up in a French speaking country. I will go through the dialog with a fine tooth comb in the next week or so and see if I can meddle with it a bit. One of the characters is a funny sort but in a kind of dry way, though, so I will have to take extra care to make sure she doesn't lose that.
