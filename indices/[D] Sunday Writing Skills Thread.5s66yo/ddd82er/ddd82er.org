Reposting a question I asked in Wednesday world building that is also a writing question...

Context is CYOAs (choose your own adventures) for [[/r/makeyourchoice]], but advice about these questions are probably also relevant for people working on tabletop RPGs, whether entirely original, homebrew, or simply a campaign.

  How do you strike a good balance between "flavor text"/"fluff" and mechanical descriptions of things "crunch"?

  How do you communicate info about the setting, balancing between players that are trying to get every little advantage out of the choices, vs. players looking for a detailed and imaginative setting vs. players that are just casually playing through and don't want to deal with too many choices.

  I am trying to work info about the setting into the choices and events and not just tell the players outright. For example, I have a pretty detailed magic system in mind, and I want to figure out how to give just enough detail that the players can work out/ imagine most of the results and implications of the magic system. Preferably enough so that most of the events in future episodes/missions will make sense. At minimum, enough so that the player's character and allies are neither underpowered or overpowered.
