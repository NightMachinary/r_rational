Not from my perspective.

I would trade my right arm for the ability to never have to sleep again, and never being tired in the sense of feeling like I have to sleep.

I doubt that I don't dream, but I have never been able to remember one, or even have a vague feeling of having been dreaming. I naturally find it more than a little difficult to fall asleep unless I'm exhausted, and once I do fall asleep, I wake up with no time having passed from my perspective.

Unfortunately, if I don't get 7+ hours of sleep, I feel like shit for the whole day.
