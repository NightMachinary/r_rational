Objecting to removing it (and sorry I'm in late).

[[/u/DaystarEid]] runs that sub, and had specifically asked for it to be featured on the sidebar. It addresses a form of irrational worldview and belief, and addresses it via informing people of how things really are. In particular, it addresses misconceptions that people visiting this sub (eg: people in the LW-o-sphere) are /actually more likely to have/ than randomly-selected redditors.
