Funny story. It was originally a sub dedicated to the abolition of sleep on the premise that the art we produce now is more thrilling than dreams -- instead, they said, we should spend that time making and consuming rational fiction. Sadly lack of sleep did a number on their heads, and their tired logic suggested that even bothering with art was useless because relationships provide a more primal pleasure. So between sleepless promiscuous nights they're now trying to perfect those through a Dr. Bronner-esque philosophy that we're held in a false entrapping Matrix, termed the Blue Pill, of political correctness and effeteness that dilutes the primality of our desires, but from which the only and equally wrong escape is the Red Pill, representing the domineering view that women are weak and worthless. In short, there is no escape. I repeat there is no escape. Neither pill is acceptable. All we can do is avoid sleep to see the horror with more clarity.

The sleep is behind me right now, isn't it?
