The last bit? couldn't it be anyone from lung to the illuminati to vampires a la twilight? all it mentions is that there is an eplioge, that the ultimate enemy- oh, that'd be slight spoilers- corrected, there, and that the eplioge is about a character that isn't the one in spoiler.

Is it sufficient now?
