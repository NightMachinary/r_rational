It stands for Less Wrong, which is a community that is really dedicated to rationalism. At one point a while back there was a post on their site that was assumed by some to be a memetic hazard (though it isn't really) called Roko's Basilisk, and a lot of people freaked out about it. That's what the subreddit they're discussing references. Some googling can tell you more if you're curious; I know Eliezer Yudkowsky talked about it in depth on the xkcd subreddit a while back.
