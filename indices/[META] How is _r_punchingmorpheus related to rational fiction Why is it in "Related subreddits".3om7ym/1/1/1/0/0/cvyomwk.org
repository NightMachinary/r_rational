I think memetic hazards as rather silly, and the idea of a past-venging future AI entity as self-contradictory unless it was aself-made problem (the only reason a rational AI that decides to take revenge on those who didn't contribute to its creation would be created is if the people who created it designed it in a way to take revenge on people who aren't of their group).
