It's worth noting that:

- Jake's parents and aunts and uncles are dead
- Cassie is dead
- Jake just watched Marco die three times and then stayed up for 24h straight

My intention was to show that he's teetering on the edge of "going too far" and that he's falling toward a literal "live free or die" attractor.
