I'd recommend maybe listening to the Andalite Chronicles episode or something like that to get a feel for how Megan and Carey talk about the books. I think they also have a guest for the second half of that episode, which is something they do with a few of the books, especially the Chronicles, but not all of them.

Good to get an idea of whether or not you like their style.
