It wasn't the most obvious thing because of Garret's habit of using ALL CAPS for people's NAMES, and FONTS ARE WEIRD. But it was noticeable, especially next to MARC1.

Don't know how he'll adjust if/when they pick up more Marcos, though. Sure, MARC2, MARC3, etc, but there won't bee that differentiating factor of VISSER ONE (QUARTER) between them anymore. He'll have to find another point of difference, I guess.

Speaking of, I was a little confused as to how the other three Marcos are "listening in"? I assume it's something to do with Visser One being split among them, but has she developed a way to communicate with herself over long distances that I missed?
