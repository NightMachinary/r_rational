This isn't exactly related to this fic, or Animorphs, but it's kinda interesting that the "planet-destroying superweapon" is a thing that keeps cropping up in Star Wars, but TLJ opened a window into "who needs a superweapon when you have hyperspace-capable ships"; which was conveniently ignored (like so much of TLJ, I guess) in favour of a fleet of planet-destroying superweapons.
