This is more headcanon than word-of-god, but my current state of beliefs here is that the Arn successfully and accurately ported-over "Esplin on top of Alloran" into a new biology, but that since there literally is no more Yeerk anymore, you can't ever undo the joining.

Like if you photocopied two post-it notes side by side. The new sheet is its own thing, even if it preserves 100% of the information of the originals.

What this means is that Visser (unlike Esplin/Alloran) is now going to /continue/ to grow and change in a fashion much more like a human mind (two lobes at war with each other) rather than like a normal Controller pair.
