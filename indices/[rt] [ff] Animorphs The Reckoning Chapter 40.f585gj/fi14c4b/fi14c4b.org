I feel like I am darting back a bit plotwise but I am very curious whether Alloran still even exists as a mind or whether, between his attempt to unthink himself and whatever the Arn did to rig up Alloresplin's new body rendered a totally new mind which thinks of itself as Esplin on top of Alloran but is really just some new thing. The Arn merger might have messed up Visser 3's plans for his own mind more than he knows. Jake's apparent misreading of what the Visser is likely to want is making me wonder more and more about this, not that it wasn't a baffling thing to wonder about from the get-go.
