  (This fic leaves a /lot/ unsaid, sometimes too much, I think. I wonder how well I would comprehend it if I wasn't participating in reddit discussions every chapter.)

I'm with you here. As much as I love this fic, it's /extremely/ mentally demanding. I don't follow the Reddit discussions, and I have to pause a lot of times during chapters just to decode stuff. Occasionally I just fail, and I move on without understand some morsel of story. It doesn't make it any easier that the gaps between updates are fairly wide, and the chapters themselves have so much going on (just in terms of length but also in terms of how many threads they're juggling) it's hard to keep track of it all anyway.

On one of the Reddit threads I /did/ read a while back, the author said something about leaving more and more things up to the reader to figure out based on what's logical. There's a cynical side of me trying to point out that, in any other medium, that would be called having plot holes.

Overall though, I don't think I've ever missed anything important. I think the stuff that counts is in there, and if something isn't obvious when it's first "revealed", it's at least usually comprehensible after reading some more.
