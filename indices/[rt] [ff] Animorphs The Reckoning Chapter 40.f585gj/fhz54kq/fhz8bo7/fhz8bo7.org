The Visser mentions Alloran's voice disappearing around the time they discovered the z-space bridge. My interpretation is that Alloran predicted this very thing and spent a long time, quiet, sublty incepting the "Earth is important" idea.

Now that the two personalities are fully integrated, that idea persists and makes sense to the Visser in a way that he can't deny it, and isn't sure that it was Alloran who put the thought there.

Jake doesn't know any of this, of course, but he's figured out that the Visser really should have cut his losses and blown this popsicle stand by now. Especially after Telor's betrayal. But he hasn't, which means he wants Earth specifically for reasons unknown, hence Jake's half-a-plan.
