Jake, now:

#+begin_quote
  “/He shouldn't still be here/. He's got no business being here. It's like---it's like---look, no matter /how/ valuable the Earth is, compared to the rest of the galaxy, he doesn't /need/ it to win. He's been running circles around everybody for two years straight, and then he gets here and suddenly all kinds of headaches start popping up. He should've just blown us up and left. But he didn't.”
#+end_quote

From the most recent Visser passage:

#+begin_quote
  /Without the Earth, completing the conquest of the rest of the galaxy will take five times as long, and be twice as likely---or more---to fail./

  He was suspicious of the thought---for being too reassuring, too convenient, for making him /feel better/ when he still did not understand the cause of his disquiet. But even in his suspicion, he /could not stop himself from believing it/. It simply seemed /true/.
#+end_quote

So...what exactly is going on here? The main two options I see are that either Jake is making an error because he knows very little about the wider war, or else this is the result of Alloran managing to mess with the Visser. The first is pretty reasonable, if narratively disappointing. The second...how would Alloran even /do/ that? Inflated the importance the Visser sees Earth to have without any conscious memory of doing so?

So yeah I'm confused. Hopefully this was the intended effect!
