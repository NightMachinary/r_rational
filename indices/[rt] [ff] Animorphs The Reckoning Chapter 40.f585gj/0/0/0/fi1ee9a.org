I just finished reading through the whole series, this was my first chapter I had to wait on. So sorry if you have answered this in the past - where did the idea for the Garrett character come from? Was that based on some aspect of the original lore that I forgot? Or if not what led you to throw in a non-canon core team member, and one with such an unusual perspective at that?
