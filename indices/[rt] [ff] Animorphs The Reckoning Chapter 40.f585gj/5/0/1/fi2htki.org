  Although it's also worth noting that that version of Garrett is gone, and while I didn't intend this as an author while writing, one /could/ make a neat argument about something like "ah, this Garrett is ending up in a slightly different mental space from the previous iteration."

I think Garrett would rediscover that conclusion from being autistic (he'd rigidly apply the same reasoning rules instead of "feeling" where personal identity lies the way a neurotypical person would), but I can't claim to be sure.
