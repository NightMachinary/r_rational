Unrelated to the overall story, but

  /“Any time somebody tries to tell me the rules I should remember that they're just guessing, or saying what they wish the rules were, or what they think the rules are but they might be wrong and there aren't any real rules [...]”/

  ...the problem wasn't that people were breaking the RULES, it was that I had been wrong about what the RULES really were, even if most of the time it wasn't my fault because they'd /told/ me wrong.

I /really/ like this lesson. There are no rules, but conversely, everyone has their own rules and you can't really know what they are (the more you know someone, the better you can guess...)

I'm trying to figure out how to internalize this myself and pass this lesson along to my 3yo daughter...
