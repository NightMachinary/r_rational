  HELIUM'S eyes swiveled so that one was pointing at each of them.

  ‹Shorm,› he whispered.

  “What does that mean?”

  ‹It doesn't matter.›
#+end_quote

I struggled to parse this a little. He was looking at Marc0 and Jake, right?

Also, I was a bit thrown off by the usage of "Shorm". It didn't make sense for Helium to indicate friendship to either Marc0 or Jake at that moment. But then I remembered it meant someone you would trust to have a tail blade at your throat, which really is not the same thing as friendship at all.

I guess that's how they (Helium) feel right now. They'll have a tail blade at the throat of the planet - at the throat their very principals. And at that moment, they decide to trust Jake with that blade.

I love the way this whole series takes things, /does not/ change them, but reinterprets them slightly to mean something different. It's great.

  “You're talking about---are you talking about the fucking /Last Jedi?”/ MARC1 sputtered.

It only just occurred to me that /Last Jedi/ came out /after/ the chapters where the Andalites threatened to throw a rock at the Earth. But because this is set in the future, you can retroactively reference it - nice!
