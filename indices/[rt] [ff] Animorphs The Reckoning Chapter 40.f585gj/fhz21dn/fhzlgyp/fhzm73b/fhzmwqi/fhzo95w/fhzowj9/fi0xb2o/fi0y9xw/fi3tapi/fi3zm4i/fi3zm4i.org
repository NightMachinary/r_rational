It's because Rachel's mind is /actually/ disorganized in there. I haven't shown this on screen yet, but Garrett and Ante tried morphing her, and they couldn't really reliably access her memories, couldn't really reliably communicate with the simulated Rachel. She's currently in something like a persistent drunken/drugged/mildly psychotic state, unable to really focus and unable to really think.
