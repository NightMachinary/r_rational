That makes so much more sense!

I was trying to imagine some complicated scheme involving the Marclones acquiring multiple layers of morph armor of each other, so they all have each other's control/interface tissue, but because the mind connected to each layer is exactly the same as the one in the physical brain, the interference is somehow coherent enough that V1/4 can make sense of it and figure out what the others are thinking.

*Edit:* Would it be possible for Marc1's Edriss shard to split in half again, and have V1/8 go into Rachel's head to relay her thoughts to the group?
