There isn't enough GARRETT in these ANIMORPHS! I say we need /two/ GARRETTS! No, /fifty/ GARRETTS!

I like how Garrett counts from 0. That is the correct number to count from. Also how he uses text-based puns in his internal monologue.

I can't help but wonder if they're actually willing to go through with it. It's one thing to know that if you're not willing to go through with it conditional on negotiations failing, you have no bargaining power. It's another for negotiations to fail, and to go through with it. I predict that some people would think in advance that they could do it, but when it came down to it wouldn't be able to. Even given that that doesn't mean the Earth is safe, it means V3 gets the Earth. And I expect V3 with a Leeran would be able to detect those people.

Maybe Jake can as well, if he morphs them and thinks to ask the question?

(There's none of them that I specifically expect not to be able to go through with it, but the question is worth asking in general.)

Given the stakes, I'm a little surprised that Jake is willing to bring Ante along based on Rachel's say-so. Obviously morphing him (and depending on timeframe, maybe Rachel) makes it less surprising. But I also feel like that /Right/ at the end was hinting at something that hasn't been revealed yet?
