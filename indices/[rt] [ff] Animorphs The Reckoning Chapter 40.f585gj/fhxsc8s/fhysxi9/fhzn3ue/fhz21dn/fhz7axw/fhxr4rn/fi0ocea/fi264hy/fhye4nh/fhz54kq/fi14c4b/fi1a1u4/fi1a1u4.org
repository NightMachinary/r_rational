Oh boy, looks like Jake is making a huge mistake. V3 was already almost going to kill the earth - threatening it with destruction might just cause him to abandon it and let it be destroyed. Even after Garrett points this out, Jake doesn't address that underlying problem. He is just hoping he will think of something during negotiations. Anything they offer V3 either gets them killed instantly or in five years (seemingly; we will see perhaps). Hopefully Tobias can find them before then, so at least they will have a better bargaining position.

Other notes: Garrett is very interesting to read. Also, It was not clear to me whether they actually acquired each other at the end of this chapter - the way it was written, it sounded like everyone just ignored Garrett there at the end. (This fic leaves a /lot/ unsaid, sometimes too much, I think. I wonder how well I would comprehend it if I wasn't participating in reddit discussions every chapter.)
