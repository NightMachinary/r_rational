As seems to be the popular opinion, I'm always extra tickled by Garrett chapters, and his whole fibonacci sequence thing was particularly great. As is just all of his observations about others.

Also, I love Jake's idea, and extra love that it was pointed out that you need to actually be prepared to /bargain/ with your enemy in situations like this. It's far too common in fiction where people figure out a MAD-type threat and then the enemy just withdraws entirely, which sure, can happen if you find something they care about too, but most antagonists are more willing to engage in negative-sum trades than most protagonists, unless they're in unusually gritty fiction.

Ha! I do this all the time when a kid is tantrumming or seems to be ignoring me for too long. Not the cursing part, but like "Sooo is some part of you in there, or not right now? Blink twice if you want me to stay, three times if you want me to go away."
