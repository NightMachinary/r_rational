He's absolutely on board with identity being equivalent across copies. This is a different, smaller sub-problem of /labeling./

I meant to make it clear that those are two separate things in his head. He's very on-board-with all of the MARCOS being MARCO he just wants to know how to distinguish them in a practical sense.

EDIT: Although it's also worth noting that that version of Garrett is gone, and while I didn't intend this as an author while writing, one /could/ make a neat argument about something like "ah, this Garrett is ending up in a slightly different mental space from the previous iteration."
