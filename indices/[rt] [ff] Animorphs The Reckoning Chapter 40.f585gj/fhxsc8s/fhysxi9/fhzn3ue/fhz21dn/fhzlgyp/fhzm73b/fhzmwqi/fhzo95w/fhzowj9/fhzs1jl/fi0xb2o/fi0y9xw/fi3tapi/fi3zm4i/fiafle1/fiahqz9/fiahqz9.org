I was about to say that's completely nuts because imagining a healthy brain is totally different from imagining a healthy arm--how would you even know what healthy brain structures look like at the neuron level to imagine it?

But then the answer is obvious: Perd√£o and V1/4 can both see and feel exactly what healthy neurons look like. How detailed does the mental imagine have to be, I wonder?
