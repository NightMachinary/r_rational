Very interesting, thanks a lot!

Yeah Garrett definitely fits well with the general exploration of neurodiversity. The original Animorphs did a good job of exploring what it was like to be various animals, but from what I remember didn't really delve into the psychology of its alien species in the same way - they were all pretty much just humans, maybe with some minor differences like Hork Bajir being dumb, Taxxons being hungry, and Andalites having random savant-like abilities. You by contrast have done some very cool work with Yeerk and Andalite psychology in particular, which along with Garrett opens up the mental aspect of morphing in a fascinating way.

Looking forward to the next chapter!
