So, there wasn't any one moment of inspiration, or anything like that. The thought process went something like:

- Tobias isn't going to be able to turn into a hawk, because of the changes I made to "rationalize" morphing tech.
- He's going to need something else to be his "thing" ... his character arc will be different.
- Oh, also, it's kind of weird that none of the Animorphs really had any outside connections, isn't it? Like, Melissa being Rachel's friend was kind of a big deal in canon for the first couple of books, but outside of that none of them seemed to have any other friends.
- Maybe Tobias is the one who has an outside friend.
- Oh, maybe Tobias's outside friend is another orphan.
- Oh, maybe it's an orphan that Tobias sort of looks after.

From there, I was sort of groping around for what their relationship ought to be like, and I sort of settled on "someone who contrasts strongly with Tobias's wariness and street-smarts; someone who at least at first blush is more open and trusting and maybe naive."

That led to a vision of, like, what their past history would have been like, with them having a mutual promise to get each other out of Oak Landing if possible and /that/ led to the idea of the blood brothers thing and /that/ led me to wonder what had gotten Tobias to pay attention to this kid in the first place and /that/ led me to "maybe he's weird." Like, maybe he's the kind of kid that /I/ would've ended up paying attention to and trying to protect?

And from "maybe he's weird" I just sort of ... cranked up several of my own weirdnesses by about 2-5x, and once I noticed that those weirdnesses clustered around the autism spectrum at least a little, I remembered THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT TIME and from there Garrett emerged.

He doesn't have much to do with the original lore, except insofar as, for its time, Animorphs was wildly diverse and accepting (interracial and interspecies couples, implied gay couples, direct look at divorce and remarriage, obviously the whole transformation thing) and so it felt pretty natural to lean a little bit into neurodiverse archetypes, especially since I knew I was going to be inside a lot of alien heads, too. Like, it felt right for "grown-up Animorphs" to have a Garrett, like if Animorphs had kept going or had been written in this decade it would obviously have a Garrett /somewhere./
