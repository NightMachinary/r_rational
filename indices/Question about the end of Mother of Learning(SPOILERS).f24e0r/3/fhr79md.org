I have wondered, a little, if Zach was the champion of the angels while Zorian was the champion of the gods. We see a lot of reasoning from Zorian, at the beginning of the loop, about how unlikely it was that someone with Zach's advantages would just so happen to become ensnared in the time loop - so, Zorian reasons, Zach must have been placed there on purpose. But Zorian's own advantages are tremendous. He's incredibly driven (to make the most of his time), a natural mind mage (to find information as quickly as possible and engage in asymmetric combat), and just so happens to have a personal connection to an archaeological adventure a continent away that was critical to his success. Within universe, the gods are supposedly withdrawn from the land, and I'm sure that's mostly true. But it's tempting to wonder if Zorian is secretly some kind of cosmic champion, making the most out of whatever very small degree of direct divine influence remains. The initial improbability of the soul-merge is difficult to explain without this, except by recourse to the anthropic principle.
