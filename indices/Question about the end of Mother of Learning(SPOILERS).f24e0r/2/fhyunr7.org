I'll actually quibble. I don't believe the Ibasans ever intended to invade the continent. The goal was to injure Eldemar badly so they ended up losing the coming war. They wanted the coming war for the continent to leave the continent weakened and someone less hostile to the Ibasans in charge. I believe Quatach-Ichl said something to that effect.

This next is just my theory, but I suspect Zach was always supposed to die. I think the angels figured Quatach-Ichl would always figure out what happened. Zach's death left fewer traces of the angel's meddling. I suspect a particularly na√Øve and idealistic kid was selected specifically because he wouldn't look at the terms too closely. Otherwise Zach just didn't make sense...why not choose an adult with proven abilities like Alaric or Xvim? Negotiating a contract with a sleeping minor who had no adult parental figures he trusted suggests they didn't think the deal would hold up to scrutiny. Zach himself suspected he would never survive the Time Loop. That was why he took girlfriends in the Time Loop and tried to tell people about it...because he was lonely thought he had to get all his living done before the Loop ended. This of course was where things went off the rails, because Jornack wasn't content to be snuffed out.

As far as why the Angels didn't intervene more directly...I will add there were some indications that if the Ibasan plan was thwarted too early the Ibasans adjusted. That happened in the loop. And there was the threat of the Wraith Bombs.
