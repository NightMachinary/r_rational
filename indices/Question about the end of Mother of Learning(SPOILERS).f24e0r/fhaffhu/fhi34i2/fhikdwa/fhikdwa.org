I think it did actually happen. There's a couple relevant passages regarding angels and the mechanics of summoning on [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2020/01/22/collected-snippets-angels-demons-spirits/][the latest worldbuilding article]]: specifically, the second paragraph under the "Angels, Demons, Spirits" header establishes that angels and demons are fundamentally the same thing (spirits) and that the differences are primarily cultural. This is relevant here, because later in the same article, there's this passage:

#+begin_quote
  Yes, demonic possession is a thing. But more than that -- once a demon is summoned into the material plane, it doesn't go back to the spiritual realms until its current vessel is destroyed. A demon in a ectoplasmic shell or a puppet can stay and cause chaos as long as they wish, they just need to find enough mana to power their vessel and avoid anyone powerful enough to banish them back to their home plane.
#+end_quote

This seems to imply that angels can stick around as long as they have a good enough source of mana to maintain their ectoplasmic forms. This is consistent with the other ectoplasmic constructs that appear in the MoL universe, whether it's the simulacrum spell or something [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2017/03/28/two-new-maps/#comment-1704][more mundane]].

Now, as to where exactly they're getting this mana from, that's another question entirely, because it's not really entirely clear in either angel summoning. In the first summoning in the church, perhaps the angel's form was maintained by Kylae and the other priests in the summoning rituals, or perhaps the angel was maintaining its form itself, and just couldn't sustain the cost for very long- especially given that it was also holding Zach and Zorian in a private space at the time.

In contrast, during the final battle the maintenance costs do not seem to be as much of a concern. Personally I figure what was going on here is that they were being maintained off of the ambient mana from the hole by the angel cube that Zorian used to summon them in the first place- it did, after all, channel all the ambient mana needed to summon them. And if that's the case, they could pretty much stick around indefinitely.

But regardless of where exactly the mana came from, I think it's pretty clear that it's not coming from Zorian or any of his human allies- after all, if the cost of a handful of non-golem-based simulacrums are able to put Zorian at a net loss, I can't imagine what the maintenance costs of a titanic high ranking angel would be like. And if they aren't coming from Zorian or one of his allies, they're coming from /some/ arbitrarily large source, which means the angels can probably stick around for pretty long.
