Yeah, that's not directly answered, but my guess would be that they just attacked Quatach-Ichl during the invasion, knocked his crown off and ran away with it or forced QI to teleport out, and then quickly applied the marker to as many people as possible before QI could take it back. A big part of the problem with fighting Quatach-Ichl is his mobility- Zach said as much in Chapter 97:

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't have the huge variety of spells that Quatach-Ichl does, his body is too large to teleport around easily, and if you kill his body, he will actually die. The old bag of bones is still the toughest opponent I ever faced.

And it's also pretty obvious from a reading of Chapter 60. They manage to force Quatach-Ichl to retreat relatively easily, but a proper victory where he's unable to drop in and attempt to kill them soon after is far out of reach. We also know Zach is capable of relieving the lich of his crown in combat even before working with Zorian, from Chapter 26:

  Zach actually managed to blow his shiny armor to bits with some kind of black bolts and even knocked the thing's crown off its skull, but nothing ever made a mark on the bones.

Such a strategy is unreliable. It's also entirely unsuited for Zach and Zorian's purposes later in the story, for two reasons: first, they need to have the crown a fair bit before the invasion, as they need to connect the Key to the Gate to use it, and the time magic facility the Gate is in is well secured and presumably won't let two "government inspectors" waltz in and play with the big divine artifact while the city is being invaded. Second, they wanted to pull a small army of temporary loopers in, rather than just a handful of Zach's buddies- they'd have to stave off Quatach-Ichl for a lot longer in order to apply the temporary markers. Then, if they couldn't get to someone in time, they'd have to mark them next iteration while still being beholden to the six-month deadline of the initial loopers, which would be devastating considering they really only have one shot at it. And they knew they'd probably need to get enough practice fighting QI to win a real victory anyways, so there's not much point in pulling temporary loopers via a hail mary-esque gambit like that.

But Jornak's group had none of these problems, and contained several powerful mages. They also had nothing to lose if the effort failed, and were pretty desperate. So I think they just went for it and got a little bit lucky.
