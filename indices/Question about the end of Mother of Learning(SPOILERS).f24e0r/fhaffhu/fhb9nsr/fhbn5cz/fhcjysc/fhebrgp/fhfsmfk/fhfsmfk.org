Maybe. But it would've been a huge obstacle overcome, and I somewhat doubt Zach never thought of enlisting the help of other people/preparing Cyorian defenders covertly so Cyoria could defeat the invaders in the final battle.

Even if he would never have been as successful as Zorian in investigating the cultists and Ibasans, surely he would've experimented to see what made them easier to beat during the invasion itself?
