Would you mind clarifying something for me as well? I'm slightly confused about the Imperial Crown and Orb. I honestly can't tell if they tricked Oganj. My first thought is that they did, based solely on the wording of "24 hours", because the angel would be long gone by than, but at the same time angel's can't lie, and there's no mention of Oganj coming for revenge. So I think that transaction actually happened (somehow)?
