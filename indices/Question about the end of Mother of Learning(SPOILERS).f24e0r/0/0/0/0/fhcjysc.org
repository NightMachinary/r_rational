My personal theory was that at some point, Zach was actually able to take QI on himself and win. The reason being that it's highly unlikely that he'd be able to know about the temporary-looper creation aspect of the crown unless he actually managed to take it to the Guardian of the Threshold himself in one of the previous loops (or experimented with it for a while).

This does bring into question why Zach didn't just leave the loop at that point, though. So I could be way off.
