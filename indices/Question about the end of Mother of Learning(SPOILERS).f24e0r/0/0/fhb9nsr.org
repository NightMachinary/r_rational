Thanks for the answers and citing sources. I just finished a fresh read so I can confirm also that everything you said is accurate but I would have been too lazy to cite chapters.

I had a similar question to OP that I'm relatively certain isn't answered: How did Zach make temporary loopers in the first place? Only the Crown can do that and I have no idea how Zach got it without Zorian's help the first time.
