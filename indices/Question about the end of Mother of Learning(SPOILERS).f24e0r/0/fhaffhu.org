1) That's directly addressed: in Chapter 96

#+begin_quote
  “We went through a great deal of effort to mask our involvement,” the angel said. “Our current interference... is already overstepping certain boundaries that we would rather not cross. It would have been best for everyone if nobody had realized our involvement.”
#+end_quote

and then later in the same chapter:

#+begin_quote
  “Why not just inform the Triumvirate Church and let them handle it?” Zorian asked.

  “Strange as this may sound to you, that would have been far worse than what we ended up doing,” the angel responded. “We are not supposed to meddle in mortal conflicts.”
#+end_quote

Basically, the angels abide by restrictions set by the gods before the silence, and generally they have to try to avoid messing with mortals too much.

2) The key isn't actually necessary to enter the time loop, I don't think. From Chapter 55:

#+begin_quote
  “The Controller is marked by the Key, by the Maker, or by its agents,” the Guardian said.
#+end_quote

So Zach was almost certainly given the controller marker by the angels and then that was what allowed him to enter the Gate. As for the second part of the question, it sounds like the Gate was activated by the angels instead of Zach himself, and the Gate is simply capable of drawing in the Controller's soul (identified by the marker) regardless of distance. Because Zach was asleep in his home when the Gate was activated, that's where he started the loop.

3) From Chapter 105:

#+begin_quote
  Panaxeth was the one who supplied him with a method of transforming his temporary marker into a permanent one, but never in a million years would have Jornak been able to actually use the method himself. No, he had to beg Quatach-Ichl for assistance to help him perform the task.

  However, that didn't mean he was willing to help Jornak without any assurances. He forced Jornak to accept something called a 'soul seed' -- a small fragment of Quatach-Ichl's soul, somehow processed to prevent degradation and imbued with some measure of self-awareness and memory -- and bound said soul fragment to Jornak's soul, with instructions to return to the original Quatach-Ichl when Jornak successfully came back to the real world.
#+end_quote

So that was how he convinced Quatach-Ichl, besides the obvious "I'll make sure your invasion succeeds" spiel. And it's likely Quatach-Ichl, with Panaxeth's instructions, used his methods of manipulating divine energies to modify the marker- it's discussed in Chapter 87:

#+begin_quote
  I suspect divine energies are involved with the marker somehow, and that the reason Red Robe had been able to jailbreak it is because he had Quatach-Ichl's help. His method of perceiving and possibly modifying divine energies may have allowed him to tamper with the marker in ways that are impossible to us... in which case our efforts to understand and modify the marker are doomed to fail right from the very start.
#+end_quote

and Chapter 89:

#+begin_quote
  They found out that, yes, the markers really did contain components made out of divine energies... and they also found a way to deal with that. Through several ruinously expensive deals with Quatach-Ichl and innumerable destroyed divine artifacts, they managed to create methods to detect and crudely manipulate strands of divine energy inside their markers.
#+end_quote

So the procedure came from Panaxeth and Quatach-Ichl just had the skills to follow it.

4) He couldn't. Soulkilling a Controller is undefined behaviour for the time loop, and I doubt it would work given how many safeguards there are in place for the Controller's safety. Likewise, the contingencies also made mindraping Zach sufficiently difficult, via Chapter 63:

#+begin_quote
  This information helped answer a few questions that Zorian had been wondering about for quite some time. Such as why Red Robe had done such relatively minor damage to Zach's memories -- he probably couldn't have done more than he did. In fact, the real surprise was that he had managed to do as much as he had without triggering the restart. If Zorian was reading his own defective marker correctly, the contingency in question was quite trigger happy -- whoever made it was a big believer in the ‘better safe than sorry' school of philosophy when it came to the safety of the Controller. Red Robe must have spent multiple restarts figuring out a way to get past it to the extent that he did.
#+end_quote

On top of that, I don't imagine Jornak really saw him as that much of a threat after he managed to wipe his memories. After all, if Zorian hadn't showed up, the chances of Zach managing to stop the invasion and make it out of the loop were almost nonexistent. And Zorian only got into the loop via an insanely lucky roll of the dice.

5) It's for much the same reasons that Zorian had to break out of the loop- regardless of whether or not they've tricked the Guardian into recognising them as Controllers, their bodies would already have souls in them when they tried to leave the loop, and the the Guardian would almost certainly notice something was wrong at that point. From Chapter 55:

#+begin_quote
  “So the Controller has their original soul drawn into the time loop when it is first made,” Zorian said. “They aren't a copy, so there is no problem with them leaving. But everyone else would have to kill someone to get out, and that's unacceptable. Is that correct?”

  “Yes,” the Guardian agreed.

  “But you could do that?” Zach suddenly spoke up. “If one of the copies wanted to leave this place, you could switch their soul with that of the original?”

  “Theoretically,” the Guardian admitted, “but that goes against what I was made to do. I am the Guardian of the Threshold. One of the main tasks the Maker gave me was to ensure things inside the time loop could not menace the source of the template. If a diverged copy tried to kill the original by switching their souls with it, I would do my best to stop them.”
#+end_quote

6) That's a plot point purposely left open, I think. Perhaps the angels never intended to kill Zach after all, or perhaps the situation changed and their angelic restrictions wouldn't allow them to interfere more. My personal theory was it was intended as a temporary measure- it stops Zach from causing trouble until they can figure out what they want to do with him at the end of the month. He's canonically a pretty decent guy and isn't going to try to take over the world or anything, so they let him live- but had he intended to start causing serious trouble using skills gained with the help of the angels, I imagine that would've run afoul of the whole “We are not supposed to meddle in mortal conflicts” bit and they would've had to kill him.
