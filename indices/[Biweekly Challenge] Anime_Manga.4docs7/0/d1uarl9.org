*Yugiohnai! Episode I: The Heart of the Cards?*

Destiny has chosen him to /defend/ the world from the return of the shadow games, not to embrace it. Now Yugi Moto has to figure out how to obtain and destroy all of the Millenium items before they turn one of his favorite games into a ritual of dark magic that could destroy the world.

It's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-duel! ...Or not!
