Hmm. This probably comes down to individual taste; for myself I liked the parody songs (to listen to), but didn't find them particularly amusing, whereas I was uncontrollably giggling from the first episode. Episodes much later I didn't find as laughter-inducing, but for some reason the Zero episodes I then uncontrollably laughed at again. I'm afraid I don't know how the majority react to different episodes.

(<tries to control expression, remembering the first episode's Exodia scene (the vocal delivery at least as much as the words themselves)>) (Ah, and for the 'Pharaoh's Throne' song, I couldn't stop myself from laughing at the 'because it makes me happy' scene... which in turn reminds me of 'Waah, waah, Baby Pharoah wants milk'... I should go to bed.)

(Another early-on scene found laughter-inducing was the 'must--risk--life--for cards!' sea scene.)
