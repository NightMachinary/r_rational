TBH, I haven't watched Detective Conan in forever but, if murders truly always happen right AFTER he arrives, with disturbing regularity, he should've been locked up by like episode 40, lol. Yay anime irrationality.

Petty, unrelated side note: It's so frustrating to watch an anime in which a single man (with a sword and body enhancement magic) defeated 70,000 soldiers (with a healthy amount of magic wielders mixed in there, although it should be noted his sword cuts through magic) yet still struggles against individual, not particularly skilled opponents later. The feeling reminds me of when, as a kid, I watched Pikachu beat a Dragonite in the Orange Islands arc, only to then be beat by a chikorita a few episodes later. Made me almost irrationally angry.
