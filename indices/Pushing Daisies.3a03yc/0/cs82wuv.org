I become a vampire hunter. One touch turns the dead back into the living, which neutralizes all of a vampire's advantages. This only works until the point where vampires start using handguns. If they're already using handguns, then I probably die in the first encounter.

On a more serious note, the first thing I would do is gather some information. The 60-second limit is basically so crap that it's almost not worth bothering with. That means turning my attention to permanently bringing someone to life. This "equivalent life value" business is poorly defined in the show, but assuming that there are any rules at all, enough experimentation should be able to find the principles. It doesn't appear that there's a limit on how long resurrection lasts, nor does it appear that resurrected people age, so "equivalent life value" seems like it works out in my favor.

/If/ I can control who dies (probably by manipulating who is around; I would get a sectioned off site in the middle of a desert with plenty of warning signs up), then I can go into business resurrecting people. There are plenty of people who would be willing to die to have someone they love brought back to life, it would just be a matter of marketing. If I were especially unscrupulous, I would try to get some funding through insurance companies, but that would require secrecy, which goes contrary to marketing (and the fact that I'm bringing people back from the dead).

Edit: Possibly contentious, but if at all possible I think trading human immortality for the death of a lower animal is perfectly acceptable.
