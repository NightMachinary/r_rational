  Not possible. You can trade one kind of animal for another, but humans only get you humans.

This is one of those things that needs experimentation to prove for sure; the basis of the equivalence isn't explored in the show, and so far as I recall, Ned never does any serious experimentation (for obvious ethical reasons, though there are certainly ways around that). The fact that you can trade a squirrel's life for a dog's life indicates to me that the possibility of trading something else for a human is a possibility worth pursuing.
