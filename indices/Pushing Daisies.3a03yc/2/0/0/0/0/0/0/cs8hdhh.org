Yeah, and you test the power's range and selective ability with rats or mice first. Go into the middle of as uninhabited of an area as you can find with a bunch of mouse corpses, and get an assistant with a walkie-talkie to bring live mice in and then clear the area. Doing it this way, you can probably test how much the power responds to different variables, most notably proximity.
