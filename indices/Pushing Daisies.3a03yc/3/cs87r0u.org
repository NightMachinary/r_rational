I'd do what I'd do in any "you have proof of the supernatural" scenario, namely head over to the local university and try to show this proof to some scientists. I could use the help trying to figure out how it works exactly and what to do with it. Plus science apparently has missed some pretty big things, who know what kind of benefits that might reap?

Edit: Scratch all that, I'd first get 1 million dollars from James Randi, then approach the scientists.
