- Fun facts about goocy

  - /"I've run a quick statistical analysis on the raw data."/
  - /"I've started with the assumption that the EMdrive's thrust reaches equilibrium with the counterforce of the torsion thread instantly."/
  - /"I've truncated the first 30 minutes of data and segmented the next 7:45 hours into 8 segments - 4 with power on, 4 with power off."/
  - /"I've then calculated the mean absolute rotation for each segment."/
  - /"I've then run a pairwise, 2-tailed Student's T-test over this data."/
  - /"I've asked for a meet-up with the team; since they publish "data" like this, it seems like they desparately need the help of a scientist like me."/
  - /"I've never done drugs."/
  - /"I've only seen tests for two directions: normal and turned by 180 degrees."/
  - /"I'm a skeptic, and this experiment would convince me, at least if used in a closed container."/
  - /"I've heard about it this year."/
  - /"I've also read that diodes can't switch that fast."/
