There's a pair of ethical questions here.

1. Do you have an obligation to bring people back from the dead?
2. Is it murder if you undo your resurrection?

For point #1, assume that you need to sacrifice a human (as opposed to a cageful of rats) in order to resurrect someone. Don't you gain utilons by sacrificing a dead-row mass-murder for a Nobel-prize-winning life extension expert?

For point #2, you have a living sapient being and you are taking away their life. Furthermore, you sacrificed someone to bring them back in the first place, which means undoing your resurrection is actually killing two people.
