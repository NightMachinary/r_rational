Sell "life insurance": Basically, I sell an extra 59 seconds of life, contingent on their body being intact enough to revive. During that time, they can say goodbye to loved ones, present evidence in a murder case, etc. For a substantial extra fee, they can name an activity within the bounds of legality and reason that they'd like to do before they die, and be revived in time to do that, so long as it's within 59 seconds. If there was someone really, really important that needed to be revived, I would probably try to find terminal patients, prisoners on death row, and other people with low expected life duration and quality, and pay them a very large amount of money to collectively gather around the one who needs to be revived.
