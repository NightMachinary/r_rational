  If you don't undo the effect within sixty seconds, something with "equivalent life value" dies somewhere else, generally nearby. This doesn't stay within species lines, but you also don't have any control over it, so whether the cost is paid by a human or something else seems to be random.

I think from what we see bringing a human back always costs a human life, presumably meaning that humans have a substantially higher (or at least different) life value from other animals.
