I remember seeing something similar on a Star Trek episode, where they got rid of a troublesome AI by surreptitiously transferring it into a complete virtual universe running on a small chunk of hardware. Being Star Trek, of course, they didn't then immediately proceed to wipe the hardware, and I don't think it was rigged to continuously destruction-test the AI.
