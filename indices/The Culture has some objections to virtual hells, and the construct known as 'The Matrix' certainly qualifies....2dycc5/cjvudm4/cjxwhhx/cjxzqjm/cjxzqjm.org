  That's where the phasing agents in white suits in the sequels come from.

Don't be silly. They never made a sequel, let alone /sequels/. Can you imagine how bad those would have been, what with big budget action movie studio pressures, and without the fresh, indie artistic vision of the Wachowskis? Some even say, partially /stolen/ vision, which only makes The Matrix more out there and edgy. But that wouldn't, couldn't be allowed to continue in sequels.

Everyone would know this going in. And yet, everyone would have felt compelled to see them anyway. The Wachowskis themselves would have become part of a system of control, to turn a joyful fanbase into just another series of box office ticket sales.

That would have been the real virtual hell. And only something extreme, like a series of separately released, collaborative animated shorts and short stories by several creative geniuses, working directly from the original Wachowski vision, would have saved anything of the IP after something like that.

/Especially/ if the final sequel was just one big infodump, adding new things to the series that /didn't make any fucking sense at all/.
