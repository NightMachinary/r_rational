*edit after actually RTFF:

I admit it: I've been nerdbaited. Though not, I think, the way this post was meant to. And it was a success, as I actually read the story.

So. This is /The Matrix/ In Name Only. Dirty pool. Tag that shit AU.

But still, well written. I'm not wrong, though. It wasn't a good tagline. And it clearly tried to play on a widely-held, and mistaken, view of the subject to generate interest.

It would have been far better just to have used a line from the summary:

#+begin_quote
  When powerful alien AIs discover the Matrix, whose side will they be on? And why? [Culture x The Matrix]
#+end_quote

But noooo, OP had to sex it up and-

Okay. Fine.

Still, keeping the rest of this here because it remains accurate, and because OP should be ashamed.

#+begin_quote
  The construct known as 'The Matrix' certainly qualifies.
#+end_quote

This is not obviously true. The Matrix's functionality, for the VAST majority of "users" (hundreds of thousands, maybe millions -- most likely not billions) is simply an imitation of late 20th century urban life. Boredom is the worst we're ever shown, other than a terrorist (Morpheus) going around killing people. Like Neo does in the lobby scene. And that's hardly the machines' fault.

As we learn in the extended pieces, The Matrix was created after a failed human global genocide of AIs, followed by an overwhelming machine intelligence counterattack. In the aftermath, they potted survivors in a virtual world, for what can easily be seen as /literally/ humanitarian purposes. The Earth was no longer anything but a smoking ruin, but instead of finishing the job, they kept humanity alive and safely contained. According to Agent Smith, they even tried to give them perfect virtual utopias first, beforing settling on the grey, boring Matrix seen in the movies. As for the canon human battery "explanation," that is given during a rushed recruitment drive by a religious zealot who might not know an amp from his ass. It certainly doesn't make any sense from a physics standpoint.

But in any case, the canon Matrix is hardly a virtual hell. It isn't even clear that any crimes are taking place in this world, or that there is any unnecessary human suffering at all. It is bad, really bad, that people are stuck in a system of control like that, but it isn't exactly the most evil thing around, and certainly doesn't compare to Banks' Culture novel virtual hells.

So 7/10 for pithy tag lines, 2/10 for +rational analysis+ nerdbaiting.
