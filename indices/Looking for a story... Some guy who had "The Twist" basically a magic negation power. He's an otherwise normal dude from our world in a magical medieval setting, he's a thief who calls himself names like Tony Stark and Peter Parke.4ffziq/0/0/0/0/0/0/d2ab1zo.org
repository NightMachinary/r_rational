Yeah that's pretty spot on. It's an interesting setting and premise but the author isn't exploring it like I wanted, just turned the story into generic fantasy romance.

A bunch of stupid shit happens in book 3. The author has zero knowledge of guns or the military and it shows. Things aren't making sense at all right now and I'm getting bored with it.
