  A bunch of stupid shit happens in book 3. The author has zero knowledge of guns or the military and it shows. Things aren't making sense at all right now and I'm getting bored with it.

Same here. [[#s][I stopped reading when]]

Actually, when I put it like that, it really shines a spotlight on that scene's flaws.

There's also the problems I had with how the dragon and her underling blame Paul for the consequences of him not following the dragon's plans, even though they never actually tell him what those consequences will be until after it's too late to do anything about it.

Dragon: "You will obey me!"\\
Paul: "You haven't given me any reason to trust you, and you're been basically manipulating me ever since I came to your attention. Instead of following your orders, I shall do the reasonable thing and get as far away from you as possible."\\
Dragon: "Fool! Because of your actions, every single living thing on the planet has died twice over /and it's all your fault!/"

Out of curiosity, what are some of the larger problems you see with how the author handled guns/military?
