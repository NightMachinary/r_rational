To me it sort of reads like an oral history or something. A story from 1000 arabian nights, which is meant to be told round a fire and ended with a hook each evening to bring people back. The descriptions though, they have no life to them. It plods, stolid and slow and this angel girl, she does not interest me. In general the character interactions are like the story itself: they get the point across but there is no sense of fun. It is not a bad story, but I can't really call it a good one either.

Does that change in the next book?
