This chapter is all about high stakes ninja on ninja combat, and is appropriately bloody considering in this story ninja are glass cannons. The PC's team was ambushed and mostly disabled, while the PC managed to get away and circle back, just in time to see his newest team member faced with two stronger opponents.

There is a link to the player vote in the title of the chapter.
