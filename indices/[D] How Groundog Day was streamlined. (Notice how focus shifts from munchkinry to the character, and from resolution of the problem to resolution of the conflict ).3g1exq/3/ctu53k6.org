In the interest of streamlining a movie I agree that it's better to cut out munchkinry over character development, but ideally any such work should contain ample quantities of both.

Leaving out the entire reason behind the time loop feels like a strange decision, but it worked for the tone of that particular movie. Not so sure what I'd think of seeing the same thing again now.
