I'd like to distinguish between grinding and munchkinry. Grinding is repetitive actions to improve skills or gather resources. Munchkinry is a clever insight about a well defined set of rules to accomplish something in a non-obvious manner, typically achieving a large magnitude of effect relative to your efforts.

Munchkinry is cleverness. Motivated cleverness is interesting. Frequent motivated cleverness often results in an overpowered character and requires in turn an overpowered opponent. So as long as you're careful about that, do as much as you want. I think people tend to prefer it if you create balanced systems, though, which relegates most of the munchkinry to fan fiction.

Grinding is dull. It is rarely a problem to reduce the amount of on-screen grinding. You can omit pretty much all of it, but you do need to demonstrate your characters' abilities before major conflicts necessitate their use, so it can be useful to show a bit. /Groundhog Day/ showed a little bit of Phil's grinding, with pretty much every incident being played for laughs and also succinct.

Typical shounen series tend to show more of the grind. They follow a standard format a lot of the time: show an upcoming conflict, demonstrate that the characters don't measure up, spend an episode training /in a novel way/, then go on to the previously mentioned conflict.

This gives a deadline, which provides a modicum of urgency, and it motivates the training. The novelty of the type of training increases interest. The training forms a miniature story arc of identifying problems, trying to solve them, eventually solving them, and seeing how much the character has improved at the end.

The recently linked manhwa /The Gamer/ is a good example of what not to do. It shows a fair bit of grinding. While the techniques used to kill zombies vary, they only vary between "hit it with a baseball bat" and "hit it with a spear" for the most part. The zombies are effectively all identical for a run of about ten chapters.
