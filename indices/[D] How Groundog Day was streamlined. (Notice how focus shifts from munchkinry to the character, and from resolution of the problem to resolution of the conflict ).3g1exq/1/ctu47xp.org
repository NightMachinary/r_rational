That's an excellent read. I've noticed this tendency to over-analyse and over-explain in a lot of stuff that's been posted on this sub (and in my own writing too). But I've always ignored my misgivings because... surely, it's a good thing when characters act the way real and sensible people would act?

Well, it is, but you don't have to show it all the time. A premise is not a story (sorry, all the [BST] posts around here), and the audience is easily clever enough to think of all the cool things /they/ would do with Phil's powers - either that or they're not interested in munchkinry anyway. We see a few hints of that, enough to assume it's happening, but it's not the main point. So /Groundhog Day/ focuses on character development and comedy instead, and is much more streamlined and stronger for it. The time loop is not such a complex idea that it needed an entire two hours to explain on its own.

Also, the writers of /Groundhog Day/ had to cut out extraneous material to fit the story into a two-hour film. But don't think that just because you're writing in a format with no built-in limits on length, that frees you from cutting out scenes that don't contribute enough to the story. (I do have a specific person in mind here, but if you're reading this comment it's almost certainly not you.)
