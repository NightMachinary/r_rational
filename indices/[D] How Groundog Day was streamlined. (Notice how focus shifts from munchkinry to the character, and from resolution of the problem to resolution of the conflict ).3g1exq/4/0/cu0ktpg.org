The general term comes from [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin]] , while as it's used in this subreddit, it usually refers to applying [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing]] to whatever the setting's laws of physics are.

(A typical example is a video game that lets your character craft Intelligence-boosting potions, which let him craft better potions, repeating until he has arbitrarily high Intelligence, which lets him craft potions to raise the rest of his stats arbitrarily high, thus being able to breeze through the rest of the game.)
