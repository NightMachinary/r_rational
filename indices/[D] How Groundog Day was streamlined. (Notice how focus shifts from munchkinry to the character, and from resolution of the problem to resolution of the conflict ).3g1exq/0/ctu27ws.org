Groundhog Day is one of my favorite movies of all time (we watch it every year on my birthday; perhaps you can guess what day that is).

One of the reasons that you have munchkinry in a story is because that's what a person really would do. You don't need to be all that clever to start thinking of exploits, but characters in fiction generally do a poor job of it because their authors just want to get on with the story. One of the things Groundhog Day does really well (something necessitated by average movie runtime) is spending a few minutes skipping through all of the munchkinry and effectively saying, "Yes, all that stuff, but this isn't the point of the film".
