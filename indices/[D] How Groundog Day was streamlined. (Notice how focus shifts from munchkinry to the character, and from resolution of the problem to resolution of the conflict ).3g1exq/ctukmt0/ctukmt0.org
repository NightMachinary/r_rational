Groundhog Day is an amazing film when it comes to economy of story telling. Broadly speaking, it's about Murray realizing that he can't win over Rita by changing her, but only by changing himself (and deciding that that's worth doing for itself). That's the romantic interpretation anyway. The other way to look at it is that it's about a man who would try literally anything, including multiple suicide attempts, before trying to better himself. This is not a film that runs away from it's concept (well, OK, it could have gone much darker than it did in terms of his consequence-less actions, but this was meant to be a film for everyone), and explores it thoroughly, but in a very clean, fast way.
