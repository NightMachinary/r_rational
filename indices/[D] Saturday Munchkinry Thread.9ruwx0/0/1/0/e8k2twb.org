You're on the right track with the puzzle, but I think you're overestimating how much damage a dumb person can do. Someone with 40 IQ isn't going to slit their wrists just because they can't do directional derivitives. Keep yourself away from heavy machinery for sure, but I think locking yourself in a room with some cartoons should work just fine.

Groundhog Day rules, your IQ changes at 6am of whichever time zone you've spent the most time in throughout your life, every day, no matter what.
