You can never overestimate how much damage stupidity can do.

The danger isn't when you have 40 IQ and are too stupid to do anything.

The danger is just before that, when you are so stupid that you think you are smart. You will rampage around doing all kinds of stupid things while thinking that they are genius plans. And the worst part is: because of your days as a freaking genius, other people will think that you /are/ doing genius things and won't stop you. Heck they will even give you access to /more/ issues that you can screw up horribly, foolishly believing that you will solve them wonderfully. The damage potential is infinite.
