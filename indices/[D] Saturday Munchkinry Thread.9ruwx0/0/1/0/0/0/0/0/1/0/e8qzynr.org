  The one of those most likely to result in your death is IQ 90 with the car keys.

Ok firstly people with 90 IQ can drive just fine, the fact you think otherwise is pretty demonstrative that you don't seem to have a very good grasp on what particular IQ's actually entail in terms of abilities.

Secondly as I said before being an idiot doesn't preclude you from being rational and from following instructions left by past you. If whenever you drop in intelligence you think you know better than the demonstrably smarter version of yourself (because you're going to notice that you have a hard time understanding things that previously seemed obvious, but you'll still remember enough to know you don't actually understand them enough), well then that's the fault of a serious flaw in your personality and shouldn't be an issue for most people.
