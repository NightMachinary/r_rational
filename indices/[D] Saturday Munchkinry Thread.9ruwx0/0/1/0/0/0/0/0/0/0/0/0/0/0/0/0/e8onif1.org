  One clever day you come up with an amazing idea: What if having sex/kids was banned for stupid people?\\
  This might check the boxes for int (use evolutionary pressure to make people smarter), but not for wisdom (that's wrong/there'd be riots, etc.).

The fact you can generate fictional examples that seem to support the cultural concept of wisdom vs intelligence does not mean those are actually meaningfully distinct categories. Were there any cognitive ability that resembled wisdom and wasn't massively correlated with intelligence (as much as different sections of IQ tests are with each other) then it would have been noticed by now. However the past century of psychometrics has pretty consistently indicated that it really is just G. This should also be intuitively obvious in that the people who consistently act like they have low WIS are usually not terribly bright either.

My point here is that there really doesn't seem to be any innate or separate "wisdom" trait. It's just a combination of intelligence and learned heuristics.
