Well if we're assuming you have a 140 IQ to begin with (not actually terribly remarkable in this subreddit if our demographics are anything like say [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]]) then going off the 15 SD IQ scale you can expect to be superhumanly intelligent, say 195 IQ (barring non-statistically-valid stuff like adjusting for age nobody on earth should have an IQ that large) only every ~22 years.\\
With that level of intelligence it's not clear what you could do, but you still only have 24 hours to do it and given people with insanely high IQ's in the actual world aren't churning out groundbreaking stuff every day I wouldn't hold your breath.

So for this ability to seem very useful (though maybe you could get some money from being a scientific curiosity) it seems like you really need to be a remarkable genius to begin with, since being an ordinary genius isn't good enough. After all if you have say a 160 IQ to begin with then you get a day at 195 IQ every 102 days, days at 200 IQ every 261 days and days at 202 IQ ([[http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/iqtable.aspx][the highest this chart goes]]) every 391 days. So /those/ are levels of intelligence I can really imagine being useful to have even if only for 24 hours, especially since being a genius already you'll have more crystalized intelligence to go off while your IQ is massively boosted.\\
Also usefully at 160 base IQ you shouldn't expect to ever be reduced to 100 IQ or below but every 80+ years, so the ability will basically only every make you /less/ clever for the most part.
