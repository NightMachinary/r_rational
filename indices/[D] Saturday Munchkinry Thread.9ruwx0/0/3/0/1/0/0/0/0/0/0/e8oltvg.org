The bell curve isn't some purely definitional thing, rather the thing is that no matter how how you go about measuring intelligence you will find that people's cognitive ability will look like a bell curve when you plot large numbers of people.\\
Average people are just vastly more common than geniuses and more genius levels of intelligence you're looking at the exponentially rarer people at that level will be (within the human range of intelligence of course).
