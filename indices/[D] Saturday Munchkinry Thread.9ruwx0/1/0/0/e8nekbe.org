  That said, wishing for a mouth full of Californium (~$24 million/gram) would let you buy the best dentures out there and a hell of a lot more besides.

You'd definitely need dentures, given that Californium is highly radioactive and unstable.

Hell, if you knew exactly when the change was going to happen and had a friend standing by with a sledgehammer and pliers ready for immediate extraction, I'm still not sure if you would survive.
