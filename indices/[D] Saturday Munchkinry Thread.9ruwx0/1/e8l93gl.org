Another children's book to munchkin: In this book, a boy discovers that the tooth fairy is his homeroom teacher, and in return she offers to grant him one wish that must be tooth-related. She offers "a new toothbrush" and "never get cavities again" as possible wishes, and the boy ends up wishing for all his teeth to fall out in hopes of getting extra money to buy a new bike. In the end, while that happens, his teacher puts his teeth back and just gives him the bike because she feels sorry for him.

So, assuming you encounter this situation, what would you wish for? Assume that any actual alterations to teeth can only be done to your own teeth. Does your answer change if we assume that in this case you still have your baby teeth?
