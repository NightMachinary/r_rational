If this is about the story I think it is then it's worth noting that this character also has his empathy/kindness change inversely proportional to his intelligence.

So on his days with super genius intelligence he's cold, impatient and needlessly harsh to people that aren't as intelligent as he is. He still has the same goals, but he becomes a bit of a straw utilitarianist about it.
