There is a level of intelligence where you are so stupid that everything is hard to do, and it is obvious to you and everyone around you that you are mentally unsound.

​

There is a level of intelligence where you are actually intelligent enough to do things competently and know you can do things competently.

​

Between those two levels, there is a level where you are just competent enough to not constantly make obvious errors, but still really dumb, and dumb enough to believe that you are truly competent even though you aren't. This is the dangerous level, because you won't recognize that you are stupid, and may act competently enough to fool others into thinking you actually know what you are doing.

​

That's why I proposed confining yourself until you demonstrate true competence, rather than just thinking you are competent and going on a rampage of stupidity.
