  My point here is that there really doesn't seem to be any innate or separate "wisdom" trait.

You are probably right about that. My comments are only intended to apply to /fiction/. I also think we still disagree on the meaning of Int and Wisdom, but for the purpose of this discussion, I think it matters only that in fiction, a power that increases "intelligence" is more likely to have effects as I described.

"If Isaac Asimov's 3 laws of robotics had been perfect, /I, Robot/ would have been dull indeed."

If you write a story where intelligence is increased, and it operates as you have said, than I will be very interested in reading it. As you brought up how this prompt pertains to reality, I am now interested in how so-called cognitive enhancers actually work in real life.
