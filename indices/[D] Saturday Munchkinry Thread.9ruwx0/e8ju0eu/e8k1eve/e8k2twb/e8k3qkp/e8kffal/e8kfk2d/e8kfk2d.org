Err... yes? That's why I said the 40 IQ isn't the danger. I said "isn't", not "is".

​

EDIT: Okay I see the confusion now. When I said "kill yourself" I didn't mean intentionally cutting yourself or throwing yourself off a building. I mean accidentally killing yourself from doing something stupid. Like people who win Darwin awards. Being stupid isn't likely to make you delusional enough to intentionally kill yourself, but it is very likely to make you take stupid actions that have high risks of accidentally killing yourself.

​

So if you have sharp objects like knives in the room, I'm not worried about you taking a knife and purposefully stabbing yourself. I'm worried about you playing around with the knife and then accidentally stabbing yourself.
