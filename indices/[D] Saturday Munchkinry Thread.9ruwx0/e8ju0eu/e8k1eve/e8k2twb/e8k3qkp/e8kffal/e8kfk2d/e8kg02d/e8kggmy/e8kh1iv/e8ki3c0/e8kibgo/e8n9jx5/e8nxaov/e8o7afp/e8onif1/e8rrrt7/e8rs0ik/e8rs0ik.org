  My comments are only intended to apply to fiction.

Still unless a story indicates otherwise it's a pretty safe bet that the humans in a setting aren't somehow fundamentally psychologically different from actual humans.

  That said, I am curious if your claim also applies to so-called 'cognitive enhancers'.

I'm not quite sure what you mean. To make a point relevant to what I suspect you might be hinting at though, it's worth noting that while stuff like modafinil or nicotine can improve focus without other cognitive side effects (though certainly other health effects in the case of nicotine) they don't improve intelligence.
