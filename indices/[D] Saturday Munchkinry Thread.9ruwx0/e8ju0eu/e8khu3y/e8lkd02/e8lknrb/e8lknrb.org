  Not how the power works, I've read the source, the base is 100 IQ, he gets the bell curve from there.

Well I don't know about the story this is based on but the post said it would deviate randomly in a bell curve from one's current IQ.

  Also you should google highest IQs individuals on earth, there are some really stupid numbers out there, and they aren't doing anything insane.. Mostly college professors making a decent living.

What exactly is your point supposed to be here? I basically said the power wouldn't be much use unless it let you achieve superhuman levels of intelligence several times a year (and you were already a high level genius the rest of the time).

Actually given in the source the character is supposedly 100 IQ to begin with, I kind of have to assume that this post is incorrect in assuming the intelligence follows a bell curve here. Since if it did then days of actually impressive genius would happen only every few years (and given the setting and the lack of crystallized intelligence to draw on you wouldn't be able to accomplish much of anything even when you got genius days).
