  Actually given in the source the character is supposedly 100 IQ to begin with, I kind of have to assume that this post is incorrect in assuming the intelligence follows a bell curve here. Since if it did then days of actually impressive genius would happen only every few years (and given the setting and the lack of crystallized intelligence to draw on you wouldn't be able to accomplish much of anything even when you got genius days).

That's the case, he had 1 day where he was monster level intelligence. And he knows it probably won't ever happen again. But in that day he did a lot, made a lot of plans and set many events in motion.

He's not xXxOPboi69XxX he's a powerful king with high intrigue and several plots and plans.. It's an interesting character following plans made by an alien with alien morals who is also himself but he can't really understand it completely.

The OP wanted to see if anybody here could exploit it more optimally or do something else entirely, but the actual author is fairly intelligent and did a good job optimizing it.
