"Never get cavities again" is an interesting wish, because it's doing some sort of sustained violation of physics. Any sustained violation of physics is infinitely more valuable for your ability to study than any material wealth can be worth, even if you could earn $100m+ with pure diamond teeth or something.

I would ask for some sort of exotic tooth related effect and dedicate my life to understanding the physics behind it and getting rich/saving humanity with it.\\
Inviolate teeth. Vorpal teeth. Laplace's Teeth. Conceptual Teeth.

Even if I can never unlock the secrets, worst case scenario I end up with teeth that can chew through a battleship and have a career as a dental related youtuber.
