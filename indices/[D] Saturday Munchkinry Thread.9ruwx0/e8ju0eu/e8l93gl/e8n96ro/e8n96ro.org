I mean, "make my teeth perfect forever" would save me a /lot/ of hassle.

That said, wishing for a mouth full of Californium (~$24 million/gram) would let you buy the best dentures out there and a hell of a lot more besides.

But never having to worry about oral hygiene again, including into old age... it would be tempting.

(Unless I can wish for, like, the next decade's stock prices or a grand unifying theory of physics to be inscribed on my teeth in microscopic font? How much tooth-related power does this fairy have?
