This is a "power" cribbed from a popular fantasy series. I won't say what series or what character as that's a heavy spoiler, but the power itself won't spoil anything. Please refrain from identifying the series in comments, you can PM me if you want confirmation on a guess :)

Every morning you wake up with a different INT score. These tend to cluster around your normal--it looks like a standard distribution from some statistical meddling you did on a good day--but there are occasional (extremely rare) outliers that leave you catatonic and drooling or, on the other end, piercing the veil of the universe with your insight. There is no pattern, save that you're just as likely to wake up with -4 INT as +4.

For purposes of discussion we'll say "genius" comes at +2 sigma, meaning 2.1% of days you're at Einstein-level cognition (and 2.1% you're a giggling child).

The character with this affliction has munchkined it pretty thoroughly, so I'm curious to see what this sub would do. First priority is probably setting your life up so that waking up with 50 IQ wouldn't collapse your whole deal.
