I'll assume it changes at midnight. Set up your sleep schedule so that you wake up at midnight, so on a rare good day you get 24 hours and can use stimulants and nootropics to borrow an extra boost from the following days. Depending on how trusting you are, find someone who loves you to get you through the bad days, or reveal your powers to also get large amounts of assistance on a good day.

The answer to many munchkinry questions involves AI, but this question is ~tailor-made for it. Beyond-human intellect is going to be most useful in producing insights for the alignment problem. Go to MIRI or something, convince them you're right, and watch them apply their creativity to motivating you to get tutored in their work on above-average days so you can play oracle once a year.

"Travel the world visiting mathematicians to solve their problems" is what Erdös (edit: not Gödel!) did on merely human intellect, so your best day should give you a good shot and hope not to be abducted by some government.

It's probably wise to look at your brain for how this is happening, though.
