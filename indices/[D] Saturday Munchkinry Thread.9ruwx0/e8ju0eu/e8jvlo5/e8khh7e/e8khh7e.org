Long term, large size problems seem inappropriate for this ability. Einstein took a long time to design his theories, and if we only get his genius 2% of the time then I don't expect our character's short bursts are going to contribute much. The average of your ability is back at your starting intelligence, so your net contribution isn't going to be much more than without the ability. Unless high intelligence massively scales up your contribution, but even so the increase will be limited. eg. if the scaling is x^2, then your contribution is about double what you would have without the power.
