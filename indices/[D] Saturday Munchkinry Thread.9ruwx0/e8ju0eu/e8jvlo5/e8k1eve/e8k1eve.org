Step 1 is to build restraints for yourself. Every day before you go to sleep, lock yourself in a room with food and water and no sharp objects, and make it so that the only way to unlock the room would be to solve some complex puzzle. You can achieve this with AI or just getting a friend on the other side of the door to unlock it only if you solve a mathematical problem. This way you can't kill yourself on days when you are a total idiot. Depending on how stupid you can become, you may need to tie yourself down to the bed and get an IV drip.

​

Step 2 is experimenting with your ability. How are you getting a different IQ every morning? What if you don't sleep at night? Does your IQ still change? Can you force rapid changes of IQ by taking naps? What if you travel to a different timezone, or keep moving around the earth ahead of the morning so your IQ never changes?

​

If your IQ changes every 24 hours regardless of what you do, you can stay up all night and prepare tranquilizers to be injected into you right after the IQ change if you don't solve some puzzle (again either AI or friends would do). That way on days where your IQ is low you just spend time asleep, on days when you have average IQ you just catch up on sleep or waking hours, and on days where you are a freaking genius you chug down lots of coffee to stay awake.
