Depends what "intelligence" entails. Poor planing (If I don't speed I'll be late), poor impulse control (what if this text is important), over estimation of capability (I'll hold the wheel steady with my knees while I open this drink bottle), and being easily distracted (wow that pedestrian is hot) would all fall within the remit of magically variable intelligence in my opinion, and would all degrade safe driving. To be fair, there's probably also a point where higher intelligence also degrades safe driving due to being bored and complacent.

Also no. That the results of making bad decisions when intoxicated doesn't always lead to bad outcomes for the individual is not proof that they made good decisions, nor is it proof that making decisions while intoxicated is "perfectly fine". People make demonstrably worse decisions when tired or intoxicated.

For the same reason that getting drunk before you drive over to your lawyer's office to go over an important contract is highly irresponsible. A person who has magically variable intelligence driving over to their lawyer's and going over an important contract on a below average int day is also being irresponsible.
