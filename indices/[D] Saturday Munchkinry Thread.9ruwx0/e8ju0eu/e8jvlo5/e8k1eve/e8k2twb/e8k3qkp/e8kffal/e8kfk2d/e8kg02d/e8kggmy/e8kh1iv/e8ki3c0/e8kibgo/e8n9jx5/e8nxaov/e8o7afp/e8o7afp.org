  By that logic actual raw genius wouldn't imply either high INT /or/ WIS, plus given both of those categories are just skills it's not clear how they're actually that meaningfully distinct other than /how/ they're learned.

One clever day you come up with an amazing idea: What if having sex/kids was banned for stupid people?

This might check the boxes for int (use evolutionary pressure to make people smarter), but not for wisdom (that's wrong/there'd be riots, etc.).

If you think this is a reasonable example of the difference between them, then int might be concerned with 'theory' and wisdom might be 'knowing/predicting in advance how well it'll work in practice'.

On the rationality front one might say 'logic and reason can be used to figure out how to do something, but they should first be used to to figure out what you should do - sometimes it's better to go around a mountain than climb over it.' The example might show someone figuring out /how/ to do something, but not that they /shouldn't/. That doesn't mean the idea should be entirely discarded: Somehow the inverse approach 'smart people should have more kids' or just 'we should research what affects intelligence' (like lead) seem much better - we do see a difference between 'killing off everyone who is unhappy' and say, 'cloning some happy people' or trying to make people happier/less unhappy.
