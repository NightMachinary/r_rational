I'm confused so if you're not talking about 40 IQ then what IQ level are you talking about as being the one where you would be too dumb to notice your weren't smart, yet still functional enough to be dangerous?

Because at any level of intelligence the point I made about stupid people not being delusional still holds, you'll be able to follow basic instructions left by past you and notice that trying to think about things that previously seemed trivial is suddenly much more difficult.\\
This situation seems in many ways fairly akin to having your thinking heavily clouded by certain drugs and I can tell you one can still be remarkably functional while unable to complete a train of thought or perform many other basic cognitive abilities.
