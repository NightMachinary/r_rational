  You seem to be conflating stupidity with irrationality here,

Well that's the question isn't it? What does an Int score actually mean? How does the -4 INT manifest itself? Do you just suddenly compute things worse? Do you lose memories or knowledge? Becoming irrational seems entirely possible as a way of manifesting -4 INT, since you might temporarily forget things such as Bayes Theorem or anything beyond simple logic.

​

Using your example of leaving notes for your future self, there are three cases:

1) You wake up too dumb to read the note, and so realize you are dumb since you can't read.

2) You wake up and read the note just fine, and obey the instructions.

3) You wake up and read the note just fine, then proceed to completely ignore the instructions because you think you are a freaking genius that is smarter than past you, and so can do much better than following past you's instructions.

​

You're saying that case 3 can't happen, but I have to ask: why not? That seems like a perfectly reasonable manifestation of -4 INT to me. (Unless whatever game system you are using has another mental stat like WIS for representing this.)
