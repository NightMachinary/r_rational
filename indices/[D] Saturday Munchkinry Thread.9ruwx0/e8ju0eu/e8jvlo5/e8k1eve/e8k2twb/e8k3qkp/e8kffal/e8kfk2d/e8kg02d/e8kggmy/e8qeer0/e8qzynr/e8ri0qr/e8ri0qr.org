You've missed the point quite badly.

The problem isn't that you'd disregard the instructions of demonstrably smarter you, nor is it that "IQ 90 people cant drive" but that you'll think the rule you agree with in principle doesn't apply today because you don't feel "that dumb", and driving with below average faculties rather that waiting for the re-roll is bad risk management.

It's similar in principle to what happens with sleep deprivation or alcohol. In particular in that while you'll know when you're severally compromised, but you'll also be prone to not recognizing how compromised you are when you're "only a little bit compromised".

Additionally a lot of very risky activities will naturally gravitate to that "average adult" zone, so a day where you're just a little bit below average and have decided that's 'close enough' is a day you're more likely to regret than a day you were way below average and could tell you weren't in a good place to make decisions.
