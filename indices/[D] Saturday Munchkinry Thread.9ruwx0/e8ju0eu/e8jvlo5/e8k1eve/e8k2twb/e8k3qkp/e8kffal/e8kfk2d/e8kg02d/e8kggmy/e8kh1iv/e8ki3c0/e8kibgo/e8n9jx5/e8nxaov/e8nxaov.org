  I think Int is 'book smarts' and Wisdom is 'street smarts'/common sense.

By that logic actual raw genius wouldn't imply either high INT /or/ WIS, plus given both of those categories are just skills it's not clear how they're actually that meaningfully distinct other than /how/ they're learned.

  Verbal IQ?
#+end_quote

Subcategories of the IQ test very rarely deviate that significantly from the overall score, so you could mainly predict something like verbal IQ based on general IQ, or even a seemingly unrelated thing like ability to mentally rotate objects in your head.\\
That's why multiple intelligence type theories aren't taken that seriously by people in psychometrics these days, because they either correspond to things that are nearly entirely learned skills or the different types of intelligence can be almost entirely predicted from G.
