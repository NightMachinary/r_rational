  Well that's the question isn't it? What does an Int score actually mean? How does the -4 INT manifest itself? Do you just suddenly compute things worse? Do you lose memories or knowledge? Becoming irrational seems entirely possible as a way of manifesting -4 INT, since you might temporarily forget things such as Bayes Theorem or anything beyond simple logic.

Lower IQ means you score worse on IQ tests, given rationality is an acquired skill which doesn't improve your ability on IQ tests it should be completely unaffected. The problem was bringing up IQ so interpreting INT as being IQ is entirely reasonable, especially since research would seem to pretty consistently fail to show any aspect of raw innate intelligence which isn't covered by IQ.
