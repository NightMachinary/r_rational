  Also no. That the results of making bad decisions when intoxicated doesn't always lead to bad outcomes for the individual is not proof that they made good decisions, nor is it proof that making decisions while intoxicated is "perfectly fine". People make demonstrably worse decisions when tired or intoxicated.

Yes but my point is that people are perfectly capable of having the sense to avoid putting themselves in a situation where they can make any decisions that are terribly important while intoxicated. This is directly analogous to having the basic sense to only let oneself make decisions in line with one's current level of intelligence. In both cases you don't need to use external methods to restrain one's own behavior.

  Depends what "intelligence" entails. Poor planing (If I don't speed I'll be late), poor impulse control (what if this text is important), over estimation of capability (I'll hold the wheel steady with my knees while I open this drink bottle), and being easily distracted (wow that pedestrian is hot) would all fall within the remit of magically variable intelligence in my opinion, and would all degrade safe driving. To be fair, there's probably also a point where higher intelligence also degrades safe driving due to being bored and complacent.

What you're describing is mostly learned heuristics which isn't really intelligence except insofar as smarter people learn those heuristics faster and more reliably. Impulse control is at least somewhat a personality trait but also seems to be heavily learned in a way that intelligence can't. Calling any of those things intelligence when talking about a system where intelligence is a /stat/ doesn't really make sense because they would more clearly be skills or stuff not captured in game-like statistics.
