See I absolutely do not buy that if your intelligence was reduced to say 70-80 (that seems like in the range you're describing) you wouldn't notice. Given as somebody trying to use their intelligence for intellectual work you will probably be thinking back on intellectual problems nearly constantly. It should be immediately obvious that as I said before, things that seemed obvious before suddenly make no sense or are incredibly difficult to piece together.

You seem to be conflating stupidity with irrationality here, nothing about being very dull makes you unable to notice extremely obvious things noticeable to a child or suddenly unable to follow basic instructions left by past you.
