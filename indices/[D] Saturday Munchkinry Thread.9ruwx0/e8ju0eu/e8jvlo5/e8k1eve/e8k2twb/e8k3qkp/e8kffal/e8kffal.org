  The danger isn't when you have 40 IQ and are too stupid to do anything.

People with 40 IQ aren't /delusional/, you would be able to notice that suddenly the world is extremely confusing and things are really difficult for you, and you would still have the basic sense to follow very basic instructions left for you by past you. Plus given how your speech would be immediately affected people would definitely notice something was wrong (for instance thinking you're on drugs or having a stroke).
