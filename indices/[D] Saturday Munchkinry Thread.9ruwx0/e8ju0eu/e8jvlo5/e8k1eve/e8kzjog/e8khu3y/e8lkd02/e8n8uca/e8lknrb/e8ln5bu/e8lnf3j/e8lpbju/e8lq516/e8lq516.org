My point is that if you ever see truly inhuman levels of intelligence then we're talking one in many trillions (since IQ rarity is exponential) chances if the intelligence distribution is a bell curve. So seeing it once is very strong evidence against that, so much so that even if you had pretty strong evidence it /was/ a bell curve this evidence would completely trump that.
