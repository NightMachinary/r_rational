> Well if we're assuming you have a 140 IQ to begin with

Not how the power works, I've read the source, the base is 100 IQ, he gets the bell curve from there.

​

Also you should google highest IQs individuals on earth, there are some really stupid numbers out there, and they aren't doing anything insane.. Mostly college professors making a decent living.

​

The thing is, they are limited by the tools and the knowledge available to them. This character in particular is in a middle ages setting, he can't do much with his power other than make elaborate plans, extrapolated predictions and solves problems / mysteries (i.e what's the identity of X enemy based on the information he has).

​

He also set up everything people in the comments suggested, he IQ tests every morning (they have their own name for IQ) and schedules his day based on it. He's actually a public figure so he can't work or be in public on very extreme IQ days.

​

I didn't see any really interesting munchkinry suggestions here, just people solving the basic issues the power causes, arguing how it'd work and overestimating what this high IQ could do specially how fast it'd be at solving difficult mathematical theorems.

​

I think what the author did was actually pretty close to optimal, you could think it can do more or less depending on how accurately you interpret high intelligence.
