  That's the case, he had 1 day where he was monster level intelligence. And he knows it probably won't ever happen again. But in that day he did a lot, made a lot of plans and set many events in motion.

I was talking about just human level genius (which for a single say still wouldn't be /that/ useful), you would expect him to only ever actually have superhuman intelligence if he had the power for many millennia.

  He's not xXxOPboi69XxX he's a powerful king with high intrigue and several plots and plans.. It's an interesting character following plans made by an alien with alien morals who is also himself but he can't really understand it completely.

Again this absolutely sounds like superhuman levels of intelligence, which would require that the distribution of his intelligence not be a proper bell curve. Otherwise you'd never actually see him with intelligence which is this impressive.
