Teeth are more than 1 gram each (why is this data so hard to find?), and adults have 32 of them, and each anti-tooth will react with an equivalent amount of matter, so you're looking at turning 64+ grams of matter into energy, minus losses to neutrinos... let's say 50 Hiroshimas, as a lower bound.

The plutonium and cocaine would also be unpleasant. Lots of valuable materials are valuable because they do things that you do not want to have happen in your mouth.
