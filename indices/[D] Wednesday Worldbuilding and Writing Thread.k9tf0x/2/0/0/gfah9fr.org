The closest there is to a consensus in-setting is that the aliens built these self-repairing, more-or-less indestructible factories to be part of the commons, and then broke the universe somehow. Probably with the punch drives.

This conclusion is entirely wrong. I'm not totally decided on what the truth is; right now I'm leaning to "the galaxy is basically an ant farm" with the technology left behind being either there to make things more interesting, there to test a theory, or both.
