Not all of these factories are /safe/, however. One produces cranial jacks/headsets that, to all appearance, put whoever wears them into a coma; they still have brain activity, but seem to constantly be in a state of fear. (For safety reasons, it's only been tested on rabbits, and similar). Of course, at some point some evil sadist tries to use these as a torture device... and it turns out that this device is a full-sensory-immersion RPG. Once you defeat the main boss, you wake up again (but for some reason, the virtual world is filled with bunnies who keep fleeing from every encounter...). (You probably also wake up automatically if you lose enough battles - that's actually /lose/ them, not continually flee from them).
