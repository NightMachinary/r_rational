  Why no nuts or seeds? Can you still eat seeds as part of something else, like a strawberry?
#+end_quote

Generally yes, seeds eaten whole are typically okay. Many seeds actually grow best after passing through animal digestive tracts, like the seeds of cherries, raspberries, and blackberries.

  Re: your last point, kinda gives the premise a very shaky foundation. If nearly everything is sentient then why should humans set different standards than everyone else?
#+end_quote

This is an interesting point. However, consider that mountain lions have no qualms about eating cats and dogs. Even though wild predators are okay with that situation, we very much are not. We do have different standards, and we're generally willing to go to great lengths to enforce our standards wherever possible.
