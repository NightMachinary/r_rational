There is a good argument that the spell merely makes animals/plants smart enough to speak and hold an intelligent conversation temporarily, not that they are inherently smart enough to do so. Presumably, this (or another justification) is the tune most people and cultures would take when the alternative is starving to death or admitting that you and everyone in your family is a ruthless mass murderer.

That said, I do think a good answer to this would be breeding feed "animals" that don't count as animals for the purposes of the spell, so while obviously our world has no reason to breed massive insects or spiders presumably they would have spent thousands of years doing just that.
