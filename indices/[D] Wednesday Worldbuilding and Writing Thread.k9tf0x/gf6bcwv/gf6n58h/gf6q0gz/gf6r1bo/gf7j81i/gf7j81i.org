If technology has advanced far enough by the time this discovery is made, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_agriculture][cellular agriculture]] could replace raising live plants and animals. Meat grown from cell culture is presumably non-sentient as long as you're not growing brains. Whether a specific plant product can be ethically cultured depends on which parts of a plant are required for sentience. If you grow a log of wood in a vat, does it become sentient? What about a lettuce leaf?
