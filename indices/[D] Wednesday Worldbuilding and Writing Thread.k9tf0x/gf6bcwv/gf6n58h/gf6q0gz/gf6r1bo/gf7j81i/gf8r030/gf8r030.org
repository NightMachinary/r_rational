Meat or wood grown in a cell culture would avoid sentience. It might exceed the 1700s-era technology level of the setting, but magic might be able to facilitate it or offer a similar approach.

Whole lettuce leaves would probably be an issue. In real-life, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_communication][plant communication]] can be carried out with volatile organic compounds emitted by glands found on leaves, and received by receptors on the leaves of other plants. This can be used to warn nearby plants about danger, like crop-eating pests, and induce those plants to secrete compounds that would kill or repel pests, or else substances which would attract insects that would eat the pests. I haven't sifted through research on lettuce to see what's known about the extent of communication and response that lettuce leaves are capable of, but given a setting with magical lettuce that can hold a conversation, I suspect whole leaves would be too much of the plant.
