There are a few magical ways to produce non-sentient nutrition:

- [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stone-to-flesh/][Stone to flesh:]] A 3' diameter 10' long cylinder of stone can be transmuted into "a fleshy substance." The texture, flavor, and nutritional value would probably be similar to spam. It's a somewhat high level spell, so roughly only one in 31,000 people are able to cast it, though they could all cast this at least daily. The spell yields about 70 cubic feet of flesh, or roughly 4,170 pounds of product.

- [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-food-and-water/][Create food and water:]] This provides enough food to feed three people for a day per spellcaster level. It's a third-level spell, and roughly 1 in 200 people can cast it at least daily, and each of them would be able to feed at least 15 people when they do.

- [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dream-feast/][Dream feast:]] This can feed one person when cast. It's a 1st-level spell, and roughly 1 in 26 people can cast it at least daily.

Taken together, these could easily provide about 25% of the nutritional needs of the population. If the spellcasters were tasked (or paid) to provide 100% of the world's food requirements, they would likely be able to do it, though it would take away a lot of their ability to use spells for other purposes like healing, teleportation, divination, etc.
