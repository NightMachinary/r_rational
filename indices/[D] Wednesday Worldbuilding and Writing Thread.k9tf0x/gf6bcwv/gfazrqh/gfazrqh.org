Given that this references DnD, I assume this is the kind of magical world where Ents also exist, and the trees can talk to each other? In that case, it seems the only thing remotely close to ethical is to kill of all herbivorous and omnivorous animalia, living of their flesh for a short while but eventually dooming all the carnivores to starvation as well. During this intermediate time, do a bunch of research to make sure all the animals (except for strict pollinators, probably mainly bees) are realy dead and will stay dead, try to expand and supply the ent population with tools to deal with any unforeseen complications or resurgence of animals, etc. Might want to spend some resources transferring knowledge and culture to the trees as well. As the ents, hopefully they'll make sure to maximally promote healthy trees and minimize shorter-lived plants. The ideal outcome here is the only living things on the planet are trees and ents (and needed non-sentient symbiotes like bacteria and mycorrhizal fungus and pollinators), that all have no frustrated needs or desires except occasionally the weather, and live for many centuries.
