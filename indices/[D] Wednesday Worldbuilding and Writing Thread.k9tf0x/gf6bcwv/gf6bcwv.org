There exist a multitude of magical methods to [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-plants/][speak with plants]] and [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-animals/][animals]]. All evidence points towards plants and animals having sentience. It is soon widely (though not universally) agreed that eating plants and animals is unethical; similar to how the idea of eating dogs, cats, or dolphins is currently perceived.

Exceptions to both the magic and ethical objection include fruits, fungi, algae, microbes, and animal products like eggs, milk, and honey. Most "vermin" are also exceptions, including all insects, arachnids, gastropods, and nematodes. Note however that nuts and seeds are widely viewed as ethically unacceptable for consumption, even though they haven't (yet) grown enough to be communicated with via any magic.
