Wanted to share and get some feedback on my interpretation of the Pokémon universe, I feel like this interpretation solves most of the issues cannon has while still holding the sprit of the world:

Pokémon are *aliens*. The Pokémon world is pretty much our world but which Pokémon appeared whatever number of years ago in from "somewhere else" (where and how exactly is not that important, you can make something rational along the lines of; arceus ported them over or Pokémon were originally just Mew with transform and became all the Pokémon we see now, or other shenanigans with the legendries, Noas arc style reality destruction, w/e). Also Pokemon are *energy beings.* As in, they are made from some sifi/magic shenanigans, and differentiate from humans and earth animals because they aren't fully physical. (I think from a more detailed perspective they could be something like a "projection" on the physical world, but practically they are as physical as anything else other than 1) pokeballs and 2) they can't die that easily (if they have blood/organs at all which can depend on the setting).

I feel like a setting like this fixes all the issues current interpretations have such as:\\
- Do animals exist? (yes)\\
- What is meat, do Pokémon eat each other? (maybe but they don't have to, nor do humans - but their "projections" are just as real as anything else so CAN be eaten -see: slowpoke tails)\\
- How do pokeballs work? (Pokémon are energy beings)\\
- Why can't you use the same space tech for anything else? (Because they are all purely matter - UNLESS, a possible "technological advancement" could be simulating Pokémon's nature with other things, this could make items which can specifically be held in containers with this "special matter" such as bikes, but humans will still not be able to use it.)\\
- Why are Pokémon based on Animals/Human items? (If we go with some sort of scenario where Pokémon are created in some way, they would obviously mimic their environment. Or, since they are malleable as being made of energy at the core, they could "adapt")\\
- If Pokémon are intelligent (which they can be) isn't this slavery? (Yes, but you can add some things with Pokémon largely not being against following trainers cos alien mindsets. - Or, one I like a lot which is the interpretation the story "dreaming of family" uses; for whatever reason Pokémon just get stronger when with a trainer, and most join willfully; they also have instincts which make them want to get stronger in the first place, and enjoy battling but are otherwise treated like family by most trainers.)\\
- Why are tiny kids going on Pokémon Journeys? (This setting I feel would make the world safer in some ways but more dangerous in others; humans (and kids) would still be walking around with nukes in their pockets but there wouldn't be much reason for wild Pokémon to attack people; so a journey into the wild like this to have kids cultivate their own personal strength actually makes much more sense to me.)\\
- What are pokemon moves/types? (Moves/types can be made possible by this same "energy", and this can also explain all the resistances/immunities/super effectiveness of types, with types being different types of energy a Pokémon is made up off/uses. This can explain matter-out-of-nothing and all the other shenanigans of the Pokémon universe which make no sense)

So what do you guys think? And if you like it, feel free to use any of this for your Pokémon fanfics- I love them XD.
