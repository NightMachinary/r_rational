Do you have any thoughts on what the ancient aliens ' purpose in leaving this technology behind was? For example, in Mass Effect >! the Reapers made the titular technology and the mass relays available because it was easy for them to deal with, compared to other technological paths. !< But other aliens might intend for their successors to receive their technologies as humanitarian aid, or as a way to uplift them into whatever transcended society they've formed, or simply whatever survived the fall of their civilisation. Deciding on that might make it easier to come up with related factories.

With the existing ones, the cheap FTL drives seem like they wouldn't be usable for routine transportation due to that disjunction effect. Instead, I imagine they'd mainly be used as transport for exploration craft far enough from anyone else that the disjunction wouldn't cause problems. If they're cheap enough, they might also be used on planetary surfaces as an alternative to conventional methods of escaping the gravity well, as such a short distance would mean that they could be used more often, but that would be vulnerable to disruption from someone jumping a longer distance.

In addition to use by couples or parents wanting a closer emotional connection with their loved ones, the empathic implants might also see use by co-pilots, spacewalk buddies, and other pairs of workers in jobs that involve close proximity and require a high degree of teamwork.

I imagine the sublight drives would lead to an infrastructure of energy beamed from solar arrays to fuel most in-system transport. The arbitrary 1s, 100m, and 0.1c values might be used as measurement standards. Also, the movement is a minimum of 0.1 light-seconds, which is about the same as the distance between the earth and the moon. That might make lunar colonies more viable.
