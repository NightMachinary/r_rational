I've been kicking around a little SciFi concept lately and wanted to get some feedback.

The setting has a vaguely moderate-future level of extrapolateable technology, mostly in the biosciences, available, along with some degree of excellence in reactor technology (fission, fusion, and antimatter). The setting also has a smattering of what are understood to be ancient alien factories, still operating; stick raw materials in the input, get the preprogrammed output.

One of these factories makes sublight drives. Attach this drive to a conductive metal, hit it with photons or the right kind of energetic particles, and whatever contiguous metal it's attached to plus a radius of 100m out moves in the direction you hit it at exactly .1c without any inertial effects once it's built up enough energy for one second of motion. (Think of it as a perfect capacitor. It's not an infinite-energy device.) These pretty much never break, so acquiring one is trivial (we're talking less than a million bucks in today's dollars, available in whatever quantity you desire) but powering it is obviously not.

Another factory makes single-shot FTL jump drives. These create a disjunction to FTL travel at both the source and destination which increases exponentially based on how far you travel. As a standard, if you jump a light year, you generate two bubbles of this disjunction; at the center of each bubble it's impossible to jump out for two years, and the duration decreases as you travel in any direction until there's no effect two light-years out. That said, the mass of the ship is completely irrelevant; there's volume limits, you can't move a planet, but you can move cubic kilometers by the hundreds for sure, possibly by the thousands. These are, similarly, extremely cheap and available.

There's a factory that makes paired ... something between a cranial jack / implant and a headset. Wear them for long enough and you start being able to feel the emotions of the person wearing the pair when they're in range (very short, maybe as little as 10ft), to the limit of that person's attunement.

What other kinds of neat alien technology might exist that would fit into this mold? What neat things can you think of (that aren't war), or consequences that jump out at you about these pieces of tech?
