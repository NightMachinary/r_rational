Re: your last point, kinda gives the premise a very shaky foundation. If nearly everything is sentient then why should humans set different standards than everyone else? Just increasing living standards should be enough. Maybe it could be figured out which animals cause the least suffering in what they eat and those could be farmed.

Why no nuts or seeds? Can you still eat seeds as part of something else, like a strawberry?

Algae vats would be viable if the infrastructure already exists.

There's going to be a weird intermediary period where people have to keep eating sentient life, that'll be interesting.
