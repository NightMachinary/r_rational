I can see a few 'ethical eating' communities forming around high-level spellcasters, but I can't see this sort of thing catching on beyond that. (The communities themselves will be short-lived, because they - for obvious reasons - collapse almost instantly once the spellcaster dies or leaves them).

Some of them will be pretty much cults - and the spellcasters will often require heavy fees (up to and including "everything you own"). The result of this is that said communities would probably be looked down on by the wider world.
