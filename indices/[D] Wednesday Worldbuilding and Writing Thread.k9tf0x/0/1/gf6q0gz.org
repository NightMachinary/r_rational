I'm gonna be honest, this scenario seems like an existential nightmare. Given that it was the case, I can only imagine that the response of many people, rather than to find ways around the murder/mass slaughter of thousands or millions of sapients, would be to deny that sapience in the first place, or ignore/purposefully try not to think about it (considering that's a common enough way of tackling sources of existential dread in our world, as far as I'm aware). I mean, there's already plenty of human death in our world which could theoretically be avoided with minimal to moderate changes to lifestyle (for example, everyone decides to research diamond companies so that they can avoid buying blood diamonds), but... it's not the case that people do that. Because there's too much suffering to tackle every bit of the problem with alterations to lifestyles. Outrage fatigue plays a part in this, and I can only imagine that it must be more prevalent in this created world as well.

But let's presume that people still try their best, because I like the optimistic spin, and happy stories make me happy. Stone and its derivatives (concrete, metal from ore, and so on) seem relatively okay, with the initial problem being the initial harvest. One work around the 'wood is immoral to harvest/farm' issue could be a funeral culture of harvesting the bodies of the dead so that they may provide in death as they did in life. Animals have their meat eaten and their bones turned into glue, trees have their wood forged into tools and houses, and so on, but this is treated very respectfully, perhaps with a culture of 'death-smiths' and related profession surrounding it. Most of these products would presumably be rare, valuable, and precious to their owners on a sentimental level.

Coral reefs could theoretically be a source of concrete and decoration, if I remember correctly. They're made of polyps, which while animals, /might/ be vermin depending on how you define it. If that is the case, then coral reefs could be an excellent source of material, and potentially dye? I'm not sure if dyes can be garnered from them, but if it is the case, then that might work.

Silk would be even more valuable than normal. Not only can it be farmed entirely from 'vermin' creatures (silk-worms) but if you altered their diet a bit, you could have them be fungivores or carnivores. Interestingly, with the distinctions you make between vermin and larger animals, the existence of carnivorous insects is more moral than the existence of herbivorous ones (since while herbivorous insects eat the sapient plants, the carnivorous insects only eat the non-sapient herbivorous insects, with a few exceptions). This would have an interesting effect on the cultural perceptions of some of these vermin compared to earth, I think - caterpillars and butterflies being seen as sinful, empty plagues, while spiders are more of a heroic defence system by the earth to defend its inhabitants. Tailor this to your personal choice, of course, but I think it's an interesting route to explore.

Fuel is a tricky one. If you have magic, then maybe an 'eternal flame' style of spell could be used, to burn without the need for wood or charcoal. It also creates the interesting aesthetic of towns clustered around magical fires, while living in the wilderness is immoral or dangerous depending on the individual. Perhaps government wizards go around fruit orchards, fungi fields, or insect farms on the outskirts of the nation to provide newly built settlements additional flames as required. This, of course, makes a lot of assumptions about your magic system, but I can't imagine an easy non-magical method off the top of my head, save for perhaps some strange flammable algae I'm not aware of.

Shelter is an important note. Because it's so much harder to produce morally, I could certainly see more communal housing being a thing. Also, perhaps cave homes? I can imagine people taking over natural caverns as a community and then civilising them, hobbit hole style, to reduce the need for building materials.

That's all I can think of right now, but I hope it helps you build this terrifying experience!
