Sentience doesn't automatically imply wanting to live (or any other sort of worldviews for that matter). I mean enough sentient people have committed suicide, and I'm sure there's enough people and/or cults that aren't as fussed about death as most (just look for mass suicides through history for the low-hanging fruit I guess). I mean enough major religions exist where eternal suffering and torture for large swathes of people is a core belief as well.

I think you overestimate how much such a world would have different actions, it would likely just have different ethical justifications with a higher tolerance for more brutal punishments like torture, maiming and execution (which have all cropped up plenty in history anyway).

Edit: I was going to talk more about sentient plants/animals being accepting of death specifically as an example, that was the worldview point, but distracted myself with the other points.

Also random thought, but a parody isekai where all the plants are extreme masochists who talk constantly about wanting to be devoured would be a hilarious one-shot.
