I would balance that against her tendency to take drastic and impulsive action (like robbing a heavily armed client on a whim) and her general disinterest in thinking ahead. She had more experience dealing with the elite of Dul Karagi than any of the other Damadzus--she was their sales agent, after all--but didn't even think that some of them might be indignant enough to retaliate after Ram's disrespect at the meeting. I think her experiences have led her to a way of life--audacious, adaptive, and improvisational--that works for her more often than it doesn't, and can usually be salvaged in the latter case, but comes with significant costs. Certainly her perspective balances Ram's.
