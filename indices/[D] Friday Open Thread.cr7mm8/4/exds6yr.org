I'm considering starting a Rationality group in Copenhagen. I've contemplated doing street epistemology as a way of recruiting people to a meetup. Practically that'll look like talking to random people on the street, asking them about a belief and digging into it, and then inviting the subset of people that seems like they are able to change their mind. Is there any downfalls to this that I'm failing to see?
