I don't know if I can recommend a book, but I had techniques that I used when I was in high school to develop lucid dreaming, which I think were ripped from a website on the early web. There are just two steps.

1. Set a timer for every fifteen minutes, or some other interval
2. When the timer goes off, try to do things that aren't possible in the real world.

What these things are is up to you. Mine were:

- Look at a clock and try to read the time, which is typically difficult to do when you're in a dream.
- Attempt to levitate.
- Attempt to use telekinesis.
- Look at writing and make sure that it makes sense.

The idea is that eventually you will have the habit of trying these things ingrained into you, and you'll try them in your dreams, whereupon they will actually work, and you'll then be lucid dreaming.

This worked for me, to the point where I was lucid dreaming roughly every other night. I never really had the purity of control that I wanted though, and I kind of stopped doing the daytime exercises, which lapsed me back into normal dreams.

I've heard that keeping a dream journal also helps, but never really tried that.
