Thank you for that and it sounds like I was doing some similar stuff without realizing.

I constantly wake up in the middle of the night and check the alarm clock to make sure I didn't oversleep for my new job, and the semi-lucidity started around the same time. When I started keeping a dream journal for interesting dreams, my dreams became more vivid and I remembered them better after waking up.

Thanks for the advice.
