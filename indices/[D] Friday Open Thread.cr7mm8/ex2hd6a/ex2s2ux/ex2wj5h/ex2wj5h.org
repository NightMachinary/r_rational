  if there's been a decrease in the number of subcultures or frequency in which they pop up, that's simply due to the fact that our generally more permissive culture makes subcultures less insular because it's less socially objectionable to share even our more obscure hobbies with the world at large.

Isn't that the author's thesis? That subcultures that are less insular and therefore get invaded by MOPs die?
