I've noticed there are people who engage in forums and don't contribute meaningfully, they just bleed away the energy with ill-considered objections... My term for them is forum barnacles. It's a kind of mop, I guess. Not quite like the trolls that try to infuriate people into more stimulating discussions with clever misunderstandings and whatnot, but more like a weaponized uncreative and uninsightful perspective that makes you want to go /elsewhere/ to have your interesting discussion with people that actually /get/ it.
