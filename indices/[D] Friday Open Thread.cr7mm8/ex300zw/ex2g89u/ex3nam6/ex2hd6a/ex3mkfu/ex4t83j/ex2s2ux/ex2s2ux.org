I generally agree with the authors outline of a subculture's evolution (with the caveat that it's an oversimplification and ignores cyclical waves of popularity, subculture splintering, subculture mutation, and subculture aggregation), but strongly disagree with both their assertion that subcultures died in 2000, and disagree with the reason they give for the death of subcultures as a whole (and also disagree with the limited form of the statement-- that the reason they posited lead to a reduction in the number of subcultures.)

Number one, plenty of subcultures popped up after 2000, with goths and hipsters being some of the most obvious. Meanwhile, you have plenty of "old" subcultures still alive and thriving-- furries, otaku, fighting game nerds, model train fanatics, etc. Number two, if there's been a decrease in the number of subcultures or frequency in which they pop up, that's simply due to the fact that our generally more permissive culture makes subcultures less insular because it's less socially objectionable to share even our more obscure hobbies with the world at large.
