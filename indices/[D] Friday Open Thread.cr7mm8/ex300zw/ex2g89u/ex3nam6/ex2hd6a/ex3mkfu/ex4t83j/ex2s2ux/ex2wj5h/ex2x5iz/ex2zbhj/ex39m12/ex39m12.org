Maybe [[/u/GaBeRockKing]] is saying something like:

Because our culture is more permissive, rather than people segregating into new communities based on their weird interests, they are able to participate in their hobbies and associate with similar people while remaining part of the "mainstream community".

It's not that the MOPs are coming in and destructively exploiting the communities, it's that fewer communities are forming in the first place. Instead you have much looser associations among similarly-hobbied people, and the lack of a tightly-bound community makes it harder for MOPs to extract value in the first place.
