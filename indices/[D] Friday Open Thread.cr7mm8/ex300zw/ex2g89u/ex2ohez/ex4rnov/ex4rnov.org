I have, I think, had a lucid dream once, although the way I got there was not the method I usually see described, which involves being in a dream and then noticing it. Rather I was fully aware as I transitioned from being awake into the dream.

This was years ago, when I was a sleep-deprived college student. Back then, I had a tendency of lying down in the middle of the afternoon and briefly slipping into a sleep paralysis/half-asleep thing, which was usually accompanied by a buzzing sound and weak visual experience, and where I was fully aware. One time, though, the experience was extremely vivid and I flew around on a dragon or something.
