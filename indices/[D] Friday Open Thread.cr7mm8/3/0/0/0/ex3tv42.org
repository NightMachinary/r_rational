No, I mean people that are actually uninsightful. Like, actual logical mistakes that you can verify with minimal effort. Like [[https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=48773.msg1979818#msg1979818][this one]], from a thread I haven't participated in. The guy assumed that aluminum being non-magnetic was a problem, but the issue had already been discussed up-thread. There were even youtube videos demonstrating the principle. The issue isn't that he misunderstood the nature of aluminum, though, it's the way he chose to express that misunderstanding. He tried to make the OP seem like an idiot.
