I don't have a book, but here are the tricks that have worked for me. It takes practice, it's tough not to wake yourself up once you've realized you're asleep. I would say I lucid dream about once a month, and maybe every other time is for any appreciable duration.

- Reality checks: probably the single most useful trick I know. These are actions you take often enough that they become habitual, and that have different results depending on whether you're awake or dreaming. (They're also what the totems from Inception are based on.) The one that works best for me is pinching my nose and trying to breathe through it. If I'm awake, the air is blocked; if I'm asleep, my body is still breathing, so I'll be able to inhale through my blocked nose. If I can breathe through my nose while pinching it, I know I'm dreaming. Other reality checks include reading text or a clock (they're garbled and nonsensical in dreams) and looking in the mirror (your face will move/not be your face). 90% of the time when I lucid dream it's because I twigged to a reality check. The other 10% of the time it's things like realizing that I've already graduated college and don't have to worry about this class that I've never heard of--kind of a reality check brought about by the dream itself instead of by my conscious mind within the dream.

- Dream journals are very helpful, mainly so you get a better idea of what your dreams feel like. I've kept one on and off over they years, never all that consistently. I could probably lucid dream more if I was better about it, but not keeping one doesn't prevent me from doing it.

- Dream anchors. This is related to the journal, though it's never worked for me. The idea is to find an object, image, symbol etc. that appears frequently in your dreams, so when you see it you know you're asleep. I'm not sure if I just don't dream this consistently, or if my lack of dedication to the journal prevented me from finding one, but I've never noticed anything consistent enough to work.

The other thing to keep in mind is that, even when you're stably lucid, you're not omnipotent (or at least, I never have been). I always try to fly first, and it takes a /lot/ of effort and focus to get going. I've also tried things like producing sparks or holographic images from my hands, which flat-out didn't work. I think this is also a matter of practice. Flying used to be almost impossible for me; the last few times I've tried, it's been hard but doable. As yet, I haven't been able to do much except for fly, but that's fun enough that I'm happy to practice it while I try other stuff.
