Personally I don't think that even an oath on the Styx would convince the gods to get rid of death altogether or let everyone into Elysium. Percy's very existence quite handily proves that while there are consequences, gods can and will break those oaths, eventually. But they might accept something like “let everyone in Asphodel into Elysium / scrap Asphodel and just have Elysium and the Fields of Punishment / make Asphodel as great as Elysium, or at least better by removing the dementia.” Etc.
