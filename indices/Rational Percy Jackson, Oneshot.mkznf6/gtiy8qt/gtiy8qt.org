Wishing to end death wouldn't make sense here, he knows there's life after death and he was told what ending death would mean, it was used as a threat, not something to wish for, stuff like universal immortality and invulnerability would probably be out of their power and have difficult to predict consequences even if they did manage it. Having them improve Asphodel Meadows would probably be it, he was even lamenting it's state earlier in the book if I remember right, Hades wanted that too but couldn't due to barely managing the logistical difficulties of the modern death rate as it was.
