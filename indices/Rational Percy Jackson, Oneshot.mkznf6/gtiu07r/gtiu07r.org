Does this work, I wonder? Like, in theory, all this means is telling Thanatos that he's unemployed now, right, and making an enemy(?) of Hades. But given Percy Jackson now exists in a world with multiple pantheons, can Olympus end all death? I suppose "all deaths under their purview," which if I understand it correctly is most of western civilization, is still a great start in any case.

I'd have to reread the bit about when Thanatos was captured in one of the Heroes of Olympus books, and the descriptors of who, exactly, goes to the Greek and Roman underworlds.
