It wouldn't work and it doesn't make sense. Technically everyone is immortal they just go live somewhere else. So really Death is just a one way teleportation machine. Also the Egyptian gods exist as well and I'm not sure what they'll say about that. Finally, if this was rational they would have to contend with the Abrhamic God, who 3 billion people actively believe in. Not sure what the Greek gods are going to do about that.
