Theory: There is a Yahweh but it's ideas are so general, contradictory and generic that it all averages out to a sort of plain white, lacking the individuality that allows "smaller" gods to act. In theory YAWH can do more than any other god but only ever does so once in a blue moon when something polarizes the whole YA-range into a particular course of action.
