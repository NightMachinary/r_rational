That's how I remember it too, they change along with their archetypes, like I think Zeus wears a three piece suit now because western civilization's cultural idea of highest authority has shifted to be more CEO or politician than king or emperor. Not being worshipped is inconvenient to Poseidon but I suspect if people stopped respecting the sea that could have deeper effects. I find how the Greek and Roman gods aren't exactly seperate or the same people very interesting. I think gods are no more individuals than civilizations are distinct or natural forces are seperate. I think there might not be a single simple mechanism underpinning the gods in this setting
