Yes, it's not really clear how it works. I agree that it doesn't sound as straightforward as "the gods keep existing as long as people believe in them". I think it might be more like that the Greek-Roman gods keep existing because western society embodies in some way the continuation of the values that their civilisation represented - not in religious terms, but in cultural ones. However even if you see the gods as "memetic personifications", so to speak (after all, they have remained important figures in artistic allegory even throughout the middle ages and Renaissance, for example), then you would still have to acknowledge also the huge importance of Christianity in defining western culture. Unless you see Christianity as really repackaged Platonism which almost immediately lost most of its connections to the philosophical contents of Hebraism right away. But obviously it's all waaaay too simplistic, cultures aren't linear processes, they intertwine and mix all the time.

I know there are other series in the same universe featuring other sets of gods, but I haven't read them. I read the Percy Jackson series recently, more out of curiosity than anything (though I have to be fair, I found the books pretty "childish", as in, not only mainly YA in target demographic, but kinda hard to enjoy as a grown up), and all I thought was that I was actually surprised this is not brought up often as politically problematic. Because "western civilisation is a cultural monolith with a direct, clear and outright divine connection tracing its way from the greatness of Athens and Rome to the modern USA" sure sounds like... something. Something that would be very easy to interpret in rather nasty ways.
