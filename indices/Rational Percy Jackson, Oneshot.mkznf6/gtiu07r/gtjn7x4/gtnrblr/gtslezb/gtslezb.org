Does it say anywhere that gods get power from belief? I might be misremebering since it's been years since I read those books but like I have the strong impression that's not how it seems to work. Belief affects the gods in some way but doesn't seem like it actually gives them power.

Plus doesn't seem like the abrahamic God actually exists in the setting. And if he exists he might just have some set of choosen teenagers somewhere fighting demons or whatever and have a base somewhere that isn't new york. Also what we see seems consistent whith weird incomprensible alien entities that for whatever reason interact whith certain chosen ones through the lens of ancient religions and mythologies for whatever reason whith somewhat complicated rules.
