Nobody dying is different from what the threat in PJO was. The threat in PJO was basically ghosts because no afterlife repairs. Frankly, this makes little sense anyways though. Death being bad is a thing because it's a complete fucking end. People on PJO don't ever die, they just switch from body to ghost. Maybe that's not the greatest, but it's certainly not death.

The Greek builder, daedalus from one of the books, cheated death by making automaton bodies. When he finally 'died' he ended up as a major construction builder for the underworld's roads and stuff. That's not death, that's literally the next great adventure.

In the PJO universe, death stopping is a bad thing because it means everybody is stuck a ghost in the real world, where they can't do shit. Of course that's horrible. Death continuing means everybody gets a semi-fair afterlife. Guaranteed. That's fucking amazing considering just how /human/ the Greek/Roman gods can be.

As for the author's answer, i'm pretty sure making everyone a god falls under the list of 'not within their power'. It may also actually break the setting. Gods rely on human worship to exist. Humans don't require shit to continue. It's a very one-sided relationship and the gods know it. It's a cause of some of the drama in that series.
