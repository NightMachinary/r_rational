I'd feel like that's probably not within their power. Obviously that's not a well defined limit but it feels like too much, based on both scale of the number of gods (3-4 digits?), tropes, and the vague notion that belief is relevant to the power of the gods.

Improving the underworld is less punchy and less explicitly transhumanist but more realistic for this setting, imo. Not that I think we've ever got a good look at the Fields of Asphodel.
