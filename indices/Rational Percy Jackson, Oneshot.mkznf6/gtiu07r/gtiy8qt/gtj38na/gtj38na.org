Nice. Though I had to read through Annabeth's dialogue twice to realize what she was referring to.\\
Though, I feel like this will very much do the whole Greek tragedy thing, whether due to the borderline narrative energy the universe runs on in PJ or due to completely normal problems with the wish.\\
If he's wishing for everyone who dies to go to Elysium: That avoids a lot of problems in the living-world that a sudden change like this would have. Might run into issues with heroes/gods who don't particularly like having people go to their hero paradise.\\
If he's wishing for no one to die anymore: (Assuming the gods avoid completely being dicks by doing the 'classic' they continue aging forever). He would probably want to also help start some change once people realize they stop aging. Hades would not like this. He might think its a plot by other gods to weaken him, it would be like saying that the seas must be dried up (or perhaps, all life in them destroyed) for Poseidon.

If he's wishing for all the dead to come back and no more death: Same issues as above. You also get the complete breakdown as so many people come into being along with all the other societal issues seeing the dead come back would cause.

So, I think the best option would be to go for the "Elysium for everyone" route. Life still have issues though, and based on Annabeth's conversation I think he'd choose one of the other methods. Though, for any of these you may run into the issues of it literally not being within the god's powers, or being within them but having other catastrophic metaphysical consequences.
