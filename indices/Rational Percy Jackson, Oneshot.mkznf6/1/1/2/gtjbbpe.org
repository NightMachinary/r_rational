I've only got that article and half-remembered English/Literature classes with me here, but I don't think Death of the Author is as relevant on any work with an edit button. If an author has a will and a way to improve or clarify a story, why not use it? Arguments against post-release changes of media (which I'd like to point out aren't made nearly as often in the newer medium of video games, despite the overlap of form), like director's cuts, seems like people rationslising a defeatist attitude towards the commercialisation of media, pessimism towards the broad reach of modern communication, and inertia from previous limits on changing a single work passed down from the experiences of teachers to a different world that the students inhabit.

Edit: I can't imagine having to reread my comments, like this one, without being able to remove typos after I post it since mobile browsers are ass. I'm up to 4 edits right now.

Also, I'm certain the jump from typewriters to computers had people lamenting the ability to delete typos rather than push through, that seems a thematically relevant argument for drawing comparisons.
