Yeah I was more going on vague memories about the other series .Seems to me that the justifications the gods give to the children are basically bullshit and what's going on is way weirder and complicated.

Like even only taking into account Percy's adventures gods have roman versions that are kind of similar and manage completely separate masquerades(which involved tons of lying) .\\
And lots of pretty much dead old religions are real too and also kind of centered on usa.

It is an interesting setting to take seriously and make into a ratfic though.If you try to make sense of all the weirdness.
