There's no indication that the abrahamic God is real in that universe. Or that belief creates gods. A lot of old religions and mythologies seem to be true, and something causes teenagers to interact whith diferent ones. And like it seems there's some mechanism that causes diferent people, (mainly teenagers) to have special powers and percieve the stuff of diferent religions.

Everyone else only gets to see an afterlife which is kind of determined by belief but seems like the belief thing is a perception filter over whatever is actually there. And there's similarly something weird whith multiple groups claiming the have caused some of the same historical events if I'm not mistaken but I might be misremebering.
