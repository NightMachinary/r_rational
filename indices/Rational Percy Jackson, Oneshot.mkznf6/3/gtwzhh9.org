This is one of those places where the common rational fiction trope of "defeating death" runs into a brick wall headfirst.

Percy Jackson exists in a world where the Afterlife has been confirmed to exist (he even visits in the First Book, and there are characters - the children of Hades - who can enter and leave the Underworld at will), and reincarnation is an actual thing souls can choose to do.

It would be far more beneficial (and be far less complex for the living world) for Percy to ask the gods to make the afterlife more human friendly. Maybe replace the Punishment place with a rehabilitation center? Make reincarnation a choice any soul can make at any time, instead of one time offer? Something like that.
