*Cultivation magic:* If you can carry around your vine-tentacles, that seems to diminish the importance of having your own guarded plot of land. What about if the core of this type of magic is a ritual that allows the creation of sympathetic links between plants? You'd have your garden back home which is set up and carefully maintained to provide optimum growing conditions, and when you're out and about you carry more portable seeds. When you activate the sympathetic link, the seeds can draw on the energy and nutrients of the linked plants in the garden for explosive growth.

The diversity of options in this system could either come from the rare plants used (heat-seeking vines, acid-producing flytraps, explosive seedpods) or from other aspects of the sympathetic link (sharing damage between your living moss shirt and the oak in your garden).

This would mean that losing your garden would be an immediate blow to your abilities, as you'd have to make do by creating links with whatever plants are in your surroundings.

*Blight magic:* In terms of ancillary powers, perhaps there could be a degree of control over what happens to the blighted biomass? For example, if you blight a tree, perhaps you can control how the wood warps as it dies, and use that to twist it into useful shapes. If you blight a fruit, you might be able to have it ferment as it rots. If you blight a harvest, you could have the stems and bran disintegrate to dust to be blown away, leaving just the grain ready to be milled without threshing. This would lead to blight mages being very useful in industry, and there could be some fun thematic links between the insatiability of the magic and of the industries it supports.

As for the blight biosphere, I'd be tempted to instead have blight magic be so ruinous that it forces the local ecology to start from scratch with pioneer species like lichen that don't need soil. If an area sees regular blighting, the lichen will be common and the process won't take too long, but if you blight an area of old growth where the pioneer species have been outcompeted by successor species for miles around, you could have an eerie rocky clearing persist for centuries.

*Wild magic:* Cultivation magic obviously encourages a static existence, while blight magic has to constantly seek fresh biomass as its demands grow. What about if wild magic exists between the two, as something that entails a long-term nomadic existence?

Perhaps they could link themselves to trees and other plants, like dryads. They could gain sustenance and strength from each link based on the health of the plant, perhaps even agelessness. If links are easy to create but provide little benefit individually, that would encourage both a roaming existence to establish as many links as possible and optimising the health of each plant. If the number of links a plant can sustain is limited, that would limit the size of wild mage groups. Lastly, if there's a baseline level of health or biomass below which the link becomes harmful for the mage, that means they would focus on old growth trees and be unable to survive in less mature ecosystems.

In terms of their ecological role, I'm envisaging wild mages as something like apex predators. They benefit the biosphere by helping the plants past local optima, clearing trees of parasitic species and so on, because they benefit from the maximal energy use.

I think these factors would lead to wild mages being feral ageless loners roaming the deep forests, caring for the trees but striking at intruders or other wild mages with super strength and endurance. If their nomadic circuits last on the scale of decades or centuries, they would seem unpredictable to the shorter-lived merchants and travellers of the cities.
