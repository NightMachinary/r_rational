Contract magic allows people to make magically binding contracts both with others. Contracts with others allow magical consequences, including lethal ones, when one party breaks the contract. Contracts with self allows one to make personal sacrifices, including stuff like vows of poverty, to increase some of their abilities or skills by a margin depending on the strength of the sacrifice. Contract naturally follows the letter rather than the spirit of a contract. A full and correct understanding of a contract must be had for a contract to work. Contracts have to be entered voluntarily, they cannot be entered through coercion but can be entered in through manipulation.

How would you expect a society in which contract magic would be?
