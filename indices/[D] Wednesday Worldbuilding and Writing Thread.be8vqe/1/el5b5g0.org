Still working on the land of rampant plant growth. I think I've got things divided out more or less how I want them in terms of people and how they interact with the environment, and most of the biomes I think are neat/cool: trees stretching up to the skies with canopy coverage so complete that it's nearly pitch black at the bottom, mangrove swamplands that desperately claw more and more sediment in to make new lands, thick jungles where massive herbivores mow through the biomass almost as fast as it's made, a symbiotic swampland where the ground can't support trees and so everything is constantly growing over and building on what's beneath.

The plantlife needs water, sunlight, and other nutrients to grow, even if it's just a matter of activating the inherent magic of the world to get supergrowth. But if there's magic /there/, then why not magic in other places? Why not two or three other, human-centric magic systems that serve to either explore or enhance the setting? Here's what I've got:

- *Cultivation magic:* Unrelated to the xianxia concept. Growing some specific species of plants gives you the ability to tap into their magic and use it for various purposes, mostly related to command and control of plantlife and hypergrowth. A cultivation mage might have prehensile vines connected to a pot on his back, or he might depend on utilizing the plantlife that's all around him, whether that's for mundane utility like growing things, or changing the terrain in combat. Some of the specifics of this (and the use cases) need to be hammered out a little bit. The intent is that every cultivation mage has his own farm/orchard, or possibly a bonsai collection, in a world where space needs to constantly be defended and is at a premium. One method of attacking a cultivation mage is then to attack his base of power, which can be difficult. Attracts meticulous managers. Might need a different name. (Also thinking about what aspects the cultivation might require, like making bonsai or otherwise sculpting the plants to grow into specific shapes, similar to writing runes, but with a living thing.)

- *Blight mages:* Blight mages get their power from the biomass, sucking it dry in order to fuel their destructive magic. There's a bit of a feedback loop to this, as destruction of biomass makes it easier for more biomass to be destroyed. Balancing that out is a decay function for the magic which increases as power increases, until eventually there's no possible way for the blight mage to keep up with the drain. Secondarily, one of the costs for an initiated blight mage is that they have a continual and increasing baseline level of magic for subsistence, which is modulated by highest magic used. After 10 years, a typical blight mage will have to start devoting more and more time to simply having enough magic to live, and once they fall below their baseline (an inevitability), they will die. Blight mages are therefore useful for their ability to quickly kill plant life, but a blight mage also has a limited shelf-life. Ancillary powers are TBD, but effects beyond mere blight seem like they would be interesting, so long as I can keep them in theme. Exact effects of blight TBD, though it might be neat to have a separate blight biosphere that arises from plantlife and microbes that specialize in eating blighted biomass.

- *Wild mages:* This one I'm a little stuck on. If cultivation magic is a farming analog, and blight magic is a destruction analog, then I'd like for a third magic to be a magic of the old growth forests, places untouched by human hands, etc. How that's specifically manifested though ... that's hard to say in terms of what it costs, who can use it, and what it's capable of doing. As far as the former goes, biospheres are in a constant attempt to make the maximal use of energy (in this case, including magic), so maybe the wild mage benefits in some way from an environment that's at or close to biological equilibrium. They're naturally at odds with blight mages (who would burn the old growth down), with cultivation mages (who want to have everything ordered), and with civilization in general (which probably has designed on that land). As for what they can do ... I kind of like the idea that they get access to the same powers that make the biosphere grow, like light, water, air, and earth, but that might make them too close to a generic elemental mage. I also like the idea of them circumscribing an area that's "theirs", which might lead to them being naturally territorial and having to fight back against incursions. Kind of like a park ranger. Going through the pitch-black woods is /dangerous/, not just because of the darkness, but because there's sure to be a wild mage whose attention you really don't want.

- *Other magic:* I think three primary systems is good enough, but most of my favorite works just go absolutely nuts with magic. The trick is doing things that are allowed to be more "niche" than the main three, magics that can exist in the obscure corners of the world rather than being lynchpins of society. Might work more on that later, but symbiosis, photosynthesis, parasitism, spores, clonal organisms, grafts, biodiversity, etc. are all jumping off points.
