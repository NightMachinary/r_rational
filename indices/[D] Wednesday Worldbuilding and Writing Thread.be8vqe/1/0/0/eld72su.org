Great stuff. My current thinking is that a cultivation mage has a carefully structured feng shui garden where individual selectively bred and crafted plants feed magical energy into each other through in complicated arrangements that eventually lead to that energy being connected to the mage, who can use it out in the world. I suppose my mind is going to circuit board designs or efficient algorithm solving, where the cultivation mage is attempting to pack as many plants as efficiently as possible in one area while maintaining their links to each other and sculpting trees/bushes for maximum throughput or generation. Prehensile vines on the back are then just a useful application of that energy.

(The gardens and plants of the cultivation mage should be immaculately manicured, taking some inspiration from bonsai, but on a larger scale and more detail, aesthetic mostly because the energy pathways encourage symmetry and elaborate, emergent patterns.)
