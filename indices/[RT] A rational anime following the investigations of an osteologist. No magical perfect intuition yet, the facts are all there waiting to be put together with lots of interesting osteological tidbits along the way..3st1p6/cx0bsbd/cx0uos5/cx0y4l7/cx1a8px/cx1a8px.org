I my opinion the main cause for such descriptions is the same as how people can't seem to differentiate between "good story" and "story i enjoyed". similarly people just take it a step further and think "i like rational stories", "i like this anime\book\fic" = > "this anime\book\fic is rational".

I do think that in most ways the list of defining elements, which is on the side, that make up "rational" stories(especially the first two) would occur naturally in like 90% of well written stories, though some of them are not mandatory. so there is some value in the distinction between well written, and rational.
