Yeah, I get that feeling more and more. First there was HPMoR, and it made me want a name for fiction that demonstrated and taught the critical approach Harry had to the world, and the consequences of it. I think "rational(ist)" was originally intended to capture that, but then people started coming up with explanations why their favourite authors were actually writing rational fiction, and it's become little more informative than "realistic fiction".

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationaly and The Origin of Species are the two fics I consider "rational(ist)" (though I'm sure there must be some I've simply not read), and I'd do away with the whole "rational" category as too nebulous, instead specifying "munchkinism" or "transhumanist themes" or what have you.
