Granted I only watched like 2 episodes of this, but I can hardly call this anime rational.

Sure there's some interesting trivia regarding bones. But the show is basically "sherlock holmes" if he was a young(ish) woman which instead of actually being a detective(with knowledge in a very wide set of fields ) was a osteologist, so needed much more convenient cases so as to give the MC a particular edge.

And by episode 2 they were already resorting to DEUS EX [[#s][episode 2]]
