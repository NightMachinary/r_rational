  For example, I would consider a soldier who killed dozens for his country to be more moral than a beggar who kills a single known criminal to steal his money. The beggar could be killing the worst criminal to ever live for his money to survive, but I would still consider the beggar to be committing an immoral action. The soldier is following a predetermined, necessary mandate to serve his country while the beggar is purely serving himself for survival.

The line gets blurrier though. If killing for your country is allowed, what about killing for a company? A company can be a large organization that is similar to a government in many ways. If a soldier following orders from a government to kill is morally exempted, would an assassin hired by a company to kill a rival company's employees be morally exempted? What if the company isn't a large one, but just a small family-run business? Should the size of the company/country even matter? Would soldiers from bigger countries be more morally exempted than soldiers from tiny ones?

If size doesn't matter, then the next gray area is whether an assassin hired by an individual is morally exempted, compared to an assassin hired by a one-man company. In both cases, you're hired by a single person anyway, and ordered by them to kill the same target. So if the latter is morally exempted, so should the former. This boils down to a simple axiom: if you are ordered to murder by literally anyone other than yourself, then you have a moral exemption for that murder.

That doesn't sound right, so we crossed the line somewhere. The question then is, where? There did not seem to be a spot where the line fits, nor did there seem to be a gradient of moral exemption unless its size, which would be really strange.
