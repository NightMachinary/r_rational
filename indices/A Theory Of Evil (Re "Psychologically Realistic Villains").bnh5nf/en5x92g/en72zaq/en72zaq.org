The morality of a soldier fighting for their country depends on the morality of the countries they're fighting for and against. I wouldn't say that a patriot fighting for the sake of Nazi Germany would be moral. In fact, I'd say that they were being actively immoral for fighting for such a clearly unjust cause. When you perform actions at the behest of someone else, you inherit the moral nature of whoever you fight for, whether good or bad, proportional to your contributions to the effort.
