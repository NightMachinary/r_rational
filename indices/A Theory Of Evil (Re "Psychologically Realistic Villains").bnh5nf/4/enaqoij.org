It's wrong on so many levels...

#+begin_quote
  People have an instinctive sense of "fairness" or "justice", which they try to satisfy. ("Natural Law exists.")
#+end_quote

Half of those perceived "Natural Laws" are like: "whatever benefit my family/tribe is fair and just", "political or economical assets should be inherited", "only our traditional way of thinking is ethical" etc

#+begin_quote
  People have difficulty holding two contradictory ideas at once.
#+end_quote

Citizen of any totalitarian state or member of organized religion can say it's assuredly wrong. In fact opposite is true: People have difficulty to make their beliefs to be consistent and not contradicting.

#+begin_quote
  "having another person's suffering as one of your terminal values"
#+end_quote

That is how most of society relate to criminals

#+begin_quote
  "Evil people are malicious. They seek the suffering of another as an end in itself."
#+end_quote

Some religion condemn sinners to eternal suffering.

#+begin_quote
  causing someone suffering for no other reason than because it makes you feel better.
#+end_quote

Revenge, criminals, sinners - most of people subscribe to one of those.

#+begin_quote
  People become evil when their internalized ethics allow malicious behavior.
#+end_quote

Not in real world. In real world people become evil then society allow or encourage it. Stanford prison experiment.

#+begin_quote
  Villains are evil. They were placed in a situation where they believed they had to be cruel
#+end_quote

In reality perceived evilness has more to do with politics or other tribal divides, with minor exception of some out of bound cruelty.

#+begin_quote
  Villains are people. They were just like you,
#+end_quote

They are on other side of some kind of conflict
