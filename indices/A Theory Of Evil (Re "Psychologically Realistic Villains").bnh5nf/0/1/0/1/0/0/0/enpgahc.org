From your previous post:

#+begin_quote
  I'm looking for ways to represent capital-E evil in a rationalist framework - cruelty that /represents an endorsement of the strong ascetic principle./
#+end_quote

From your most recent post:

#+begin_quote
  Postulate: There is some world that is identical to this one in every way, save that [insert your favored group of "bad people"] suffer more.

  If you endorse that this world is better than the current world, /that is an endorsement of the strong ascetic principle./ You believe that /some world exists/ that is better than this one because it contains more suffering.
#+end_quote

​

If cruelty that endorses the strong ascetic principle is capital-E Evil, then, by your most recent definition, anyone who thinks that, say, child molesters deserve the especially ill treatment that they receive in prison, is capital-E Evil, because they're wishing that cruelty onto a specific group of "bad people" that they think deserve it.

Personally, I think that's a horrific thing to wish on /anyone/, but I'd file that kind of urge to punish wrongdoers under "mundane everyday evil" rather than "capital-E Evil."

​

Also, your most recent post seems to be in direct contradiction to:

#+begin_quote
  This isn't about evil that says "You should suffer, because...": this is about evil that says "you should suffer", full stop.
#+end_quote

Either the extra suffering is "deserved" (e.g. happening to "bad people"), in which case there /is/ a "because," and (in my opinion) desiring it doesn't fall under the capital-E Evil you describe...

Or we're back to where I left off in my previous post and I don't see it as being simultaneously compatible with both Natural Law and rationality.
