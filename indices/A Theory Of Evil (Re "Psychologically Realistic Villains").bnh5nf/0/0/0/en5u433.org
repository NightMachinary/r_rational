See my comment above. There's a long long list of reasons and justifications for habitual cruelty: I did not intend my post to be an exhaustive list.

If we're going to be doing this, though, I'll add my own major inciter:

*Spending a long period of time in close contact with someone who reminds you of your own failings.*

We hate few people as much as those who are "like us, but worse." It hurts to see someone else repeating all your mistakes - and it's even worse if you try to help and they /won't listen./ (Because our habitual selves take /training/ to change, regardless of how good of an idea our conscious mind may think an idea is.)
