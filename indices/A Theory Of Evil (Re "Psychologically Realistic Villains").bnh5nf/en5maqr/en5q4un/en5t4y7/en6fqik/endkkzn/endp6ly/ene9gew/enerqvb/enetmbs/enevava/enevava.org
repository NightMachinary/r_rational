As I understand it, the difference between incentive vs. disincentive isn't that the former is positive and the latter is negative; it's that the former encourages a particular action, while the latter discourages the same. So a lottery rewarding those who don't speed is as much a disincentive for speeding as (or, to be honest, probably a /better one/ than) a fine punishing those who do, because both make it less desirable to speed (or, framed another way, both are incentives to stay below the speed limit).
