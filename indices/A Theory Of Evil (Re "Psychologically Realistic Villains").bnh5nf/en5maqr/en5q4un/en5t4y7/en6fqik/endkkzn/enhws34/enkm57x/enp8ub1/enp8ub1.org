You seem to be arguing past me, so let me try and define the strong ascetic principle in more detail for the purpose of formal argumentation:

"There exists a world identical to this one in every way, save that it contains more suffering, and that world is better than this one."

Postulate: There is some world that is identical to this one in every way, save that [insert your favored group of "bad people"] suffer more.

If you endorse that this world is better than the current world, /that is an endorsement of the strong ascetic principle./ You believe that /some world exists/ that is better than this one because it contains more suffering. This does not imply that /all/ worlds that contain more suffering than this one are better than it.
