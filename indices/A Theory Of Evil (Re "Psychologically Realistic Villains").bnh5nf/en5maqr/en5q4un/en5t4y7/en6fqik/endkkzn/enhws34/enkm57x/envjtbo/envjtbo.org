Well, there's plenty of reasons to be that sort of evil. First, you assume there exists a natural aversion towards certain acts, but such a thing would obviously be a genetic feature of our brain and thus subject to mutation. You could have people who simply don't have that check (psychopaths, for example). Then you could have people that /actively work against that check/ until they're desensitised to it and thus end up being free from it (this can go for anyone who gets e.g. overused to violence, from soldiers to butchers. Inflicting suffering onto animals without even flinching can be a good first step to doing the same to humans). The societal expectations and habits drilled into you, the Id part, people could rebel against on purpose, seeing them as shackles imposed onto them by others. Considering that not all social customs are always sensible or rational, this is certainly an example of throwing away the baby with the bath water. Dunno, I can imagine a lot of patterns that don't square neatly into your starting hypotheses.
