Also not mentioning that even the most obvious of blame that can be directly laid upon people, any act done in the moment, will be a "rational act", rationalised by their feelings and thoughts at the moment. No blame from anyone will ever convince them otherwise. Evil and ignorance go hand in hand.

Personally I find evil to be a rather vapid term placed there by opponents and detractors. If you want to see why people do truly evil acts, start with the greatest hero in your life (that isn't yourself, because everyone except depressed people is the hero of their own lives), which would be your mother or father, usually. Imagine every time they've made you feel bad, ask yourself, and then them, how it made them feel. You felt bad, they felt better when yelling at you. They'll tell you they felt bad, but it was necessary. Which is also true, in their eyes. Now imagine how good you feel when you're chewing someone out online or in real life. Then imagine getting a thousand downvotes and negative comments and the feelings of consternation, rage, disappointment. Apply the same feelings to you and your parent, you and your victim,

Escalate that progression of feeling of power and gratification when posting the first post, thinking you'll "win". The "winning", being in power, being right, in control, justified. From the most petty things, all the way until you're the evil villain
