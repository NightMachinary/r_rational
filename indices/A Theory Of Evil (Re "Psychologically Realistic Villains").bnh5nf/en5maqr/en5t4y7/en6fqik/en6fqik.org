What I'm objecting to is not the overall thrust of your post, but a couple of specific lines:

#+begin_quote
  When we act on malicious desires, we call that "cruelty." It's the action of causing someone suffering for /no other reason than because it makes you feel better./
#+end_quote

Cruelty in the name of "justice" is generally /not/ done just for the reason of "because it makes you feel better;" it's done because people think that it will improve the prisoner, or deter crime, or right a cosmic balance, or whatever. Notably, to use the US as an example, "cruel" punishment for prisoners is not outlawed; it's only considered unconstitutional when it's both "cruel and unusual." Which, itself, has the implication that /some/ cruelty in the name of justice /should/ be usual.

#+begin_quote
  When humans do something cruel, we feel guilty - a form of cognitive dissonance. Our sense of justice is at odds with our actions.
#+end_quote

Again, cruelty which is /triggered by a sense of injustice/ generally /doesn't/ make people feel guilty. If someone, for example, gets attacked, they don't usually feel wracked by guilt at the notion of having to use violence to defend themselves. A lot of what goes into justifying cruelty is the idea that whoever the cruelty is directed at /has it coming/. It doesn't /have/ to be habitualized that way.
