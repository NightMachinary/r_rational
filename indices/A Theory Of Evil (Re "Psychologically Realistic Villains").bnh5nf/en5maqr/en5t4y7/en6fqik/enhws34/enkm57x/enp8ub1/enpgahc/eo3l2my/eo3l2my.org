Malice is capital-E Evil, yes. And yes, I do honestly believe that the vast majority of humans have a shard of capital-E Evil in them: if suffering is our ultimate opponent, then every act of cruelty (that is, every act that endorses the Strong Ascetic Principle) gives it a further advantage in a game it's already largely winning.

However, in order for /people/ to be capital-E Evil overall, they have to make cruelty /habitual/ - something they no longer need a justification for. Over long enough periods, "[Group] deserve to suffer because [justification]" reduces down into simply "[Group] deserve to suffer."
