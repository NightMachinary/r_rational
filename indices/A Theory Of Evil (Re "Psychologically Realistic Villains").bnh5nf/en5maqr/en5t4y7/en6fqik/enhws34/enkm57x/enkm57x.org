#+begin_quote
  I'm looking for ways to represent capital-E evil in a rationalist framework - cruelty that /represents an endorsement of the strong ascetic principle./ ("A world identical to this one in every way, save that it contains more suffering, is better than it.")
#+end_quote

That doesn't seem to match what you said in your initial post:

#+begin_quote
  This does not mean that they seek the suffering of /everyone/
#+end_quote

If a rational person thinks that a world with more suffering is better for it, then they would, as a terminal goal, seek the suffering of everyone, just as a rational person who thinks that a world with less suffering is better for it would, as a terminal goal, seek to reduce everyone's suffering.

​

On another note, I don't think that I can accept the premises of "Natural Law exists" and "people can rationally adopt the 'strong ascetic principle'^{1}" as non-contradictory. You'd have to convince me of that idea.

​

That is, I can /totally/ accept rational people thinking that suffering, by its very nature, makes the world better. "Suffering is good" is a value judgement, and the deepest level of values in any person's head has to either be taught or inherited (any rationally derived value has to take the form "A is better than B because X is better than Y, and A implies X, and B implies Y," so there has to be at least one base value of "/this/ is better than /that/" which is not rationally derived). So, if someone believes, in their heart of hearts, that suffering is good (or some equally irrationally-acquired principle from which "suffering is good" rationally follows), that can absolutely be rational.

​

However, you're defining Natural Law as "People have an "instinctive sense of 'fairness' or 'justice.'" That's the base-level value you're imparting onto all human beings: that good things should happen to good people, and bad things should happen to bad people (or, at least, good things should happen proportionately *more* to good people, and the same for bad things and bad people). And that *can't* be rationally reconciled with "a world with more suffering is better" (unless the "more suffering" is distributed "fairly"/"justly" upon those who deserve it more, but that would no longer be "a world identical to this one in every way").

​

Please choose one or the other: that people believe in justice and fairness as an intrinsic, basic value, or that rational people can endorse that a world identical to this one in every way, save that it contains more suffering, is better than this world. Or convince me that the two are compatible.

^{1}I can't find any other reference on the Internet to the term "strong ascetic principle," so I'm going to assume you coined it yourself. I'll adopt it for the sake of this discussion, as you've defined it adequately enough to avoid confusion, but I'd just like to note that I don't accept the definition of "asceticism" as "the reverse of utilitarianism.^{2}"

^{2}I will also note that cruelty as "the action of causing someone suffering for no other reason than because it makes you feel better" /would/ fall under what I would define as "the reverse of asceticism," which is /libertinism/ (trying to maximize /only your own/ pleasure/happiness, at the expense of others' if necessary). Performing cruelty that "makes you feel better" cannot be practicing asceticism, by /any/ reasonable definition of "ascetic."
