I think this is true, but as a fictional trope tends to result in villains who are simply strongly partisan - knights templar and well-intentioned-extremists, who have a first loyalty to some ideal or group and fight ruthlessly to serve it.

I'm looking for ways to represent capital-E evil in a rationalist framework - cruelty that /represents an endorsement of the strong ascetic principle./ ("A world identical to this one in every way, save that it contains more suffering, is better than it.")

This isn't about evil that says "You should suffer, because...": this is about evil that says "you should suffer", full stop.
