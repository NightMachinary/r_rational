Hmm, true, but it was definitely established that he had an instinctive flinch that prevented him from thinking about death to the point where it stopped him from realizing that having 300 horcruxes did not actually offer any additional protection. At least that was Harry's interpretation, and Harry's darkside had such a gargantuan fear of death that it literally crippled his ability to think around dementors. So it's not much of a stretch to say that this influenced his affinity for the killing curse, to the point where he was one of the only people who could cast it without limitations.

(That last bit was also a clever way to make the protagonist and antagonist thematic opposites on Eliezer's part: Harry was the only one who could use the Patronum v2.0, Voldemort was the only one who could use the Killing Curse v2.0.)
