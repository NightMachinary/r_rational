I think you make it sound too much like evil people are rational pursuers of immoral desires. In reality, evil is almost always the result of some form of irrationality. If you ask war criminals if they ever regret their actions, the usual response (like in Dick Cheney's famous interview) is something along the lines of "I don't look back." It's a form of apathy, or a lack of imagination, that stops them from imaging alternative pathways to pursuing their goals, or from seeing their enemies as fully human.

Real evil is almost always banal. Yes, some of the nazi lackeys may simply enjoy cruelty, but like you say that's just lazy writing when it comes to the main villain. The more compelling question in fiction is always "why do good people do bad things" and the answer is almost never "because something bad happened to them in the past". That's Freudian nonsense, or romanticist nonsense, and certainly not what I would expect to see in rational fiction.

Good and evil is not something you learn or unlearn over a matter of decades, but rather something people flip between from one moment to another like flicking a switch. A soldier can fight for his country, see his friend get killed, get enraged and murder a whole family of foreigners, and then go back home to their family like nothing happened. I think that's the main thing that stops writers from writing 'evil' realistically: They think that because the consequences of evil are so terrible, therefore the causes must be equally grand. In reality, a school shooter might butcher all of their classmates because they got a bad grade.

If you want a pure evil villain, you can simply have them be born cruel and instead have the protagonist struggle with the question of how such a thing is even possible, have them wonder what wires need to be crossed for something like that to happen. But if you don't want your villain to be pure evil, you have to give them a blindspot. Give them a bias, an emotional flaw, an instinctive flinch away from the thing they cannot bring themselves to consider. Even HPMOR's Voldemort, who was as close to a pure evil villain as I've seen here, was some combination of the two. He could not bring himself to think of death because he was terrified of it, and that's also why he thought so little of killing others. That kind of flaw is what makes for interesting villains, without making them any less evil.
