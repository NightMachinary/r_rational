It also falls down to what consequences the soldier would suffer for his defection. I frankly can hardly muster much sympathy for people who enlist voluntarily in the army of a certain superpower I will not name these days, as the last decades have vastly shown how "moral" the ends they're likely to be employed for will be. But some poor sob conscripted and dragged to the front lines in WW1 to kill or be shot in the back for insubordination is more of a victim than a culprit to me.
