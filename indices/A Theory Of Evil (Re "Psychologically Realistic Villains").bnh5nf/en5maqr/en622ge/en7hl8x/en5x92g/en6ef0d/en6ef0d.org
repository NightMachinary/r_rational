  the end justify the means
#+end_quote

My personal checklist for "the ends justifying the means" is:

- Are the ends better than the means are bad? (Gross positive outcome)
- Does this hold true when all consequences are taken into effect? (Net positive outcome)
- Am I sure that these means will actually achieve my ends? (Risk of /nothing/ justifying the means)
- Are there any /less harmful/ means that will achieve these same ends? (Minimal intervention)
- Will these actions create a precedent that might case the same means to be used towards the same ends without taking the above into consideration? (Slippery slope analysis)

Generally, the utilitarian analysis above comes out in agreement with the deontological result. For example, I wouldn't support (or conduct) torture to extract information, as it fails on pretty much every point above: it's generally more evil than the goal you're trying to get information to achieve is good; even if it isn't, torture is generally going to make you additional enemies that cancel out any benefit from your stated ends; torture /doesn't work/ to extract accurate information; even if it was effective, there are more effective, more humane ways of obtaining information; and that's the kind of human rights violation that tends to grow a whole bureaucracy built up around perpetuating it.

However, to use an example from the movie /The Dark Knight/: Batman's use of the cell phone sonar is a /horrible/ breach of the trust and the privacy of Gothamites. However, they were focused on their goal, so neither of the people hooked into the system (Lucius or Batman) learned much that would be considered a privacy invasion, and he saved dozens, if not hundreds, of lives by doing it. The only /other/ consequence for doing so was losing the trust of Lucius Fox, which still leaves the action a net positive. It /does/ actually allow Batman to find the Joker and save the lives. No other option for finding the Joker in a reasonable time presented itself. And the system was destroyed afterwards, so it can't be used again under less-justifiable circumstances.

The ends /can/ justify the means; it's just incredibly rare that they would (as evidenced by the /incredibly/ contrived scenario in TDK). As such, I default to deontology most of the time.

  I would consider a soldier who killed dozens for his country to be more moral than a beggar who kills a single known criminal to steal his money.

Funny; I'd be tempted to go in the other direction. The survival instinct is something very strong and hard to override. If someone believed that murder was the only way for him and his family to survive, I'd be inclined to grant that person some moral leeway (not, you know, a /lot/, but enough for me to feel empathy for the person). The soldier, on the other hand, has delegated the moral decisions of whether or not certain people are worth killing to the leader of the country, and heads-of-state are not, by nature, notably moral people. There's a reason why "I was just following orders" is rightly sneered upon as a defense for bad deeds.
