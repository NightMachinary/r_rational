My views/evidence on a few points here:

1: "Fairness" does seem to be encoded very low-level in the mind. Experiments with chimps and gorillas have demonstrated that they get annoyed when you stiff them. It's also one of the "five pillars" of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_foundations_theory][Moral Foundations Theory]], which seems to have a fairly decent evidence base for a social-sciences construct.

If I momentarily adopt Moral Foundations Theory for the sake of argument, I'm saying that "evil" people weight the Care and Fairness axes comparatively too low versus the Authority, Loyalty and Sanctity axes.

2: It /is/ actually possible to train out many reflexes; people training to break boards with their hands have to train out the flinch reaction that people naturally have when their hands impact a solid object.

3: "Is altruism nature or nurture" is a longstanding unsettled question, and as with most nature vs. nurture questions, it seems fairly clear that the answer is "yes."
