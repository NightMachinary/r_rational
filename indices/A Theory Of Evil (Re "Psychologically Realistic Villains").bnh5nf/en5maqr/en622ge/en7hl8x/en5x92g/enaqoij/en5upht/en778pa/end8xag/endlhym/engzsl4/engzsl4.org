I also saw 'premise 5' in another comment just now, which looks to be a rephrasing of the part I'm questioning.

​

I don't want to go to full-blown Quirrelmort levels of pessimism, but I'm suspicious that you are misestimating the amount of selfishness and callous-cruelty (cruelty-for-the-sake-of-cruelty coming under the umbrella of the second line) in a neurotypical human. Specifically, that there's an instinct-level impulse against unfairness.

​

I'm familiar with people in groups acting to punish those who exploit their position, like someone who lets their cow eat more grass than allowed or pulling down a leader who hurts others with abuses of their power (and is also weak enough for a revolution to be successful). However, people suffering throughout their day because of the unfairness that others--not them--are suffering strikes me as the exception, an abnormal case, not the rule.

​

Speaking in benevolent ways and acting in benevolent ways can be taught, as signalling for self-protection. Some keep to this and agree benevolence to be desirable. Some do not, in and in situations where they won't be punished for deviation from this--like school playgrounds or city alleys--they do not keep to this. Past a certain point, I find it to be begging the question to ask 'Why are all these people acting as though they don't have an impulse-against-unfairness, even though they have an impulse-against-unfairness?'. Whether writing off large proportions of the population as neurologically abnormal (in which case, again, once you're writing off over 50% then they're the normal ones and the rest are abnormal), or claiming that they must actually be constantly exerting willpower to resist the urge to Do Good that they would otherwise fall prey to, Occam's Razor questions: is it possible that the strange absence of evidence for an Instinct To Do Good is because [[https://www.schlockmercenary.com/2005-10-09][there isn't one]]?

​

...though it actually might be better to search for primary literature rather than speculating...

​

While speculating, though: It is currently plausible to me that someone without an instinct can condition themselves to think in a certain way as though they have an instinct, with Pavlovian conditioning as an example. To an outside observer, the dog may seem as though it has a built-in instinct to salivate when it hears a bell. However, can you do the reverse and condition someone to act as though they don't have an instinct? Can you get rid of the instinct to jump at a loud noise, or to feel hungry when your energy levels are low, or to sleep when you haven't slept in a long time? Though then one gets into the question of if there's a distinction between instincts and physiological reactions... but for other things that you group together under the term 'instincts', can you train someone not to feel them, or do they have to hold back only-temporarily with difficulty? Are there any at all that can be withstood for a prolonged period of time, and are there any at all that a large portion of the human population lack entirely despite being detectably-strong and present in a large portion of the rest of the population?

That is, 'Is self-sacrificing altruism instinctive or adopted(/learned)'?
