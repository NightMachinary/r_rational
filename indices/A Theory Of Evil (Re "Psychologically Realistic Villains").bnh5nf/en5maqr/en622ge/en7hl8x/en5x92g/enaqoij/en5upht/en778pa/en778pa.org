Taking your layout as a challenge (Devil's advocate), two things stand out:

​

'People have an instinctive sense of "fairness" or "justice", which they try to satisfy. ("Natural Law exists.")'

*'What does it mean for someone to "be evil"?* Evil people are malicious. They seek the suffering of another as an end in itself.'

​

Two character types come to mind to challenge this. For the first character type, which I propose goes against both lines, I propose a Fang-Yuan-like 'amoral demonic-path' individual: strongly caring about oneself (such as one's own power/wealth/longevity), the person feels no qualms about hurting others, burning the world, et cetera if it gives benefits for the person. In modern reality, consider large-corporation CEOs whose choices often seem immoral or amoral. Also consider in contrast Google's "Don't be evil" intention. I would argue that such a character would not be seen as trying to satisfy fairness/justice, nor seek the suffering of another as an end in itself (unless coincidentally, rather than necessarily), yet would confidently be termed 'Evil' by most. What are your thoughts on this?

(...Hmm, the 'Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven' line also comes to mind, again valuing solely one's own interests in place of fairness/justice (there wanting to oneself reign rather than wanting an equal republic) and being motivated by one's own interests rather than others' suffering for its own sake.)

​

The second type that comes to mind (proposed to go against the second line only): imagine someone tasked with killing large numbers of otherwise-innocent members of a social group, whether according to poverty or ethnicity or something else. For questionable reasons, this person and most members of this person's society feel that this should be done, and that it is in line with fairness/justice--the person does not feel stress or guilt. Some people with the same job carry it out as simply as possible, some enjoy doing it cruelly, but this person puts in extra time and effort to kill them as humanely as possible, with the similar outlook to someone euthanising large numbers of abandoned pets. They die unknowing in their sleep, without fear or discomfort. Most members of this person's society would claim the person's actions/choices are not 'Evil'. My understanding is that most members of our current societies would claim the person's actions/choices are 'Evil', even if evaluated as more 'Good' than those of another who did the same things while taking pleasure in causing unnecessarily greater suffering. Following 'you are what you do', members of that person's society would not view the person as 'Evil' whereas we might. What are your thoughts on this?
