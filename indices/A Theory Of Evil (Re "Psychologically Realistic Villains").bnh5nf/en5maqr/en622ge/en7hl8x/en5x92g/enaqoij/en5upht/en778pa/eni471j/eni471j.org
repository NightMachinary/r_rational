  *What does it mean for someone to "be evil"?*

  Evil people are malicious. They seek the suffering of another as an end in itself.
#+end_quote

This seems incredibly reductive to the point of damaging your argument. Plenty people generally regarded as evil have committed morally reprehensible acts with the end goal ostensibly being noble. The suffering of others along the way wasn't the end goal, it was merely a convenient route to take to reach the actual goal. In fact, it even seems that you don't agree with this line yourself. Later in your post you state:

#+begin_quote
  They were placed in a situation where they believed they had to be cruel, and remained in that situation for long enough that cruelty became a reflex
#+end_quote

Even in this situation, you aren't saying that the cruelty is the end goal of this definitively evil villain. It may be a tool in their toolbox that they use often, but nobody uses a hammer as a goal unto itself, they use a hammer to drive in a nail.
