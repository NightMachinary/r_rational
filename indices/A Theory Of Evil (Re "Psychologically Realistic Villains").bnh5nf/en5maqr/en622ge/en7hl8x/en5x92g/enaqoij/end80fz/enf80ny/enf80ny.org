  ...Are you claiming that cognitive dissonance doesn't exist?

I suspect it really exist mostly on instinctual or instincually learned level, like distress caused by contradictory instinctual behavior. For higher concepts like ethics or ideology overwhelming majority of people don't pay attention to contradictions, or consider contradictions perfectly acceptable. Religious people revel in contradictions. Only extremely analytical people are capable to be distressed by contradictions of higher concepts.
