That's what I call weak evidences. It's well known that chimps are capable of behavior which benefit band as a whole and winch even impinge on alpha leader (sharing meat in the band where even weakest member have share of meat). You can call it precursor of moral but it's too far from human understanding of moral in my opinion.
