I agree with your argument, save that I believe humans to possess moral intuitions that cause cognitive dissonance and emotional pain when we act against them. See the concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetrator_trauma][Perpetrator Trauma]]; I think the evidence is in favor of the idea that we become stressed and hurt when we violate our moral intuitions. (Which are distinct from our ethical or ideological beliefs! Moral intuitions live in our emotional, habitual selves: ideology and ethics live in our reasoning, conceptual selves.)
