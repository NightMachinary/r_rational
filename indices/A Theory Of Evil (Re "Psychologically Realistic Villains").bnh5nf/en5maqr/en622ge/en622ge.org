  everyone wants to believe their ethical system is perfect, because holding a self-image that says you /aren't a good person/ is incredibly maladaptive.

I don't think this is entirely accurate. People don't need to believe that they are good, they just need to believe that they are morally no worse than the people around them. The evidence for this is the bystander effect: when one person is in some kind of trouble and a thousand people are watching. In most ethical systems, the morally good thing for each of the thousand people to do is to help. Yet the likelihood of each person choosing to help is far lower than you would expect from a morally good person.

From this we can conclude that actual motivation to be *more morally good* than others or even to be *morally good* on an absolute scale is very rare and/or very weak: if it isn't, then the thousand people should be rushing to help for the mere opportunity to do good, even if no one else around them does. So we see that most people are only motivated to be *as morally good as* the others, even if that's actually morally evil on an absolute scale.

So I would say it is realistic to have villains that acknowledge their moral evils, but persist anyway because they believe they are not more morally evil than other people, and that if those other people can do so much evil (and get away with it), why shouldn't they do the same?
