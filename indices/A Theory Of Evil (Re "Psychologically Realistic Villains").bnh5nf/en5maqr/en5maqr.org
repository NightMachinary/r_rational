One thing I think you're missing is that some people want to see others suffer /as a result of their innate sense of justice./

For example, people who think that prisoners getting raped is funny (Don't drop the soap!). Or people who think that people deserve to be tortured because they belong to a group (country/religion/etc.) which has harmed them. Hell*, over a billion people believe that the rest of humanity deserves eternal torture just for not choosing Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior.

To use the HPMOR example, the villain in that piece was, in the end, unable to abandon cruelty because he took joy /specifically/ in delivering pain and death to those he thought deserved it (in his case, "[[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/108][idiots]]").

*Pun fully intended.
