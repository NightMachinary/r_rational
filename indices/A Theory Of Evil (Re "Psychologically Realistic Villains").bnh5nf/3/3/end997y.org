I would say that "killing, regardless of circumstance, presents a moral risk that must be actively mitigated and guarded against in order to preserve one's own ethics."

Edit: I think "Moral Trauma" is the word you might want to look for here - IIRC, soldiers who have killed in war have higher rates of PTSD than those who have not, irrespective of relative intensity of conflict overall.
