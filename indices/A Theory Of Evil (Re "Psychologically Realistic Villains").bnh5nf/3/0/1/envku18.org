  I default to deontology most of the time.

Yeah, I was just thinking the other day that a good one-sentence definition of these two philosophies is "dentology is utilitarianism that made it". In most cases, deontological principles are born just of that sort of analysis, more or less heuristically, and they were simply found to be the correct answer in such an overwhelming majority of cases that it gets easier to enshrine them as absolute principles than deal with the risk of idiots thinking /their/ flawed utilitarian analyses are better and use them as rationalisation to do whatever.
