I usually like villains who use the logic "the end justify the means" because it's something that makes perfect sense...if the person in question is a machine who can hold to their ethics no matter what instead of being a human being running on [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Corrupted_hardware][corrupted hardware]].

For example, I can absolutely conceive of a situation where it would be justifiable to murder someone and it would be the right thing to do over anything else I could do in this hypothetical situation. But I would most likely still choose to not murder due to an ethical injunction to never kill, because murder will fundamentally change who I am as a person and I wouldn't be able to trust my future murderous self to be as moral as my present non-murderous self.

Not to say that all murderers are beyond redemption for passing beyond a moral event horizon or anything like that. But if I have chosen to make an exception for my ethical injunction of */+THOU SHALT NEVER KILL+/* then after making one exception, it's more likely to make a second exception, a third, fourth, and so on.

Due to running on messy flawed hardware of our brains, I can't trust that I'll hold to any moral rules as tightly if I ever break it even once. Hence, "the end justify the means" is not something that I can ever use to justify violating any moral rule. No matter the consequences, in my mind, some actions are immoral by their very nature.

EDIT: This train of thought actually brings me to a very interesting idea about people who have to kill for their jobs such as a soldier in a war, or doctors who give euthanasia (even though this is not a thing in most countries). I can absolutely see someone who kills a patient still being moral if they follow strict rules about making sure there is no other option and the patient sincerely cannot continue any longer. Soldiers who kill are only morally permitted when ordered to do so against enemy combatants, and they aren't allowed to kill civilians, prisoners of war, and other uninvolved groups.

I'm most likely loosing a lot of nuance by summarizing the two examples too much, but to me, the only time people can still be moral while still killing, is if they follow strictly regimented rules and codes of conduct for occasions where the murder has been determined to be necessary.

For example, I would consider a soldier who killed dozens for his country to be more moral than a beggar who kills a single known criminal to steal his money. The beggar could be killing the worst criminal to ever live for his money to survive, but I would still consider the beggar to be committing an immoral action. The soldier is following a predetermined, necessary mandate to serve his country while the beggar is purely serving himself for survival.

EDIT 2: All of this musing brings up an interesting ethics puzzle to contemplate, is killing in self-defense moral, immoral, or neither?

EDIT 3: Some comment replies have made me think that I'm mixing up the meaning of ethics with morals (following a code of conduct versus values). So the example concerning the soldier versus the beggar is somewhat inaccurate in what I was trying to talk about in relating ethics to immoral behavior.
