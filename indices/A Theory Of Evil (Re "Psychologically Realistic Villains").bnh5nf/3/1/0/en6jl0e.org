  That doesn't sound right, so we crossed the line somewhere.

After reading yours and [[https://www.reddit.com/user/Nimelennar][u/Nimelennar]]'s comment, I'm starting to think that I have accidentally crossed a line somewhere too.

I was envisioning how cultures develop roles and strict traditions for dealing with immoral actions that need to be done such as carrying out the death penalty and killing others in wars. But you bring up a good point about how if there are any moral exemptions for a nation, what stops us from applying the same exemptions for smaller and smaller groups?

I suppose that I made a mistake when I mixed up ethics and morals when talking about soldiers.

What I should have said is that soldiers are ethical, since ethics are about codes and conducts one must follow while morals are about norms and values of what is good or bad. And soldiers have to deal with conflicts between organizational ethics versus personal morals.

Maybe I shouldn't have said that a soldier is more moral than the beggar, but rather more /ethical/ than the beggar.

Either way, I really enjoyed your comment and excellent rebuttal against my argument!
