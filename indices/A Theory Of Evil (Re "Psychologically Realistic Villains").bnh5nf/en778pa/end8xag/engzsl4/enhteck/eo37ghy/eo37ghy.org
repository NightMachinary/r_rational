' Experiments with chimps and gorillas have demonstrated that they get annoyed when you stiff them.' This is consistent with my 'because of the unfairness that others--not them--are suffering' paragraph, in that people (evidently and/including chimps/gorillas) are very sensitive to when people are hurting them, and punishing them to prevent that behaviour, but not necessarily sensitive to or reactive to unfairness which does not hurt them, such as to an effectively-powerless minority within that group while they are the majority. However, while writing this I come to the realisation that it could always be argued that any inconsistent apathy towards others is due to dehumanisation/moral-group-exclusion of those others, unless one can actually see how the person's neural network is functioning.

​

'Care and Fairness' weighted comparatively low--I have no argument at this time.

​

Flinch training: Definitely relevant! If I have been overestimating how hardwired certain things are in plastic brains, that opens up the model a lot to account for all sorts of stable behaviour patterns.

​

By the point that one is modelling altruism as a weak instinctual impulse that can be wholly replaced by a strong learned pattern of thought, has it not though become effectively 'nurture' rather than 'nature'? If you put two groups of people into an altruism-reinforcing tube and an altruism-extinguishing tube, and they come out according to which tube you put them in, then how can you distinguish between that world and a world in which they didn't have the altruism impulse from the start, and does it matter? Is it meaningful, for the final 'villain', if there was a 'fall from grace' or instead 'never rising to grace'? Though perhaps I should said 'benevolence', since 'grace' usually implies external favor.
