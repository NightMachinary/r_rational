lots of awesome thoughts, thanks for putting some time into this =)

The last point about hydrology and differing plateau levels is super interesting from a world-building standpoint. Having massive waterfalls as common features could lead to advances in hydro power and mills as commonplace. I hadn't considered this element but I like it a lot.

Securing the soil is also a major environmental concern that would be interesting to explore. Poor farmers would be literally pushed to the "edge" of society, and be left scrabbling at loose earth with risk of losing chunks of their farmland to errant sky quakes.

Levitating artillery to increase range is also something I hadn't thought about much. I have some ballistae already worked into some of the armies as common weapons, having batteries of them on levitating platforms would be pretty dope.

great ideas, lots to consider!
