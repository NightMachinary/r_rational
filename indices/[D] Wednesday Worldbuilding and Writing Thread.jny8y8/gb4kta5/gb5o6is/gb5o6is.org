Unpowered flight with antigravity seems pretty trivial, although it's not very safe without a parachute or being tied to something. Getting yourself to net 0 weight would be fun, assuming it's not too uncomfortable. I guess balancing the distribution would be a little tricky, but doable.

I feel like elevators/dumbwaiters should be possible with this, but I don't know how you'd reset the counterweight without regular machinery.
