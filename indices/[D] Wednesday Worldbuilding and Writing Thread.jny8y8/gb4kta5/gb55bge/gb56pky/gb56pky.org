Good questions!

I would imagine for the large crystal complexes, you get something like the feeling of a large train passing, or the thrum of a large factory's boiler room, something almost more felt than heard. These are usually burred in layers of rock, so it's a vibration felt through your feet, but if encountered in the open it would be deafening.

For very small crystals, I'd expect a barely audible high pitched whine, like some electronics.
