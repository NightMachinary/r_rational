If a healer existed who didn't need resources to restore peoples health existed, but was limited by touch, would the healer mostly be moved around or centralized? Because the bigger the area/population the healer serves the more it becomes a need to get all the injured/sick to them instead of the healer to the masses. Is my thinking correct?
