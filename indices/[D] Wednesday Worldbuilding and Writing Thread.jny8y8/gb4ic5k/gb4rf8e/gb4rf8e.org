It depends on how much time it takes them to do the healing, the type of healing they can offer, and the relative speed, cost, and safety of your available transportation methods.

If the healing can be done instantly upon contact, then you'd ideally want some kind of setup which allows people to reach the healer as fast possible. This might favor centralizing the healer at a purpose-built facility, perhaps with the healer on one conveyor belt, and people to be healed moving along on two adjacent conveyor belts traveling in the opposite direction. If it takes anywhere from a few seconds to a minute, then on-site logistics are no longer a chokepoint, so you could plausibly have the healer traveling to reduce the logistical burden of transporting millions of people to them. If it takes hours or days to do the healing, then the logistical burden for transporting people to the healer becomes small, and there's a relatively greater advantage to having a consistent place for the healer to be so that the people in greatest need can be triaged and seen first.

Regarding the type of healing, if they can fix literally anything - blindness, amputations, nerve damage, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, strokes, obesity, etc., then every city in the world could benefit from them. This was my assumed case for the paragraph above. If they can only heal 'injuries', like cuts, burns, gunshot wounds, broken legs, then the ideal approach might be to station them in areas with the highest expected need; probably large cities with high crime rates in peacetime, and then switching to secure locations near war zones or other conflict areas when such events occur.

Transportation is the only other issue that I think would impact things. Obviously, losing the healer in a car accident would be devastating. I would expect road travel to resemble a presidential convoy, with police blocking off all side-streets and clearing the roads ahead of the healer's motorcade. Travel by air would need to be done with multiple redundant safety systems which are re-certified before every flight, with parachutes available, appropriate equipment for dropping into water or in dangerous territory, equipment for signalling rescue teams, and of course, having high-speed search-and-rescue teams on standby. Travel by ship would be risky due to the possibility of rogue waves, so it would have to be done exclusively in calm seas, avoiding storms at all times, and having evac available on the ship in case of unexpected weather changes. Higher transportation costs favor moving the healer to reduce the transportation burden, and higher transportation speeds also favor moving the healer since it takes less time out of their available time for healing.
