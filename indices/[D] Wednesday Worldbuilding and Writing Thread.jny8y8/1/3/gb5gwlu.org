I imagine them not moving hardly at all. Transportation is safe, but not as safe as staying put. Building infrastructure to bring people to them is easy if they don't move.

But if you have three healers, things become very different. Two of them can travel, together--not on the same vehicle, but near enough that if one gets injured the other can heal them back. In catastrophe the third still exists. In that case moving them around becomes much more feasible and attractive.
