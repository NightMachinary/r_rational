Personally, I often reach a good groove when I'm past the first couple ten thousand words/first few chapters. Then, when I've reached a significant milestone, and go back to proof read and edit, I find the first couple chapters lackluster and give them a major overhaul/rewrite. I'd generally advise not to be too picky about the beginning (prologue or no) and just keep writing. Once you're further in, you can easily go back and write a higher quality or more fulfilling beginning.
