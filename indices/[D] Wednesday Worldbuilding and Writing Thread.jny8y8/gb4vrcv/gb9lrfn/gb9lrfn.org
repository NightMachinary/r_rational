  A god dies in it, except the 'god' is closer to the Entities from Worm in nature and it's not all powerful like most gods from religion usually are

A pretty huge chunk of polytheistic deities were described as being weaker than the Entities. I doubt any typical fantasy reader would object to calling something on that scale a god if it otherwise fit the setting thematically.
