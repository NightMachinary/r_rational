Hey all! Back for more brainstorming on applications of antigravity crystals in a fantasy/steampunk setting.

Setting is floating islands held aloft by "magic" crystals. the crystals are shards of a massive obelisk that shattered in a past cataclysm, and now drift in orbit around it. The crystals lift is proportional to their volume, so small slivers (3 cm) can be held in a heavy vial, and large crystals (2-3 m) can hold up an airship. massive crystal complexes embedded in rock support entire islands that can sustain life.

Crystals emit an audible vibration, pitch based again on size, and exert a weak but wide range attractive force around them (akin to another form of gravity), allowing islands to stick together and causing condensation of water vapor in the immediate area. this allows for weather cycles in the vicinity of large crystals and formation of permanent bodies of water on the islands.

Islands drift haphazardly and over time mini-continents will form and break apart, much more rapidly than earth tectonics. this has allowed for migration between different islands by various species over the centuries.

Not 100% clear on what the planet below is like, been toying with it just being a gas giant with increasingly dense clouds giving way to a hot ocean the further down you go. Behemoths prowl the depths, making exploration dangerous.

Tech level of civilizations is just barely post-medieval, with a recent Di Vinci style renaissance of flying contraptions and simple machines.

What kinds of fun contraptions might you expect that leverage this tech level and physics?
