You know what would be a really cool justification for the "medieval stasis" trope? Whenever a civilization becomes too advanced, dragons/aliens/ect become worried they will soon advance even more and be able to fight them, and so immediately wipe them out and burn their libraries and technology, and even attack their neighbors just in case some technology or knowledge had spread. Thus, an extreme taboo against technology rises.
