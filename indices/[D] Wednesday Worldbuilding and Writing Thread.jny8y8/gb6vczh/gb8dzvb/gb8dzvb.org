Interestingly, we actually see this to an extent in real-life with nuclear technology, not just for weapons but also for energy. Most smaller less-developed countries are pretty content to just not even try to develop it because of the potential international shitstorm it would cause.

As one example, Iraq makes for an interesting lesson of how a mere allegation of nuclear weapons development could be used as justification to bomb the country, overthrow its government, and execute its leader, causing about a million civilian excess deaths and creating two million refugees. Iran is another interesting example, one of the few who are openly trying to develop nuclear energy (and allegedly weapons) and they've been hit with trade sanctions, Stuxnet, multiple assassinations of their nuclear physicists (allegedly), and the constant threat of being subjected to an Israeli airstrike and missile barrage potentially backed up by a US invasion.

In a fictional setting, I imagine much of this might be similar. Perhaps elves tolerate the humans as trading partners, but once they see their air and water becoming polluted by industrialization, they demand that the humans shut down their factories. If the humans are weak, the elves will simply invade, lay siege to their cities, burn their libraries, and destroy every factory they find. If the humans are strong(er), the elves impose trade sanctions, assassinate industrialists, sabotage factories, scare off superstitious workers with bad omens, and threaten to attack if the humans don't back down.

As another possibility, maybe dragons claim dominion over all of the land and tolerate humans only as a useful way to extract gold, gems, and silver from the earth. As long as the humans maintain regular shipments of treasure to add to their hoards, the dragons will spare their fields and cities from being lit afire. However, each time the humans try to industrialize, develop gunpowder weapons, or attempt to unite their kingdoms, the dragons see the humans as a threat and basically go on a rampage, killing and destroying enough to set the humans back at least a few hundred years or so.
