So I just got done writing the prologue for my fic and I don't really know what to do with it. It's not too long (only 800 words or so) and it's also not terribly important for the immediate plot, it's more like light worldbuilding to signal that the fic (a fanfic of an original fic based on a fanfic, which is also a fanfic of a fanfic of another series) takes place in an AU that while similar on a surface level to the source material the main plot will go in a completely different direction.

Things which I like about it:

- Sets some of the themes that will come into play later on.

- Clarifies some inconsistencies present on the canon setting.

- Gets speculation started with regards to what happened between the past and the present.

- Gives a reasonable answer as to why the powerlevels are bound to get wack (I got rid of the asspull magic and stupid macguffins so people actually have to think and prepare a plan to deal with the BBEG that goes beyond 'find the Dragon Balls before the bad guy does and hope for the best').

- Foreshadows the genre shift down the line.

Things which I'm on the fence about:

- Some of the tech and terms on the prologue will likely come across as nonsense or technobabble.

- The event that takes place in the prologue kinda pushes suspension of disbelief because of how... loose the canon associations and powerlevels are. A god dies in it, except the 'god' is closer to the Entities from Worm in nature and it's not all powerful like most gods from religion usually are (which is what I guess most people will associate with the word 'God', hence thinking it shouldn't be able to be killed, therefore thinking the worldbuilding isn't well thought out, etc)

- The tone of the prologue is dark, which is to be expected from a creation/fall from grace myth, but still darker than 60-70% of the rest of the fic will be.

Possible solutions:

- Rewrite it so it's more vague and condensed.

- Rewrite it but make it so the darker tone/events are only implied.

- Repurpose the prologue as an interlude.

- Get rid of it then find a way to expose it throughout the story.

I'm considering all of these except the last one, one thing I noticed with regards to these kind of myths or events that happen in 'ancient times' is that it's very hard to present them in a way that is natural and not just 'side character destroys chapter's pacing to explain in rigorous detail an event that realistically they either would have no way of knowing or should be common knowledge by now'. I also think it's more fun if the readers and the characters know or have different beliefs with regards to how events played out, but I'm aware of how frustrating that can come across when handled poorly (which is why I'm trying to get this right).

Any tips or advice? I'm not losing sleep over this so I can settle for any thoughts or insights y'all might have with regards to prologues or info dumping in other books or fics.
