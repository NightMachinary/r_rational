If you have the elevators balanced about right, you wouldn't need all that much power to move things around. The counterweights could be very light. In a medieval/early modern equivalent society, you probably won't have enough population density to justify elevators. Though as I mentioned in another comment, you could move freight up and down large elevation changes fairly easily with something like an elevator, and that has some promise.
