This is a fun read and great thought experiment, thanks for putting in all the work on the math!

The 4th power distance law seems to lead to some really explosive results. This is definitely thought provoking and I'll have to consider what mechanics would make this world functional.

I wonder if it should function something more like magnetism where they are attracted to each other and certain high density materials but wouldn't immediately black hole anything squishy in the vicinity :)
