so how many db is the hum? You could for example with a complicated series of tubes create a horn that directs the sound. you could easily make a telegraph system.

Or if you were a mad man, you could throw a bunch of crystals in a jar and use that energy to turn a fan or blower. Say for example could I make a backpack of them through a reducing set of tubes and create an airjet so I could sandblast things or create a compressed air gun?
