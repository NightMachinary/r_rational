If the islands are only loosely bound together through magical attractive forces, I think you would have people planting trees and other plants to attempt to bind islands together more than they naturally are. Failure of this system could mean that whatever polity is located near the edge would immediately lose some substantial amount of farmland, or possibly towns or cities. But until that happens, huge swathes of land dedicated to old growth forests isn't particularly profitable, so there's an individual incentive to turn that land towards either pasture land, or to turn all that lumber into something. This is very profitable until it suddenly isn't. Could work in various analogies for the destructive nature of clear-cutting, coastal erosiom, any number of things really.

It really seems like earthquakes would be extremely common, though probably not as destructive overall. You might see architecture styles more similar to Japan even with an overall European aesthetic.

You could leverage the floating crystals for architectural uses, if your population density is large enough to justify it. This could range from huge bridges that span far longer stretches than would be ordinarily possible, to impossibly tall but otherwise ordinary buildings, or any number of things.

If levitation if not powered flight is relatively easy, I think you would see something equivalent to a crow's nest on ships, but for cities and towns. Communication speeds with medieval tech are the speed of a racing horse under normal conditions, but it's possible to get much faster speeds if you have long sight lines, like with mountains, by using some light source to send signals. If you just have rotating crews of people on platforms suspended hundreds of feet in the sky, you could replicate this and send morse code with large mirrors (or selectively blocked fires at night) to other platforms, dramatically speeding up communication speed. Tether the platforms to the ground with rope, have people go up and down ropes with small levitation platforms and then just pull themselves up the rope... I think it could work well. There's some obvious ability to perform scouting and surveying with this as well.

The military uses of levitation are obvious. Lift rocks, drop them on approaching army. Any city could have a ring of platforms just for that purpose. Any artillery pieces would have ludicrous range, though you would have stability issues. The tether holding those platforms to the ground would be vulnerable, but also pretty hard to hit.

I think you could have much better naval transport utilizing the floating crystals. You don't need deep water ports, sail boats could go far faster, rowing would be more effective since there's not nearly as much drag from the water, or you can just haul much more cargo. Obviously depends on substantial rivers and seas, but I think the ability to control your direction with oars would give these ships an edge over airships that need something more complicated to fly in opposition to the wind.

Your world is going to have some huge elevation differences on its land, as individual islands don't precisely merge with the level of the main continent. Highly mountainous terrain, or equivalent, is going to incentivize relatively stagnant political maps over the large scale, because mountains are really, really difficult to move armies through. This may also stifle trade, and would lead to very interesting hydrology. The hydrology will probably need to be worked out in a bit of detail, because the rivers and oceans that connect different places are going to seriously affect political dynamics.
