I think the bridges I mentioned earlier would be extremely useful for the increased variance in terrain height. Depending on how good your engineering is, you could make some huge bridges to help span the gaps caused by huge cliffs, canyons, etc. Bypass rough mountain passes to make trade easier.

You're naturally going to get some incredible scenery, with the enormous mountains, cliffs, and waterfalls. Maybe you would get some really weird things like a sea that isn't level because it spans two conjoined islands at different heights, or a river that runs in a loop.

The large variations in height make trains much harder, since they can only handle pretty small inclines. Obviously this is a little past medieval tech. You could have trains for traversing mostly flat land, and something like an elevator or series of elevators using the floating platforms to move freight/people up large elevation changes, which then offloads into another train station for the next part of the trip. Works less well for extended mountain ranges or other places where there's substantial horizontal distance in addition to vertical distance.

In a much closer analogue to coastal erosion, you would want forests ringing every island and continent, so that soil doesn't wash away in the rain. I'm assuming that soil that goes over the sides eventually comes back through whatever means, but without something securing the soil, the edges of every floating landmass would be fairly barren.

Given the difficulty of making a stable platform, I would think ballistae would have the best range, but you're more limited on the structural damage you can cause. Carting the floating platforms on the ground means you can set up siege engines well in advance then float them into engagement range. Having floating platforms makes logistics a lot easier for an advancing army, because they need less horses to pull a given weight, and if they're fully floating then rough terrain is much easier to get through.
