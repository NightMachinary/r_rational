I think that's usually true, but maybe not always. Places with infrastructure will maximize the absolute number of people who have access to the supernatural healer, true. But whether that's what you want to optimize will depend on what sorts of healing are most important.

For example there are considerations like disease eradication. A lot of the holdouts keeping the last enclaves of polio from being eradicated are regions where it is very difficult to build infrastructure or transport enough equipment and trained personnel. A supernatural healer with less logistical overhead might be the ideal candidate to reach places like this.

I could also imagine somebody with an ability like this being deployed with a global rapid response team to hotspots where new plagues are emerging. Depending on the details of their ability, they might be really helpful in containing potential pandemics or even smaller but still serious outbreaks of infectious diseases before they can spread.

But if all you're concerned about is maximizing patients treated or coordinating access, I think centralizing makes sense.
