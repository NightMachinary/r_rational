Interesting to hear about the thought process behind it. And yeah, understandably the balance between the Gary Stu rationalist and normal teenage boy is very hard to pull off.

I think the reason it feels like a regular romcom is that Xavier is a pretty decent kid, and always chooses the "nice guy" dialogue choice when faced with situations with the girls, which is the same thing a normal manga protagonist does (Huh, maybe that's why he was chosen to be a protagonist, he has that overly self-sacrificial personality that is very hard to find IRL). Maybe give him a few dialogues where he tries the opposite or maybe show him struggling a little more when he has to make the choice between losing agency in his life vs hurting one of the girls, might help.

  that sort of simultaneous send-up of a genre while writing a great example of that genre is where I'd ideally like this story to end up

That is a real big hurdle you've set for yourself man. But I'm not one to discourage people from chasing of their dreams, so all the best with that!
