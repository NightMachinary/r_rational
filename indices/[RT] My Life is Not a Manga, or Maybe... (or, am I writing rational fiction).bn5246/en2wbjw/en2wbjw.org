Really enjoyed this so far. Reminds me of The Simulacrum but with better writing and moving in a different direction.

I like that how the MC evaluates his scenario and his realistic reactions to his reality being based on a manga. I'm also a big fan of the parents lending assistance and super curious about the death game his Mom was involved in.

So far this is definitely looks like a work I would keep up with.
