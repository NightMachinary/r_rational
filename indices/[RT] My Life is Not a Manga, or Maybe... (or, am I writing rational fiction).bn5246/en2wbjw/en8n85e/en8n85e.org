I like the premise a lot more than what's actually on the page, to be totally honest. Much like The Simulacrum, the story sets us up with a protagonist that is nominally aware of the reality they live in, but who decides early on to not rock the boat. The protagonist gets sucked up in replaying the stations of the genre, instead of interacting with those in a more assertive, conflict-generating way.

Xavier's internal struggle is not enough to create a unique plot, and now that he has surrendered his agency even further to a reliance on his parents' planning skills it feels like there's no room for him to show that he can act differently from the archetype he's trying to avoid embodying.

The premise of the story implies a much more involved protagonist. I'd argue Xavier could currently be replaced with a simpler genre savvy protagonist while leaving all plotpoints except for his parents' backstory intact. I'd also argue that that's not a good thing, but clearly other people find the story up to their standards.

The first misstep is likely that Xavier never seriously considers sharing what he has learned with anybody other than the girlfriend that gets put on the bus before he can get a word in. Because only secondary characters know about his secret, it plays out like the usual romance comedy: His interactions with the female cast are not allowed to be premise-aware. This is a problem that gets lampshaded early on, but hanging a lampshade on the problem doesn't mean it's solved and, personally speaking, a story in which Xavier gets over his initial failure to address the premise sounds better.
