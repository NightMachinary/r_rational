Thanks so much for the criticism!

  The first misstep is likely that Xavier never seriously considers sharing what he has learned with anybody

This is a good point. It's actually an intentional character flaw (Xavier has a weird block even sharing he /likes/ manga, much less being willing to try and convince someone that he's in one), but it does impact the narrative pretty heavily. I'll give it some thought when it comes time to revise. I'm honestly not sure whether I'll change it or not; there is a point to it, but that point isn't going to matter for another volume or two (assuming my plans proceed...erm, as planned) and it might not be worth playing the long game if the first volume is putting people off.
