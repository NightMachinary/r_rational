This is now live! From the homepage or table of contents, right arrow will take you to the most recent unread chapter, and when viewing a chapter left/right arrows will navigate back/forward respectively.

(Opted to leave the current left-to-right orientation for arrows in place; maybe I'll implement a "manga mode" down the road.)

Thanks for the suggestion!
