Ok this has a very *very* interesting premise, but as of chapter 16, the protagonist being aware of the situation has not had an effect on the plot. I understand that you want Xavier to look like a normal teenager, but that drags the early part of the story quite a bit. It just plays out like a normal Harem Romcom with the only differences being that the setting is not in Japan and the protagonist is meta-aware.

The plot will only be interesting if awareness of being in a story will allow the protagonist to change his predicament.

As of chapter 19, consider me intrigued.

Caught up now, hoping for something interesting to happen soon. All we've seen so far is Xavier triggering flags left and right with only his own increasing horror for company, and 26 chapters of just that setup is no different from an actual Harem romcom plot.
