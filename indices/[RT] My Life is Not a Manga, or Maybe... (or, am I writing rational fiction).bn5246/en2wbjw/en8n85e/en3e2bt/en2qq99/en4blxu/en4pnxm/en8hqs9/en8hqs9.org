Actually surprisingly great. I really had fun reading this one. The first couple chapters didn't grab me all that much nor did they scare me away, but by about chapter five I was hooked.

I'd go as far as to say that this is the first Harem Manga I've enjoyed in a few years, heh. I have pretty much the same issues as Xavier does with the genre, but somehow the entire thing being couched in this weird story makes it palatable again.

And, of course, the entire premise being the protagonist vs the rules of the world fits right in with rational stories and is really satisfying in general.
