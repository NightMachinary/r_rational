I've changed my mind; thanks /for nothing!/ (*´▽`*) I barely got any work done on Not A Manga this weekend because I was obsessively reading Sleeping with the Girls (haven't quite finished the second volume at this point, but I desperately need sleep). Really fascinating and well-written story, to the point that I didn't even care about the weird recurring typos and bad comma usage (it's "nigh" not "neigh", dammit!).

It's also super interesting because it's basically the same premise, but approached from a completely different angle. Both are about everymen inserted into manga whose end goal is a return to normality, but with totally different stakes and capabilities (mostly perfect plot knowledge vs. imperfect genre knowledge; desperately trying to survive vs. trying not to irrevocably destroy his everyday life; inserted into manga vs. having manga logic imposed on his world; etc.).
