Nice! Reminded me of Sleeping with the Girls, a Self-Insert crossover fic where the protagonist suddenly starts waking up next to a different anime female character each time he goes to sleep...

Vol. 1 - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality]]

Vol. 2 - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6052381/1/Sleeping-With-The-Girls-Vol-II-Chaos-Theory]]

Although that one seems to be abandoned, I found it very entertaining while it lasted.

EDIT - The author's preamble in the first volume says it all:

  Pre-Story notes:

  As a fanfiction writer, I'm sure one has always had fantasies they wished to write about concerning some of their favorite stories/settings/character. And along with these, sets of what-ifs. Fanfiction, in a way, has always been about what-ifs by most authors. It allows them to express their own thoughts and insights into the characters and settings of a story. Or if you're feeling particularly unforgiving at this time... It's just blatant teenage hormones going off... Hit and Miss y'know.

  The scenario presented is something along the lines of a twisted what-if. What if, you took a fanfiction author's fantasy scenario, and twisted it? Corrupted it. Made one of the most basic desires of the amateur fanfic writer go COMPLETELY... 'NOT AS PLANNED!'

  The following story will be such an experiment. Things won't be going according to the scenario. This is not part of the master plan... In fact, Gendo has been banned from all further meetings.

  So without further ado: We begin our story.
