You're right on the cusp of him starting to try and take control of his situation. Chapters 20-21 are Xaviertalking to his parents (not really a spoiler if you've read the end of chapter 19), and he'll start trying to deal with Samantha in chapter 22. His approach with Samantha is still a bit roundabout; he's still invested in playing the nice guy at this point, but that's likely to start changing soon because there's no way it will work with Paula.

Thanks for your feedback! The complaint that Xavier is too reactive for too long is a pretty common complaint, so I'm planning to revisit the pacing when it comes time to revise.
