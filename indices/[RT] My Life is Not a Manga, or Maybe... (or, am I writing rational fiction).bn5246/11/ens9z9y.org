I've been reading until chapter 19 and this far it hasn't really drawn me in. I enjoy the premise of a self aware harem character however this far he hasn't done anything that impresses me. His motivation seems to be that he doesn't want a girlfriend right now with having recently been dropped and that he resents the idea of being controlled by an author. Plausible enough.

This far though he hasn't done anything to avoid it. No emotionally mature talks about how he isn't interested in any girlfriend right now, no talks to the tsundere about how it's obvious that she likes him but that he can't stand the repeating deflections and will ask her to stop doing that or distance herself, no talk to the sexy senior about how her behaviour makes him uncomfortable and if she doesn't stop he'll ask her not to contact him, not trying to hook up his harem with friends. No trying to engineer situations that allowed him to achieve +world dominans+ his goals by using predictable tropes.

Is Xavier taking more initiative in later chapters or does it continue like this?
