Thanks for the criticism! I honestly kind of drove myself into a corner before I wrote the first word. My thought process ran from the inspiration that I wanted to write about a character trapped in a manga and aware of the genre to the desire for a character who was relatable and realistic (which means no magic or similar, at least initially). I quickly ended up with a harem, because that's the genre that I'm simultaneously decently well-versed in, but one that I have a lot of issues with. So great! I started writing.

And quickly realized that Xavier had a serious issue, because harems are almost wholly driven by coincidences and/or dense-as-brick protagonists! The premise completely fails if he's the latter, and the former makes it very difficult for him to gain any level of control over his own life. There's additionally the narrative tension of needing him to be proactive, but not wanting everything to completely go his way (because someone making a plan and having it go off without a hitch every time is super boring).

I'll keep this in mind when it comes time to try and revise the story, since the complaint that Xavier is too reactive for too long is one that others have had, as well.

On the other hand, hearing that it reads like an actual harem romcom plot is kind of encouraging; one of my main goals for this was to try and achieve a similar balance to Yomi Hirasaki's A Sister's All You Need (he's WAY better, and I'm nowhere near there yet, but that sort of simultaneous send-up of a genre while writing a great example of that genre is where I'd ideally like this story to end up). We'll see if that ends up working long-term.
