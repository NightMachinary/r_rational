I discovered The Simulacrum shortly after I started posting Not A Manga, and it's definitely a completely different take on the "trapped in a manga" thing. Didn't make it very far through, though, TBH. Something about the MC just didn't do it for me.

I can't really do much to assuage your curiosity at this point, unfortunately. Specifics about the death game are not likely to come up much in Xavier's story, because his mom doesn't like talking about it for obvious reasons (maybe I'll do a prequel at some point, but no promises). I can say that it was called the Labyrinth Obscura (Xavier's dad revealed this in Chapter 21), it was primarily a zero-sum game with prisoner's dilemma elements thrown in for giggles, and Xavier's mother is older than her birth year would indicate thanks to time dilation (more time passed within the Labyrinth Obscura than out of it, and she was in and out several times). I thought about writing that arc before I started on Xavier's story, but I'm honestly kind of scared of it. Unlike Xavier, she goes in without any genre awareness or external support network; the results are not pretty.
