Very exciting. Makes me think of the possibilities of getting something like the VR design center Tony uses on Iron Man. I've played a little with kinect and OpenCV and I think its possible to create measurement systems that are somewhat reliable.

Its tempting to start a project based on this concept, maybe once I'm done with my thesis.
