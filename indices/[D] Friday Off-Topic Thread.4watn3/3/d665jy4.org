Anyone intrested or have any thoughts on [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01316v1.pdf][Tabby's star]] as mentioned [[http://gizmodo.com/the-so-called-alien-megastructure-just-got-even-more-my-1784883811][Gizmodo TL:DR or clickbait]] The star's observed output is decreasing in a strange way. Current models don't explain the observed changes; potentially raising the probability that we are looking at a Dyson swarm or other mega-structure construction project.

I'm still working through the paper, and I doubt that's the best explanation but it's interesting.
