Finished listening to The Martian and Ready Player One. If you haven't read The Martian yet - you absolutely should, it's amazing. Audiobook perfomance is also fantastic.

Ready Player One had a few irrational/weird moments, but I have enjoyed it a lot.

Can somebody recommend some great scifi audiobooks? I'm really into it now, have some free time, and a bunch of audible credits. What's the best stuff you've listened to recently? I'm looking for pretty much any kind of great scifi, except for too heavy/depressing/dystopian things.
