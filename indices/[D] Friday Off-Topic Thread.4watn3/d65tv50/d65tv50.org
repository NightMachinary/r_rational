As I mentioned in the worldbuilding thread, I've started on an Undertale fanfiction (probably non-rational). It's going decently, I've got about three-quarters of the first draft of the first chapter done, though I'll probably be waiting until I get the first few chapters done and revised before I post anything.

There are two primary things that inspired this, both of which have plenty of spoilers for Undertale -- don't watch if you haven't played, play if you haven't, it's a fantastic game.

The first is this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2mTK1iuGqY][vocal duet cover]], the second is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5296460/chapters/12226634][The Golden Quiche]] by the venerable [[/u/Sophiera]]

Highly recommend that fic to anyone who has any interest in Undertale, it explores and expands on the magic of the universe and is overall pretty fantastic. They also have a work of original fiction, [[https://www.amazon.com/Crafting-Sun-Sophia-J-Teh-ebook/dp/B01H1QH652][Crafting the Sun]] published on Amazon which I haven't gotten around to reading yet.
