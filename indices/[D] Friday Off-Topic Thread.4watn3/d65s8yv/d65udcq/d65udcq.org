I recommend the Legion books by Brandon Sanderson. They're pretty mundane for the most part, it just has a weird premise and a hi-tech gadget as a macguffin, but I found them interesting and entertaining. I like the second book much more than the first, which was just a novella, but I had a good time listening to them both.
