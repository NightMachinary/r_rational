Favorites from my library I re-listen to a lot:

Look at everything else [[http://www.audible.com/search/ref=a_search_tseft?advsearchKeywords=wil+wheaton&filterby=field-keywords&sprefixRefmarker=nb_sb_ss_i_0_3&sprefix=wil][Wil-wheaton]] narrates, trust me, you'll like it or at least I have enjoyed Red-shirts and Lock-In, and What-If (though I already knew most of it by rote)so far.

[[http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Accelerando-Audiobook/B00J3542OI][Accelerando]] Charles Stross /A Classic/ I'd also recommend Glass House but it is a bit too Dystopian

The Quantum Thief, The Fractal Prince, and The Causal Angel [[https://www.audible.com/search?searchAuthor=Hannu+Rajaniemi][Hannu Rajaniemi]] /One level is an adventurous thief tale with a rising Godzilla threshold, another level is a mostly fair mystery told in median res about what happened in the singularity, and a fair bit of physics porn. A book that either disrupts immersions by smacking you in the skull with the setting vocabulary or makes you fight to tread water and figure it out before you get a definition/ *Note: no glossary*

The Expanse series [[http://www.audible.com/search?searchAuthor=James+S.+A.+Corey][James S. A. Corey]] /The closest a series can get to Firefly, while still observing Economics and physics IMHO. The new Scify TV series is pretty good, but this is better./ [[#s][Late 3rd book spoiler "One hundred and thirteen times a second, it reaches out"]]

Seconded on Leagion, or really anything by Sanderson, but I was hooked on the Wheel of Time over two decades ago, so my bias probably needs reassessment.

Just about anything by the [[http://www.audible.com/search?searchAuthor=Robert+Heinlein][Robert A. Heinlein]] /Fair warning, rampant sexism, nationalism, cranky old men, good stories, and at least two good swings at solipsistic pantheon-ism./ Oh and *The moon is a harsh mistress* has quiet possibly the best discussion of Rods from Gods as a military tactic, decent orbital mechanics, and badly anthropomorphic AI, though I was always partial to *The Cat who walks through walls, A comedy of manners*, but it is really the 3rd or 4th to last book to read if you want to read the full history as Myth series most of his works amalgamate into.
