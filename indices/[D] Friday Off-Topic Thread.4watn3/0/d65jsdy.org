If you are interested in learning more things about problems in the US criminal justice system (as [[/u/kishoto][u/kishoto]] talked about on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4vmxdv/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d6116l9][Monday]]), I recently read an article about a false murder confession [[http://www.westword.com/news/how-to-convict-a-fourteen-year-old-of-a-murder-he-didnt-commit-8134479][(link)]] that police got out of a fourteen-year-old. In addition to problems with trials and problems with plea bargains, we also have problems with investigation. There wasn't some grand conspiracy to railroad this kid; that would be relatively easy to fix, in a way. Instead, we have a much more insidious problem. The police probably think they had the right guy, and twisted things until they had the evidence needed for a conviction. Nobody gathered in a dark room and decided to put an innocent kid in prison. You can't point at a meeting and be like "here are the bad guys" because that's not how it works. Instead, there are bad incentives and bad procedures, and they predictably lead to bad outcomes.

So, what happened here? The police coerced a confession out of him with aggressive interrogation tactics. In hindsight, knowing he's likely innocent, it seems obvious the confession is false. He had to be coached to get the details of the crime right right. Although the confession proper didn't make it into evidence, after he confessed they (perhaps reasonably) decided he was guilty and did their best to build a case against him. "Their best" is very good; the police build cases a lot, as it is part of their job. The problem with this sort of interrogation + confession is the same as the problem with people going for plea bargains, as I mentioned in the discussion [[/u/kishoto]] started: whether or not you take a plea bargain has mostly to do with how desperate and terrified you are, rather than how guilty you are. This is also true for terrified teenagers being interrogated and being told to confess. The guilty and innocent alike plead guilty to reduce their sentences, and so too can they be coerced into confessions.

So, there are a lot of places you can run into problems with the system. Generally, and perhaps tautologically, the criminal justice system deals with criminals. Still, we want it to be fair and just. Besides the question of "is a 12 peer/juror trial a good concept" which should be addressed, but we have problems that happen before the trial. Plea bargains can have problems [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4vmxdv/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d61fsc1][(link)]]. Investigations can have problems. Contact with the police in the first place can have problems. Even if all of this was fixed, sentencing is a problem going back decades [[http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/flashbks/death/kaufman.htm][(link)]]. There's a lot to read if this interests you!
