ISTM that the problem here is people thinking forced confessions are not only evidence of guilt on their own, but overwhelmingly /strong/ evidence.

As problems go, ignorance is at least one we have mechanisms developed to fix (awareness campaigns, training, writing compelling stories featuring the topic, etc.) We just need to turn those tools to this problem.
