It's a lot of fun - but for me the best experience has been /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/482390/][The Night Cafe]]/, exploring Van Gogh from an otherwise impossible perspective.

Or /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/440630/][The Brookhaven Experiment]]/, which is on an entirely different level to any horror movie... making for seriously useful training to keep a cool, calm, detached mindset in any (real) situation.
