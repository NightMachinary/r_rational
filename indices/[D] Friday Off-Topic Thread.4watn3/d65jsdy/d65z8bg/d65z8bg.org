I read a PDF somewhere that a confession alone has a powerful contamination effect on all the remaining evidence, even if the confession is transparently false.

I wish I can find that PDF overview because it's pretty comprehensive.

Edit:

One interesting reform idea I heard from a fictional story is that instead of appointing prosecutors to an office, they are actually part of the same pool and chosen randomly. For each case, a lawyer could be prosecutor, or a public defender. I think it would be great if we get rid of the much maligned political office for district attorney and such.
