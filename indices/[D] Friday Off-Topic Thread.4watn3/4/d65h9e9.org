Am I the only person who doesn't like Stranger Things? I don't think it's a bad show, I just didn't get invested in the story or characters when it seems like everyone else did. I thought it was just okay and figured people liked it just because it paid homage to stories they liked, but then [[https://youtu.be/V8yMzgp_YuE][Chris Stuckmann]] carefully explained why he thought the show stands on its own so I'm at a loss.
