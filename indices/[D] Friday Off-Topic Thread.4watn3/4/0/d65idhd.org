People say this often and frequently, but I think standards are just a lot lower these days. One thing that stuckmann identified was something that nagged me as I was watching the series. The "homages". Sorry Hollywood, in my mind an homage is a quick reference to another work, like with a throwaway line of dialogue or a quick shot done in another film maker's style, NOT plot lines and character dynamics.
