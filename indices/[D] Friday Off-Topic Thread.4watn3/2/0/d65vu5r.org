Thank you again Cariyaga for the recommendations! It is certainly a pleasant surprise to be mentioned here.

I'd like to add some more information about [[https://www.amazon.com/Crafting-Sun-Sophia-J-Teh-ebook/dp/B01H1QH652][Crafting the Sun]] for those who prefer Sci-fi.

In the simplest terms, it's a character driven Science Fiction novel of the robot future variety. It has a set lore and its own consistent world science. It's not hard-science (as in following our universe to its closest), but it still adheres to its own rules.

I will be very thankful if other Sci-fi fans can spare a little money and time to check it out.
