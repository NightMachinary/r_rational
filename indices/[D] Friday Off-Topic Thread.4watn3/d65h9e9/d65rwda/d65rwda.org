I agree, I thought it was super predictable, boring, had lots of cliches, and made no sense.

How did this boy learn to control electricity? Did he use lights to spell out "run" while being in the same room with the monster? Why would he immediately stop responding when there's anyone else in the room? If that lady knew she sounds crazy, and that nobody would believe her, why on earth would she keep trying to incoherently convince everyone? Whats up with the love triangle plotline between the jerk and the American-Beauty-guy, was it even necessary? Did the evil doctor have any motivation, or was he just evil for no reason? Also, why don't these people ever communicate with each other?

That's just the most frustrating stuff that I remember now.
