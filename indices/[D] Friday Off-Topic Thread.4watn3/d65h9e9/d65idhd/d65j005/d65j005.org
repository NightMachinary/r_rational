The difference between the two types of homages you just referenced, is that not knowing about the other work would subtract from my enjoyment of this story in the case of a "throwaway line of dialogue", whereas plot lines and character dynamics are able to be enjoyed without understanding everything that came before. In the end, there's only a finite number of combinations of good plots and character dynamics, and [[http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/][creativity inherently depends on copying]], so I'll give /Stranger Things/ a free pass on both those elements.

I'm fiercely enjoying it in my ignorance of 1980s anything, btw.
