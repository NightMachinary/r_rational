Entertaining, but something bugs me about it.

All that semi-mystic philosophising about being one with the world and in the end they go for a slightly larger, but still similarly distinct object as the target. If you go with the implied message, surely the target should be the whole universe without discrimination, rather than one tiny specific piece of it? Just seems discordant to me. Sure, Earth is special from our perspective, but forgoing everything else in its favour just doesn't line up with the previous message as I see it. It's like graduating from drawing a boundary around a person to drawing a boundary around the planet, when the whole point is that there is no boundary at all.
