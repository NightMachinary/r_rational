I thought about this while writing the story. Here's my take:

I think what you're saying is fundamentally valid, but humanity hasn't gotten to the point where it could effectively do that. They would have to see the entire universe as one object, be able to have an accurate conception that encompasses all of reality, a 'theory of everything' in order to do it this way. So Saki is choosing to do something that a person would be capable of doing, since the Earth is one concrete object that can be visualized, when viewed from space in that way. That's why they had to go into space to do it. In addition, there's nothing else near the Earth, so for practical purposes there's no real difference, since the not-earth part of the universe is essentially inaccessible (unless they actually travel there with the spaceship of course). Maybe at some point in the future they will reach that state (able to visualize the entire universe), but it won't be for some time.

The thought's also that as opposed to before, if they did take the children up there upon their awakening, it would result in humanity passively guiding the evolution of other earth life in a constructive way, like the monoliths in 2001, as opposed to haphazard and in some cases destructive like we saw in the show.
