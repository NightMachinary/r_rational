For the anime/manga challenge, I wrote part of a fanfiction for my favorite anime, From the New World. I've finished it now, and it came out being a lot more substantial in terms of length than I initially expected.

From the New World isn't something I've ever seen discussed outside of anime specific circles, so I'll link its info here:([[http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori]]). From the New World definitely fits the criteria of rational fiction, and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone who likes rational fiction since I think it's a prime example: the ideas are really interesting and novel and the execution both visually and narratively is spot-on.

So, my story is not 'rationalifying' the anime, but is just what I consider to be a logical continuation from that point. For those who aren't into anime or animation, or those who are more literature fans, the novel it's based on has just finished being fan translated. Search for the Shinsekai Yori novel. The anime is a very faithful and visually breathtaking and inventive adaptation.

I had a lot of fun writing this story. I hope you guys get something out of it, too!
