It starts off in a seeming-idylic low tech japanese village where everyone has psychokinetic powers of similar type and great versatility. The story follows the life of a group of friends over ten or so years as they grow and mature into adults, slowly finding out more about the world around them and its hidden history. There are also interactions with the creatures known as queer-rats, who see them as gods because of their powers.

There is a good deal more to it than that, but I can't even hint at it apart from to say that the reveals are surprising, yet make perfect sense in retrospect and are fantastically well done. It's a thoughtful and subtle story that challenges your assumptions, one of the best anime I've ever watched.
