Smallpox was no god; it was but one face of the Demon with a Million, Billion Maws. The Great Devourer, whose appetite for the children of Life will never be sated. Whose terrible hunger leads men to sacrifice one another to the Great Beast, that they might momentarily slow its advance.

Smallpox was but a mere shadow of the Gaping Void from which none can ever return. The Cold Dark of Oblivion were all Life ends. The Endless Abyss that would engulf reality itself if left unchecked.

Smallpox was but another name for Death, the True Enemy, whose mere mention drives men to sew their own eyes shut, that they might not meet its maddening gaze.

...But Smallpox was.

And one face at a time, we will strike Death down. We will not ever rest until the True Enemy is defeated. Until all of reality is safe from its grasp, and all that is left of its legacy is a sad memory of what could have been.

In time, even Death may die.
