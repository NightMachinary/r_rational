  On March 27, 2014, the WHO announced the eradication of poliomyelitis in the South-East Asia Region, in which the WHO includes eleven countries: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh][Bangladesh]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan][Bhutan]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea][North Korea]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India][India]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia][Indonesia]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives][Maldives]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar][Myanmar]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal][Nepal]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka][Sri Lanka]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand][Thailand]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor-Leste][Timor-Leste]]. With the addition of this region, the proportion of world population living in polio-free regions has reached 80%. The last case of wild polio in the South-East Asia Region was reported in India on 13 January 2011.

  Up to October 15, 243 cases of wild polio have been reported - compared to 293 in the same period last year, a 17% improvement. In the 3 endemic countries, Nigeria has reduced polio cases greatly from 49 to 6, Afghanistan increased to 12 from 7 and Pakistan greatly increased to 206 from 43. 19 cases have also been reported this year in non-endemic countries. The number of polio cases reported in Pakistan reached a 14-year high of 206. The outbreak has been blamed on Al Qaeda and Taliban militants, who prevent aid workers from vaccinating children in rural regions of the country.
