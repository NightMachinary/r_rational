I'm going to limit the ability to only work on humans, and only on diseases that actually affect the first target. So you cannot bring around some kind of carrier who is immune to tons of diseases but carries all of them.

I will allow parasites and prions, but not toxins. The disease has to be something that can reproduce itself and so look like it could have spread without your ability. Rule of thumb: if the disease can be spread by taking blood from one person and injecting it into the other, your ability will work.

No you cannot tell what diseases someone has by looking at them. But you can say, see that someone is coughing, and spread whatever disease is making him cough to another person without knowing what that disease is. Your ability will fail if his cough isn't actually a disease (or the target you are trying to spread the disease to is immune to that disease), but there are no penalties or side effects from failed uses of your ability.

  If I wanted to help humanity, I'd get some of the worst diseases in the world and bring them to rich people - multi-millionaires tend to start charities to raise money and awareness for diseases that people they know have, so I'd take advantage of that.

You just blew my mind. That is a very unorthodox approach to curing disease, but I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work.

  In conquering the world and/or helping humanity, I'd also do some Kira-like vigilantism, which would be an easier feat if I could carry a rabid bat around with me which I probably can't. I don't think this would be very easy as the sort of people I'd most want to kill in this context would be people who would have good access to medicine and poor access to really, really sick people.

Hmm. Yeah, you would need to somehow get them near fatally ill people, which would probably require you to get accomplices willing to abandon their hospital treatments to come around with you. It also wouldn't be very safe, since the diseases you spread may end up spreading on their own, killing innocent people by accident. For example, if you go visit an imprisoned serial killer with your accomplice, and spread rabies to him, the serial killer may later bite another prisoner and then the disease may end up spreading to the entire prison before it is caught.
