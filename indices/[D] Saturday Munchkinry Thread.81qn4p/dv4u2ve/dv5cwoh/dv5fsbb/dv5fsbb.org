  Honestly your best bet with this power is almost certainly to use it to spread colds/influenza in controlled circumstances in order to prove you have powers and get rich/famous.

I'm not sure this would end well. I can imagine getting rich by proving you have a supernatural ability to make coins disappear, but proving you have a supernatural ability to spread disease seems more likely to end with you burning at the stake. After all, there will be tons of sick people wondering if they got sick naturally, or if they got sick because you spread the disease to them. So even if you never used your ability on them, there could be tons of people out for your blood, screaming vengeance to the high heavens.
