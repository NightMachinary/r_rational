Also HIV is well optimized as a wasting disease: it takes a shitload of resources to keep someone with HIV alive, and it never goes away.

Ironically, someone could probably use this to positive social ends. Go to Washington DC with someone HIV positive, and beam HIV into Congresspeople till they're motivated enough to cure it.
