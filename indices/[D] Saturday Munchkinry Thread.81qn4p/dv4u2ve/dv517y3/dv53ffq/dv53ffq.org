HIV is not the worst disease to have: in a vulnerable population a simple flu will kill people far, far quicker than even untreated HIV which takes months if not years.

If you really want to kill people you probably want to spread rabies (if parasites count as germs), since it kills quickly and reliably. Especially if the power works on animals...
