One place where this could be useful would be in diagnostics:

If you can determine which (germ-based) diseases someone has by sight, this would make you a near-perfect diagnostician. That could be very valuable, both as a day job and for pandemic prevention. If instead you just spread all the diseases the "donor" has, that would be less useful unless you can find people in good health who are willing to be infected with unknown diseases to improve someone else's diagnosis. I guess depending on where personhood starts you could also use IVF to produce "people" in petri dishes and transfer the diseases to them, which might be easier to analyse.

Other ideas:

Public health: Get one person with a very mild form of an otherwise dangerous disease at a large public gathering and use them to perform an invisible mass vaccination. This might be easiest to perform from space, depending on how visible individuals need to be and how easily you can get access to the ISS.

Intrigue: Provide spies with samples of different mild bacteria that they can infect themselves with to encode information. When the spy appears in public, transfer their illnesses to yourself and determine which ones are present. This would be almost completely undetectable, other than requiring you to see the other person.

SETI: How clear a view of the person do you need to have? If you can look at the night sky and detect diseased people beyond Earth, that has strong implications for the Great Filter. You can also transfer their diseases back to Earth to get an idea of their biology, and send them the various SETI broadcasts encoded in the DNA of a custom bacteria strain.

FTL: Do lenses and mirrors still count when viewing someone? If so, you might be able to set up a very elaborate optical arrangement where you view two people who are very long distances from each other, then try transferring a disease between them to see whether this transfer occurs faster than light. Of course, you'd need an immediately detectable disease, and this probably wouldn't be worth the effort.
