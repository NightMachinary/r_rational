Point of information for others to use: most people have a butt-ton of asymptomatic diseases, so even a single person would be a vector for a few dozen diseases.

Question: Does it work on animals? I'm guessing not because you said 'people' but if it works on animals I can carry a bat with rabies around with me... (in a cage!)

Question: By 'germ' I assume you're using a catch-all designation for viruses/bacteria. Do parasites (e.g. rabies) count? Do prions (e.g. mad cow) count? What about toxins (e.g. poison mushroom, medication overdose)?

Question: Can you tell what diseases someone has by looking at them?

Question: Do you have to see them IRL or, for example, if you watched a video of a president giving an address to a large crowd, you could give the president the worst disease in the crowd?

Generally, if I have the ability to identify diseases, I'd use that to be some sort of medical psychic and win a bunch of skeptic prizes, use that fame and some cold reading to become famous that way and I'm rich. (Even without identifying diseases, I can also "predict" who will get which diseases by causing them, cast "curses", and so on: the problem is if people are able to prove I did it I could go to prison and that would suck).

If I wanted to help humanity, I'd get some of the worst diseases in the world and bring them to rich people - multi-millionaires tend to start charities to raise money and awareness for diseases that people they know have, so I'd take advantage of that.

I can't think how I'd conquer the world, short of killing probably the entire population of England and then also most of Australia and getting myself on the British throne somehow, and I'm not sure I'd even be eligible as I was born out of wedlock and the British royal family has weird rules like that (my parents, who have been together since 1980, finally got married three years ago because they went to vegas and they figured they had to since that's what you do there; but I digress...).

In conquering the world and/or helping humanity, I'd also do some Kira-like vigilantism, which would be an easier feat if I could carry a rabid bat around with me which I probably can't. I don't think this would be very easy as the sort of people I'd most want to kill in this context would be people who would have good access to medicine and poor access to really, really sick people.
