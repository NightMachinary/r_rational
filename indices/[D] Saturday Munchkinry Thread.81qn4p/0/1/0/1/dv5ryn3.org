  and only on diseases that actually affect the first target

How do you define "affect"? The three asymptomatic colds I no doubt have right now are affecting my immune system, but they're just not causing /visible symptoms/.

#+begin_quote
  But you can say, see that someone is coughing, and spread whatever disease is making him cough to another person without knowing what that disease is.

So if someone has an "invisible" disease like, say.... well, let's go with a worm infection. They're probably in a lot of pain if it's severe, losing weight, wasting away, etc, but in the early enough stages they'll look pretty normal even if they are being affected. Can I not spread their worms? Or do I need to guess they have worms?

  You just blew my mind. That is a very unorthodox approach to curing disease, but I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work.

Glad to blow minds! It's what I'm here for! :) Yeah, I watched /The Celebrity Apprentice/ (even the most recent season with The Arnold replacing The Donald), and the celebrities played to raise money for charities, and it was usually a charity they or a family member was personally affected by. So it was an interesting trend.And actually, there was one celebrity whose charity was some disease nobody had ever heard of, and he was like, "the people with this disease have a really hard time, so I am raising money for them", and usually Obscure Disease Charity Celebs have a cousin or kid with the disease (e.g. Trace Adkins had a food allergy charity because his daughter has a peanut allergy), but nope, this guy was just feeling bad for these people with this rare disease. Don't remember his name but I remember being surprised by the lack of connection.

The big problem is that most infectious diseases just aren't fatal enough to weaponise. You'd probably need to do it on a lot of fronts at once. Twenty years ago HIV might have been a good start, but now it's kind of useless in the first world unless it goes undetected a very long time (which is going to be your best bet, really - give someone HIV, hope they don't find out on a blood test, then give them a bunch of flus and whatnot to take advantage of the AIDS when it develops...)
