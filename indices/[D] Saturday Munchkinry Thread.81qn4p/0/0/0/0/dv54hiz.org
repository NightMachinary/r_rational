Sure, HIV isn't the worst thing to have, but it might be more subtle than a crowd all gaining rabies, depending how you plan on doing things.

You dont /need/ to have the power able to transfer rabies to humans, if you nab someone you could overpower, and then nab a rabid dog, and let it transfer naturally, then you can use your superpower that way.

This power is kinda quite evil, huh.
