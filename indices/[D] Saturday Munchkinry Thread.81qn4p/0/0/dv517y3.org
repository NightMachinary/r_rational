Are you immune to any diseases? Can you +move+ Shift the disease from one to another, without making both have the disease?

Can you use any of your ability on yourself? This is incredibly powerful, but still somewhat dangerous, especially if you go seeking rarer diseases, because even if you don't need to touch the afflicted, you might expose yourself to other diseases along the way.

The power to transfer say, HIV from one person in a crowd, to everyone else in a crowd and within such a short period of time is VERY powerful.
