Do you think we live in the middle ages? All you need to demonstrate is an ability to spread colds from one person to another in relatively close proximity, there's no reason to assume such an extremely limited power would lead to some sort of panic.

Plus like with any demonstration of supernatural abilities you would probably go to a european country unlikely to kidnap and do experiments on you first and the local government isn't just going to turn you over to panicked masses. Though really I think you overestimate the degree to which this is actually liable to cause genuine mass panic.
