Honestly your best bet with this power is almost certainly to use it to spread colds/influenza in controlled circumstances in order to prove you have powers and get rich/famous. At some point in the future there might be utility from this power in that you can use it to rapidly spread retroviruses and that it's creating matter from nothing, thus preventing the heat death of the universe long term.

Fundamentally using this to spread pandemics just isn't likely to serve you any good, and you'd probably get caught pretty quickly (since the CDC is smart enough to know if a disease looks like it's spreading through deliberate infection).
