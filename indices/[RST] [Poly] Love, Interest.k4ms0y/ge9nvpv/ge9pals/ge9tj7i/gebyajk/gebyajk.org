Personally I think good practice is for a genre/field be named generally in order to make it descriptive and disassociated from the arguable founder. It's nice to recognize people's contributions but that's what history books/Wikipedia articles, etc. are for.

Specifically, I happen to like Yudkowsky, but there are people who do not and I don't want to make it harder for them to interact with the genre.
