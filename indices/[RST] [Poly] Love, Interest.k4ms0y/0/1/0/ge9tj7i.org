I think it can be both presumptuous and partially true. It's not how I'd describe the broader oeuvre of what I enjoy about this sub, but I don't begrudge him his rightful pride in his contributions, nor do I require him to pretend to be modest. Arrogance is part of his brand, and he does it in a likable enough way.
