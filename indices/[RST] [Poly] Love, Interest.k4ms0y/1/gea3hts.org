This felt really cute until it felt really stupid.

I don't think acknowledging the meta-state of stories as fiction, and characters as unreal except for the parts of them we see on screen, is a particularly rational storytelling tool. Especially not as used here, where it's mostly done to dodge actually answering real questions that do matter within the fiction.

The really frustrating thing is that if this had just ended shortly after the comment about living in a golden age, with our protagonist saying “and then it got complicated” or even just “but it all worked out” or something, I would have been way more satisfied with that as an ending. Even showing the breakup with your alien superintelligence botfriend and then lamenting that loss but focusing on the other relationships more, or something. It just gets so pointlessly naval gazing after that.
