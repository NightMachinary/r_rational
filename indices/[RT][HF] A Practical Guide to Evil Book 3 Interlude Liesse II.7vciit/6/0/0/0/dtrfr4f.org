Akua is too obvious a target. And know that most of her plants were cleared. Malicia... definitely a possibility, assuming she thinks Black will rebel, but I think she's the type that would wait until the war was over to do something like this. Or maybe she's in on Black's plan. Or maybe its her plan and Black is helping to execute it. Damn, so many possibilities.
