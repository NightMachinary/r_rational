Suspects for the murder:

Assassin, Certainly able, but the motive is muddy. Even if black is cleaning house, his actual team hasn't been shown to be on board with any supposed suicide pact for the sake of cat. Also, from what we've seen he generally kills with a bit more style.

Robber: He's a sneaky little bastard, and we haven't seen in him months, but the motive is even weirder. It would supposedly be at Cat's command, and she isn't certain enough of a win to risk offing commanders during the battle.

Akua's pet: The 15th cleared house, but Istrid's legions didn't. The motive is obvious

Cordelia's spys: Technically possible, but she made no assassination attempts outside her borders this far.

Malicia's spys: Malicia has eyes everywhere, and she has plans for the weapon, so some interventions by her can be expected. Still feels awfully confident to just assume you will win even if you start killing your own commanders
