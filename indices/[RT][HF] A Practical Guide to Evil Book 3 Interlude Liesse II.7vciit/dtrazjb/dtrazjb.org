Well this battle has turned into a complete shitshow. The only way I can imagine for the Legions to survive this would be for Catherine, Masego or Warlock to somehow seize control of either the wights or the gate. It shouldn't be /impossible/ given the importance of usurpation in sorcery, but I sure as hell can't see how they're going to manage it right now.
