I'm not sure this is Black's doing. Killing most of the generals during the battle would neatly avoid any suspicion that could be thrown Cat's way but at the same time the legions are already losing. Without the generals to lead them I honestly can't see them winning this one.

If I was being cynical I would say this is Malicia's plan. Get rid of the Black & Cat power block and eliminate Akua at the same time. She would stand to gain the most if all three died in this engagement as it would mean she would be the only power in the Empire and she had a lot of plausible deniability if the plan doesn't pan out.
