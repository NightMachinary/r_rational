I don't think that was Robber. As the comments on the chapter discuss, Goblin steel weapons are standard for high-ranking members of the Legions. Cat herself wields goblin steel, iirc. So there's no reason to believe those last two paragraphs mean a goblin was responsible. It could easily be an assassin planted by Akua, or even by Cordelia to weaken the Legions in preparation of her crusade.
