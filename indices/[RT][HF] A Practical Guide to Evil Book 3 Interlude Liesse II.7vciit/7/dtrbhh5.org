We were missing someone to replace Scribe of the old Calamities - to be affiliated, shady, deadly and not technically a Calamity. It seems to me like Robber is taking that role and here he is, cleaning up the Legions loyal to the Calamities.

We know Scribe and Assassin have an odd relationship, Robber and Theif fit to have their own.

It also seems to me like Black is knowingly helping to achieve this by overextending his Sixth back in the start. Well played Black, as brutal as ever.

Also, Talbot, you misunderstand what the Empress is doing to your country. Annexation in truth because it comes with merger.
