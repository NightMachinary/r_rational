No, Goblin steel means its wielded by someone from the legion. Not specifically a goblin.

Technically there's also resurrected wights that wield goblin steel, but their blade wouldn't have been poisoned (Why poison your blade if you are gonna fight undead?)

So its someone from her side, and it happened during the fighting, or i imagine she would have felt it.
