When reading Masego's segment, I couldn't help but recall:

We hold all Earth to plunder---

All Time and Space as well---

Too wonder-stale to wonder

At each new miracle;

Till, in the mid-illusion

Of Godhead 'neath our hand,

Falls multiple confusion

On all we did or planned---

The mighty works we planned.

-Kipling

It seemed... Appropriate.
