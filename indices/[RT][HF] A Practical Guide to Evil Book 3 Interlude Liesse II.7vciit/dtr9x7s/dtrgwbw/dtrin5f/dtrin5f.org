True. The kill could very well have come from Assassin. I've always suspected Assassin is her Spymaster and takes orders from Malicia and not Black. Remember that Assassin was in Procer when Black thought Assassin was supposed to be working on the Wandering Bard and nothing in the interludes thus far indicates that Black is actually close to Assassin.

Tinfoil theory: Cat will become the Black Queen and Malicia will marry Cat to seal the 2 kingdoms together, mirroring the Fae. It's already been setup by the fact that Cat notices Malicia is lesbian.
