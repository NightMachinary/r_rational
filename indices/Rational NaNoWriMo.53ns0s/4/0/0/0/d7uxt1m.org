I like your answer to the second question, but not the first. The Doctor is no paragon of altruism, but he never willfully chooses to not help people when he can. The reason his enemies keep surviving is because they're worthy opponents to him, not because he's unwilling to stop them permanently.

One thing that I think HPMOR did better than every other rational story I've read is that it acknowledges how unusual the psychology of munchkinism actually is. HJPEV is not a normal person and his worldview is as much an asset to him as it is a hindrance. He's really smart, but not always right.

So many stories I read here treat "world optimization" like its the obvious course of action that any smart person would follow, but it isn't. It's the product of a view of reality different from the norm that can be really useful, but is not universally better. Even HJPEV admitted he had much to learn from Hufflepuff.
