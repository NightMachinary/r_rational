The first question I have is precisely why the Doctor decides to change the universe instead of just tour it and help people he meets. I'm not objecting to an HJPEV-like Time Lord, but it's rather uncharacteristic of the Doctor to be proactive instead of reactive considering what sort of person he is and the way things have gone for him.

My second question is what genre this story will be. The series has played around with pretty much every kind of story, but at its core it's an adventure through interesting scenarios. If the protagonist is munchkining their way through all of time and space, how do you deliver the sense of exploration and wonder that the series is built around?
