I can't commit ahead of time since there's some real life stuff that might interfere. Specifically, early in November I'm going to ask my psychiatrist about reducing my dosage of antidepressants. Adjusting medication has never been a fun time for me, but it's either that or just keep taking it forever.

But if I /do/ take part in NaNoWriMo, I'll probably work on the rational Doctor Who serial I've been planning. It's a somewhat loose take on canon, which is notoriously poor with consistency. I'm hoping to tighten up the mechanics and nail down some of the setting to make it more rational.

I can probably answer questions about it, but I haven't come up with a spoiler-free way to summarise the plot.

Suffice it to say that this Doctor will be a lot more interested in bettering the universe than the canon version, who is mostly content to slay dragons while literal billions are dying in agony at all times due to causes unrelated to the monster of the week.

Naturally, this task is a lot harder than "come up with a brilliant solution at the last minute like always". It's harder even than the Doctor thinks, because he's not the only time-travelling immortal out there with designs on the universe.
