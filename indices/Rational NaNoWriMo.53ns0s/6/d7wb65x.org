I'm considering resurrecting [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4637439/chapters/10575111][rules of wishing]] and first finishing it off with a concluding chapter (which I've been intending to do for literally months) and then taking it apart and trying to fill in the gaps so that it actually covers the whole plot of the movie instead of just a collection of fragmented scenes.

Obviously this is not how you're "supposed" to do NaNoWriMo but I don't really care. :-)

This may all fall apart as a plan though as the rest of the year is looking likely to be very busy.
