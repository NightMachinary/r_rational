The only example I know of that comes close is the webcomic El Goonish Shive. Supernatural elements play a large part in the characters lives, but the majority of the comic is just slice of life drama with only occasional adventures. The way it pulls off rational romance is that all the characters are intelligent enough to ALWAYS talk to each other about their feelings, and empathetic enough to ALWAYS help each other through their problems. Expect plenty of anime-esque comedy, though.

The comic is a little long, it's been updating for over ten years, but I think it's a great example of a rational teen drama involving LGBT themes and the supernatural. The only problem is that it doesn't start out that way. The first few chapters aren't bad, they're just nothing exemplary since the author was still inexperienced. You can't just skip ahead, though, since you need the background to understand what's going on even if EVERY stupid or uncreative idea gets retconned away.
