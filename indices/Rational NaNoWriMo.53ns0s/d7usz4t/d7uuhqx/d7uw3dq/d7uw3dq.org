Spoilers ahead for people who haven't seen Doctor Who (mostly the new batch of seasons).

In canon, the Doctor has a lot of different characterisations, all of whom have essentially the same goals (i.e. travel with one or more companions and defeat the monster of the week). This is his status quo even after events that ought to have changed his approach.

E.g. his planet and species being destroyed by nigh-unstoppable aliens that he subsequently eradicated---except not well enough, because this existential threat to the universe keeps reappearing (as does the rest of his Rogue's Gallery, to borrow a term). Despite this, he is happy to wait for the next potential armageddon before doing anything.

Working backwards from his actions to estimate his motivations, we'd have to conclude that the canon Doctor craves the adventure, even after seeing what his failure to act ahead of time can do to the things he loves.

The second question is trickier. I'm planning to stick with the standard Doctor Who formula ("episodes" within larger arcs, with an overarching story theme). There will be the occasional Doctor PoV chapter where we see what he's actually doing, as well as hints throughout the other chapters.

The idea is that his adventures in the "main" chapters are his way of taking a break from the more boring work, and represent significant events and/or data for his larger goals.

Genre of each chapter will vary like the show's episodes do. Most of them will feature some sort of reason that "get in the Tardis and fix everything" won't work (a little more transparently than the show, where it's arbitrary and usually not mentioned so it can be a deus ex machina when it's needed).

I'm going to sleep now, so I can respond more thoroughly tomorrow.
