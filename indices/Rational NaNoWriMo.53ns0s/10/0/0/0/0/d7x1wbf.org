  being together leads to character growth and makes them better people

Yeah, another couple involves a lot of that - very timid, low self esteem sort of guy coming out of his shell. Good point about character growth in relationships, I will consider that carefully. I'm probably going to try for JaNoWriMo (january).

It's hard to have couples change though when many of my characters are multiple thousands of years old. I just don't see a personality changing that drastically, though I did do some drabble yesterday about a vampire coping with the fact that his relationship with his lover had changed ever since he turned him, which I suppose comes into it.

Actually... there's a lot of that stuff in there. Hmm. Thanks for that. Not sure if what I just said made any sense but you made me think and that's always a good thing!
