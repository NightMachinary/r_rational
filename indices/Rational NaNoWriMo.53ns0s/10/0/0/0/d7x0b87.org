I buy it, though the kind of romance stories I like is where being together leads to character growth and makes them better people. One of the relationships in EGS is a little like yours, though the supernatural character's quirks are more due to her upbringing instead of her nature.

The only exception I can think of is her sexuality, which the author actually apologized for when he realized his definition of bisexual was too restrictive. In no way did it hurt the character or the romantic arc, it was just a label and it was rectified it in-universe.
