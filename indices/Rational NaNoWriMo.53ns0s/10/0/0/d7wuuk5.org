Thanks for the webcomic recommendation! I'll have to check it out too.

I agree on having characters communicate. As a polyamorous person, communication and situations where it seems all the people concerned would be OK with polyamory but just dismiss the idea are my two romance story pet peeves, and I am very much on board with putting them aside.

Something I think probably exemplifies the types of stories we might tell:

A character is a 5,000 year old gargoyle and he romances a human woman. He is a good boyfriend, but he often goes on about how fragile humans are, how he can't wait to comfort her in her old age, how humans are so young and naive and such, and she's not cool with that. So they break up (after he tries to propose, because drama is always fun). She explains her concerns and, after trying to reason with her a few minutes, he sort of smiles and nods and apologises for wasting her time.

So then he goes and starts romancing a human man, still doing the same faux-pas, only the man doesn't mind because he's got different values to the woman - he even says "um, he's a five thousand year old fifteen foot tall monster who can fly. He /is/ better than humans".

No misunderstandings, no putting up with a lover with flaws, and no creepy "I will win her back at any cost!". After all, to a 5000 year old person, dating someone for a year is like you or I going on a few dates with someone. A first date is like a tinder conversation. He is not going to feel invested enough in a partner to do anything dramatic if it is clear they don't want him.
