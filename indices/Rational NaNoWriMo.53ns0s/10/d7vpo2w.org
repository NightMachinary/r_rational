I've always considered NaNoWriMo, but I wish it was January or February because November is always a terrible month for me (exams, weddings, buying/moving houses, and so on).

I want to finally novelise my "supernatural romance" story, and it'd be cool to get rational elements into it, but, honestly, it's just a vanity project with roleplaying characters me and my bff have had since we were 14, so I'm not sure anyone but our parents and partners would be interested in it.

So, maybe I'll do it in January or February, I don't know much about NaNoWriMo, can you just.... declare some other month your own personal one?

Does anyone have ideas on how to make a "supernatural romance" type story rational? It's a GLBT / feminist twist on the genre, but given it's more about relationships than "let's go destroy cthulu, who is taking over the world", is there much way that it can be made "rationalist"? We've been avoiding and subverting common tropes, especially the kind where the whole plot existing depends in a misunderstanding, but I'm not sure anything about it, beyond my own rationalist leanings, would ever be able to make such a story appropriate for this subreddit.
