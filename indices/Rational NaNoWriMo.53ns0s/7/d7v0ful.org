Going to be working on the book I started for last year's NaNo: Mapmaker, Mapbreaker - A world of deadly flora and fauna where, every ten years, a global earthquake violently rearranges the geography.

Part One is available [[https://goo.gl/gBzwCC][here]] in alpha reader form, if anyone's interested.

I will publish this goddamn book one day.
