I watched Steins;Gate, but it was a few years ago. I can't remember anything outstanding about how they presented the time-travel shenanigans. Can you explain what they did that would be useful for me to do in my story? Thanks!

I agreed that the characters were amazing, and the antagonists were kinda cliche villains.
