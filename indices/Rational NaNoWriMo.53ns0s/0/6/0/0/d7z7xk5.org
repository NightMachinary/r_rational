ooh this kind of thing is neat. Isn't there a free money recipe there? Like, precommit to betting on a particular team of a sports match (or anything with a binary outcome), make a save, bet lots of money on the sports match, if you win, great, if you lose, reset, then because you're aware that you've reset you therefore bet on the other team instead and win. Free money forever? Discounting butterfly effects like betting the other way causing the result to change somehow.
