First off, it's one save point at a time. So I can have a save at 9 am in the morning and reset to it as many times I want. But if I then make a new save at 10 am, then I can only reset to 10 am from now on and never reset to 9 am.

About memory loss being the same as death, it's an interesting philosophical question about whether or not losing memories truly counts as killing yourself. Because while I agree that forgetting the last five years of your life would be murder since I'm a different person from the me of five years ago, however if you only forget the last five minutes, hours, or days, it doesn't feel as if I'm really killing myself. I mean, if you lose the same memories due to being drunk or a concussion and only a small number of memories were lost, would you consider the person before and after the memory loss to be different people?

Finally, in most of the 'discarded' loops the protagonist is going through, he is spending the time testing out the consequences of different actions (passwords to a bank account), doing mind-numbing amount of research to learn about some important information in time, or to learn about some important future event to gain some foreknowledge. Most of this will be boring or unimportant to remember. If you forgot non-essential memories such as what you ate for breakfast, and remembered important information such as your parents' names, wouldn't that lessen the chances of you becoming a different person after losing such trivial memories?
