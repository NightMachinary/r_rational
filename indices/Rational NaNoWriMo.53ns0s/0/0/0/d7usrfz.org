It depends on how EXACTLY the power works, but you can track your loops if you get the "feeling" at the moment of your last reset. Since Xamuel's still in the brainstorming phase, they can choose to make the power work like this.

In that case, each day, or 3 days, or week, I sit down in my chair at 7:55 am and watch my computer clock. At 8:00, if I don't have "the feeling", I set my save point. If I have "the feeling" at 8:00, I will wait to save at 8:01 instead. If I get "the feeling" X time, I'll set my save point to 1 minute past X. Thus, if I get "the feeling" at 8:04 am, I know I've reset my timeline four times this week for some reason. I set my reset at 8:05 am, and I start to brainstorm why I would feel the need to reset my timeline four times.

If you can do this, you can do other things, too. For instance, if you know you have a problem coming up that you might want to reset, you could write out solutions ahead of time, before 8 am on Sunday, and label them. E.g, Loop 1, try X, Loop 2, try Y. (Though in practice, if you get "The feeling" at 8:00 am, you should probably start leaving earlier or later than usual for appointments this week; you might have been caught in a near-death situation like being hit by a car.)

Again, this would assume that if you're in, say, Loop 4, you only get "The feeling" at the moment you started Loop 3. For the purpose of an interesting story, I think it should probably be made to function like this.
