Cool, and thanks for the encouragement. You've been really helpful in forcing me to explicitly explain the trickier bits.

Maybe I'll leave it as an unanswered question. I wasn't planning on showing the reader what happens in the 'discarded' time loops at all, so readers will always be left wondering as the protagonist muses on the exact same question.
