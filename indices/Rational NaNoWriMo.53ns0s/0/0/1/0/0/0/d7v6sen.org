Eh, a world in which he successfully avoids an infinite loop through extreme caution, and a world in which there's a get-out-clause which will prevent an infinite loop should one otherwise arise, are indistinguishable.

And it's a small jump from successfully avoiding all infinite loops through extreme caution, to mostly doing so aside from some occasional luck. Kind of like how [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] has an in-universe explanation for the early story's apparent plot-armor, this sort of behind-the-scenes mechanic might smooth things for those with just the right style of willing suspension of disbelief.

At any rate.

I love your idea for the story, and look forward to reading whatever you write.
