Exactly. It's an exercise in precommitment, because this power is at it's strongest when it's used exactly once. If it's used twice, then it becomes an infinite loop, because the first and second loop differed with respect to a signal sent from the future, but a second and third loop will be completely identical (due to identical starting conditions) and that leads to infinite loops.

It's a dangerous power and the protagonist is going to be /extremely/ cautious with it.
