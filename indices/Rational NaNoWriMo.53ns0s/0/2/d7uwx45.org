This sounds awesome.

  I need to do some thinking to explain why deliberately inconsistent timelines will not occur

Physically this is easy to justify any number of ways. Mechanically it's a non-issue. Might as well worry about why, in a story with free-will, the characters never choose to just spontaneously start behaving contrary to all your previous characterization. Or, why don't you ever test your freewill by jumping out of your car while driving down the highway? The only consistent scenario is one in which incentives and actions align, but that is nothing novel to your setting. You just need to make sure that the setting is realistic, in that the incentives never fail to align with the actions. The best system is one in which your protagonist never /wants/ to send back different data, but the reasons do not need to follow /directly/ from the message on the note. It is in fact more interesting, and more realistic, if they do not.

So, yes, if your physics says that the protagonist will never successfully send back inconsistent data, then your universe needs to be one in which the protagonist never does so - BUT, this doesn't require anything so heavy-handed as "do not mess with Time." That message served purposes in HPMOR (Harry bullheadedly trying to turn Time to his advantage and only stopping when confronted with threat surpassing his capacity to imagine, together with demonstrating to the reader the insurmountability of the task by practically personifying Time as a potentially malignant and super-powered opponent to any such attempt). Unless your story absolutely needs a similar treatment, it would be infinitely more interesting to produce something more subtle; where, at the time that the character understands why they would have wanted to send back the note and how it will affect things, sending back that note is precisely what they want. Mechanisms include

1. Desireable outcomes outweighing the UnDesireable at the moment the note is sent [but before all of the potentially UnDesireable ramifications are clear]

2. external influences which prevent contradictory note-sending inbetween an incentive to do so and the actual sending [Do Not Mess With Time would fall under this]

3. knowledge that it is impossible to "alter" the past and so an unwillingness to test it at every opportunity [this was the consequence of Do Not Mess With Time]

Out of these, (1) is the cleanest, followed by (3) (absent truly dire threats on the part of Time, (3) is hard to justify), and both trailed by (2). The less that (2) seems external, and the more that it blends into (1) as part of the background information influencing the decision of how to proceed, the better it plays.

This would be facilitated by a hard-coded, Physics based note-sending mechanism that prevents sending notes inbetween the arrival and sending of previous notes, so that incomplete information and inability to intervene remain your tools despite the power afforded by the time messenger's system.
