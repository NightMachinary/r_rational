From the antagonist's perspective, the timeline is immutable, however the protagonist sees it as mutable instead. So the way it works is that the antagonist's Stable Time Loop messages can predict the protagonist's actions in his *current* loop/iteration. However when the protagonist resets, the antagonist will be likely to have received a different message (or none at all) due to the differing actions the protagonist takes.
