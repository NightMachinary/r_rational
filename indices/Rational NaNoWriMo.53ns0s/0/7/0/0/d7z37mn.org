That's a possible conflict. If the antagonist believes time is immutable then the protagonist can kill him and the rest of the Universe when he loads a save point.

Alternatively, there is some life-threatening risk and the protagonist wants to use very high-risk/high-reward methods to solve it, reasoning that he can just load a savepoint if he fails. The antagonist is worried that the protagonist isn't really /changing/ the timeline, just moving to an alternate timeline, therefore he will be stuck in the 'failed' timeline living with the results of the protagonist's reckless plan.
