  why isn't she getting a message every smallest unit of time theoretically possible
#+end_quote

The intuitive answer that makes sense to me is that the events of getting a message can't be treated as independent of each other. Since we are dealing with the type of time-travel where the future explicitly influences the past, then the message you get now is affected by the message you get later the following day, even if you 'sent' the first message before you get the second message.

A timeline where you get the message 'You will have a nice day', send that, and then get the message 'No you won't!' is different from the timeline where you get the message 'You will have a nice day', send that, and then (after three days) get the message 'No you won't!'.

So when my protagonist gets the very first message ever, the entire timeline of every single action she ever does using this power until she dies/stops using the power permanently is predetermined.

So now that I have explained that all messages ever sent has an effect on every other message sent, the only thing left is to explain why one self-consistent timeline is selected over another self-consistent timeline. I feel the best way to do this intuitively is via a probability distribution where each timeline has a prior likelihood chance of occurring and timelines which both better match the timing and the wording of her messages with her personality (and events in the story) have a greater chance of coming true. While she can still receive strange messages which are very unlikely to be sent by herself, they will be accompanied with either her attempting to create inconsistent timelines and/or extreme events such as near-death scenarios where she is 'pressured' to send unusual messages to force the timeline into ones where she stops messing with inconsistency/survives.

  blatant Bootstrap Paradoxes
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how to answer this question, since it feels to me that this is something that can happen. But I'm having trouble thinking of a scenario which is a Bootstrap Paradox. Do you mind coming up with one and I can explain why it does or doesn't work? Note that only one message can be sent at a time and a second message can only be received after the first message has been sent.

Hope I explained everything clearly enough.

EDIT: I just did some research into what a Bootstrap paradox is and I realized that "Back to the Future" movie involved one where Marty plays a song from the future at the school dance, but it turns out that he was the original originator of the song. The question is, who was the "inventor" of the song?

Combining it with my earlier discussion about how different self-consistent timelines each have separate probability of coming true (which all sum to 1), I would say that Bootstrap Paradoxes are fully possible, but the spontaneous generation of information requires a probability penalty which decreases the likelihood of it occurring. A very interesting example is the "Do Not Mess With Time" message, because the protagonist had no intention of writing that message, and the very existence of the message is what causes the message to be sent/created in the first place. Therefore the timeline has to be under pressure/in danger of becoming inconsistent, before Bootstrap messages start spontaneously occurring.

Another example I've been playing with is an emergency system, where the protagonist will precommit to sending inconsistent messages when she is in danger of dying. Since this causes pressure on the timeline, she will receive messages that warn her of the danger.

Yes, it gives her an insane amount of power. The story is centered around how one person with a weaker form of time travel can win against someone with a stronger power.
