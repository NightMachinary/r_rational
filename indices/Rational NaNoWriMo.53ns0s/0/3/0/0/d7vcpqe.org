With the 'Do Not Mess With Time' message, that warning message is itself a bootstrap paradox, to an extent. In general, any time the person bases the message they send back on the message they received, the information has spawned out of nowhere. Your idea of probability penalties is good, though, and what's notable about Do Not Mess With Time is that while it, after a fashion, created itself, the amount of information being bootstrapped is very small compared to what Harry was hoping for, information that would allow him to solve any code with ease. I can't remember where, but I think Yudkowsky even said once that he built his time turner mechanics around the smallest amount of information from nothing.

What you say about everything being predetermined from the first message... I don't quite grasp it. Unless I'm fatally misunderstanding this, the universe shouldn't care if she's very confused or frustrated with her power. Unless a weighing system is in place to choose one way of going about things (like your Bootstrap Paradox aversion principle), shouldn't every universe in which she only ever receives messages that she will accurately send back be valid, including ones where she gets a new message immediately, always, or never gets a second one to begin with? I mean, this can be avoided by having her prophecies come to her as she requests them, but I've been getting the impression that's not what you're doing, so I'm not sure how you can concoct rules of time that will lead to a frequency of prophecies that wouldn't be out of place.

And as for precommitments, well, the Do Not Mess With Time Travel message Harry got was on the heels of him precommiting to answer in certain ways to the message he got and force the timeline to give him the information he wanted. Assuming a similar level of aversion for the Bootstrap Paradox, shouldn't something similar happen to convince your protagonist to abandon her precommitments instead of giving her information ex nihilo?
