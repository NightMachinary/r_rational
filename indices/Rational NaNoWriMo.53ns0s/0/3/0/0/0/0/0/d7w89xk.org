Shoooot! I wrote a super long post detailing my explanation and it got deleted immediately after I finished typing it all up!!!!

/Inhales, exhales/

First off, your first paragraph lines up with what I was trying to explain about the bootstrap, so you got that right.

The second paragraph...you need to understand that the protagonist has the power to render any timeline she dislikes inconsistent, even if that fact won't be obvious in the story. All we see are timelines where she either approves, or for some reason failed to render it inconsistent.

If she was the sort of person who would always send the message back, regardless of whatever the message says, then all messages have an equal probability of being sent back in time (before we start assigning information bootstrapping penalties). However if she is willing to refuse to send back messages she doesn't like, then she can render the timeline inconsistent and therefore retroactively cause the message to not be sent at all in the first place. That's why if she isn't concerned about consistency, then she can massively affect the probability distribution of the timelines.

Let side track into a brief example of Quirrelmort from HPMOR. If you read the story carefully, you'll notice that he attempted multiple times to prevent the prophecy from coming true. While he failed in the story, it was actually a very good policy. Because if prophecies are like Stable Time Loops, then the timelines where he succeeded will be rendered inconsistent and Quirrel manages to avoid being involved in prophecies. If he never even tried to escape any prophecies, then he would likely be involved in many more prophecies. The likelihood of being in an undesirable timeline increases as the user's willingness to make it inconsistent goes down.

Do you understand that the protagonist's reaction to the message contents and the likelihood that she lets the timeline be consistent or inconsistent affects how likely it is for her to receive the message in the first place?

[[/u/TimTravel]] posted a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xie39/time_travel_and_why_everyone_gets_it_wrong/][link]] about similar mechanics behind Stable Time Loops and he covers a similar example about HPMOR at the end of the post (actually I just stole his).

I need to spend some time thinking about what it would do to the consistency of the timeline if the protagonist lies to herself in the message, because I'm very sure that lying would lead to inconsistency, but I'm not sure yet.
