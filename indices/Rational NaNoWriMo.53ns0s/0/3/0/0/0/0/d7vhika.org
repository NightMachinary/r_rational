What I was talking about with precommitments wasn't about 'whether to use the power or not' type of precommitment, but a precommitment toward what type of information is sent back. I was hypothesizing that between Harry's plan of a timeline in which he receives information which fits unique criteria from his precommitments that lets the same message be sent back, and the timeline in which he is spooked out of his precommitments and sends a lower-information message back, the lower-information timeline would be more highly weighted. The time travel wouldn't seek to prevent its own use, but instead to minimize bootstrapping within its own use.

Also, and this is the one part I'm still really fuzzy on, there's a principle at work here where the probability of the timeline is directly related to the willingness a person would have to send the message back /if they weren't concerned about consistency/? As in, I know that I would tire of sending test messages back at myself but if I kept receiving them I would always send them back, zealously and without fail, because I know I couldn't violate the consistency. But at the same time, the principle works in such a way that, since I /wouldn't/ care about the message if consistency weren't pushing me to send it, the timeline with that message is weighted less favourably?
