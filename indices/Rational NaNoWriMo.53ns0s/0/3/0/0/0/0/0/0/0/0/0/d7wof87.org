You see the timeline as 'reserving' points in time for messages and it has the room to fit other messages because the timeline machine isn't being used during the empty time periods.

But I see the messages as being affected by when she does or doesn't get a message. A timeline where she gets a message only at 8 am is different from the timeline where she gets the /exact/ same message at 8 am and another message at 10 am. The timeline with two messages, I consider to, by necessity, to have a lower probability.

Let me try a different line of reasoning. The timelines are like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy][Conjunction Fallacy]] where the probability of a ball is red has to be greater than the probability of a ball being both red and striped. Similarly, when you have two timelines with identical messages, but timeline B also has another message in addition. Therefore timeline A has the higher probability, unless only one message leads to inconsistency and two messages allow consistency (somehow).

Sorry if this is unclear. I'm a little rushed right now.
