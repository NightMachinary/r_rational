I'm still not quite sure I understand the rules about /why/ a time loop message is happening or not, at any given point. The link you have covered the reason behind paradoxes being excluded in good detail, explaining that the universe would skew probability to ensure any timelines which result in paradox do not happen. But one thing, the assumption I'm not 100% certain is being made here, is that each time loop message is being considered an event that could happen or not, and paradox-exclusion behaviours make that specific loop not happen at all, instead of default to a different timeline.

Let me explain. You said that if your protagonist got incessant messages from her future self, always on the heels of the last message, she would refuse to send a consistent message back, and that therefore the message would never have been sent in the first place. But I don't see any reason why no message can happen there anymore. Even if we have to resort to quantum silliness that shapes events in incredibly improbable ways, there should be at least one path of causality where even your prideful protagonist sends a consistent message back. This is a bit different from what I was talking about earlier, but none of your rules seem to cover why a time period /must/ go without a message when there exists at least one timeline in which a consistent message could be sent.
