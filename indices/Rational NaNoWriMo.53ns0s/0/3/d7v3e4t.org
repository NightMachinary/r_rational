An important question to consider about your time travel message power is the question of how frequent these messages will come. There's no causal answer, because the Self-Consistency Principle mandates that the state of the future dictate the state of the past. If your character receives from the future knowledge that she wore a green shirt the next day, it should be entirely within her power to wear blue, but that result is inconsistent with the fundamental mechanics of the universe. It shouldn't even matter if 'she wouldn't disobey her future self', since the /possibility/ that, according to causality, that future doesn't come to pass is at odds with the nature of the time travel. If this is to work properly, the sanctity of the time loop must be 100% certain before causality can be allowed any usage at all.

Instead of a vague 'timeline prime' or anything like that, you can start from an a-causal position, and form a set of sorts, containing every possible universe causally diverging from different time travel events. As in, suppose a TARDIS showed up, you'd have a universe for every thing that could be inside the TARDIS, regardless of how possible it should be for that thing to get there. And I'm talking everything, including a Hitler made of antimatter. The next thing to do is cut away all universes that don't result in the same time travel event that happened at the beginning of the observed period. In this way, you are left with all possible universes that follow the Self-Consistency Principle.

The question here is how to choose one, and when and why they happen. Causality is out of the question, because we have to approach this a-causally to make it make sense, so why isn't your character getting messages that result in blatant Bootstrap Paradoxes and why isn't she getting a message every smallest unit of time theoretically possible? These, I think, are questions that you should explore.
