I've been thinking of stretching my writing muscles again with a near-future horror story set in the asteroid belt.

Still in the early, early, early planning stages at this point so not much is set in stone, but I want a protagonist who decides that the future is taking too long to arrive, steals a mining ship his company is working on, and takes his family out to the belt to prove there are untold riches waiting for humanity to reach out and take them. And then they're all horribly killed by monsters for my own sick pleasure.
