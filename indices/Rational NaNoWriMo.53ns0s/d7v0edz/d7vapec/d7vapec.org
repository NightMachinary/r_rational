Do you need monsters to write space horror?

I'd be interested in a story where it's just the (underestimated) dangers of living on space that threaten, made worse by the stubborn protagonist and other personality clashes. In space, character and environment are threats enough to dispense with an antagonist - and as /The Martian/ shows, you don't even need character threats.

You could have monsters and be very carefully ambiguous as to whether they really exist...
