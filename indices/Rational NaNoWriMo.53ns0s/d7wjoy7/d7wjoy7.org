I plan to do Nano, but am still not sure which of two ideas I'm going with. One is based on djinn with relatively limited power, which will involve at least one djinni 'owner' questioning the morality of slavery, the dangers of setting free non-human powerful entities, and how best to munchkin wish granting spells invented in much earlier times (e.g. the door opening spell gives you a 'key' that opens all locks that are locked with a keyhole - so no good for combinations or rfid scanners) Two is a world where some people get to live their lives over again - i.e. not reincarnation, but actually going back to when they were a baby and reliving the same years. Since this is effectively the same world as The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August it would effectively be a fanfic of that.

I don't know how rational either would end up, though there will definitely be munchkinry and hopefully a lack of people being egregiously stupid or pointlessly evil.

Neither idea yet has a decent antagonist or enough conflict, which is a problem :-(
