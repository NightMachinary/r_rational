Doh! I mistyped and put down 'ten days' for next month instead of 'in a month'. Thanks for the catch!

I'm posting about this early, because some people won't think about the event until they get an external remainder such as a [[/r/rational]] post. At that point it's hard to plan out story ideas within a week without being discouraged. I'm hoping by posting about this a month in advance, people will be better motivated to write and plan the story.

I'll post about the event again when there's only a week left, but if people think I should take it down, then I will do so.

We could always use more writers on this subreddit! ;)
