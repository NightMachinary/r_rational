I won't be doing a full-on NaNoWriMo project, but there's a decent chance I'll end up finishing my current work-in-progress in or around November.

This one is a blend of a magical school story (stylistically similar to Mother of Learning) and a JRPG-style uber dungeon crawl. It's got a pretty heavy focus on magic theory and making magical items, which I think the [[/r/rational]] crowd will probably enjoy.
