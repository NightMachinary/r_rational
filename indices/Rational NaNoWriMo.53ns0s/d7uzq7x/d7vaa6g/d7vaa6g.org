That sounds like a fairly straightforward fantasy adventure, which is unusual coming from you. I'm all for it, I like fantasy adventures, but after reading Metropolitan Man, A Bluer Shade of White, and the first four chapters of Shadows of the Limelight I'm convinced you don't have it in you to write something that sticks to genre conventions. There has to be a major twist somewhere, or you wouldn't be writing it.

Limelight is a a unique and original take on both fantasy and superheroes that rationalizes the romanticized narratives of both genres in a uniquely meta way, but it does not deliver a traditionally satisfying narrative. Every single character is an actor playing a role for a fictional audience, so their real lives are purposefully written to be less interesting than their dramatized ones in order for the story to work.
