Quantum indeterminacy could mean that an "infinite time loop" does not consist of identical loops.

You have the option of random quantum fluctuations causing the flapping of butterflies wings causing slightly greater drafts causing closed curtains preventing a passerby from seeing a vase in a window and thinking about his mother and being 15 seconds late to a meeting where his color of shirt would cause the protagonist to think about the color blue which means he more focused as he walks down the stairs and so notices the attacker before getting stabbed.

And when we're talking an infinite number of attempts and unrestricted (though improbable) fluctuations, breaking out of the infinite loop is inevitable.

He wouldn't know it, but the reader could, and this would allow some "good luck" with an in-world justification.
