That's something I could use to justify why the protagonist is never 'stuck' forever in some loop. But if I accept this as a rule for his power, then due to the nature of infinity, from the protagonist's point of view, he will always be 'lucky' and succeed in anything he wants. He'd literally be guaranteed to never fail if he's capable of always resetting until he gets what he wants (assuming I allow auto-resets in the case of death).

It's too 'strong' of a power and I don't see an obvious way to nerf it. Therefore I decided that perfect determinism is a thing and unless the protagonist figures out a way to vary his actions loop-to-loop, he will perfectly repeat what he did in the last loop and get stuck in an infinite loop. It'll be a creeping threat where he's always tempted to reset 'one' more time when he's in dangerous situation, even if he 'forgets' about the threat when he resets.

Also, I'm dealing with non-Turing-computable operations with the Novikov time power, so the laws of physics are not exactly what we know it to be.
