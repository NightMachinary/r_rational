Ooo, you seem to have a better understanding of how to explain why my protagonist doesn't try for deliberately inconsistent timelines. I will go with at least one Do Not Mess With Time experience, because like you said, (3)'s hard to justify without at least one such experience. Also, I'm writing the story for you guys and you all will get on my case to why didn't she try it at least once.

  Physics based note-sending mechanism

She will have a machine that only has two displays for input and output. She will see a note on the output display which will somehow lead to her typing the exact same message when she next types at the input display.

  prevents sending notes inbetween the arrival and sending of previous notes
#+end_quote

What do you mean by this? She can send her message anytime after she receives the message in question. There's no limitations like HPMOR's Time-Turners' eight hour time limit. Or did you mean the ability to send multiple messages in a different order than she receives them, because she can only send one message at a time.
