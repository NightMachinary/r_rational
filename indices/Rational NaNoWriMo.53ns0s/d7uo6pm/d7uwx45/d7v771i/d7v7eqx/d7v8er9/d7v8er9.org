Oh god! I don't want to deal with that headache. It's a lot easier to explain in a visual medium like a movie than in a book. It's to keep things as simple as possible that I'm only allowing one message at a time and she can only receive a new message after she has sent the previous message. It's only barely within my ability to easily conceptualize all of the ramifications of such a power. The multiple message version would be so complicated that I would always be wondering if I screwed something up.

Maybe I'll try that version of time-travel once I have finished writing about the one-message case.
