  I'm playing around with a protagonist who has the time travel power of making 'save' points in time and he can reset to that saved time at will and as many time as he likes. The drawback is that he can only have one 'save' and he looses all memories of what happened after the save.

How is going back to the save point not equivalent to killing yourself, then? And is it one save at a time, or one save ever?
