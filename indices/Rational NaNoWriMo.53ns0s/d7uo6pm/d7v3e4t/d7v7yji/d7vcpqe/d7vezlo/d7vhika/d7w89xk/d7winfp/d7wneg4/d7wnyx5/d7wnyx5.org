Okay, so when calculating which messages are sent the highest priority consistent timeline gets its timespan reserved, for lack of a better word, and any other messages have to fit around the high-priority message. And as the protagonist becomes less inclined to respond consistently to a repeat message, it becomes lower priority and more likely to be displaced by a more highly-rated message.

I suppose, then, the problem is what happens between the 'reserved' time slots? If she gets an 'important' message at 2 PM, sends it back at 4 PM, and gets another high-priority one at at 9 PM, it should be possible to squeeze another message between the two, a consistent timeline in which the message is received after 4 PM and is sent back before 9 PM (say, 7 PM to 8 PM). If there is no higher-priority message to be sent, I've seen no defined reason for that message to not be sent, and the logic would continue onwards, filling every gap of time larger than a minute or so between higher-priority message with lower-priority messages.
