So the evaluation of probable time-loop messages is based on a superstructure in which multiple messages decreases the probability of that individual timeline. Is there an inherent limitation of scope to this, or are we considering this superstructure to extend indefinitely forwards? Because if the latter, how is more than one message to be sent if the inherent nature of a second message at any point within the scope would decrease the priority of such a timeline? Is there some sort of accumulating push in the system that forces messages that would, overall, lower total priority after time has passed?
