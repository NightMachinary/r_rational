The predetermined timeline is because we know that between receiving the message and then sending it, the timeline has to be predetermined. I'm simply extending it to the entire timeline, because to me, it doesn't make sense for only part of the timeline to be predetermined and for it to be non-deterministic in between messages. So I'm working off the idea that the entire timeline is deterministic, but it gives the illusion of being non-deterministic, due to people having incomplete information. You can still make a choice and have free-will. It's just that events are determined before you have consciously decided what you are going to do. That's the best I can do to explain that the timeline is globally predetermined rather than in local temporal sections.

Now the Bootstrap Paradox aversion principle I feel has a very strong influence on the timing and the contents of the message. However, I don't feel as if it's enough to explain why some timelines are chosen over others. It minimizes the amount of new information and can be leveraged for more information when the protagonist starts forcing inconsistent solutions otherwise. It also allows for the protagonist to receive messages immediately after sending the previous one. So there can be a 'flood' of meaningless messages which the protagonist then keep sending due to fear of creating inconsistent timelines. However, I consider such a scenario to be unlikely since the protagonist will get annoyed and stop spamming herself with annoying messages.

It's a logical contradiction to create an inconsistent timeline and she literally can't ever make one. Therefore the frequency of sent messages is dependent on how likely she's willing to send the message back. Yes due to the infinite number of possible timelines there will always be some where she sends a new message immediately after the last one, but there are far more timelines where she sends messages as needed rather than as soon as possible. I probably didn't explicitly say this, but she can control when to send a message back as long as it's after she sent the previous message. If there are many timelines where she sends the same message to 8 am with minor variations, and very few timelines where she sends the message at 12:38 pm, then she's more likely to send the message at times convenient for herself at 8 am.

This is a form of time travel that I see as being very strongly dependent on the personality of the user. If you were a fearful person who earnestly believes not sending the messages will lead to death of the universe, then you will be a neurotic mess who constantly sends message after message. My protagonist is a very prideful women (to the point of arrogance) who has confidence in her intellectual faith that inconsistent timelines are truly impossible. In fact, there will be an early experiment where she keeps sending 'test' messages to herself on the heels of the previous message, she will get annoyed and thinks to herself that she won't send the next message before worrying about inconsistency issues. She immediately stops receiving messages, and she will realize that the timing of the messages are dependent on how likely future her will actually send the message.

EDIT: Added the following paragraph.

Due to her willful personality and willingness to send messages despite disturbing warnings, it actually requires a large amount of information to cause her to abandon the ability if it's at all possible. You might be thinking that since the timeline is trying to minimize the amount of information generated from nothing, it will try to get her to abandon the ability. However, she /knows/ time travel is possible and has the will/madness to poke at it despite any time shenanigans to not do so. According to my rules, the most likely timelines should be ones where time-travel is never invented or abandoned immediately. But timelines are selected based on message consistency, which won't prevent the invention of time-travel. Also if people can get past the early experimentation where warning messages to stop messing with time-travel and do so anyway, it will lead to inconsistent messages as people tire of sending warning messages back, and stop doing so. Basically under my rules, there can only be one "Do Not Mess With Time" and after that people are less frivolous with the power.

Gah! It's a little twisty to try explaining how timelines are deterministic, yet can be treated as probability distributions. I decided to try writing the rules down to better formalize it.

*Rules of Time Travel*

1. Inconsistent timelines are impossible.

2. Timelines with higher probability are more likely to occur.

3. Likelihood of a timeline is determined by the number of timelines where the user decides on the same message content and timing. Or in clearer wording, the likelihood of the user sending back the same message she receives. Or is the inverse of the probability the user will make the timeline inconsistent.

4. Timelines are globally deterministic and not locally. All events are predetermined, not just the next few days.

5. Information has a probability penalty which decreases the likelihood of a timeline. Messages with less information generated from nothing have less of a penalty to the likelihood of the timeline.

6. As the number of inconsistent timelines go up, more information can be generated from nothingness to preserve the consistency of the timeline.

Sorry for rambling so much!

EDIT: Added to rule #3. That's going to be the hardest rule to explain in the story.
