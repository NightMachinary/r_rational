I don't think that will be a concern, because it doesn't make sense to me if the ability can affect events unrelated to the time message. I mean, there shouldn't be freak accidents that cause the time machine to send the same message without any input from the antagonist. Instead, the information in the time message has to somehow cause the protagonist to send the exact same message without unrelated events occurring. This means that this form of time travel can't do anything to prevent it's invention and I believe that consistent timelines where people are frightened off investigating the time-travel device shouldn't have higher probabilities than consistent timelines where people use it at a semi-frequent basis. I mean, timelines where people are spooked require a very unusual and unlikely message(s) to be sent.

Now you might wonder what would happen if the protagonist decides to force only inconsistent timelines. She can do so by sending a blank message if she gets a message with text, sending a text message 'Experimental Message' if she gets a blank message, sending a blank message if she gets no message, and to follow the previous three conditions no matter what message she sees. My reasoning is that messages can affect the contents of earlier messages, so if she is just deciding to try an experiment to force inconsistent timelines only and hasn't yet come up with the details of the experiment, then she will start receiving messages warning/scaring her out of trying the experiment. In fact, I'm planning a spooky thing where as she comes up with the idea, she'll get a message to check the first letter of every previous message ever sent and the letters spell out "WE ARE WATCHING YOU" or something like that.
