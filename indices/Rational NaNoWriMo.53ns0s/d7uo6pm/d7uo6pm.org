Since I am the original poster, I'll put my story idea out there first.

I'm playing around with a protagonist who has the time travel power of making 'save' points in time and he can reset to that saved time at will and as many time as he likes. The drawback is that he can only have one 'save' and he looses all memories of what happened after the save. He only knows if he is on his first pass of the timeline or if he is on a timeline after resetting at least once. It's an interesting power because it's so deceptively weak.

His antagonist is someone who also has a time travel power where she can receive short messages from the future, but the messages follow the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle][Novikov Self-Consistency Principle]] that no matter what message she receives, it will be the same message she sends back. I need to do some thinking to explain why deliberately inconsistent timelines will not occur, but I know that paradoxes by their nature simply can't occur, so she'll probably experience something like HPMOR's "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" to set her straight.

I have the early experimentation planned out for both time powers. However, the only thing I'm having issue with this story is a conflict to base the story around. If you guys want suggest anything, I'm all ears! I prefer a Good vs Good conflict and am very flexible with respect to setting (sci-fi, fantasy, or steam-punk).

EDIT: An idle thought I had was to take the idea of soulmates (where everyone has a magical tattoo with their destined one's name) and all that it entails about predestination and subvert the cliche tru-luv!, but I don't really know how to best include it in the story as a /third/ time travel mechanic without it getting messy. I rather have the story focus more on scientific experimentation than on relationship drama anyway.
