It wasn't the use of time travel that impressed me, it was why it was being used that made the conflict interesting. The characters were given access to a time machine and used it to make changes to their personal history to try and make their lives happier. Even the villains, as nonsensical as I thought their motives were, put the protagonist in a position where he had to choose which of his friends' lives, and quality of life, he valued more.

It was that intense personal nature of the conflict that made it work. I hated the evil conspiracy because the story had nothing to do with investigating a conspiracy, it was a character-focused drama framed around a sci-fi gadget. Adding a rationalist to the story actually would have hurt it because it was their irrationality that made the characters feel human. They were just regular, flawed people trying their best to be happy with mixed success.
