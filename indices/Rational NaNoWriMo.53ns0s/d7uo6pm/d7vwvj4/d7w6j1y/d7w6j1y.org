Your comment confuses me. Why doesn't it matter that universes with Stable Time Loops can't occur naturally? I'm just writing a story where people somehow live in a reality where this is a real thing.

Or are you trying suggest an idea for the story to explain the phenomena?

Thanks for the link though. I already knew about it but I appreciate the gesture.
