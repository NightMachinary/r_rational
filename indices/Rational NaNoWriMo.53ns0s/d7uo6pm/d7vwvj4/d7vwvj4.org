Universes that contain Stable Time Loops cannot occur naturally, because the particular set of loops in the universe has to be selected out of all the possible sets. The selection can only be done by an entity that is outside the universe and has full control over it. In other words, any rational character who encounters a loop should realize that they are mere characters in a story.

See Yudkowsky's discussion of a looping Game of Life [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/fok/causal_universes/][here]].
