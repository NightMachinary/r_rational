It's not particularly rational (it's more humanist), and I didn't write it during November, but I wrote over 1,000 words a day for 48 days earlier this year as I was writing [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/therapy-a-wormfic.29673/][Therapy]].

Eventually I had to slow down, to preserve my Sanity. People who do this for a living have my undying respect, and I wasn't even doing much world building!

Writing is hard. Don't beat yourself up if you can't do as much of it as you would like, or can't do it at all.
