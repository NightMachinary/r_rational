This is exactly the scenario I considered in Set In Stone. Someone plugged me with a link earlier (which is how I found this thread.)

After colonizing an extremely metal-poor world, Humanity finally manages to create a stable, sane, AI, and convince it that humanity is required for it's long-term sanity. The AI, in turn, determines that humans are insufficiently sane. So it suppresses technology and engages in a very long term biological and societal experiment in an effort to reduce humanity's aggressive violent tendencies.

That's the backstory. The story itself is told from the point of view of a young swineherd with worrisome violent tendencies, who has to navigate through a scenario of potential war in a society that hasn't seen a war in a thousand years.

The story is a readable draft, but due to my change of career and working 80+ hour weeks for the last year or so, I have not edited it for publication yet.
