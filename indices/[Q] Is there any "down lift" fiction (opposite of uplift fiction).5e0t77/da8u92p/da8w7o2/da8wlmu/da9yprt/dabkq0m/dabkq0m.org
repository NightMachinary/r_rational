There's a subgenre of rational fiction where an entity has alien values but rationally pursues their goals. So for example, if my main character had a value of "maximize the number of paperclips in the universe" I could write a rational story about that, even if it's a stupid value to have.

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/][See: Reactionary Philosophy in an Enormous Planetsized Nutshell]]. I think it's incorrect, but I will say that I think it's not /so/ incorrect as to be completely outside the bounds of what a rational person might believe. (Though downlifting a society would require another leap of logic.)
