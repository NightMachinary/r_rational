Well I can think of writing a story of how a group of people tries to ban "high frequency trading" globally and fail followed by the sequels where they manage to get it banned in one country e.g. Switzerland through the direct democracy... this story could naturally be told through the groups or one of the people who try to oppose them (both could have rational actors).
