Stargate had 2 episodes about a race that did this in season 4 and 5 (spoilers as to how obviously).

The first episode was set 10 years ahead of the shows present time. The characters had contacted an advanced race called the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5gmcc4/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/daulxv5][Aschen]], who shared their technology with Earth. The Goa'uld are wiped out, the public transportation system uses personal teleporter pads, an anti-aging vaccine has been distributed worldwide, and the beginnings of a plan to turn Jupiter into a star are being discussed. One of the characters discover that the anti-aging vaccine has actually caused sterility in over 90% of the human population in a long term invasion plan by the Aschen. The characters use a time travel application of the Stargate to to warn their past selves, who receive a bloody note in their own handwriting telling them that under no circumstances to visit (address of the Aschen homeworld).

Next season, we see an example of another race who have been downlifted by the Aschen into a primarily agrarian society who export most of the food they farm to to the Aschen and who have no memory of ever having been an industrial civilization. The characters eventually discover some industrial ruins and a newspaper headline proclaiming "Aschen vaccine causes sterility", as well as realizing that the Aschen homeworld has the same address as the one they had been warned about in the bloody note.

Luckily, the Aschen are mostly quarantined since they only have a handful of Stargate addresses, and no way of discovering more (the SGC's database of addresses are the main thing they wanted to trade with Earth for).
