Abner Doon's story in [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/53869-worthing][/Worthing series./]] I've been seeing probable parallels between this story and actions of a certain RL dictator for quite some time, by now.

Given your request, you can start from chapter 4 of Capitol [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_the_Game][/(“Breaking the Game”)/]] and see if you like the general narration and storyline, because it serves as a pretty good preview to the whole trilogy.

p.s. Here's another recently made book request that /could/ be relevant to your interests:
