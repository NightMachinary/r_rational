(spoilers for the series in case my spoiler formatting didn't work, I'm on mobile)

In Neal Asher's polity universe, there are [gabbleducks](which are a previously sentient species which purposely devolved in order to avoid an alien plague which targeted technologically advanced civilizations.) It's not the main plot but I think it might be what you are looking for. The gridlinked series in particular.
