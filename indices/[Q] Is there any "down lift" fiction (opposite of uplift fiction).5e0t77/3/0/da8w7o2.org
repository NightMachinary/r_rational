Both Anathem (Stephenson) and Dune (Herbert) posit worlds in which computers turn out to be so dangerous that the technology must be dramatically limited. In Anathem, programmers are separated from scientists, and both groups are forced to live apart from society in monasteries. In Dune, computers are considered anathema and an alternative set of technologies based on advanced human intelligence allows people to perform (somewhat) similar operations, like astronavigation. The Tripod Trilogy might also fit this (human technology suppressed by alien occupiers).

The universe of the Culture books (Banks) has a sort of technological high point in the distant past, but the level of technology in the books is still high. A technological fall is a pretty common trope in general (post-apocalyptic everything, also many fantasy books like Sword of Shannara or Prince of Thorns), but that might not be what you're looking for. Wheel of Time might also technically fit your criteria, as the "technology" there (more like magic) has fallen from a high point and must be rediscovered over the course of the novels.
