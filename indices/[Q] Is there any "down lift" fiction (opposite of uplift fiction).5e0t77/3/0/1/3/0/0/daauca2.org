  Well I can think of writing a story of how a group of people tries to ban "high frequency trading" globally

So it definitely doesn't entirely satisfy your general request, but a recurring theme in [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/62787551366/stories][The Fall of Doc Future and its sequels]] is shaping the direction in which technology develops and suppressing certain technologies and aspects of society while improving things overall. It's in general much closer to uplift than downlift, but it's a very specifically shaped uplift in which certain things (including high frequency trading) are stomped on pretty hard.
