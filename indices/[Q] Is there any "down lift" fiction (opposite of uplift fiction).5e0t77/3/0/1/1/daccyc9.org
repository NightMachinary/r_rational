Science Fiction tends to be written by people with big ideas, that don't like hewing to Malthusian principles or "appropriate technology", and if you extend the last thousand years forward you are going to assume that technology will (eventually) have an answer to every question and problem that it raises. By giving that up you are assigning an end date to the continued survival of the people who suffer under your restrictions.

So, some examples (none of which are particularly rational):

Anne McCaffrey's Pern was settled by Space Amish, colonists who deliberately selected a world that didn't have the resources (metals) to sustain an industrial society.

David Weber's Safehold books are about a colony world that lives in fear that the aliens who destroyed Earth and the other human colonies would come back for them and so ban anything that might lead to the re-development of radio.

David Brin's /The Practice Effect/ is a world where machines built under conventional physics have difficulty operating.

Niven and Pournelle's /Fallen Angels/ is Earth, after an anti-technology government took power in the US and banned space flight. It tells the story of two survivors of the International Space Station after they crash during a routine machine to skim atmosphere and resupply volatiles and how they get back into space. It's propaganda, but it's also fun :)

Sharon Shinn's Samaria (romance) novels are another colony world that was colonized by Luddites that wanted the pastoral ideal (with semi-mystical weather control).

Peter F Hamilton's /Night's Dawn/ trilogy has two examples, the human colonized world of Norfolk that prohibits most post-industrial technology and iirc one of the alien races they interact with has deliberately frozen their technology level. (I might be mis-remembering it but I think the Adamists also had some self-imposed limits on researching biology? Most of them found the Edenists unsettling and avoided researching anything that might rediscover the technology that set them apart?)
