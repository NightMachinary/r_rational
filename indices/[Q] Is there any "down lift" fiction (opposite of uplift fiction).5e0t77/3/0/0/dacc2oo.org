The Culture is very much on the slope upwards, they are the collection of material societies that are voluntarily choosing not to transcend. The stories talk about how the effector and displacer technology improved from the Idiran war to the stories set after it and Player of Games directly contrasts a large (~50cm) drone built several hundred years earlier to the newly created drone that was fist-sized. The same books also mentions that they are contacting societies in the Large Magellanic Cloud for the first time. GSVs are getting larger -- the MSV Not Invented Here was a GSV when it was built and reclassed down when the Plate class GSVs started being built.
