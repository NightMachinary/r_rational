That's a defensible position. Certainly I enjoy the luxuries I currently experience, and would not like to lose them. But if I had never experienced them, my expectations and thus actual happiness would be different. There are many stories of Native American tribes who were able to easily convert white people to their way of life, and almost no stories of the reverse. Of course, that was two centuries ago, but I really don't think recent developments like the internet have altered cost/benefit tradeoff much for the better for modern civilization. Rates of mental illness are higher, experiences of loneliness and depression are higher, etc. Religion is more maintainable in small tribes or communities, and has many benefits for experienced well being. In small communities everyone can be unique and important. These aren't necessarily unanswerable arguments, but they're far from self-evidently incorrect ones.
