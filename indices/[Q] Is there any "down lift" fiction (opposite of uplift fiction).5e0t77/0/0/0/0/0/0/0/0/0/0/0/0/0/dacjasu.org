and what if small tribes did have access to modern wealth, technology and education? the reason that small tribes were so primitive is not because they were small, it's because they lacked the knowledge and resources necessary for a better quality of life.

and people are still living in tribes in the modern day. it's just that a lot of those tribes are much, MUCH BIGGER, and that might have something to do with issues like loneliness etc. (people feeling like they don't belong to their own tribe or something). That being said, having larger societies does have advantages. Like being easier to defend from other larger societies, or more social mobility--correct me if i'm wrong, but if you didn't like the people in your small tribe back when small tribes were a thing, you didn't necessarily have many other options. maybe just hope your small tribe encountered another small tribe which you liked more?

history is not a simple constant arrow of upwards progress. there are ups and downs. just because the present is much better than the past /on average/ doesn't mean that it's better in every way.
