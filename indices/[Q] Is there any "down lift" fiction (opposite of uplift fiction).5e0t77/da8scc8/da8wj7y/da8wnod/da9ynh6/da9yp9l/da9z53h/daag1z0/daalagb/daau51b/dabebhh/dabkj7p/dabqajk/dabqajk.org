I'm only barely talking about the internet. I'm talking about things like indoor plumbing, refrigeration, vaccination, farm automation, heating, air conditioning.

And not even just technology, but philosophy. In a tribal society, physical strength rules and equality isn't even a fantasy. The enlightenment was a product of the wealth of western society, in the same way the bronze age was a product of the wealth of the first farming cities.

The things that make life anything other than "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short," are the products of modern society.

Primitivism is the ultimate regressive nonsense.
