I stopped reading Worm too, so this is the first I've heard of the ending. It wasn't what I expected, I'll give it that, but that sounds pretty bleak. I suffered from Darkness Induced Audience Apathy from the Slaughterhouse 9 showing up just after Leviathan and the introduction of a malicious conspiracy within the Protectorate, but if the story ends on a note that depressing I think I got off easy.
