Ooh, Lovecraft! I'd love to watch this whole video, but it's half an hour long and he seems to ramble a little bit. He repeats himself a lot, and the "but"s and "yeah" in this video are off the charts. Maybe a script would help him get to the point more quickly.

On that note, what story should I read as an introduction to the mythos?
