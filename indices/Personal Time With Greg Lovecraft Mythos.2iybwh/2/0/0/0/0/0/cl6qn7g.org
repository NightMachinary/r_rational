It is a parody, so no, not rationalist /per se/. But it's a parody that will happily talk about debt based economies for a while. I wouldn't call pratchett "rational" it's a fantasy world that doesn't really run on reductionism. But at the same time, it talks about the real world.

So sort of like that.

Consider that series to be mechwarrior fanfiction, basically.
