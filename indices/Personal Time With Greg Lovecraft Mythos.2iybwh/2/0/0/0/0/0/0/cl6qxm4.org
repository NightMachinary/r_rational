So let me follow your thought pattern. In order to gain more viewers for a show you like (that is an intelligent parody of another show) you take a monologue of the guy who makes said show and post it on a subreddit that was first inspired by a fanfic that is mentioned in passing in said monologue, this being the only relation between show and subreddit?

mechwarrior parody <-> half-hour monologue by same person with passing mention of a fanfic <-> subreddit about rational fiction inspired by fanfic

Seems like a bit of a convoluted way of doing things.
