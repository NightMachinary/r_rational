Yeah, that's about it honestly. He occasionally has interesting points. I tend to put it on in the background.

I expected this to be downvoted, it's not as good as most of the rest of the stuff, particularly [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Jd5Vsca9Y&list=UUSNd59iRYuFSqo-vb0qjJuQ][this]] (for sheer production quality), which hasn't historically done well here. Video's aren't a format I think most of us like. And none of it is really rationalist.
