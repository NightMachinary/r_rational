My rationale was mostly that he mentioned hpmor in this one, and that I think you guys should probably watch the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNC_sRuPtMonAOP46gqW9Q6E4ESFmum6d][mechwarrior series]] by the same studio.

I tried to more or less imply as much in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2iybwh/personal_time_with_greg_lovecraft_mythos/cl6l9x3][this]] comment.

Last time I posted his mechwarrior series, it didn't get much of a response. Because it starts off a bit rough, and it is a time commitment. My hope is that by associating the author with the whole "lesswrong cluster" people will be more inclined to see it through, and one of the rare video-things I enjoy will get more viewers. Hopefully making his viewership more rational-subculture and less pony-subculture.

Especially since he's trying to get into original content for legal reasons.
