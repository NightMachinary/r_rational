Shameless self-promotion thread would be good (I don't write anything). Sometimes communities can seem unapproachable, and I'm always on the lookout for new stories and authors to check out. It's tough to put yourself out there, so having a way to do that and not worry about being judged harshly seems like it would have massive benefits.
