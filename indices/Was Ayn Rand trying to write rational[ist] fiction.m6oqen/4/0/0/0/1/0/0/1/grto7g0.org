The whole setup is twisted to absurdity in an effort to create a world where a small group are the only people who are useful. In any reasonable reality employees who refuse to be useful like that group of engineers get fired and replaced. Fired employees don't eat. Therefore employees largely agree to do their jobs. It's that simple. People aren't useless because if a willingness to do their work doesn't come from any inherent motivation, it comes from being coerced into being useful.

Capitalism is not a nice system, but it does strongly incentivize people.

Characterizing the vast majority of society as unwilling to do anything useful because they're not rewarded for it is ridiculous. They're rewarded with food on the table and roofs over their heads.

As for Rand's moral line of argument, there are obvious issues in application with a moral philosophy that can and often is interpreted as 'Everyone's happiness is their own job, so if I've got what I want to be happy even at the expense of things you need to live, screw you.'

To put it another way, people use it to ignore the problem of externalized costs. To ignore the reality that civilizations are fundamentally cooperative, and calling exploitation a moral good is deeply problematic. Societies that embrace the pursuit of personal desires regardless of the cost to others create underclasses, suffering, and instability.

Then all the elites who were 'just pursuing their own happiness' while leeching off the labor of everyone else eventually wonder why they're being led to a guillotine in front of cheering crowds.
