You said "the villains all hold idiot balls". Not just minor ones. But besides, not /all/ works need to do this - but not all works claim to be actually about a philosophical system of beliefs that ought to be applied in real life! I'm perfectly fine if Batman punches Condiment Man, a criminal by whose standards somehow "rob banks with ketchup" is an idea that makes sense, and there's no more depth than that to it. But I'm certainly not going to take Batman as a guide to how to handle crime and justice in real life (in fact, one might argue it's a problem when the character takes itself a lot more seriously while not expressing any deeper idea about the same issue, because /now/ it seems like it's saying something important when it's really no less childish than a guy in a bat suit fighting a guy with a pressurized mayonnaise tank strapped to his back). The problem is, if your fiction is supposed to work as a mental experiment that makes it clear /why/ your idea on how to run society is better than others, it should actually show us a realistic slice of what society looks like. Not strawmen. Any bonkers, stupid, weak-ass idea can win against strawmen.
