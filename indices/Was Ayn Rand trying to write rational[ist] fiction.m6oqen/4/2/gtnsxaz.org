  Characters aren't intended to be "realistic", they're intended to demonstrate guide marks to decode the philosophy. The villains all hold idiot balls because naming and explaining those idiot balls (and their real life parallels) is most of the point of the work.

But that's exactly the problem, isn't it? If to prove your point about something being a common mistake in real life you have to concoct a completely unrealistic character... is that mistake an actual thing that happens? Why can't you just write a character that makes it but I can recognise as familiar and believable? Maybe you're just ignoring something that makes their behaviour a lot more understandable?
