I always thought that Rand was trying to honour the underappreciated virtues of the men she admired. She had an interesting way of balancing nobility and inhuman impulses in the same people. One gets the feeling that she was outraged at the way people saw them, thinking it shallow.

I wouldn't take her philosophy too seriously (I don't rule out taking it a /little/ seriously). People don't remember H. G. Wells for his socialism. She was a remarkable artist and a bit of a moron otherwise. Not an uncommon combination.
