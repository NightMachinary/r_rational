  I'm not sure what argument you're trying to make, here.

Sorry, I dashed that off pretty quick. I'm not going to get into the entire edifice of No True Socialism, but Rand was very much inspired by what she saw in the USSR. It's a common trend in real life economies that egalitarian rhetoric and socialist/communist policies result in marginal (and not so marginal) economic pullback. You seem to think that something like the bare threat of starvation will force people to keep being maximally productive, but this is completely disproved by countless historical examples. Plenty of people, even in full capitalist societies, do just barely enough to not get fired, and when everyone else is doing the same thing, the bar can drop unsustainably low with shocking ease.

  I'm going by the common interpretation of her advocates. The economic elites who love Rand because they want moral justification for telling everyone else it's their job to be happy, even if those elites have created a system of grinding poverty for everyone else by their efforts to accumulate all the wealth for themselves.

What fantasy elites are these? John Alison, who ran the only bank that had to be forced to take a bailout in 2008? Can you cite literally even a single person?

I'm sorry, but in the real world, none of Rand's advocates talk like this. I apologize for veering close to the realm of modern politics, but this is like judging a Democrat entirely by what Breitbart says that they say.

  That would be the ridiculous imagined 'exploitation' of a group of elites who feel they're responsible for the vast majority of wealth creation in society and should be rewarded according, ignoring the vast amount of labor done by everyone else.

It's not ignored. It's fully acknowledged. The issue is that is also demands that you admit that the Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and Elon Musks offer vastly more in the voluntary agreement of their employment contract to their marginal employee than that marginal employee offers back. In an actual corporation, the owner builds a vast fortune by taking a small sliver of the marginal productivity of many employees, in exchange for access to the productivity multiplying engine of the corporation.

  The truth is that the people being paid less than what they're worth in a capitalist system are the laborers, and the capitalist class skims off the value of their labor for themselves.
#+end_quote

They're paid exactly what they're worth in a capitalist system, because non-capitalist systems don't even have a coherent notion of "worth".

Reversing the direction of traditional exploitation is just Nietzsche's Slave Morality. Reversing it back again is /still exploitation/. And Rand's whole /thing/ is that no one should exploit /anyone/, that it should be mutually voluntary trades all the way down.
