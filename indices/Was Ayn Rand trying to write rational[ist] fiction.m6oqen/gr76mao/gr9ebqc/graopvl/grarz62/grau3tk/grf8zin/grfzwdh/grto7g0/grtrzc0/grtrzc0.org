  Characterizing the vast majority of society as unwilling to do anything useful because they're not rewarded for it is ridiculous. They're rewarded with food on the table and roofs over their heads.

You should look up the history of this other economic system called "socialism". The old joke in the USSR was "We pretend to work and they pretend to pay us."

  As for Rand's moral line of argument, there are obvious issues in application with a moral philosophy that can and often is interpreted as 'Everyone's happiness is their own job, so if I've got what I want to be happy even at the expense of things you need to live, screw you.'

Do you normally judge moral philosophies by the most bad faith interpretations by avowed opponents?

  To put it another way, people use it to ignore the problem of externalized costs. To ignore the reality that civilizations are fundamentally cooperative, and calling exploitation a moral good is deeply problematic. Societies that embrace the pursuit of personal desires regardless of the cost to others create underclasses, suffering, and instability.

It's actually a proposed /solution/ to externalized costs and exploitation. This is stuff Rand spends /hundreds/ of pages on. You're criticizing a caricature forged in such ignorance and bad faith that it's completely unrecognizable. "Not caring about Ayn Rand" is a perfectly valid choice, but being deeply invested in this kind of untethered, anti-outgroup propaganda is no way to go through life.
