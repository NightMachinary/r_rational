Disclaimer: Kind of drunk. Apologies if this was less than coherent.

Credit for looking at the actual text. That speech /is/ sort of the summation of a lot of her philosophy. But you're ignoring over a thousand pages of context. Let's start with your initial points, about the small population. Warning: spoilers will abound.

The working title for Atlas Shrugged was "The Strike", but really, there are two or three strikes happening simultaneously. The big one that drives the plot is John Galt headhunting particularly talented individuals, and convincing them to stop offering their intellectual abilities on the market. These are the people who get the offer to move to the gulch. Numbers are not given, but the gulch boasts a population large enough for some people to make a living as stage actresses or philosophers. A few thousand is probably a good approximation. AS was written in the 40's, when the US population was about a third of it's current total, so lets inflation adjust that to 10k. So that's Elon Musk, and the 10k closest people to being Elon Musk explicitly dropping off the face of the earth.

Do you think they talk to no one? Their employees, their friends, their families all know that some mysterious stranger talked to them for a few hours, and then they decided to abandon modern society. This is the start of the second "strike", which isn't as explicit. Hundreds of pages in the book are devoted to describing the chilling effect on the rest of the populace that arises from the double-whammy of Galt sniping geniuses and the general rise of what we might call Woke Classism. There's a growing sense that the game is rigged, and regular people who are decent and hardworking pick up on it and just... marginally and less marginally pull back their efforts. Why put yourself out there with a suggestion or idea or solution, when displaying ability just gets you more responsibility with less reward? And so the more insightful employee doesn't volunteer to do what needs to be done, or go above and beyond, or apply for that promotion... but the incompetent social climbers, the people who want power for the sake of power, are /thrilled/ with the lack of competition.

There's a scene in the book when things are starting to get really bad. Dagny is the COO of Taggart Transcontinental, a railroad corporation. She's been driving herself to exhaustion trying to keep things functional, and gets hit with some critical mechanical failure which can't be fixed due to the breakdown of normal parts supply (the device which sorts trains through the terminals, iirc). She calls a meeting of her mechanical engineers to ask for alternative solutions, and they all just stand there. Why put themselves up as a clever, competent employee, when that will just earn the ire of the Woke Classists, like Dagny's brother, James, the CEO? Dagny ends up calling a rival company right in front of them to ask if she can rent a competent engineer. The line is something like "We've finally fallen so far that I don't have a single mind left at Taggart Transcontinental." At least, no one is /willing/ to step up and stand out by saving the day.

And this goes down even further. There's an infamous sequence with the tunnel explosion. The lead up to it involves like 20 pages of railroad employees quietly understanding that what is being asked of them is /stupid and dangerous/, but no one being willing to say that to a (weak) political power. And so ensues a comedy of responsibility-dodging and buck-passing that leads to a major disaster that kills scores of people.

So it's really not just "remove a thousand geniuses". It's that plus "a national culture inimical to usefulness, productivity and rationality". Rand's argument wasn't that removing them was sufficient to collapse society, but that the heroic efforts of the 0.1% more competent people might have kept the disaster going /even longer/, as shown by Dagny and Hank routing around socialist edicts to try to keep portions of the economy afloat. Rand's argument here is essentially accelerationist.

  [No moral obligation to anyone else, other than to be rational. No dealings with others except for the sake of self-interest.]
#+end_quote

This would require a few thousand words to get into on it's own, but for now I'l just say that Rand's definition of "selfish" is bizarrely narrow to a native English speaker. This is a total rejection of moral black checks, and anything that can be logically construed to require a moral blank check. In Rand's terms, if you harm none and pay your own way fairly and honestly, that's sufficient for being a morally decent person.

#+begin_quote
  "If you desire ever again to live in an industrial society, it will be on our moral terms." [Without Galt's 0.02%, it is impossible for an industrial society to exist. Again: if this isn't the entire rest of the world leeching off their brilliance and hard work, what is it?]
#+end_quote

Did you actually read the speech, or just scan through it for lines that seemed open to attack? Huge portions of the book (and the speech!) are devoted to arguing that those moral terms are technical requirements for industrial society. She would argue that this applies to the meanest idiot alone on a desert island just as much as some brilliant genius in a modern first world country.

#+begin_quote
  "Accept the fact that the achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life" [However could anyone get the idea that Rand's works promote self-serving and self-centred ideals?]
#+end_quote

There's a line of questioning I've asked a few times in various places, and never received a good answer. In terms of moral obligations, at what point /do/ you actually get to just be happy? Do you believe that you have a requirement to help others? Are you doing so right now? Do you believe you have a moral right to happiness, or to seek happiness? Even while children are starving in Africa?

It seems to me that there are two actual answers to this line of thinking (almost everyone who even considers this sort of thing seems to just stop thinking about it out of some desperate survival instinct). One is the enslavement of all to all, a sort of nightmare, Rawlsian Repugnant Conclusion. The other is to say that everyone's happiness is their own burden, and any help they give to others must be voluntary (and so, by their own reckoning (this would also be a long essay on Rand's use of "value" and "sacrifice"), in their own self-interest).

On a final note, thank you. I haven't had cause or opportunity to think about a lot of this stuff in a long time. Trading walls of text was a fun past time. Thanks for inspiring me to do it again.
