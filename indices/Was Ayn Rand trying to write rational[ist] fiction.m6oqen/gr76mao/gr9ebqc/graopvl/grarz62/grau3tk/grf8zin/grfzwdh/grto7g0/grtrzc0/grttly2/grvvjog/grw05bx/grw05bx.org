  What fantasy elites are these?

It's fairly common among Libertarians and Republicans with Libertarian leanings, or just Republicans busy making the case for eliminating the regulation of business, cutting social spending of any kind, and slashing taxes on the wealthy. The interpretation of Rand I'm describing to you is a core driver behind the 'caveat emptor' and 'everyone is responsible for pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps' arguments necessary to pretend to rationalize these policy positions, which are otherwise indefensible.

Businesses parasitically take as much of the value of an employee's labor as they can get away with. They don't nobly keep the share to only what the owner(s) need to survive.

Owners and CEOs don't actually add all that much value to a company. Sure, Bill Gates and Elon Musk are decent engineers, but there are plenty of decent engineers who will work for $100,000 a year. What they're really paid for is owning capital, not delivering value with their own hands.

Elon can't make a billion dollars of cars all by himself, and if he isn't doing the work himself, why should he get so much of the profit from it? Why does he deserve more than the engineers who design the cars, or the people who actually build them? The difference between them and Elon is that Elon ponied up the investment capital. Not because he provided some great and worthy service to humanity that couldn't be offered by anyone else.

  And Rand's whole thing is that no one should exploit anyone, that it should be mutually voluntary trades all the way down.

This is a fundamental mistake. As sad history has proven over and over again, voluntary agreements can be highly coercive and exploitative. Whole sections of contract law had to be invented over the last ten centuries to even begin to curb the sorts of abuses that desperate people could be compelled to agree to because they had no alternative. That an agreement is voluntary is only the beginning of an analysis of whether we can justify enforcing it, not the entirety of such an analysis.

If no examples of voluntary but exploitative arrangements are coming to mind, consider people who signed up to be serfs, or indentured servants, or sharecroppers because they had no alternatives. And those offenses against equity and human dignity are only the beginning of the horrors that wealthy and powerful people inflicted on the desperate with 'voluntary agreements' to expand their wealth and power.
