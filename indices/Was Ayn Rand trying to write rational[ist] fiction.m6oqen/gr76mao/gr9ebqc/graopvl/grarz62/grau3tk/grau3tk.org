You should consider actually reading some of her work sometime. Your points vary between silly exaggerations of plot elements that are themselves exaggerated to show them in better relief, points that are actually addressed in her work, and eye-brow raising projection.

Notice how you wrote 6 paragraphs, without citing a single specific example? That's one of the many tells that you're going entirely on N+1th-hand attacks, that mostly hadn't even read her in the original, and were written in bad faith besides.

Don't feel too bad, it happens to most smart, young progressive folks. Any time she gets referenced, you hear this same screed, and just absorb it by osmosis. I did. And then I called someone out for it in person (/exactly/ like you're trying to do here, except on a train instead of a subreddit), and I had enough intellectual honestly to feel bad about how shallow my understanding was. I went to go get some firsthand knowledge, and well, here I am defending her 15 years later.
