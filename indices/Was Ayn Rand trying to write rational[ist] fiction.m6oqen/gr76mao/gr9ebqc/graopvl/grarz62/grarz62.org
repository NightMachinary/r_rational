Randian fantasy presents its great men heroes as solely responsible for their own success and the entire rest of the world as trying to leech off of their brilliance and hard work.

It glosses over the reality of the world, which is that nobody is personally responsible for creating vast wealth and tremendous advances. The founder of a successful megacompany makes billions, but they don't do it by doing all the work themselves. They hire people to do work, tell them what to do, and then steal a portion of the value of that work for themselves.

Then there are all the debts that these supposedly self-made figures owe to society and are completely blind to. Their successes wouldn't be possible without the creation and maintenance of the society around them. Who educates those workers they need? Who pays for the roads that bring them to work? Who ensures they and the protagonist aren't murdered by marauding bandits?

Rand's idea of the man who stands alone and owes nothing to anyone is an ignorant and fantastical myth. The real life equivalents, the world's megarich CEOs and investors, they got their wealth by making money off of owning capital. They are parasites who live off the labor of others, not men who have somehow produced billions of dollars worth of goods with their own hands. Many have done legitimately useful work, but not work worth billions of dollars.

Nobody can do that all by themselves.

They love the Randian myth because it enables them to think their wealth was a result of their own work, and because they can use it to pretend to moral indignation about how society is stealing from them when it expects them to pay taxes.

It is willful ignorance based on a desire to find some ways to see themselves as the heroes of their own story, as oppressed by the rest of the world.
