Judging from her comments in interviews, I believe you may be reading way more into it than was actually there.

I think the major attractions of Rand's books are how they can be used in a shallow way to attempt to rationalize and defend self serving and self centered ideals. Rand gives people a way to believe that 'I've got mine, screw you' is somehow the height of moral conduct, and gives them a way to idolize themselves as one of a few people in society who actually matter while everyone else is some sort of useless taker.

There's a certain kind of person who wants to benefit themselves at the expense of others and think they're better than everyone else. Rand gives them a way to do that without feeling bad about it like they would under any other moral system. So they flock to it, not because the philosophy has any value or truth, but because they want it to be true.
