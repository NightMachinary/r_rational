The distinction there is more that real people are much more complicated that just one flaw in thinking, no matter how central it is to their identity. There are some characters who get more nuanced development, but there are a lot of minor characters who only get page time to show off one error or another. The book is already like 1200 pages long; going even longer to undermine it's own criticisms would have probably been a worse option.
