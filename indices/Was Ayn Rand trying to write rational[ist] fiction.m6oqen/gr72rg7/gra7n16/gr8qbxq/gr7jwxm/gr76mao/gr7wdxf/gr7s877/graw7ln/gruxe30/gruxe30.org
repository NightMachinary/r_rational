Yes.

Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism is a precursor for modern Rationalism, and Atlas Shrugged is for all means and purposes a 1950s era version of HPMOR.

Of course the philosophy itself is clunky as hell and full of holes, and the writing is poor: but please remember that she wrote it in 1950s way before modern Rationalists were even born.

She was basically like Wright Brothers of objective philosophy: knocking together a crude contraption of wood and glue that barely took off the ground, but was a proof of concept that made modern jets possible.

She effectively provided simple, but inescapable arguments that allow an ordinary person to dismantle spiritualism, existentialism, nihilism, religion, Marxism, and most importantly, Kantism.

With that she laid down the groundwork for modern Rationalism to be built on.

IMHO, it is good to read Ayn Rand as a teen to "scrub your brain" and get yourself rid of stupid cultural memes, and THEN you are ready to tackle Rationality as it is modernly conceived by people like EY.
