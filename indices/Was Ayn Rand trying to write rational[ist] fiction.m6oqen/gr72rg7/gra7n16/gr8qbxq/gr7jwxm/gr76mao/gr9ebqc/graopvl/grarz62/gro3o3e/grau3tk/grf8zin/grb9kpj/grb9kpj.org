You seem very stuck on this idea that anyone who has actually read the text will surely agree with you. I have read Rand, way back in college for ethics classes two decades ago. I recall writing a paper ripping apart her issues and looking for a few pieces that might be salvageable. There wasn't much. You'll forgive me if specific plot points don't come to mind after all that time. They were rather forgettable.

Have you listened to her interviews? I found them rather illuminating as to her actual beliefs, without all the intermediary messiness of the fictional framing device getting in the way. Her essays were similarly useful.
