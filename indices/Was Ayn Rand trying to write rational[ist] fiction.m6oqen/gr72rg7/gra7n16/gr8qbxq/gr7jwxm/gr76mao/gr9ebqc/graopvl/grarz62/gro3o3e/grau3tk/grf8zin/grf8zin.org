Here are some excerpts from John Galt's very long speech in /Atlas Shrugged/. It seems to me that (1) this speech is intended as a statement of Rand's own position, and isn't some sort of fantastical exaggeration, and that (2) it very much does present Randian heroes as solely responsible for their own success and the rest of the world as trying to leech off their brilliance and hard work, and that (3) it very much does argue for a position of total selfishness (and calls that morality). In what follows, my own comments are in italics inside square brackets; everything else is Galt. I'm using [[https://amberandchaos.net/?page_id=73][this copy]] of the text of the speech; of course if that's a wholesale fabrication then my evaluation will be nonsense, but I don't think it is.

"I have stopped your motor. I have deprived your world of man's mind. [...] I have withdrawn those who do [live by the mind]. I have withdrawn those whose mind isn't [impotent]. [...] We have left you free to face [...] a world without mind." [/I don't know whether the total number of people in Galt's Gulch is stated explicitly, but it can't be more than a couple of thousand and my impression is that it's rather less. So, according to Rand, the world is brought to its knees by the removal of at most about 0.02% of its population; those are *the* men of the mind, removing them means "a world without mind"./]

"We have granted you everything you demanded of us, we who had always been the givers, but have only now understood it. [...] You have nothing to offer us. We do not need you. Are you now crying: No, this was not what you wanted? A mindless world of ruins was not your goal? You did not want us to leave you?" [/Once again, Galt's no-more-than-~1000 pals are *the* givers, and the rest of the world has *nothing* to offer them. The rest of the world has been leeching off them, and now that they're gone it lies mindless and in ruins because of their absence./]

"Do you ask what moral obligation I owe to my fellow men? None -- except the obligation I owe to myself, to material objects and to all of existence: rationality. I deal with men [...] by means of reason. I seek or desire nothing from them except such relations as they care to enter of their own voluntary choice. It is only with their mind that I can deal and only for my own self-interest, when they see that my interest coincides with theirs." [/No moral obligation to anyone else, other than to be rational. No dealings with others except for the sake of self-interest./]

"If you desire ever again to live in an industrial society, it will be on our moral terms." [/Without Galt's 0.02%, it is impossible for an industrial society to exist. Again: if this isn't the entire rest of the world leeching off their brilliance and hard work, what is it?/]

"Accept the fact that the achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life" [/However could anyone get the idea that Rand's works promote self-serving and self-centred ideals?/]

Now, it /is/ true that Rand had a word or two to say against the idea that your success is purely your own. But ... well, here's Galt again. "When you work in a modern factory, you are paid, not only for your labor, but for all the productive genius which has made that factory possible: for the work of the industrialist who built it, for the work of the investor who saved the money to risk on the untried and the new, for the work of the engineer who designed the machines of which you are pushing the levers, for the work of the inventor who created the product which you spend your time on making, for the work of the philosopher who taught men how to think and whom you spend your time denouncing." So far as I can tell, nowhere does he (or she) acknowledge that the industrialist, the investor, the engineer, the inventor, or the philosopher depend on anyone else's work for the pay /they/ get; but the /little people/, the ordinary people working in the factory, why, we've already established that they have no minds, and the injustice is that /they/ are being paid for the genius and hard work of the Randian Heroes.

A couple of paragraphs later, she makes that more explicit. "The man at the top of the intellectual pyramid ccontributes the most to all those below him, but gets nothing except his material payment, receiving no intellectual bonus from others to add to the value of his time. The man at the bottom who, left to himself, would starve in his hopeless ineptitude, contributes nothing to those above him, but receives the bonus of all of their brains."

To be clear, I'm not claiming that there's nothing /else/ in Galt's speech, or in Rand generally, than a call for selfishness and a declaration that a tiny handful of Great Men, owing nothing whatever to anyone else, are responsible for all the good things in the world. But those things most definitely are in there.
