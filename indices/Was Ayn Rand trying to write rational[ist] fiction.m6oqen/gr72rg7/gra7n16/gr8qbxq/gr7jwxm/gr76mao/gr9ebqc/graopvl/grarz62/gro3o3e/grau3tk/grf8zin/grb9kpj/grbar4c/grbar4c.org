Nah, if you look back, you'll see me saying something like "dislike it all you want". And that's sincere. There are plenty of inflections points where people can reasonably disagree - I have a few myself. But hating Rand as a meme is ten thousand times more common than disliking Rand for what she actually argued, and I simply don't believe you that you read her. Every flag you throw up says that if that college paper story is even true, you googled and paraphrased a few criticisms which fit the pattern I mentioned above: bad faith personal attacks cribbed from bad faith personal attacks, cribbed from bad faith personal attacks.

Sorry, but this is all really obvious if you've actually read the books. Call it /unrealistic/, or the byproduct of trauma from the USSR, or a PSA on the consequences of 50's meth usage, but your description of her philosophy simply does not jive with the actual depictions of her heroes and villains, like James and Dagny Taggart, or Francisco. She had plenty to say about the proper functions of government (Rand supported quarantines!), and how certain functions might be handled otherwise; that's a huge part of the Gulch arc. Feel free to disagree that her ideas were optimal, or worth pursuing, or even baseline minimally workable, but insisting that she just never even considered them is pure ignorance.

  Have you listened to her interviews?

Only a few limited bits. She comes off as, well, a smart person who uses meth. I have read most of her non-fiction books and essays.
