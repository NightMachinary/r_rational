  You should look up the history of this other economic system called "socialism". The old joke in the USSR was "We pretend to work and they pretend to pay us."

I'm not sure what argument you're trying to make, here. Of course if the engineers weren't paid then they would have no incentive to work. But they were paid, and they needed the money to live, so they had every incentive to work. Capitalism, not communism. (Which you've confused with socialism, which is not remotely the same thing. And the USSR wasn't even well executed communism, it was authoritarianism that claimed to be otherwise for legitimacy.)

  Do you normally judge moral philosophies by the most bad faith interpretations by avowed opponents?
#+end_quote

I'm not going by the bad faith interpretations of Rand's opponents. I'm going by the common interpretation of her advocates. The economic elites who love Rand because they want moral justification for telling everyone else it's their job to be happy, even if those elites have created a system of grinding poverty for everyone else by their efforts to accumulate all the wealth for themselves. Plus all the people who dream of those elites, imagining themselves better and more valuable than everyone else.

  It's actually a proposed solution to externalized costs and exploitation.
#+end_quote

That would be the ridiculous imagined 'exploitation' of a group of elites who feel they're responsible for the vast majority of wealth creation in society and should be rewarded according, ignoring the vast amount of labor done by everyone else.

The truth is that the people being paid less than what they're worth in a capitalist system are the laborers, and the capitalist class skims off the value of their labor for themselves. Randian fantasy reverses the direction of exploitation, allowing elites to attempt to justify a 'poor me' defense and grub for ever larger portions of an economy they contribute little to.
