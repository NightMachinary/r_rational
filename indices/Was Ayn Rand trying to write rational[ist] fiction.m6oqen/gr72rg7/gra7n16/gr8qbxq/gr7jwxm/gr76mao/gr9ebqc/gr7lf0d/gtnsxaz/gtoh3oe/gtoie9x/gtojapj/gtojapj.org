It's a stylistic choice that fits perfectly with the general theme of the work. If you're writing a work specifically to explore villainous flaws, spending time showing the villain taking their mother to dialysis is tonally dissonant at best. It's assumed that you're able to understand that complications can exist, and that you condemn or applaud different traits or actions as relevant. The point of the work is laying out an argument for /which/ traits and actions are laudatory or condemnatory.

To take another tack, name another work where you'll call out the author for not taking more time to explore how minor antagonists were actually decent people who had some good points.
