To steal your analogy, Condiment Man is /clearly/ an allegory about totalizing pathological obsessions, and we can tell this by all the time spent discussing and defining his totalizing pathological obsession, and the flaws in thinking that are involved. This works as an allegory because real people experience totalizing pathological obsession, and it's useful to define and describe it without the messiness that comes with trying to psychoanalyze your brother, who suffers from totalizing pathological obsession.

Complaining that this work is unfair to Condiment Man because it doesn't give him credit for his activism on behalf of the whales, or because he's an unrealistic character, is somewhere between "missing the point so badly that your English teacher will fail the paper" and "insane troll logic".

The point of Rand's idiot balls is that they're real ones that real people hold, and it's worthwhile to examine them and their consequences in isolation. Being a human endowed with abstract reasoning, you're supposed to be capable of drawing lessons from those examples that can be applied to other contexts. If you want to criticize those lessons, go read the book and do so. But this criticism is just nonsensical. It's like complaining that O'Brien from 1984 is a strawman.

And funny enough, no one I've talked to about the book has trouble picking up on this /except/ people who absorbed hatred for Rand on ideological grounds before having ever read a word.
