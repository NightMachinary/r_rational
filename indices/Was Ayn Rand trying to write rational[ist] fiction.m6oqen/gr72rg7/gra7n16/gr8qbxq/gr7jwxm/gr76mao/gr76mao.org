No, she was writing a novel as a hash function for a remarkably thorough, expansive and consistent philosophy of human life. Dislike that philosophy all you like, but the sheer amount of information encoded in her books is impressive in it's own right. But in aiming for that goal, her writing is very much, I don't know the term, mythic descriptive? Characters aren't intended to be "realistic", they're intended to demonstrate guide marks to decode the philosophy. The villains all hold idiot balls because naming and explaining those idiot balls (and their real life parallels) is most of the point of the work.

To the extent that there is a connection to this community, it's that Methods of Rationality has a lot of that same energy. Imagine if EY had spent 10 years obsessively perfecting MoR.
