I think there's a really big and often unacknowledged difference between “rational fiction” and “rationalizing fiction”. Rational fiction is, basically, about problem solving. Often involving critical examination of biases and preconceptions. Rationalizing fiction is about trying to justify why the way you already believe is right would solve the problem.

Rand wrote fiction that took the things she already believed, and concocted a world in which they were not only true, but absolute. Atlas Shrugged is an entire novel length version of someone at a party desperately telling you that “no no, in /this/ situation, my horrible ideas /work/!”, while everyone tries to escape.
