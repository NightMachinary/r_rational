She's writing in a tradition sometimes called utopian literature.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_utopian_literature]]

More' /Utopia/ was the origin of the tradition, but basically you comment on society by inventing a society in fiction. Sometimes the invented society is a utopia and you contrast it with real societies, and sometimes it is a dystopia as a warning. Rand did both, a dystopia and then a utopia embedded in that.

If you're interested in the method but turned off by Rand's ideology, Jack London does something similar in /The Iron Heel/, and Bellamy's /Looking Backward/ is pretty damn fascinating, it was a bestseller in around the turn of the (19th/20th) century and inspired mini utopian clubs and societies to spring up for a while.

Here's some utopian lit to chew on if you're interested, they're all pretty short and readable, though obviously not modern.

[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/624][Looking Backward]] - Kind of hard to describe politically, sort of a state-oriented capitalism. Really gets at the period, though, and is pretty fascinating.\\
[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1164][Iron Heel]] - London was a Marxist and this is a capitalist dystopia.\\
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_from_Nowhere][News from Nowhere]] - A less over-the-top socialist utopian novel, and kind of helps you to understand the context that Marxism came out of (really ridiculous exploitation in factories, among other specific abuses). Less heavy than Iron Heel, which is pretty over the top.

If you're OK with something a little more challenging, Bacon's [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2434][New Atlantis]] is a scientific utopia, but in the early modern period science was considered 100% compatible with Christianity, which makes for pretty weird reading. And More' [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2130][Utopia]] is really worth reading, though you might need to get into the context of the time a little (he talks about sheep for a big chunk of the beginning of the book, but enclosure of common land was one of the hot political issues of that day).
