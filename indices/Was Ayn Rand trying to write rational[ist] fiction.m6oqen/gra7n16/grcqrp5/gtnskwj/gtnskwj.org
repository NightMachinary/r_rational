Allegory is an explicit rhetorical device in which you use a fictional world and series of events to say something about different real world things. Gulliver's Travels says a lot about what Swift thought of society without him /literally/ claiming that tiny men or talking horses are a thing.

What Ayn Rand did instead is concoct a contrived, realistic sounding series of events to hold up as a mental experiment that proves her philosophical points. The problem being, of course, if a mental experiment is actually just a deranged fantasy that would never in a million years come to pass, it's worthless.
