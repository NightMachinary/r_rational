I think Jimmy Wales agrees with you and it sounds somewhat plausible, the way he talks about her:\\
[[https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/jimmy-wales/][Jimmy Wales on Systems and Incentives (Ep. 109) | Conversations with Tyler]]

But yeah, maybe she is a good epistemical influence on people who really read her very deeply, past just the capitalism vs communism stuff.

But I'm not too interested in reading more Ayn Rand myself right now, to see if you're right. My epsitemics are fine (I think) and whilst I'm sure it would be insightful, she's so incredibly polarizing, that her insights can't be easily discussed with others.\\
I think that's what Wales laments in that interview.\\
She doomed herself to be underrated by her detractors, overrated by her followers and to never fully be appreciated or discussed.\\
She's been dead for forty years.\\
Maybe in another forty, she'll stop being so triggering.

On the other hand:\\
Many people read Ayn Rand when they are young.\\
Atlas Shrugged is probably the longest/densest book many young have ever read and the most philosophical, too.\\
Any philosophy at all, will improve (and sometimes temporarily or permanently destroy) the thinking of someone who's previously been untouched by higher-minded thought.\\
Books are info hazards.

Perhaps that's true for reading any philosopher or reading any philosophy?\\
I'm sure if someone read Hannah Arendt or Kant as deeply as some enthusiasts read Ayn Rand, they would hardly avoid coming out with improved epistemics.
