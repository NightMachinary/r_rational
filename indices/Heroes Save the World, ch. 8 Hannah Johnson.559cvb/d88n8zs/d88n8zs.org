Thanks again to [[/u/alexanderwales]] for giving me permission to riff off of his story, [[http://alexanderwales.com/the-randi-prize/][The Randi Prize]].

If you think that these chapters have been overly ambiguous, then let me know if you'd be interested in being a beta reader. I've been told a couple of times so far that a given passage was unclear, and I want to avoid that as much as possible.

*Synopsis*

Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?
