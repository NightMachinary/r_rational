Some thoughts on the list of prompts, specifically the "longer stories" prompt:

I notice that most of the stories I remember seeing submitted for a challenge that were also /written/ for the challenge are not all that long, and certainly wouldn't qualify in a "longer stories" challenge (the prompt list currently suggests a 10k word minimum for it). I strongly suspect that this is because 1-2 weeks isn't long enough for most people here to write a decent rationalfic of that length, especially given my experience in trying to write a story for one of the prompts that /needs/ to be on the longer end of "short story" to work. (My (incomplete) draft currently stands at 13.5k words, and is slated to run under the upcoming "Superheroes" challenge instead of the "Reverse Portal Fantasy" challenge that initially inspired it.)

Because of this, I don't think the "longer stories" challenge should be run as a regular challenge if it is run at all. Instead, I have two suggestions (that could even both be used as separate challenges) for how such a prompt might be run well:

- Announce the prompt for that particular challenge further in advance so that prospective participants have enough time to write an entry. (How much further is an interesting question.) Depending on the subreddit's intentions for the playing field, it may be helpful to limit the challenge to works created for it / within that timeframe.
- Run the challenge as a showcase of /previously submitted/ (whether for a challenge or just to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]) works, possibly further polished by their authors. The trick here would be having enough entries without turning it into a contest between known major works, although allowing multi-part stories (where different parts were submitted for different challenges) to be showcased as a single entry would help.

Further suggestions? Thoughts on what you would want to see?
