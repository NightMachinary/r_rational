A couple of recommendations for happy rational stories:

"Please don't tell my parents that I'm a supervillain" series is incredibly cute, happy and lighthearted story, while being quite rational. Main charcters may not be total munchkins, and they do make mistakes, but that only makes them really believable /smart/ 13 y.o. kids who are in the supervillain business mostly for fun and brawl. Also, the superpowered society is plain amazing.

"Silent sinner in blue", one of the official "Touhou project" mangas and the only one with a continual plot, is also very happy-go-lucky (like the entire Touhou in general), and also perfectly rational... when you consider what is a common sence in a society of overpowered and nigh-immortal monsters, friends who know each other for several hundreds years, and magic built on faith.
