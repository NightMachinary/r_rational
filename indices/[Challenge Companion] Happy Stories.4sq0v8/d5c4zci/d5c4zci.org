My recommendation, for those who find their inspiration in the darker themes, though my own attempt isn't going well: A Comedy of Errors.

Much rational fiction is about characters who don't make major mistakes, and that isn't quite the same thing as thinking things through. Misunderstanding is less frequent when intelligent characters apply their knowledge and resources rationally... but the ones that squeeze through that sieve tend to be a LOT more impressive.

Just make sure you remember your Aristotle: In a tragedy, everything goes well and then falls apart. In a comedy, everything falls apart but turns out well. In the best comedies, all the follies act as a sort of crucible that flares away the toxic gasses, skims the slag, and generally leaves everything better than we found them.

It can get pretty grim in the middle there, though. So long as it's never taken seriously enough to convince us that that's the direction the story is going.
