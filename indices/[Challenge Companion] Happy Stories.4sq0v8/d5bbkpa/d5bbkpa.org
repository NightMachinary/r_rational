[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff]] shows a Harry who uses his Muggle background and nous and his sheer laziness to make a lot of money and make his life easier. It's mostly Rational and is pretty funny. It's not very long (covers just year 1 and 2) but it's light-hearted enough to count as a happy story.
