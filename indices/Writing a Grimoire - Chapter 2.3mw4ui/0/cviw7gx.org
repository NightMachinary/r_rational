Next action:

Have Emma repeat what she just did on a fresh piece of paper exactly, changing nothing about her process whatsoever.

Have Matt and Daniel follow along on their own pieces of paper, copying Emma's process exactly. (Tom too if he's cooperative, but his characterization so far suggests he might not take orders from Emma.)

I predict that if she is careful to reproduce her process exactly, Emma's second pentagram will also turn its paper super-cold --- but I want to be sure before proposing too many other tests.

I don't have a prediction regarding the pentagrams drawn by the other members of the group --- but if they have different effects besides super-freeze, that will give some useful avenues for subsequent experimentation.
