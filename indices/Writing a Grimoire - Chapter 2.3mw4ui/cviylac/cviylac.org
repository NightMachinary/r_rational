first action: don't check if it's hard as steel until it warms. it hurts enough that she yanked her hand away, and matt can tell it's cold without physical contact. instead, test if this cold can be transfered. place something hot on top of it, or something room temperature, and see if it gets notably different. meanwhile, have emma write down her procedure, and have someone else repeat it. do they get the same result as she does?

(testing magic for stability, or branches, is the first thing i would do with any magic system. does everyone have the same system and results, or does a pure-hearted individual saying oogeley boogley create a unicorn instead of a bat?)

second action: try at least two other orders of steps with the same individual, preferably emma. if all same result, the symbols affect the result and nothing else does is likely, in that case, it should repeat no matter the order of operations.

third action: test a different combination with a new individual iff the old spell worked identically the first and second time and the results are identical for each order. if so, will the result be the same, or does the order matter the first time?

fourth action: take tom up on his offer, unless he backs out. photograph the diagram. does it print? does it take effect immidiately? is it more/less potent? does it work after printing? what results occur? if it works on photograph, see if you can get a lot of cheap cameras if you expect to ever need the ability to cast quickly. take a picture and throw it at an enemy.

five: depending on majors... if electrical engineering resources availible, test electrical resistance, compare before and after. if not, will it burn like paper or stay like metal? (or something less destructive, i suppose. maybe try hitting it with a hammer and seeing how it reacts?)
