Considering that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Lewis_%28actor%29][Matthew Lewis]] played Neville and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Fiennes][Ralph Fiennes]] played /Lord Voldemort/, I think you're onto something here. Makes me worry about what Ralph is going to do to the four of them if they all meet up.
