Looked to me like Ralph's System 2 knew that their universe was little more real than a story, but his System 1 pitied them enough to get Ralph to invest enough effort that they'd live lives of magic. Writing a cryptic hint saves that universe from being doomed to heat death; writing a manual would only have the further effect of saving the inhabitants some experimentation. Unless experimentation destroys the world, in that case he'd have pointed it out.
