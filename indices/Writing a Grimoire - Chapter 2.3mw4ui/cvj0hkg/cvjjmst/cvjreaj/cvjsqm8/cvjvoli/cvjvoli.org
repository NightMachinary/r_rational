So he's willing to let us die miserable natural deaths if we can't figure out magic to an advanced level before one of us gets run over by a car or something (and we're his friends, we thought - let us say nothing of the death of strangers), even to the extent of not sticking around for a few hours to give some pointers, but he'd make certain to warn us if this "magic" stuff was dangerous, either to ourselves or to surrounding people?

Sure, maybe there's a 25% chance or so that he'd warn us, and maybe you have more faith in Ralph's scruples and work ethic (again, the scruples and work ethic of the guy who just noped out of the universe without warning) and would assign a higher number. But this does not reassure me much.
