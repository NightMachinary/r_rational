I'm concerned about experimentation destroying the world. In light of this fact, this post is not a proposal for a specific experiment, but for a research program.

As an example, suppose the cold is due to the "spell" removing some energy from the surroundings. If we try to cast a spell a quintillion times as powerful, does that freeze all life on earth as a mere side effect? How do we know that flipping a few triangles doesn't correspond to "casting" such a powerful spell? How do we know that there aren't certain conjunctions of circumstances that amplify this cold, making it possible to destroy the world without altering the pattern at all?

And of course, this is also why we can't tell people without serious deliberation. You don't give everyone on earth a [[http://www.angryflower.com/golden.gif][nuclear bomb]], and you don't give them potentially world-destroying magic.

It seems (and to some extent we have to trust) that small changes in pattern or circumstance produce only small changes in effect (assuming that this paper turns out like the last one after it warms up). This is good, because it means that we can experiment with small changes. Ideally what we'd like is some way to limit side-effects. If we were a space-age society we might draw these pentagrams remotely, on the other side of the solar system. Heck, maybe we should be drawing the pentagrams remotely ourselves - even if we don't destroy the world we might win a Darwin award by freezing the room we're standing in.

But for long term safety, I think we need to limit side effects at the source - by using an ensemble of strategies to "break the spell" if it poses some threat. The ideal would be some sort of "magical fuse" that burns out if too much power is drawn, combined with some fail-safes that attempt to disrupt the pattern when either triggered or damaged. On top of that, we should identify and use practices that cause spells to have a smaller impact (such as drawing them remotely if possible, or [hypothetically] making the pentagram smaller), to increase chances of surviving even a serious accident.

Can we develop such safety measures with only tiny variations to a pentagram that makes paper unbendable? Possibly.
