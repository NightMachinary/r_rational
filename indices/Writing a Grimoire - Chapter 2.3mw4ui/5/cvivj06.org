Okay, my suggestion for the next action is dependent on several things. Of course if this was happening in real life, I'd run away screaming and report it to authorities, because suicide note+demonic pentagram+magic = ominous tidings.

Is the body there or is it only the paper? Because I want to know if there is anything to look at other than the suicide note and the original pentagram. Because if there is anything else, investigate it. Otherwise, do the following:

- First Action: Check if new version Emma drew is also hard as steel. If it's hard then wait to see if it warms up and becomes like the first pentagram-paper. If it becomes like the first paper, then Emma probably followed all of the steps to replicate the original pentagram. Otherwise if it stays cold and/or is not as hard as the original paper, then Emma didn't replicate the original pentagram perfectly. In either case, have Emma repeat the process two or three more times to make sure it's repeatable (ie produces ice-cold paper sheets). Then test it by seeing if other people drawing it make any differences. If it's repeatable and other people can do the exact same thing, we can move onto the following testing scenarios:

- Start testing the 'magic' by changing how the pentagram is drawn:

  - Change the order of how the pentagram is drawn like Emma is currently doing. Vary the order of the triangles drawn, see if the circle, pentagrams, and triangles can be drawn out of order, and test if drawing the entire thing upside-down makes a difference.
  - Does direction of the pentagram make a difference? Like drawing it upside-down, reversed (if it's not symmetrical), or changing the direction of the triangles and/or lines inside the pentagram.

- Then test external factors of what the pentagram is drawn with, instead of how the pentagram itself is drawn:

  - Does tracing it make a difference?
  - Draw the pentagram on various types of materials like metal, wood, wax, and anything easy to get a hold of.
  - Test it with different writing materials (does blood, pens, pencils, juice, or wine make a difference?).

- Once we are done trying the various ways to draw pentagrams, try changing the "caster".

  - Does emotional states like anger, joy, sadness, or boredom make any difference?
  - Does having one person blindfolded and/or someone else moving their hand change anything?
  - Does the 'magic' work if one person draws the circle, someone else does the pentagram, and a third person does the triangles?

- The moment a pentagram repeats an earlier effect, check what was the crucial step. Otherwise, play around to see if anything makes a difference.

Record how each pentagram is drawn, who made each pentagram, differences in pentagram production tested, and any effects produced. Ideally, everyone tries every single possible combination, but if differences in the drawer mattered, then we should be seeing different effects from, otherwise identical, pentagrams quickly.

Bigger changes to drawing the pentagram comes later.

P.S. Stuff like printing out the pentagram comes when we can actually hide evidence of broken printers.
