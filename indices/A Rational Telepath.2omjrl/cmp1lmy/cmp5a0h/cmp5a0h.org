*Phase Two: Verification*

It was midday. I hadn't told my wife anything, and I didn't want to, not until I had verified that what I was hearing had some bearing on reality instead of just being a case of insanity. All the same, I needed help, so I called up Brady.

I can't remember how we first met, but Brady and I had been friends for years. He was a bodybuilder, with biceps like thick hams, though his day job was working sales at a fabric outlet. He picked up on the first ring, and when I said that I needed him, he dropped everything that he'd been doing and came to help. Brady was like that. He took friendship seriously. It made it easy to overlook his faults.

“So was this guy fooling around with your wife?” asked Brady when he got to my place.

“No,” I said slowly. But I didn't want to tell him what we were doing, so then I just sort of stood there awkwardly. “I just need you to go talk to him.”

“Just talk to him?” asked Brady. “About what?”

“Anything,” I replied. “Just make something up. Make up ... make up a three word phrase, something that I'd have no way of knowing. Work it into the conversation.”

“Alright,” said Brady. He hopped out of the car and walked up to John Greenwood's apartment.

That was the thing about Brady - he would just do things. I wouldn't say that he was suggestible, but he always seemed to see everything as a lark. You'd tell him to moon a friend, and he'd laugh and do it, because he was just up for anything. He didn't have any real sense of shame, and seemed to only follow conventions when the mood took him. I went grocery shopping with him once, and he grabbed a doughnut from the case and started eating it while we walked. That was the sort of thing that always made me nervous, like I'd get stopped by someone in the store - which was exactly what happened. A manager came up to us and asked Brady whether he was going to pay for the doughnut, and Brady just took another bite, looked the manager directly in the eyes, and said no. That was the kind of guy that Brady was. So it wasn't all that surprising that just forty minutes after I'd called him up, he was walking up to a stranger's house for a chat.

Twenty minutes passed by while I waited in the car. I had a pencil and notepad ready, and I wrote down every thought that I heard. Brady was in there for a lot longer than I would have thought, and they talked about all sorts of inane things. John was only entertaining Brady because he was suspicious, and as soon as John thought about identifying the car, I started it up and moved it. When Brady finally left, I called his cell and told him to walk around the block to where I was parked. Brady just said okay, and thankfully, John was willing to brush it off as a bit of strangeness.

“Mission accomplished!” said Brady with a laugh when he got in the car. “What was that all about?”

“I can read minds,” I said.

“Shit, can you read my mind?” asked Brady.

That was his response. Not, “bullshit”, not “prove it”, just wondering whether his own thoughts were safe. He said it with a half smile, like he was just joking, but he did that a lot. He'd done that when he'd asked whether my wife was cheating on me. That was another thing that grated on me sometimes. For a guy that was so brash, he was never really serious, I think mostly to give himself an out. He'd ask if your wife was cheating on you, and if you took offense, he'd laugh it off as a joke.

“I can only read one mind,” I said. “That guy you just visited.” I handed him the notepad. “This is everything that he was thinking while he was talking to you. I need you to very carefully read it over and make sure that it matches what you said. The three word phrase you said should be in there.”

Brady looked over the notepad in silence, while I fidgeted beside him. I'll admit that I was nervous. I was waiting for Brady to tell me that I'd just imagined the whole thing, or that what I'd written was chicken scratch, or that it was all a dream. But overlayed on top of that were all of John's thoughts, which distracted from my own.

“Well, that proves it,” said Brady after a while. He was wrong, naturally. His first thought should have been that I was playing a prank on him - that I had used some parabolic microphone aimed at John's window or slipped a listening device into his jacket pocket, or that John was a confederate trying to trick him. But Brady didn't push the issue, just accepted it with a good nature.

I gave him the rundown. I'd started hearing the thoughts when I'd woken up in the morning, just after my wife left, and based on his thoughts, just when John woke up. I couldn't figure out any way to switch the focus to someone else. I couldn't turn it off.

“Look, there's something I haven't told you,” I said slowly. “This guy, John Greenwood ... I think he's killed a few people. Three women, if I'm right. Maybe four. He thinks about the crimes. He thinks about hurting people too, people he just randomly meets, or passes on the street. I don't know what to do with that information.”

“That's fucked up,” said Brady with a nod. “Of all the people whose thoughts you could be peeping, you get a killer.”

“I don't know that he's a killer,” I replied. “Not for sure. The fantasy and reality are hard to distinguish, and I get distracted by my own life when I'm not actively listening to what he's thinking. But I should be able to find out whether the murders were real or fake, if I can listen in on some names. He's going to access his e-mail account sometime, and I should also be able to snoop there, maybe get some more information. If he did kill the women, maybe he would have written about it. Maybe I could RDP into his computer with the right credentials. I don't know.”

“And then what?” asked Brady. “You go to the police, they put him on trial for a few years, eventually they convict his ass, and he rots in jail for the rest of his life. Meanwhile, you're stuck listening to his every thought, every time he gets raped in prison, all that crap. You shouldn't have to put up with that.”

“If he did it,” I said. “And there's no guarantee that this link between us is going to last for much longer. Maybe tomorrow I wake up and nothing is back to normal. Or ... eventually I'm going to have to bring someone in. If the link persists, it's the scientific discovery of the century, and if we can change its focus - even if I'm the only one who can hear someone else's thoughts - it would revolutionize court cases. Or spycraft, for that matter.”

“And if there's not enough evidence to put him away? If it's a he-said he-said thing?” asked Brady. “If we can prove that he's guilty but not enough so that the cops can touch him? And let me tell you, you want to be careful who you share this with. You don't want to get your brain picked apart in a lab somewhere. Nothing to say you're the first either, maybe there's already a whole team of mind readers out there.”

“I'll be careful,” I said slowly. “There are a few things that I need to try.”

“But if we can't prove he's a killer?” asked Brady. He was insistent, and pointed his finger at me as he talked. “If you keep hearing him? We could take him out ourselves, is all I'm saying.”

Brady had always had a vigilante streak to him. That was part of why he had built such big muscles - he liked to get in fights and right perceived wrongs. He was one of those guys that seemed like he was constantly spoiling for a fight, always talking about how he would fuck someone up if they pushed against him, or how he'd shoot a burglar through the heart with one of the guns he kept around his house. I mostly took it for bravado, but he seemed serious about taking the law into his own hands.

I said my goodbyes, but thought about what he said. John was arguing with someone online about how to properly care for a box turtle, even though he knew nothing about the subject. He was gleeful about getting a rise out of someone. When that was done, he opened some horse porn and masturbated again - it was a slender Ukrainian woman and a horse with a penis the size of a forearm. She seemed unhappy, and John kept calling her a slut. I nearly threw up.

Then my wife came home, and I had to explain things to her.
