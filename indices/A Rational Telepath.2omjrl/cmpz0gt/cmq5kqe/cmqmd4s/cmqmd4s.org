To be fair, the scenario above really only holds true at work for me. Amongst family and friends, I'm sure I'm more normal.

Amongst strangers, I'm also more likely to give the benefit of a doubt. I will trust when someone asks for help, but I never trust anyone that I am asked to give money to, to use it for what they say they will. The stranger at the gas station asking for money, I pay for their gas, and they have to pump it while I'm there. Or I'll buy them food that's not packaged, off the grill, or I open packaged food before giving it to them so it can't be returned or exchanged for alcohol. I suppose that I am trusting them, assuming that they really need a helping hand when they might not.

However, when at work, with the very high percentage of people who try to dodge, invalidate, or otherwise break the support system, when that phone rings, I verify, then trust.
