I think you are missing an important portion of the story here. If I suddenly developed the ability to read one murderer's thoughts, my first thought would be that I developed schizophrenia, not telepathy. I would place higher probability on me going insane than on me getting psychic powers, unless I lived in an alternate universe with magic. I would get professional help and learn all I could about the brain, psychology, mental illness, and cognition. After some time I would discover that the foreign thoughts belong to another real, living person. At that point my next actions would depend on the nature of the murderer. The other comments cover the possibilities from here.

(Alternatively, maybe my psychiatrist figures out my telepathy before I do and tips off an evil conspiracy of neurologists. I escape with the help of some other captured psychics or maybe I'm rescued by a rival research teem of ethical psychics and neurologists. The evil conspiracy uses the my link to the murderer to try to find the renegade research team, so I become a liability. What follows is an epic chess game of psychology, ethics, and psychic powers; all the while searching for the cause of our ESP.)
