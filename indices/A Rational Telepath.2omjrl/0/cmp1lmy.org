*Phase One: Investigation*

I could hear his thoughts. I knew it was a "he", because I could hear everything that was said to him. That was something that I figured out even before anything gendered came up. Whenever someone was talking to him, he was thinking about what was said, and those thoughts - by some strange alchemy that I still don't understand - made their way to me. I thought I was going crazy. Perhaps the smart thing to do would have been to talk to my wife about the thoughts I was hearing, and maybe if he'd been less of a violent person I would have, but I'd been in a mental institution before, and I knew I'd be going back there if I told them what I was hearing. I gave myself a day to figure out whether there was a more rational explanation than simple insanity, and if there wasn't, then it was back to the nut hut for me.

The thoughts were mundane most of the time. He would have these flashes of intense anger and violence, and I would get nothing more than a mental image of some grocery store clerk stripped down and flayed alive, but more often it was dull. Ticking off items from a grocery list. Wondering why shelled and unshelled meant the same thing. Inspecting a trio of freckles on his right arm. That was part of what convinced me that it was some one else's thoughts - I figured that if I were insane, I would have thought of something more interesting.

It didn't take him long to go online, and that was how I got him. I'd already known from when he'd ordered coffee at Starbucks that his name was John, and maybe it would have made a better story if I'd had to piece everything together from context, assembling a collection of clues and tracking them down one by one. Maybe I would have had to do that if he'd used LastPass. Anyway, he typed in the URL to go to his bank's website, and I wrote down that thought as I heard it. He typed in his username, and I got that too. And with his password, I had the same full access as he did. I waited until he was done, then walked down to the local gaming store, where you could rent computer time for five dollars an hour without even having to sign anything. No security cameras either. If I could have handled listening to his thoughts, I probably would have figured out some more elegant solution like booting from a flash drive and hiding behind TOR, but ...

Look, I know how it looks. It looks like I was planning even then to get away with killing him. You'd argue that a truly innocent man who only cared about finding out whether he was crazy or not would have just used his home computer instead of taking the extra time and money to do it relatively anonymously. But it wasn't like that, not really. I was thinking that if he was real, he wouldn't want me to be looking into his mind like I was. It just seemed like a reasonable precaution is all. I wasn't thinking about the police investigations that would come later, even if it seems like I was.

Anyway, I logged in to his bank account, which would have been a major victory even if it hadn't given me virtually all his information. A bank account was proof that he existed - that the thoughts I was hearing weren't just schizophrenia. My aunt was a paranoid schizophrenic - I guess I should have mentioned that earlier, since it was obviously on my mind - and she heard voices on a pretty regular basis. She thought that the United States Postal Service was out to get her. But schizophrenia can't make a bank account appear out of thin air. It was possible that it was a visual hallucination, but those are pretty rare. I wouldn't have trusted a phone call, because that could have played into the persistent auditory hallucinations of believing that I was hearing a person's thoughts, but I felt pretty certain that I could trust a website. I paid five cents to print off a screenshot of the account information, then went back home.

John Greenwood. He lived in my city, though I won't tell you which one it is. He was close enough that I could go visit him. That moved us to Phase Two.
