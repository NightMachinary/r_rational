If you want it to. The point is to have a story prompt for others to use their rationality skills to deduce things and imagine how they could be [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/][convinced]] of the supernatural in today's modern world as well as a couple of reasons.

For me, I would imagine it to be so, because the ability switches when you cannot read any more thoughts which most often occurs due to death.

I imagine it doesn't matter either way if you just want to change targets or get the person to stop thinking in an ethical matter. You first convince the person whose mind you are reading to go for cryonic freezing. If the ability switches to a new target, then you are now reading the mind of someone who you deliberately placed as the closest and are fine with reading their mind. Otherwise, the frozen person is now not thinking anything and is not a problem anymore.
