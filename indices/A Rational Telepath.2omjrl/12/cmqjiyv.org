This is a great prompt -- I find myself almost paralyzed with a series of questions though.

If you read surface thoughts, would you be able to read sensations, images and emotions better than internal dialogue?

How much of our internal world is coded in language -- and what if the person you're mind-reading speaks a different language? How would that translate in your brain?

How much of my internal world is occupied by idle internal dialogue versus active recall of past memories vs experience of external phenomenon and a reaction to those things?
