I'm sorry, but I have to make a comment on this: "humans will accept other people's statements as truth, before analyzing it for falsehood."

I work in technical support. I promise you that I do not accept other people's statements as truth, before analyzing them for falsehood. In fact, I can be very confident that they are lying before I even pick up the phone!
