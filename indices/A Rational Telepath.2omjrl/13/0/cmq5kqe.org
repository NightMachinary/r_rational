I know what you mean. It's an interesting fact that explains a lot about human nature to me (mostly why con artists can be so successful), but it doesn't explain how we can assume someone is lying before hearing anything they might say. I wish I could find more research about this, but it's a hard thing to analyze in cognitive science since one's perception of truth and lying is a fuzzy thing.
