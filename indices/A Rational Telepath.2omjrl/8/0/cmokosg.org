All I wanted is do is to tell people that she/he is a murderer; let them imagine how guilty the murderer is and decide how they would act. The protagonist has proof due to the fact she/he can read the murdeer's mind as the murderer remembers making the kill. I'm curious in how rationalists will react, and if it's popular enough, I plan on taking everyone's ideas and start posting it as a series of short /rationalist/ stories on [[https://www.fictionpress.com/][FictionPress]]. (With credit given to [[/r/rational]])

I just wanted to liven this thread up a little where more people contribute their own original thoughts, instead of links or discussion of related topics.

Feel free to post your own story prompt, or ask advice on a hard decision.

EDIT: Thanks noggin-scratcher for catching that embarrassing mistake.
