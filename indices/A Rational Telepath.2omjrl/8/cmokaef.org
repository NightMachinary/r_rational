How sure are we that the person whose mind we are currently reading a murder; are they planning on killing just one person, have they already killed a person and trying to cover it up, or are we reading the mind of a serial killer who is planing on killing again?

I would be interested in reading a story like this and wish you the best and for a link to it after you put it up for consumption.
