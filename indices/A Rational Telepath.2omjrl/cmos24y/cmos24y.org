Hmm. It depends, are your friends/family willing to entertain extraordinary hypotheses?

If you can get the murderer convicted and executed, do that. If not, either because capital punishment is outlawed in your state/province or because they're a psychopath who covered their tracks too well for the police to follow with anonymous tips, you'd have to do something else.

You weren't entirely clear in your post - can the target of this telepathy be changed at will? Or is it limited to only one person until they die, at which point it changes focus to the next nearest person until they die, /ad infinitum/?

If it's controllable, your options are boundless. But if not, as I suspect you intended, then your main goals would be to arrange for the death of the murderer, while sitting next to a coma patient. This assumes that you can't discover anything else about the mechanism of this telepathy, in which case it's time to learn more about the arbitrary laws of the universe.

As far as reacting to the murder, it all depends on whether it was premeditated. If the murderer is drunk and kills someone else in a barfight, we already have the ability to disregard crazy-talk (like the opinions of the drunk or the clearly insane). If they're a sociopath and the murder was premeditated, could you prevent it from happening at all? Maybe they got off on killing people, but surely its easy enough to disregard stimulus linking murder to happiness for long enough to get them arrested and/or enacting some hill justice?

Eh, there are a lot of ways this could go. Your main problem is coming up with a convincing way for the protagonist to come to the conclusion 'telepathy' and not 'schizophrenia' or 'brain tumour'.
