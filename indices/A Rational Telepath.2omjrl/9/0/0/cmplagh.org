You're not a blank slate. You have your own prejudices and whims and desires that the emotions are going to overlay on. There are heavy limits to what peer pressure can do, especially if you deliberately avoid reinforcing it.

Personally I'd probably try and convert the whole murder thing into a video game thing. I am already easily able to murder within video games so I'd interpret the emotions I got as those from a video game. That would limit the applications. Am I not in a video game? Then these feelings don't apply.
