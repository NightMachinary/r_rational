If this happened in real life, and the murderer is a cold-blooded psychopath, I would assume you'd easily notice the murderer's emotions since you don't normally feel excitement/lust at the thought of murder. However, over time your brain will begin to associate the murderer's emotions with the thought of murder (or any other subjects your emotions differ significantly from the murder's). Since you cannot block the murderer's thoughts, you will come to think of killing others as a joyful experience and be conditioned into desiring it. From there it's a question of how strong your morals and integrity is.

It's why I always viewed telepathy as a horrifying curse. You can't /not/ absorb other people's associations and views; you become a copy of the people around you. It's peer pressure taken to its logical extreme.
