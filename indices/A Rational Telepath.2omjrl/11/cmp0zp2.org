  DISCLAIMER

  The above list is just a hypothetical exercise on how I would check for telepathic abilities or noticed that I am having strange thoughts. Do not do the above checklist if you, for any reason whatsoever, think you are insane, delusional, or thinking/acting oddly. Go to a hospital.

If we want to write a rational story with level 1 intelligent characters, the protagonist /wouldn't/ do your checklist. S/he /would/ go to a hospital. Unless there is a clear reason not to, like strong evidence that S/he is telepathic and super strong evidence that the doctors can't be trusted.
