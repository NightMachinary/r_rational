How is the emotional impact? I don't believe thoughts and emotions can be really separated, so I assume they get transfered as well.

If I assume a cold-blooded psychopathic murderer, he probably felt something like accomplishment or sexual arousal at the murder. How does that mix with my emotion of disgust? Can I distinguish who generates which emotions? Is there even a difference?
