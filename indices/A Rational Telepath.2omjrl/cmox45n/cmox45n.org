  Once the person you are reading has died, you will automatically be able to read the mind of the person you are physically closest to until they too have died.

You can't know this one, unless the /real/ first person you mind-read dies before anything interesting happens, and the /second/ person you mind read is a murderer. If I was writing the story I'd probably have you /first/ gain telepathy on a terminally ill ally who dies right around the time you pick up enough evidence to suspect something magic is going on, then have you immediately lock on to the victim of the murder and experience being murdered, then have you lock onto the murderer. You can probably skip the terminally ill patient if you want, but that gives you a chance to experiment with a cooperative party and also follows the classic narrative Rule of Three (wherein it takes 3 cases to establish a pattern. In this instance, three repetitions makes it clear that the mindlink transfers on death.)

Anyway, I'd probably ignore the fact that they are a murderer and try to co-opt them to help me tell the world of my powers, so that scientists can discern the underlying laws powering our apparently magical universe which has special laws for human minds. Manipulation of this person should be doable thanks to the mind reading, right?

I admit that the idea of killing the murderer For Science and/or protection of my mind does occur to me (and subsequent mind-links aught only to be formed with those near death, or on animals if possible, until such time as there was no need for further experimentation) so if he or she is a morally irredeemable person the "murderer" bit actually makes this instrumentally expedient option a little more palatable.

The murderer and even my sanity is kind of small potatoes compared to my /real/ internal debate, concerning the implications of the existence of magic and whether or not telling humanity about it could somehow fuck everything up. I'd be thinking thoughts along the lines of "am I the only one", "if not, why don't we already know about it", "if so, why me", and so on.

Just think about the ginormous implications... the universe is somehow recognizing human minds as well as human death. (we can experimentally test the boundaries of when the universe considers a mind "dead"), and there's a ton of new stuff in neuroscience and physics, not to mention the fact that telepathy is just /one/ of the things people commonly believe in but scientists consistently refute which actually turned out to be true.

The problem is that an awful lot of stories involving the sudden introduction of secret magic into a non-magical world reduce to this exact scenario when you look at them rationally, so unless this scenario is the story you want to tell you kind of have to blot that out for the sake of story telling or introduce compelling reasons to not tell (or just, have your character believe in the idea of secrecy more than I do I guess)
