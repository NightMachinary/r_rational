Assuming that I didn't know who the murderer was, or his or her location?

Track him or her down, gain/record enough of his or her personal/bank information as is available so that I can turn a profit, invite a carefully chosen close friend out for some vigilante justice, kill the murderer.

Tracking down the murderer and recording his or her personal info for later thievery-related purposes would be quite easy just by reading surface thoughts. Plotting an opportune murder should be similarly easy. Finding a friend good enough to trust me and high-quality enough for me to not mind being mind-linked to them would be harder, but I have some prospects in mind already.

After the murder is accomplished I'd then team up with my friend to demonstrate that we're genuinely linked, win Randi's million dollars, and retire.

All the above assumes that the murderer I'm initially linked to is actually a bad person, though. If said murderer happens to be an intelligent, interesting person who happened to be in a bad situation which caused him or her to commit the crime, then I'd probably approach the person and explain the situation directly. Then win that million bucks.
