Just some thoughts in random order:

Take a thin thread, apply the superpower. Now you've got a very sharp cutting edge, which can be used as a tool or a weapon.

Put on some rubber gloves, now you can protect your hands from stuff like molten steel.

Apply the superpower to some water as you step on it. You can walk on water!

The ability to stop biological processes could be invaluable in medicine. You can perfectly preserve organs during medical procedures. For example, only the brain really needs constant supply of oxygen, other organs can survive without it for a long time. You can start applying the superpower to patient's head, the doctors can do a long operation on something below the neck without worrying about oxygen deprivation. What is even cooler, the patient is not going to feel any pain, so you can skip anesthesia.

Since the Item cannot change, it cannot absorp any kind of radiation. So applying the superpower would turn the Item into a perfect mirror.

An indestructible container would be useful for holding hot plasma. This would actually solve fusion power.
