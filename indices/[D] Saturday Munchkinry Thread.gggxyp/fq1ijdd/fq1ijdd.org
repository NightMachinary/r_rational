Power: you can mentally select one item you touch and make it Unchangeable. No impact, no chemical can deform or corrode it to any measurable degree while the effect is in power. The effect can be called off, and is broken as soon as the contact with the item stops. The item cannot exceed you in weight, volume or biggest linear value. You can effect two or more items touching each other as a single one, e.g. chain, stack of books.
