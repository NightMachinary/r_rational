A few ways to use this come to mind:

- *Stasis rescue:* Touch a person of your weight or less and temporarily halt everything. If they were dying from a severe traumatic injury but could be saved if only they were in an operating room which is prepped and ready to treat them, you can buy the time needed to make that happen.

- *Hostile teleport:* From other people's perspective, this can appear to be the same as being able to either teleport them to a second location with a touch, or to teleport your allies in.

- *Invincibility:* Make your skin, hair, clothing, and corneas unchangeable just prior to some kind of injury, e.g. car accident, gunshot, explosion, plane crash, stabbing, etc. Nothing can kill you if you see it coming, and you could also maintain significant 'armored' portions of your body/clothes passively even when walking around not expecting a fight.

- *Nano-blade:* Attach the thinnest strand of wire or thread you can buy to a metal handle. You might find this at a magic supply shop, used as thread so thin that it wouldn't be seen under ordinary circumstances. Tape one end of this to your wall, tape another end to a comfortable handle-shaped wooden or metal rod, make it taut, and then make it all unchangeable. You now have a nearly invisible and nearly weightless ~6 ft. long blade with a point so narrow and an edge so sharp that you could press it into a plate of metal and then slice through it if necessary.

- *Featherweight gun*: You could replace the barrel(s) and some other heavy components of a gun with thin-walled plastic. The receiver can't be modified in this manner, but just about everything else can be.

- *Hand's free dead man's switch:* When in close quarters with someone who has other powers which might allow them to kill you, you could arm three grenades, cooking each one off until only 1 second remains, then place each at different points of your body and freeze them. If the other person manages to kill you, they won't be able to stop all three grenades from going off, and as long as they're close by, you'll at least have your revenge.
