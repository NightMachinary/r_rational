I stumbled upon the history of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thioacetone][Thioacetone]] on youtube a few days ago. It's a real world, relatively easy to make chemical that smells so bad a 'small amount' (Not defined) produced in a lab is enough to make people vomit and/or pass out hundreds of yards away in other buildings. When it was first discovered in the late 1800s a whole town was evacuated. The smell was described as 'fearful'.

Here is an account from Oxford in 1967:

  Recently we found ourselves with an odour problem beyond our worst expectations. During early experiments, a stopper jumped from a bottle of residues, and, although replaced at once, resulted in an immediate complaint of nausea and sickness from colleagues working in a building two hundred yards [180 m] away. Two of our chemists who had done no more than investigate the cracking of minute amounts of trithioacetone found themselves the object of hostile stares in a restaurant and suffered the humiliation of having a waitress spray the area around them with a deodorant. The odours defied the expected effects of dilution since workers in the laboratory did not find the odours intolerable ... and genuinely denied responsibility since they were working in closed systems. To convince them otherwise, they were dispersed with other observers around the laboratory, at distances up to a quarter of a mile [0.40 km], and one drop of either acetone gem-dithiol or the mother liquors from crude trithioacetone crystallisations were placed on a watch glass in a fume cupboard. The odour was detected downwind in seconds.

I have no idea why authoritarian regimes don't use it to disperse riots and protesters. Doesn't even seem to have lasting side effects.

Anyway, outside of military and 'peace keeping' applications, what uses can you think of for it? Again, this is a real chemical a high schooler could make. The most exotic thing you need to make it is a Bunsen burner.
