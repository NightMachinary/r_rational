Re: Lanterns placement.

It seems to me that, while more convenient during construction, that placement makes the new lantern much less useful: if it's at the borders of a previous one, about half (maybe more, depending on the additive properties of the lanternfields) of the new lantern's field will be completely redundant.

Thus, you'll gain half the terrain you could have gained. Since keeping a lantern fed seems to take a large effort, you want to maximize the return of each lantern.
