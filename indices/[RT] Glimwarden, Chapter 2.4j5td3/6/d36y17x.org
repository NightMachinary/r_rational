How do elections actually work in Light's Hollow? The way it is mentioned makes them seem like they are not quite straight forward, especially with the offhand mention of them being few and far between as opposed to "only every X years".

I noticed that you mentioned Samuel having black gore on his clothing, presumably coming from a slain darkling. For some reason I thought that darklings evaporate relatively quickly after death, leaving only their hava heart behind. Did I imagine that part? Especially in the center of town, right next to the central Lantern one would expect any remaining gore to be near instantly torn to shreds. Except if darkling tissue turns immune to the Lantern field's effects after their death that is.

Lastly I find it curious that no one mentions the possibility of building the new Lantern at the borders of an old one, thus forgoing the need for protecting the construction site. I assume you'll explain the reasons for them being built that far apart at some later point in the story?
