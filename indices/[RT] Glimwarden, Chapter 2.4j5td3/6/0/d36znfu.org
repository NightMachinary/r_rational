There are four seats on the city council. The first is the chief glimwarden, who is the current most senior (in terms of number of years served) glimwarden. The second is the mayor, who is voted for every nine years by every member of the community above the age of fourteen. Alternately an election can be forced by petition. The third seat is the chief engineer, assigned through internal voting among the engineers, though usually (and currently) someone in a more managerial position. The fourth is the plebian vote, which basically goes to everyone who isn't a glimwarden or an engineer. In theory, there's an election every three years, but in practice if there's an incumbent the seat is rarely challenged so no election happens. (More on all this later.)

The darkling flesh liquifies post-death, but their substance doesn't fade, though it will wash away in the rain. The mechanism by which the lanterns affect the darklings will be gone into with more detail later.

Procedure for building a new lantern will be gone into later.
