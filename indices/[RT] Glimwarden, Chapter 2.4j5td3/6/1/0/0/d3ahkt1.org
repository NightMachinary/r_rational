But I'd say a decrease in efficiency means more future risk for glimwardens or, rather, less return for their risk: if I'm not getting it wrong, glimwardens hunt darklings for hava, which then goes into the lanterns. Less efficiency means more glimwarden risk for less benefit to the village. In any case this seems like a more complicated calculation, so I guess we'll just have to wait and see :)
