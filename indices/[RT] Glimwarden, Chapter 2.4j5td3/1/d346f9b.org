Philip seems to be somewhat of a high-functioning sociopath. The cold to Sander's (relative) hot. Should be interesting to see if he ends up being much of a "good guy". Even in his thoughts he never quite recognizes altruism as being anything close to a terminal goal for him.

Sure, "he didn't think that it would be fair to say that he was kind and helpful only because he thought there was something in it for him", but that doesn't mean that such an accusation would not be accurate, even if it wouldn't be fair, right?
