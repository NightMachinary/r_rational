Woo! The first chapter left me wondering if the darklings targeted animals or if they were only hostile to people. The mention of bears in this chapter makes me think large animals are still around, which would mean the darklings aren't targeting them. I wonder, though, if domesticated animals are much of a thing in this setting. No mention of cows, chickens, or dogs has been made so far, after all.

The previous chapter also had a character use "candy red" do describe Sanders' aura. Does this mean candy apples, which candy red is named after, exist in this setting? That would mean apples and sugar cane are both being cultivated.

The use of "Watts" as a unit in the last chapter was also interesting to me. "Meters" and "miles" are units of measure that a fantasy author could use simply to avoid coming up with their own units of measure, but "Watts" are named for a person. Did this person exist in this setting?

I have a pet theory that this story is in a post-post-apocalyptic future, and took "Watts" and "candy red" to be evidence of this. The statement that radio was invented to measure lantern output goes against this, though. As does the lack of mention of ancient yet advanced ruins.

I don't expect you, the author, to answer the questions here, by the way. These are just things I plan on looking out for.
