Beg your pardon, but I asked Mr. Wales if I could have a preface in order to address these very issues and he said that it was "bad enough to have a prologue". Not only that, but my requested notes on translation have been removed due to "technical limitations". I was promised that I would be allowed a preface once the serial work has been completed, but I fear that will take quite some time. As a compromise, I have been allowed a reddit account to answer strictly those questions which pertain to translation.

Translation of units has been a consistent problem, because if left as they are they require notes in place to inform the reader of the exchange rate between their local units. Thereafter, when they encounter the native units, they must translate the units in their head or pick it up from context. It is my belief that off-loading the work of translation to the reader in this manner does them a disservice. Where possible, I have kept my translation to modern English as straightforward as possible. Where it is not possible, I have attempted to use English analogs. "Glimwarden", for example, is a portmanteau of the archaic "glim" (meaning lantern) and of course "warden" (meaning keeper), which I hope lends some of the weight that the word contains in its original Jor√≥nese.

Similar translations have been done to names and places. It is my hope that the overall effect is to draw the reader in rather than to push them out, as I believe preserving the /intent/ of the work is more important than precision, especially since the original work is widely regarded as fiction itself.
