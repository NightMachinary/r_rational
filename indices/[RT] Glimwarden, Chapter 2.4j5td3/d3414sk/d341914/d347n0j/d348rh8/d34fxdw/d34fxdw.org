I do that mostly as a point of view thing. If I were writing in the first person, I would probably say, "My father, Warren," on the first time I mention him and then just "my father" or "dad" every time after that. I'm not a hundred percent certain how effectively this comes across, and there's a good chance that I need more variation there.
