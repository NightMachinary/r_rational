Alliterative names are a cultural thing.

I might change Samuel Seaborn if it's distracting, but I'm sort of loathe to change names after the fact, because that's confusing. It's a bullet that would be better to bite now. (Originally their last name was Sandborn, but I changed it to Seaborn because I thought it was more hopeful and slightly less alliterative. I didn't notice the name duplication until later, but figured it probably wouldn't matter since there's no similarity in terms of characterization, appearance, etc.)
