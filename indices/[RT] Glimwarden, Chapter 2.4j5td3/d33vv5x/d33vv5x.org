This chapter sees the introduction of our second viewpoint character, Philip Phandrum, the mayor's son.

I've added the Mistape plugin to my website; highlight spelling or grammar errors, hit Ctrl+Enter, and it will send an e-mail to [[mailto:typos@alexanderwales.com][typos@alexanderwales.com]], which goes straight to me. It's not a perfect solution, but I'm hoping that this makes error corrections faster and more trackable for me. (Ideally there aren't any errors at all, but I think I only managed that in one or two chapters of /Shadows/.)
