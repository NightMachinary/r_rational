RKVs though are an immense materials and energy investment, and it's possible to defend against pretty easily.

How, you ask? Simple. Spreading out. A vast number of low mass space habitats - or, really, separate solar arrays and compute nodes - around a star are a very hard to kill target.

​

The reason is that the attacker has to spend more mass-energy constructing and accelerating the RKVs than the defender loses in mass from a node blown out of orbit.

​

It's only for defenders stuck on planets that RKVs are a civilization ending threat. Once we have the tech to build exponentially replicating machines, there would be no need to live on a planet. And we're within a few decades of that tech - it doesn't require anything but a robust machine learning framework that is easy to repurpose between different robotic platforms. No need for machine sentience, no need for nanotechnology. Just a straightforward bit of software engineering from what we already have.
