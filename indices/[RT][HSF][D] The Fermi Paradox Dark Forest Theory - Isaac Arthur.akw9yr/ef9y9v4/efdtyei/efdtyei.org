Well put, which is why Dark Forest Theory was a really neat in universe plot device, especially since some of the incomprehensible, stealthy, weapons of mass destruction were actually shown in book 3.

In addition, the book series also mentioned at some point, I believe, that hunter civilizations sent out silent probes to spread out in the galaxies carrying those weapons; the entire kill-loud-civilizations process was automated and ran little risk of exposing their own home civilization.
