I concur that he never actually gives arguments which address any of the points in the book. However, the Dark Forest premise depends on a number of assumptions which themselves have unclear truth value, and of which make its application to real life of dubious applicability.

IMO, the core notion of the Dark Forest requires a couple of technological assumptions usually not assumed in realistic near-term hard sci fi - not that the assumptions must always be true, but that they can be true at some point in history. The first is basically weapons of mass destruction that are also stealthy. If I see you, I can basically instantly kill you, and no one will really be able to know where it came from. Some commentators suggest that the act of attacking is not stealthy. I disagree that it must be so. Near Light speed RKVs are already extremely low warning weapons, at least for the receiver (though probably less so for bystanders). The point is that the arguments depend on an implicit assumption that it's a loud genocidal war, when it might not be lpud, abd almost certainly isn't a war as much as a massacre.
