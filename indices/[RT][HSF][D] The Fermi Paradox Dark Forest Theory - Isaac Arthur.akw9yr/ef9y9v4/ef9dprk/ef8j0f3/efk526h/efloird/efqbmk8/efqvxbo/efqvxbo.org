You clearly meant something different when you used "be the tree" as an analogy (and I rather like your idea), but let me describe what I meant:

By hiding, I meant placing yourself in a state where you can't contact the outside world, but the outside world can no longer reach or harm you either. I don't remember the details, but from what I remember the Black Domain does appear as astronomical features, just ones that are no longer relevant as sentient species for the outside world.

So in that case, it's not that you've disguised yourself to not be a threat, but rather that you're actually no longer a threat to the outside world, though with the drawback that (kinda like a tree) you don't have the ability to affect the world beyond yourself.
