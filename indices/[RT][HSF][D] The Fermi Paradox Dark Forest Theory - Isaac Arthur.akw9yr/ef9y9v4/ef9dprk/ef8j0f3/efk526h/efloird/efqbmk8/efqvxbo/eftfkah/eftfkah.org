I get it.

What I find amusing about the metaphor though, is that the author appears to have forgotten that trees are alive, and in choosing a forrest for the "backdrop" accidentally created something that can be interpreted completely differently.

Unlike the tech described, the hunters don't juts lack the capability or need to attack the trees. They cannot afford to attack the trees as they depend on the trees to hide them from other hunters. And by there being enough trees to hide the hunters from each otehr implies that by sheer numbers the trees are "winning".
