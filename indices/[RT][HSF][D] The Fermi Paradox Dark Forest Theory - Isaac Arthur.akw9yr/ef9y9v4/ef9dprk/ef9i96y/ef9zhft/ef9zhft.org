To add on this comment, it's a bad assumption for countless reasons, but the biggest one IMO is light lag and the technological explosion. By the time the information has reached you, it will have been decades. How much more powerful is the modern US military compared to its 1960s counterpart? Well, we saw how easily thr US demolished Iraq. This is with downright conservative assumptions too. In this universe where Dark Forest may apply, FTL travel is unavaliable, technology may or may not grow rapidly - you can't tell, and similarly the societal outlook of your possible rivals is dated by light lag and you canmot tell how quickly or slowly they are changing.
