Except the trees aren't hiding (any hunter can identify several if asked). They juts aren't perceived as a threat by the hunters, but rather as cover.

I'm not sure how that would apply as a deliberate strategy, but IMO being sufficiently alien that the hunters don't recognize you as a threat is probably an adaptation that an environment like that selects for.
