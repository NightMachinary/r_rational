lets say you have four species: 3 quiet and one loud. one of the quiet species is genocidal, and kills anyone they see. they attack the loud species. this is a VERY visible action. they just told the universe their position, their hostile intent, and given a rough estimate of their military capacity. timing puts them inside a specific sphere relative to the target.

so, you just realized that you had a loud neighbor, and a psychopath killed them. you now know roughly where the psychopath is, and you know you cant stay queit forever. logically, you should take action NOW to deal with the problem. if one neighbor sees this and acts, its 50/50 who wins. if two or more see this and act, then the hostile species is destroyed, and there may be an alliance made between the survivors. what if there are more hostile species?

the problem with the game theory approach, is it assumes only two actors. in reality, you will likely have more actors than that. hostile response to hostile action means that it is a dangerous strategy in the long run.

we have not seen anything that looks like a space-battle, so space battles are probably very unlikely. thus hostile species are likely rare, unless we are just the first to be able to act and choose. either way, the lack of space battles is a good thing.
