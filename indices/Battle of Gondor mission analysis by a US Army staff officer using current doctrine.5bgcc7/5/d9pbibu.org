It's fun reading a fantasy battle couched in modern military jargon.

I'm not sure it has much value as a teaching tool though, except to learn the terminology. A LotR battle goes a certain way not as an inevitable consequence of the way military leaders managed their assets, but because Tolkien / Peter Jackson decided it would look good and hit the right story note.
