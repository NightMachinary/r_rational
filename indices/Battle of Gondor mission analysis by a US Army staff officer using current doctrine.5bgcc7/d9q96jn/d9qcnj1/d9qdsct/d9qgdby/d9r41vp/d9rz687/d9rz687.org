Can't say I remember that character, but per that description it could be because the climbing monsters are good at infiltration. [[http://worm.wikia.com/wiki/Stranger][Stranger]] includes all the things that make someone a good spy (or spy-generator), even if the most famous examples are capes who make themselves invisible in some way.

(Another cape who dodges the "enhancer" hole in the classification by mind-controlling his targets.)
