  Isn't "cause you to hallucinate and think there are bugs everywhere" pure master? It masters humans by causing them to start screaming and flailing around and it relates to bugs.

IMO it isn't really a Master class ability if the person with the power doesn't have some control as to how you flail about. I'm not sure though. Where general insanity and/or hallucinatory powers considered Master class? I can't at the moment come up with an in-story example. Long time ago that I read Worm.

  And what is "mutate you into a giant bug"? Is that breaker or master?

According to the wiki Rachel (Bitch/Hellhound) is a Master 5/Striker 5. Amy (Panacea) is a Striker 9 as well. I don't remember though if she had to touch her dogs to transform them or not. I don't think any canon character had the ability to transform people at range, especially not unilaterally and without some kind of targeting mechanism.

I guess the classification system may be lacking in that department.
