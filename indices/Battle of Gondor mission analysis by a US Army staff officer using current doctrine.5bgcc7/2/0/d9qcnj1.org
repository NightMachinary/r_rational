None of the ones you mentioned are pure master class abilities. Some of them would be considered master/shaker/breaker or even not master at all.

What could have been bug-related master is if she summons bugs or if she can use bugs to control humans. It also leaves blank the possibility of the bugs themselves having supernatural powers. But transforming vital assets into controllable creatures or substances would not be considered purely master.
