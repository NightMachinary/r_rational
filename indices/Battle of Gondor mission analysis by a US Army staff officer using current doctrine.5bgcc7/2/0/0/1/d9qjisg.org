  Isn't "cause you to hallucinate and think there are bugs everywhere" pure master?

Sounds like a Striker or Blaster (depending on range).

Except if her hallucinations give her some control over the victims somehow, but in that case her classification would be "Master [pretty low number], humans".

Worm power classification is not extremely accurate. There's only so much information you can compress into a couple of words. But that's no different from real-world classification systems, e.g.

  Gondor's sustainment came in the form of massed supplies of Class I and Class V

The PRT agents who are told that Skitter is "Master 8, bugs" are /considerably/ better informed than those who aren't.
