To note, Bitch's Master classification is (as intended) about what kind of threat she offers in combat, not what her power actually does.

She doesn't get (much) /supernatural/ control over her dogs, and /she/ can't supernaturally harm you on contact. But her rating tells you "there are entities under her control, and some kind of close-contact threat".

There does seem to be a hole in the classification for "beneficially altering other human beings without controlling them or interacting with their powers". Othala is the only such character in canon (Panacea could have, but didn't), and her rating is not known.
