Well, looks like someone with an understanding of Military Jargon translator translated LOTR into it. Nifty.

You know what would be niftier? If someone who spoke Military Jargonese but had never heard of LOTR came along and tried to translate this back into epic fantasy-ese. Would it be like one of those jokes where they show you what happens when you use a machine translator to translate something from English to a foreign language and then translate the result back and forth a few times?

"And then Aragorn swung the light tactical warhead at the Witch King's head, but Sauron had hacked the encryption on the base code of reality and was able to institute a just in time patch to the physics engine, resulting in a failure to detonate."

It sometimes bothers me in fiction when I start wondering exactly how much information is really encoded in the jargon. The PRT ratings from Worm are a perfect example.

"Okay, fellow PRT men. We are here to deal with a highly dangerous individual, one Skitter. Use of extreme force is authorized. According to the briefing command transmitted before coms cut out she is an, um, Master 8, bugs."

"What the heck does that mean, Sarge?"

"Good question. Squad two, you up for a recon probe?"

"Oh hell, Sarge. Do we have to?"

"Sorry, men. Them's the breaks. Hey, before you leave, anyone want to place a bet on whether "Master 8, bugs" means she's going to turn your biomass into a swarm of bugs under her control, or mutate you into giant bugs that serve her, or cause you to hallucinate and think there are bugs everywhere, or cause your clothes and equipment to turn into bugs, or cause bugs to start hatching inside you and borrowing their way out?"
