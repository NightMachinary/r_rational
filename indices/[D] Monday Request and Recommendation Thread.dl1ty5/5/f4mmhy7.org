[[https://www.nature.com/articles/436150a][What's expected by us]] by Ted Chiang is probably interesting and quite relevant for many of the people in [[/r/rational]].

Why it's particularly relevant in spoiler tags: spoiler This story is particularly relevant because one major theme in a lot of rational fiction is the idea of a deadly idea. For example, CORDYCEPS and SCP stories in particular focus on that theme. However, in those stories the deadly "idea" or "meme" is usually unspecified or given a non realistic explanation. This story explores a more realistic deadly "idea" or "meme" and explains how and why society would collapse due to it. One particularly relevant quote: "People used to speculate about a thought that destroys the thinker, some unspeakable lovecraftian horror, or a GÃ¶del sentence that crashes the human logical system"
