I'm currently addicted to that Left Behind quest that was linked here a week or two ago. I find myself /really/ wishing I could have gotten involved before it was over, to be a relentless voice for MOAR ECO and, you know, not petulantly pissing off the petty, vengeful and near-omnipotent Deity.

So... ya'll got any more of them lore-rich logistics quests? Either ongoing or completed works for me.
