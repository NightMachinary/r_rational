Aside from stuff others have already recommended,

[[https://banter-latte.com/portfolio/interviewing-leather/][Interviewing Leather]]. It's rather short, and features no teenagers, but is an interesting exploration of that dynamic - it's focused on a reporter interviewing a supervillain. Generally very good. Is complete, and novel-length.

[[http://inmydaydreams.com/][Legion of Nothing]] is not rational at all, generally very /light/ in terms of tone, and plays superheroes straight (complete with Ancients technology and Alien Interference), but otherwise is well-written and its characters behave logically and rationally. Is also an ongoing serial.

[[https://villainousintent.wordpress.com/][World Domination in Retrospect]] is what a traditional superhero setting might look like from the perspective of a crazy villain. It's /very/ off-the-rails - but maybe worth a try.
