[[https://tiraas.net/table-of-contents/][The Gods Are Bastards]] just finished book 15, and the author is taking a break for the rest of the month before he begins posting chapters for book 16. Per his end note, he anticipates two more books in the series before it's completed.

The webnovel has a somewhat-contentious presence in this sub, and I would identify it as "rational-adjacent." Motivations and goals are fairly clear for most characters, and learning and growing are key goals for the main cast. The worldbuilding is probably my favorite part besides the banter between characters, and there's a lot of politics, theology, and shifting alliances underpinning everything that happens. I've seen over time that many of the criticisms of the story are from those who read the first few books and dropped them, and a lot of those are addressed or explored later on. I also found that the characterization and writing improved over time as the author seemed to grow and develop as well. I can't guarantee it'll appeal to everyone in the sub - actually, I guarantee it WON'T appeal to everyone in this sub! - but I know it's the kind of story I've really enjoyed. And with 15 books (and basically another book of side stories) to get through and only two to go, it's not a bad time to get started!
