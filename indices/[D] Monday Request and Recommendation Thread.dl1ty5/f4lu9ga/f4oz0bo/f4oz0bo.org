I really want to enjoy it, sort of hoping for it to scratch that Harry Potter itch, but it just drags like deadweight in many sections.

It's epic in length but not in scope. It feels like a trilogy squeezed into 16 books with random tonal changes, whole sections that feel like the trade war part of the phantom menace and everytime something interesting happens, we rush through it and focus on some minutia.

I think the main groups are the most boring to focus on while the interlude type chapters are by far the best thing, but are used too scarcely and so the many side characters don't have much depth outside as foils or plot points.

When I started skipping whole chapters since i felt they'd be boring, I realised I couldn't keep going any longer.

I vastly prefer the wandering Inn, but it too has it's problems.
