You're asking for novels, but I heavily recommend the entirety of the Star Trek TV/film saga. Just google for episode guides for each specific series to skip the stinkers (unless you love the jank) and start from the beginning (Star Trek TOS).

It's exactly what you're asking for, and what I was looking for a year ago until I marathoned the entire thing. Unfortunately the novels I've tried really suck.
