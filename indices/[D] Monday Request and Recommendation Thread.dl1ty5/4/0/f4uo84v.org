This sounds like TV serial format. Dr. Who, Star Trek...

But it's not just TV. Older adventure serials may also fit; Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote plenty of stuff using this formula (Tarzan, Pellucidar, John Carter of Mars...)

Or you could look up Alan Dean Foster's books (the Flinx series, perhaps, or Codgerspace). Or perhaps C.J. Cherryh's /Chanur/ series is more up your alley, though that's a little more into interplanetary politics.
