I am looking for a /"Government agency fighting aliens/supernatural threats"/ stories. Inspiration came from the XCOM(2) game . XCOM is the local area 51 that firstly fights against aliens as they invade, and then guerilla war when they've taken over. The themes I enjoy the most:

- how the XCOM researches aliens, and adapts their technology for their use.
- the competency and working together as organization feel - most non-player characters are stereotypical specialists in their field - there is a gritty workaholic chief military officer, strict chief scientist and younger, more enthusiastic chief engineer.
- going on missions - XCOM gains intelligence on aliens, finds what they are up to and then dispatches squad of soldiers to deal with it.

Rational take on this scenario would be really interesting, but if you happen to know anything else that fits, please tell!).Some things that I've already found - *Laundry files* (but it's not too serious), *Hellboy* - for the squad missions feel, *Rook* - I think there is too much of mystery there. I am also thinking about [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22171697-fear-the-sky#][Fear the sky]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/360929.Area_51][Area 51]].
