I'm not familiar with that scale. Doc has substantial reference to NSFW topics and suggestive conversation, but I don't recall any actual explicit content. I put it in the same category as Worm, though such topics come up more frequently (the plot is substantially more relationship focused, and sexuality is relevant).

But it's not erotic fiction, and I don't feel any concern about recommending it to people - anyone uncomfortable with that level of content will see what they're getting into within a couple of chapters.
