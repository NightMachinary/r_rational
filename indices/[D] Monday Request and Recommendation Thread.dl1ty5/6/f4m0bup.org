Looking for stories that are rational (or rational-adjacent) that have some degree of romance/relationships in them. Not to be a central focus of the story. As an example, I liked how this was portrayed in Worth the Candle although the "Harem" trope in it is a bit weird, but justifiable given how meta WtC is.
