[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14016/not-all-heroes][Not All Heroes]] by Rhodeworks. It's more of a dystopian future kind of story. Turns out people getting superpowers doesn't automatically make them Good Guys, though it does lead to a lot of collateral damage.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reckoners][The Reckoners]] is also pretty good. It's kind of like Ocean's Eleven, but with psychotic superheroes as the enemy. The heroes role is kind of flipped: people get superpowers, but the more they use it the more it drives them insane, so it's up to normal, non-powered people to beat them by outsmarting them.
