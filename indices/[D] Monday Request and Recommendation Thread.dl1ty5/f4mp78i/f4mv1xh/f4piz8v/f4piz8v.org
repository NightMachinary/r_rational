Definitely read [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]], if you haven't yet. Sylvester fits your recommendation to a tee(?).

Like all of Wildbow's works, it's more rational-adjacent than outright rational, but it features most of what people here look for: consistent worldbuilding, munchkinry, people acting according to their goals and values.

Twig takes place in an alt-History's 1920ies, where the Frankenstein experiments were picked up by the British Crown, letting them conquer the entire world via zombie armies and worse experiments. Sylvester is one such experiment; a kid who was given drugs and poisons from a young age to keep his brain malleable, letting him acquire any skill soon, but making long-term memory retention difficult. His skill set is usually tuned towards social manipulation. Since he's really weak, he could never win a fight on his own, and is thus paired with a group of other kid experiments called the Lambs. They are used as spies, assassins, and terrorists by the Crown. Twig is at its core a coming-of-age-story of these Lambs, and deals heavily with sociology, class, politics, war, and gaining independence from your parents.
