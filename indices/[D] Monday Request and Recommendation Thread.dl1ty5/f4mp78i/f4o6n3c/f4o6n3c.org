On spacebattles is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/to-the-victor-the-spoils.270718/][To the Victor, the Spoils]], about a famous supersoldier waking up decades into the future and being given a governorship/neofeudal duchy. The wider society which venerates her is generally awful and she's trying to figure out how to change things when most of what she has experience with is violence.

Three warnings - one, it updates only one a month (currently) and is fairly slow-paced. Two, the main character is a little Sueish - how much of this is justified by the "genetically engineered to be better" is debatable. Three, many readers (including me) disagree with the main character's and author's moral framing of both the historical and current conflict.
