Because I only /just/ realized the sequels came out, I'm going to recommend Michael Grant's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_(novel_series)][GONE]] series. Reading the first book of the sequel series, I'm reminded of just how seriously these books take themselves, for all that they're YA literature. The characters are teens, but the themes are adult, and for a story that's essentially just one more take on "Lord of the Flies," it's still an interesting, fresh take that also neatly slots into the intelligent-use-of-well-defined-powers genre.

Though, all of that is recommendation for the first series. I'm working through the first book in the next series, which is much more explicitly superhero v supervillain (in a way that's probably an interesting reflection about how marvel movies have influenced our culture in the interim between the great-recession influenced first series and the modern one, but that's a digression for another day). The writing quality and characterization is still excellent, not just for YA but in general (I re-read the opening to a chapter three times because it was so elegantly done), though I'm holding off on recommending it because I'm not sure yet if, having read worm (and this new series has some really suspicious similarities), reading the new series really adds anything.

Also, I'm going to rec Alicorn's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1118999][Radiance]], the sequel to Luminosity. Obviously it's a common rec, but specifically I'm putting it out here as someone who read Luminosity, liked it but was depressed at the ending, tried reading Radiance, dropped it, and then picked it up again years after to speed-read the whole thing in threeish days. I don't know if it's me that's changed, or just that I had enough distance from Luminosity's ending, but it Radiance was significantly more readable this time around. So if you're in a similar position as I was, check it out.
