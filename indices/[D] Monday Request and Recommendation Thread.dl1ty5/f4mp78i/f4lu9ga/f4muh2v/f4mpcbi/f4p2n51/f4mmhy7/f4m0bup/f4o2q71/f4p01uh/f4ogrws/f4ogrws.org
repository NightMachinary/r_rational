I'm 23 episodes into Gundam Wing, and while I feel an obligation to continue it to the end, I'm not sure I would say I strongly endorse it.

I've seen Zeta Gundam, and will probably watch Double Zeta after finishing Wing just to wrap up my knowledge of the Universal Century timeline.

Are there Gundam mangas that are considered good in the scanlation? Most of my interaction with the fandom has been the various videos. I enjoyed 08th MS Team, 0083, Iron-Blooded Orphans, 0080, the recent Red Comet OVA, and G Gundam.

Are there other "Mechs exist for a reason other than rule of cool" shows that are recommended? I found Star Driver, Promare, Gurren Lagann, and Gunbuster/Diebuster to be good, but never got into Gundam 00 or Gundam SEED.
