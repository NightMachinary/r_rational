I had initially thought 'uplift' was a good description for what I was looking for, but the term is already in use to describe stories about adding intelligence to species: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_(science_fiction][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_(science_fiction)]]). A cursory search on the term didn't find what I was looking for at all, but it's possible that people are using that word for this too, and it's just swamped by references to the Brin series?

I enjoyed Arithmancer, and I'm interested in Safehold especially, but I'll probably give all of those suggestions a shot :-)
