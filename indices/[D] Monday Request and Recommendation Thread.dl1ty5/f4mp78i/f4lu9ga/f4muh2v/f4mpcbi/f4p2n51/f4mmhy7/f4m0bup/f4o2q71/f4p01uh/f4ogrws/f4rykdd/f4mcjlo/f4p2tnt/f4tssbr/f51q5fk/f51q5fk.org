(Since you mentioned "Island in the Sea of Time", I am including stories of technological uplift initiated by a group of people.)

Some of the better known classic examples:

- Mark Twain, [[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?2201][A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court][Wikipedia]] (1889) -- a modern human goes back in time and rebuilds civilization
- L. Sprague de Camp, [[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?25655][Lest Darkness Fall]] (1939-1941), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lest_Darkness_Fall][Wikipedia]] -- a modern human goes back in time and rebuilds civilization
- H. Beam Piper, [[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?12411][Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen]] (1964-1965), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kalvan_of_Otherwhen][Wikipedia]] later continued by John F. Carr, Roland J. Green and now Wolfgang Diehr -- a modern human is transported to a parallel world and helps it progress

More recent examples include:

- William R. Forstchen's [[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?3491][The Lost Regiment]] series, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Regiment][Wikipedia]] -- on a distant planet, multiple transportees from other planets (including Earth) compete and cooperate, which sometimes results in technological progression
- Eric Flint's [[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?25194][Assiti Shards Universe]], especially its "163x" branch -- modern humans go back in time and rebuild civilization
- Adrian Tchaikovsky's [[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?51315][Children of Time]] series -- spiders progress on a distant planet [the character who originally helps them progress is not exactly rational, though]
- Olan Thorensen's [[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?48207][Destiny's Crucible]] series -- a modern Earthling uplifts another planet
