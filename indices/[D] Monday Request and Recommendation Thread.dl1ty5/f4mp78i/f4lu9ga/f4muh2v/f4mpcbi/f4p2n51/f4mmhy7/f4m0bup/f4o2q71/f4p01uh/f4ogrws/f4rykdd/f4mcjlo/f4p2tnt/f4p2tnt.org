I'm not sure if there's a real genre name for what I'm looking for already, but I think of them as "societal bootstrapping" stories - stories where a rational character comes in from somewhere with a scientific tradition and realistically uplifts a whole society/kingdom/world. The only ones I'm aware of so far is "A Hero's War", and maybe "Island in the Sea of Time" or debatably HP:MoR.
