[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26116/the-eighth-warden][The Eight Warden]] might be worth a shot. It's about knight who gets kicked out of his order because he can do magic. The thing is that he doesn't control the magic, it kind of just happens subconsciously.

He ends up finding work as a caravan guard, when he comes across a women. She's actually a pickpocket with a bounty, he intends on bringing her in. His magic "flares up" and marks her somehow, linking the two of them. So instead they decide to find a way of removing the link.
