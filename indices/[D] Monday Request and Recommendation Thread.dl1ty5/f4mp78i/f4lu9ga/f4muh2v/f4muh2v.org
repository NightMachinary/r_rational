Gnomon by Nick Harkaway is not exactly rational but is certainly rationalist-adjacent. It's definitely inspired by ideas in /Godel, Escher, Bach/ and /Inception/. The plot centres around a detective working a case in a future Britain mass surveillance state that has the capability of reading people's minds. It's the sort of book that I can tell after reading I will undoubtedly revisit and reread multiple times in the future.

The prose of the book is remarkably good, and it brings up a lot of interesting ideas. The book is extremely dense and has a lot of stuff going on, and I'm sure I'll get more of it on a future reread.
