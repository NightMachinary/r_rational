Yep! I _mostly_ enjoy_ it, although I've got a few issues. Seconding a few things: the world-building is on-point, characters really do develop, and not everyone here will like it.

Reliable update schedule, although I don't like it enough to read immediately on updates, I always get around to reading it eventually.
