I'm looking for rational works in which the protagonist tries to tackle systemic issues in a world, who navigates complex political situations, and/or wins through the use of his faction rather than personally hitting things. Things that I think would enhance such a story would be clever use of magic, meaningful character development, multiple competent agents, main character required to receiving meaningful help, a focus on allying with adversaries instead of only defeating them.

Stories that I have read that tickles this fancy(not going into the flaws of the works):

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.8961/][With This Ring]][DC SI]. The main character in various ways try to find mundane uses for DC magic/technology. Examples include introducing a magic school and let encourage armies to learn magic and asking a mad social scientist to figure out why i.e. a supervillain robs a bank with a freeze gun instead of finding commercial uses for it, introduces a magic school. I in particular enjoy that the main character tries to figure out what other people want and aligns their incentives to further his goals and really want more of that.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6279gwfusrdcsx/The_Two_Year_Emperor.zip?dl=0][Two Year Emperor]][DnD Isekai]. Guy is yanked into a DnD world, crowned emperor and fights Evil by i.e. making Wish traps to give everyone youth and major permanent buffs.

[[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][Significant Digits]][HPMOR fanfic/cont.] HJVP controls a large faction and attempts to create major societal changes.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3998737?view_full_work=true][Amelia]][Worm fanfic]: Through clever use of power the protagonists achieves power and creates their own team from which they derive their power. There are reconstruction of societies from the ground up (mmmm yummy) and political navigation(i.e. countries contesting over extradimensional land) though I would have liked this to be a little more of the focus.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire/][Enlightened Empire]][Isekaiish]: Protagonist uses modern world knowledge to accent in power and play empire building with the big guys. There is some incompetent adversaries but at least one competent one.
