Oh, I know about SCP, but I was afraid of delving into it. Mostly because I ha hard time determining what it is exactly. Are those actually stories? Looking at the closest thing at [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][http://www.scp-wiki.net]] it looks like it's just descriptions/classification of SCP objects. It gives you an impression of role-playing, as opposed to a well defined fiction story.

Also, seems like this is a compilation of a lot of works by a lot of (mostly amateur) authors. Is there any coherent main story arc?
