I just think it's dishonest, for me who lacks the belief in any god, to hedge my bets and choose a religion who I claim to follow. Also, wouldn't the almighty creator of the universe see through my scam?

Basically I can't make myself believe something I'm unconvinced of (and why would I want to) so why fake it?
