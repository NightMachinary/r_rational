Excuse me, but this bears saying in capital letters.

WHY SHOULD YOU BELIEVE MORE IN BELIEF-ORIENTED MYSTICISM THAN IN THE POWER OF YOUR OWN HANDS AND YOUR OWN MIND!?

Everything in the natural world plays a part in cause and effect. If you are sufficiently capable, all of it, every last quark, can be turned to a purpose /you/ deem fit, although I will kick you around if you try it with /people/. Nonetheless, simply as a living creature in the natural world, you possess a foundation for ultimate freedom.

Why should you respect a being who holds Himself back and refuses to interact in the common, causal fashion of two living beings, Who instead sits "outside" the universe of cause and effect, and demands that you pervert your thought processes away from what is useful /in all other circumstances/ just for /His/ sake? Why should you cripple yourself for the sake of Someone who won't reach out His hand to help you as a few people /claim/ He did for a group of a million Jewish slaves -- a deed for which He, /of course/, left no evidence!

What an ego this God of yours has!

Sure, you can go the "philosopher of religion" route, and start whittling down your God to be unable to do much anything other than provide a philosophical foundation. That /does/ get you away from the nasty old issue of evidence. Then, however, you've got a philosophical foundation based on nothing you can think about, talk to, or handle in any way -- a God every bit as impersonal and uncaring as the atheist's empty space, but with more philosophy-of-religion books. What good is that?

Besides which, His eternity is cheap and shabby. You wouldn't like it very much.
