There's quite a lot of parallels between Christian beliefs and the rationalist mythos.

1. Do good in the world by helping the needy, and convert others to Christianity. When Judgement Day comes, you will be rewarded with eternal life and happiness.

2. Do good in the world by working on x-risk, and spread awareness of the Friendly AI problem. When the Singularity comes, you will be rewarded with eternal life and happiness.

There are attractors in meme space that pull beliefs in and fit them into a story. This is one of them. We know that our beliefs are shaped by our biases, and that many biases are shared by all humans. Is it surprising that the same biases affect rationalists and Christians in the same way?

Oh, and there's a particular detail that I like better about the rational take: Instead of the good going to Heaven and the wicked going to Hell, everyone goes to the same place and it's a matter of determining what that place will be like. I think that's a much better story. Changing that detail back gives you Roko's Basilisk.
