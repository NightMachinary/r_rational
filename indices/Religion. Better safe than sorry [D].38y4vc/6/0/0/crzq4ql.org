Don't do it. It may sound fun, running a cult, but you have to come up with a Scripture long enough to be divided into an entire yearly/multi-yearly round of weekly readings, or else people will realize there's nothing new in religion this week and stop attending. You also have to make it appealing enough to pull in new blood over the first couple of generations via conversions, until you get a steady breeding population of 10,000 going.
