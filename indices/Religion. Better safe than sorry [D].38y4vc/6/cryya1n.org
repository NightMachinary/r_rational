There's not much point in discussing Pascal's wager unless you're /already/ a believer. A quick look at the argument reveals that it's not really about whether you should believe. It just lays out the possible consequences of particular beliefs. But that does sod-all for changing anyone's mind. People can't really choose what they believe -- various pieces go into your brain, it does its thing, and then you're either convinced or not. You have some control over it, but by and large belief is sorta involuntary, and certainly not as simple as deciding to believe in god one fine day.

Telling an atheist about Pascal's wager is a waste of time -- if they didn't believe in god earlier, they won't believe in god after the argument. If they accept it, the most they'll do is go through the motions of believing in god, something that any omniscient being will immediately see through. So what use is Pascal's wager anyway?

It's for religious people to tell other religious people.

There's an important unspoken filter you must run all religious arguments through -- namely, who is the audience? With a handful of exceptions, all religious arguments are directed by believers at fellow believers. They're preaching to the choir, because it's a community ritual that everyone gains from. The person who makes the argument seems pious and knowledgeable about their religion, and the people listening affirm their religiosity by nodding and agreeing. They can also get bonus brownie points by quibbling over tiny details while still agreeing overall. Everybody wins.

It's not even an uncommon pattern. As far as I can tell it's just some sort of naturally occurring ingroup dynamic where people almost ritually say certain things they all agree with. Reddit knows this pattern well. I believe the technical term is 'circlejerk'. :P

For such things, I always try to remember that humans beings are deeply political creatures, but they're not quite consciously aware of this. Politics is basically the art of advancing a personal agenda under the guise of a public one. You make things look a certain way (because that form is socially acceptable) even though it is something quite different. But such trickery goes /really/ deep into our brains, to the point that we think we're making a rational argument, even though we're really just setting up a circlejerk. You think your allegiance is to truth and reason, but your brain is more interested in advancing the cause of social cohesion and scoring you tribal brownie points.

*Tl;dr:* Pascal's wager is fine if you're a religious person who wants to reaffirm their belief or strengthen a religious community's social bonds. If you're an atheist, it's a complete waste of your time. Unless you're pretending to be religious or starting a cult or something.
