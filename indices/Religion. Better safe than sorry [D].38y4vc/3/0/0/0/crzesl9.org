There's a decision-theoretic problem if you assume rationality must be computationally unbounded. A bounded-rational agent is normatively required to deal with the possibilities it considers most probable first, and given how small we usually say the probability is in Pascal's Mugging, we should usually expend all our computing power before paying the mugger.
