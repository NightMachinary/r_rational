  I don't agree with the metaethical justification behind it, but I can't deny that their predictions regarding the effects it was going to have on society seem to have panned out.
#+end_quote

In what sense?

#+begin_quote
  Other than that, it's hard to think of other examples. Probably the Inquisition, although that's substantially misrepresented in popular culture.

My understanding of it was a brutal crackdown of subsects of Christianity that the Catholic Church did not want to propagate or spread, with a good helping of torturing and burning of heretics in general and practitioners of withcraft much more rarely. Do you have a different one?

#+begin_quote
  And ... I'm sorry, but secular-humanist ethical thought seems exceptionally prone to taking a massive simplification of ethics and running with it so far that millions of people die.
#+end_quote

This seems like a very strange characterization to me, and I'm really curious to know what you're referring to when you say this. Do you have any historical examples of secular-humanism advocating for or enabling the death of millions?

#+begin_quote
  I'm a humanist myself (albeit not particularly secular), but there's nothing there with a track record anywhere near that of any major religion. If you can't be your own ethicist, then you're better off trusting the Church than your local atheist.

The same Church that harbors and protects child molestation amongst its clergy? I'm sorry, but that seems almost painfully absurd. I don't know what the flavor of your local atheists are, and there's nothing about the word that inherently supports that an atheist will be rational or ethical, let alone a humanist, but if you're just picking random people off the street and comparing them to the "The Church" as a monolothic entity, then I'm pretty sure you're going to find people with a better track record on things like whether child molesters should be prosecuted at the very least.
