  Increased promiscuity, increased tolerance for sexual deviations from the norm, traditional marriage vastly less popular ... I might disagree on whether that's a bad thing, because most opposition to it seems to be based on a misinterpretation of the telos of man, but it did happen.

Oh, that. Well yeah, that's not really a prediction so much as a recognition of human nature, not to mention history. They're the ones that, by and large, made up these rules and imposed them on society (not often through force, but definitely a type of soft coercion/manipulation). Of course once those rules stop being seen as sacrosanct people revert back to how they acted before.

By predictions I thought you meant the ones that matter to those who don't already share their religious values, such as that society would descend into loveless anarchy and abandoned children would litter the streets. I'm being hyperbolic, but not terribly so: the idea that contraception is actually /harmful/ to people, that it reduces their standard of living, increases pain, reduces pleasure, reduces safety, increases dysfunction... none of THOSE predictions panned out, and in fact we can see many of the opposite occur.

  Marxism

Are you confusing Marxism with Stalinism? The former is indeed a secular humanist philosophy, but is not the one that led to millions of deaths.

  French Revolution
#+end_quote

Could you explain the link you're perceiving between secular humanism and the French Revolution? It was the result of the ideals of the Enlightenment, but as a whole it was a socio-political event, not the result of secular humanism: to lay the tens of thousands of deaths of the French Revolution as a whole at secular humanism's door would be exactly like blaming the millions upon millions that died throughout the Crusades all on Christianity (and Islam).

  libertarianism, Ayn Rand

As irritating or ignorant as some Libertarian and Objectivist beliefs are, I don't see how they advocate for the deaths of millions, nor do their philosophies have any such track record in the real world.

  and Peter Singer

Wow. What do I not know about Peter Singer? o_O

#+begin_quote
  ... is this intended to be a serious argument? Sorry, it's hard to tell with text sometimes.

No, just a bit of absurdity to counter the idea that the Church is a better ethicist than "your local atheist," as if comparing an individual's ethics to an organization's codified rules makes any sense.

Again, I don't know the flavor of your local average atheist, some are self-centered nihilistic twits, but generally speaking, the Catholic Church is not considered particularly ethical by those of us who have left the religious fold, even putting aside their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases#Criticisms_of_church_responses][really, really, really bad track record]] of handling child molestation among their clergy.
