  Gonna ignore the tautology of this, and go to this part which I'm honestly confused about:
#+end_quote

Yeah, I figure this is not the place to start trying to bridge that particular inferential gap.

  The Catholic Church has been behind some major, egregiously harmful movements, behaviors and beliefs, not the least of which currently is the teaching that contraception is so sinful that not even people living in a country with epidemic HIV/AIDS should use it.
#+end_quote

They waver pretty heavily on that, actually. But yeah.

The contraception thing ... well, I don't agree with the metaethical justification behind it, but I can't deny that their predictions regarding the effects it was going to have on society seem to have panned out.

Other than that, it's hard to think of other examples. Probably the Inquisition, although that's substantially misrepresented in popular culture. Maybe the crusades. But both of those are heavily characterized by the Church being influenced by society/politics around it, rather than the other way around.

And ... I'm sorry, but secular-humanist ethical thought seems exceptionally prone to taking a massive simplification of ethics and running with it so far that millions of people die. I'm a humanist myself (albeit not particularly secular), but there's nothing there with a track record anywhere near that of any major religion. If you can't be your own ethicist, then you're better off trusting the Church than your local atheist.
