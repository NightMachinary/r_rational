Speaking as an actual Christian - yes, we exist on [[/r/rational]] - we /don't/ believe that Christianity is a "free ticket to heaven".

There are a few ways of wording this, and it comes at different strengths, but pretty much everyone agrees that you have to lead a good life to count - as, obviously, anyone who actually believed Jesus was the Son of God /would/ rationally do. Quite a lot of people also agree that, if you're good regardless, you'll still get in.

So why believe at all? Well, firstly, 'cos it's true. But more in line with the OP, Christianity has had a bunch of thought put into ways to /be more virtuous/ - which, obviously, is useful for fulfilling human values as long as you believe human values exist, regardless of their origin. (For example, the Catholic Church was very good at predicting slavery would ... not be looked on kindly by anyone outside that particular cluster****.)

Oh, and I'm planning to live a lot more than 150 years, obviously ;) And then I'm gonna do it again, God willing.

Anyway - this comment is a little rambling, but I get the impression most religions consider roughly-similar codes of ethical behavior to be necessary, if not sufficient, for salvation. Believing helps with that, but I wouldn't consider it necessary.
