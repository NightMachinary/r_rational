    I can't deny that their predictions regarding the effects it was going to have on society seem to have panned out.
  #+end_quote

  In what sense?
#+end_quote

Increased promiscuity, increased tolerance for sexual deviations from the norm, traditional marriage vastly less popular ... I might disagree on whether that's a /bad/ thing, because most opposition to it seems to be based on a misinterpretation of the /telos/ of man, but it did happen.

  My understanding of it was a brutal crackdown of subsects of Christianity that the Catholic Church did not want to propagate or spread, with a good helping of torturing and burning of heretics in general and practitioners of withcraft much more rarely. Do you have a different one?
#+end_quote

No, that's pretty accurate. Sorry if I seemed to imply you were ignorant on the subject, it just irritates me that popular culture is. (It /might/ be worth noting that ecclesiastical courts were widely considered fairer and more lenient than the alternatives, but that's a quibble at best.)

  This seems like a very strange characterization to me, and I'm really curious to know what you're referring to when you say this. Do you have any historical examples of secular-humanism advocating for or enabling the death of millions?
#+end_quote

Marxism, French Revolution, libertarianism, Ayn Rand, and Peter Singer all spring to mind (in descending order of awfulness, roughly.)

LessWrong-style metaethics are pretty good, with a healthy respect for complexity of value; sorry if I seemed to be impugning us.

  The same Church that harbors and protects child molestation amongst its clergy?
#+end_quote

... is this intended to be a serious argument? Sorry, it's hard to tell with text sometimes.
