  So why believe at all? Well, firstly, 'cos it's true.

Gonna ignore the tautology of this, and go to this part which I'm honestly confused about:

  But more in line with the OP, Christianity has had a bunch of thought put into ways to be more virtuous - which, obviously, is useful for fulfilling human values as long as you believe human values exist, regardless of their origin. (For example, the Catholic Church was very good at predicting slavery would ... not be looked on kindly by anyone outside that particular cluster****.)

Could you explain this please? The Catholic Church has been behind some major, egregiously harmful movements, behaviors and beliefs, not the least of which currently is the teaching that contraception is so sinful that not even people living in a country with epidemic HIV/AIDS should use it.

It seems to me that saying they've put thought into being "more virtuous" is only of value if you take for granted that their virtues are correct, despite them having shifted on a number of issues over the centuries, and often lagging behind secular-humanist ethical thought.
