  There are a few ways of wording this, and it comes at different strengths, but pretty much everyone agrees that you have to lead a good life to count

Wait, doesn't God/Jesus forgive everyone's sins as long as they truly repent and believe? Or am I confusing Christian sects here? But otherwise why would priests care to give the last rite to even the vilest criminals on death row? After all they would be bound for hell no matter what they do in those last days/hours. Or is that something that only happens in movies? As someone with a non-religious upbringing most things I know about Christianity is from observing Christians, talking to them and the media so I may be confused here.
