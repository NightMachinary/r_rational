You have to change your behavior in order to repent; it's just that you can't damn yourself so badly that nothing you could ever do would make up for it.

You're right, though; Christianity tends to run on virtue-ethical theories of morality, so what matters is being a good /person/, not leading a good /life/. Those are technically distinct concepts, although in practise people tend to treat them as pointing to the same thing.
