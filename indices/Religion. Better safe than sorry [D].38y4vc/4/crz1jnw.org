One could imagine an infinite amount of gods, each with their own rules for reward/punishment. Maybe god punishes you for unjustified beliefs, and accepting Pascal's wager actually sends you to hell forever.

The math doesn't support Pascal's wager once you consider more possibilities. Some Christians think that unbelief results in endless time spent in pain and misery. Well, suppose Religion X threatens a fractal super-hell, where every uncountably divisible moment of time produces a new timeline with a new, recursive fractal hell contained within it. Religion X's hell is not only worse than Christian hell, it is infinitely worse, in a higher order of infinity.

So, gambling with expectation values doesn't work, unless you think you can assign a zero probability to every imaginable high-consequence religion besides those that are currently popular. Pascal evidently thought you could, but that seems presumptuous to me. It would reduce the wager to, "If you already think Religion Y is your best shot, you should go with it," which isn't saying much.
