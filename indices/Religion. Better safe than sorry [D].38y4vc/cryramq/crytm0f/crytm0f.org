Pascal did address these things.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager]]

He noted that other religions were obviously false and explained it and gave what he saw as proofs and suggested that you ask for advice from others on how to learn how to believe and follow their path.

  However, as noted above, nowhere in the establishment of the wager does Pascal appeal to feigned belief; God, being omniscient, would not succumb to such trickery and unwittingly reward the disingenuous. Rather, in the passage following the establishment of the wager, Pascal addresses a hypothetical person who has already weighed the rationality of believing in God through the wager and is convinced by it, but remains unable to sincerely believe. Again, as noted above, Pascal offers this person a way to escape the irrational sentiment that compels him to withhold belief in God after the validity of the wager has been rationally conceded. This way consists of applying oneself to spiritual discipline, study, and community.

He was a highly intelligent philosopher and scientist. He's not going to make the sort of silly mistakes Dawkins mentioned. He explained what he saw as rational reasons for believing in god, and then used his wager as a little push to help people overcome their own irrationality.

He wrote an entire book. People should actually read it before criticizing it. This is a big reason why I dislike Dawkins. He's great on evolution, but intellectually both very talkative and very lazy outside his field. Views on everything, but he does little research.
