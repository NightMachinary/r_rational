So just to be clear, you have now shifted the argument from one about my beliefs about religion, which I could easily have expanded upon from just the first half of your post, to a personal attack on my past behavior, which I now have the need to defend myself against, despite them having nothing to do with the present conversation. I want to make this clear incase you lack the self awareness that what you did is engage in ad hominem, perhaps the lowest form of argument available.

I won't return the favor, because despite your accusations and misrepresentation of me, I try to hold myself to a higher standard than that. I just want you to know incase you have the self awareness and humility to recognize that if you're losing an argument, going into a person's past and finding other things about them to discredit their words does not meet, as you referenced, basic argument ediquette, and perhaps will apologize.

  I don't know the actual quality of your research. You didn't study every religion for a start, many of them are regional and you wouldn't be able to find much online. You studied some subsection of them, likely major ones that were popularly available. So I know you're exaggerating about your studying.
#+end_quote

I studied every religion and many of the subsects available through online research and two classes in aboriginal theology. When I said "every religion" I assumed it would be taken for granted that I didn't mean every single religion and spiritual belief throughout history and across the planet, but rather the major ones that are most commonly referred to and discussed. Thank you for the semantic nitpick: in the future I will be more careful with my wording.

  I don't know how good you are at researching. Did you actually read the religious texts of the varying religions?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  Did you consult scholars? Did you consult scholarly texts?
#+end_quote

Yes and yes, as long as their works were available online.

#+begin_quote
  Did you try to get a balanced perspective? Did you check archaeology to see how well their claims were substantiated?
#+end_quote

Same as above. Many of the claims were obviously not falsifiable, but of the major religions that have huge incentives to discover evidence of their religious beliefs' history and accuracy, such as the expeditions to uncover evidence of the Jewish Exodus from Egypt, or Noah's Flood, there has been none found.

#+begin_quote
  From what I remember of you from CMV you mostly don't.
#+end_quote

Okay, so now we're getting to the personal stuff. From what I remember of you, you did not post in any of the CMVs you linked to, though I could be wrong: you never engaged in argument with me directly, simply responding to reports based on people who ran the gamut of offensive and insulting, so I'm happy to correct whatever false light that might have cast me in.

  Here where you seem to try and win a semantics debate on what a prejudice is.
#+end_quote

Yes, as that was the entire point of the mostly tongue-and-cheek CMV. You say "try to win a semantic debate" as if that is automatically a bad thing, when the entire point of the argument was clearing up what exactly qualifies as a "prejudice" and whether things we less often associate with the word are in fact one.

  Here where you try to convince people that a group is annoying and that you don't respect them with wordplay.
#+end_quote

Let me correct you there: Here I ask for evidence that a group I find annoying is actually not worth my disregard and worth respecting, based on clearly set standards and very specific evidence that failed to materialize. I then moved the goal posts very deliberately toward my opponents to make their job easier, and they still failed to land a single one, instead resorting to ad hominem, special pleading, and as is usual with many MRA advocates, shifting all the blame to feminism despite me pointing out in the original post why I would not find such arguments convincing.

  Here where you try to convince people that we should transplant an inflammatory phrase to another unrelated situation, another wordplay heavy argument.
#+end_quote

It's a curious thing to see your words twisted by someone who you've never met, but it will never cease to hurt. If you consider the argument against climate change and the referral to those who deny it as "climate change denial" inflammatory, then that's your opinion, but if you consider my argument as transplanting it to an "unrelated situation" when the exact same outcome from both beliefs is the same, and consider that "wordplay heavy" despite the very clear standard of focusing on economic fallout rather than scientific evidence, I'm not sure what else there is to say other than that you perhaps merely skimmed these things in order to find things to discredit me with.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not really convinced from what little I know that your reason and evidence is so strong I should trust you just based off your word. You seem to focus more off trapping someone in some wordplay argument than focusing on the facts and the evidence. So your statement that whatever research you did was better than Pascal's doesn't feel convincing to me, as you haven't proven you have done any good research or given me evidence of such.
#+end_quote

I never asked you to trust me based off my word, not would I expect it of you. I don't particularly care what you think of me, but as a mod of CMV, you should know better than to assume other people's perspective, and pay closer attention to what they say rather than putting words in their mouth, as you have done to me twice now even before this post, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/38y4vc/religion_better_safe_than_sorry_d/crywtvd][here]] and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/38y4vc/religion_better_safe_than_sorry_d/crza69g][here]] as I pointed out in my responses.

#+begin_quote
  Good evidence and facts are what matters, and as is normal for a casual conversation neither you nor Pascal drew that many in.
#+end_quote

The next time you want to advance a conversation to more than casual conversation, by all means ask politely and I will be happy to do so. Throw more sucker-punches like this in efforts to discredit people however, and you will quickly gain a reputation for inflammatory argumentative tactics.
