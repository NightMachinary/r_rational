  That wasn't my point at all: you actually transplanted a response from one part of the conversation to a specific question about the difference in standards. Reread what I said.

  I used to be religious. I studied every religion when I started doubting mine. I don't base my dismissal of religions I disagree with on standards that my own beliefs can't meet, as Pascal does. If you can point to some hypocrisy or double standard my beliefs have, by all means attempt to do so, but the idea that Pascal's blatant bias for what he took for granted as true should be excused among rational people is ridiculous.

If you didn't intend those two sentences, about you reading from every religion and you not having hypocrisy about knowledge of every religion then your sentence construction is confusing to me.

  Granted, but under basic context of the conversation I thought it would be understood that "researched all the religions" would be taken as covering all the obvious and most populated ones. My mistake.

I now know four religions you've studied. I don't know what you find obvious and populated. Christianity and Islam presumably at least, and probably Roman Catholics, plus Aboriginal religions. I still have little clue what you studied. With that paucity of information it's hard to make judgements.

  arbitrary categorizations for personality that utterly lack evidence or rationale

That was more you noting the common elements of what I suspect was racism and astrology than you giving complete definitions. As you later noted, racism can also include negative comments about skin colour, not just personality. You didn't define prejudice.

  There is no way to assert that you want a negative view of a group of people to be made positive without making it obvious that you don't have a positive view of them.

CMV and any argument are bad places for changing your positive or negative feelings since they are based on lots of things like what you ate, how bright the sun is, whether you've got laid that day. They are emotions, you are free to feel what you want.

You could easily have just said "CMV, MRAs have no major accomplishments or feats." which would have been factual and non emotional.

"CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they're annoying and I don't respect them." is a rather bad post that I would suspect was trolling.

"CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they have no legal right to it" is better, though deserve is a complex term whose meaning should be unpacked.

"CMV, Israels shouldn't feel guilty about not giving Palestinians a state because Palestinians have no legal right to it" is even better.
