  So just to be clear, you have now shifted the argument from one about my beliefs about religion, which I could easily have expanded upon from just the first half of your post, to a personal attack on my past behavior, which I now have the need to defend myself against, despite them having nothing to do with the present conversation. I want to make this clear incase you lack the self awareness that what you did is engage in ad hominem, perhaps the lowest form of argument available.

  If you can point to some hypocrisy or double standard my beliefs have, by all means attempt to do so, but the idea that Pascal's blatant bias for what he took for granted as true should be excused among rational people is ridiculous.

  I don't take for granted that I'm right in the same way that he does: he used what amount to literal double standards and hypocrisy to assert his own religion's truth and dismiss others'.

I'm not sure why you decided to challenge me to find some hypocrisy or double standard of beliefs in comparison to the irrationality of Pascal and then were surprised when I pointed out a double standard of irrationality in you. It's not an ad hominen, I was responding to you. If you would prefer not to do that you probably shouldn't ask me to point to some hypocrisy or double standard in your beliefs.

Both of you left your arguments out of your writings rather than explaining in depth, both of you display some errors in reasoning, you used Pascal's as a reason to discredit him and not read his arguments in any more depth, you didn't use your own to discredit yourself. Double standards and hypocrisy.

  I studied every religion and many of the subsects available through online research and two classes in aboriginal theology. When I said "every religion" I assumed it would be taken for granted that I didn't mean every single religion and spiritual belief throughout history and across the planet, but rather the major ones that are most commonly referred to and discussed. Thank you for the semantic nitpick: in the future I will be more careful with my wording.

This is what I mean about trusting your arguments. You're leaving things out. I have no real idea about the breadth of your research because you're not mentioning any actual names bar Aboriginals or much about in what depth you went into beyond some subsects. That's fine, that's normal in conversations, but it's rather useless to me on actual 'How valid are these arguments' just as Pascal's arguments were rather useless to you. Pascal revealed next to nothing about why he dismissed other religions, you revealed next to nothing, revealing nothing is not evidence of hypocrisy and double standards.

You reveal a little bit with the miracles stuff, but otherwise very little.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, as that was the entire point of the mostly tongue-and-cheek CMV. You say "try to win a semantic debate" as if that is automatically a bad thing, when the entire point of the argument was clearing up what exactly qualifies as a "prejudice" and whether things we less often associate with the word are in fact one.

Prejudice and racism are both words with a lot of confusing different definitions and meanings which vary from person to person. Having it as an entire debate as to how they're connected with the word astrology without actually defining either of them is about as useless as having a debate about whether a tree makes a sound when it falls and no one is there to hear it without defining sound or hearing. It's a pointless point.

  Here I ask for evidence that a group I find annoying is actually not worth my disregard and worth respecting, based on clearly set standards and very specific evidence that failed to materialize.
#+end_quote

Predictably, when you have a trolly title your points don't come across well and your goals and standards are not met. Better to lead with the standards and the meanings, not to antagonize whatever group. Mudslinging tends to lead to mudslinging.

#+begin_quote
  but if you consider my argument as transplanting it to an "unrelated situation" when the exact same outcome from both beliefs is the same, and consider that "wordplay heavy" despite the very clear standard of focusing on economic fallout rather than scientific evidence, I'm not sure what else there is to say other than that you perhaps merely skimmed these things in order to find things to discredit me with.
#+end_quote

I read the post but I wasn't actually sure what your point was much, it was rather long and bounced around from point to point and I evidently missed your argument. 13 paragraphs in before it got to stating the point. Ok, that's a fair argument, although rather confusing to find. One of the benefits of having a tldr is that people can find what your argument was. I assumed it was something else.

#+begin_quote
  I never asked you to trust me based off my word, not would I expect it of you.
#+end_quote

You stated your position was superior to Pascal's because you'd done more research, that you didn't have his hypocrisy and double standards, hence to agree with you I'd have to trust your research.

On the combativeness- if you want I feel no real need to challenge you on hypocrisy and double standards, just, you said to do so. You challenging me to prove your beliefs have two negative characteristics is inevitably going to lead to issues and I am not sure why you did it if you didn't want this sort of thing.
