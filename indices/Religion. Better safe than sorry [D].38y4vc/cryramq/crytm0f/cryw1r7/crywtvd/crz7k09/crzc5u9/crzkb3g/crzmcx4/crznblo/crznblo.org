  I'm not sure why you decided to challenge me to find some hypocrisy or double standard of beliefs in comparison to the irrationality of Pascal and then were surprised when I pointed out a double standard of irrationality in you.
#+end_quote

Because that is literally the definition of ad hominem: ignoring my arguments against Pascal's beliefs on religion and trying to turn the discussion into one of me that would allow you to disregard my arguments as a matter of course. And you didn't actually point out a double standard or irrationality: you just pointed to posts I made in some cases over a year ago and insulted them with various inaccurate summarizations or descriptions of them being about wordplay.

#+begin_quote
  It's not an ad hominen, I was responding to you. If you would prefer not to do that you probably shouldn't ask me to point to some hypocrisy or double standard in your beliefs.
#+end_quote

It is actually an ad hominem, because we were specifically talking about religious beliefs. That you are trying to lecture me on proper argumentation and are a mod of CMV and don't recognize this is rather disturbing.

#+begin_quote
  Both of you left your arguments out of your writings rather than explaining in depth, both of you display some errors in reasoning, you used Pascal's as a reason to discredit him and not read his arguments in any more depth, you didn't use your own to discredit yourself. Double standards and hypocrisy.
#+end_quote

Incorrect on all counts: I explained the standard that Pascal failed and why I don't fall to it. You haven't pointed out my errors in reasoning. Pascal's arguments all related to religious beliefs, I did not go into his beliefs on other topics and try to use them to discredit his religious beliefs, as you did.

#+begin_quote
  This is what I mean about trusting your arguments. You're leaving things out.
#+end_quote

No, I made a very basic semantic error that should have been understandable within context by someone reading with even the slightest bit of benefit of the doubt. You decided to take that semantic error, interpret it as a blatant lie or foundational error, and then use it as a bludgeon to disregard the rest of my arguments. You're not doing yourself any favors here.

#+begin_quote
  I have no real idea about the breadth of your research because you're not mentioning any actual names bar Aboriginals or much about in what depth you went into beyond some subsects. That's fine, that's normal in conversations, but it's rather useless to me on actual 'How valid are these arguments' just as Pascal's arguments were rather useless to you. Pascal revealed next to nothing about why he dismissed other religions, you revealed next to nothing, revealing nothing is not evidence of hypocrisy and double standards.
#+end_quote

I explained exactly what the double standard in Pascal was and how his argument was invalid, and you are using in response the lack of detail in a specific thing I said as equivalent. I'll leave it to any audience we may have to decide, but again, to me this false equivocation is not doing your argument any favors.

#+begin_quote
  Prejudice and racism are both words with a lot of confusing different definitions and meanings which vary from person to person. Having it as an entire debate as to how they're connected with the word astrology without actually defining either of them is about as useless as having a debate about whether a tree makes a sound when it falls and no one is there to hear it without defining sound or hearing. It's a pointless point.
#+end_quote

Except I did define it, in fact I defined both very clearly. The post is there for all to see and read for themselves. That you missed this is more evidence that you're not here to actually have an honest debate, but simply skimmed some things you thought would make me look bad and are bringing them up in an attempt to put me on the defensive and discredit my perspective without addressing my arguments.

#+begin_quote
  Predictably, when you have a trolly title your points don't come across well and your goals and standards are not met. Better to lead with the standards and the meanings, not to antagonize whatever group. Mudslinging tends to lead to mudslinging.
#+end_quote

My title was not "Trolly," it was an honest reflection of the belief I wanted people to change. I led with the standards and the meaning in the post itself. Your ability to recognize mudslinging is heavily in question if you fail to see this.

#+begin_quote
  I read the post but I wasn't actually sure what your point was much, it was rather long and bounced around from point to point and I evidently missed your argument. 13 paragraphs in before it got to stating the point. Ok, that's a fair argument, although rather confusing to find. One of the benefits of having a tldr is that people can find what your argument was. I assumed it was something else.
#+end_quote

Apology accepted, perhaps it was confusing as written: I wrote it over a year ago and barely remembered it. I don't put TLDRs in a CMV post because then people just skip to that and argue it without going over the extensive evidence I presented and needed refuting.

#+begin_quote
  You stated your position was superior to Pascal's because you'd done more research, that you didn't have his hypocrisy and double standards, hence to agree with you I'd have to trust your research.
#+end_quote

No, I stated that Pascal's perspective on one religion being evidently more true to the person who tries to believe it has very obvious double standards in his approach to religious superiority that my perspective on a specific religion as /not/ clearly truer than any others does not have.

#+begin_quote
  On the combativeness- if you want I feel no real need to challenge you on hypocrisy and double standards, just, you said to do so. You challenging me to prove your beliefs have two negative characteristics is inevitably going to lead to issues and I am not sure why you did it if you didn't want this sort of thing.
#+end_quote

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt here and assume you really think this was an appropriate response to what I said, as it might have been unclear:

I asked you to feel free to point out double standards or hypocrisy in my religious beliefs, or rather lack of them, as we were specifically talking about religion. I thought this was obvious in the context of the discussion.

If you extend that to mean "find any hypocritical or double standard belief I have anywhere," then that's basically the textbook definition of ad hominem, because you are then using my potential wrongness in one area to extend to my wrongness in another. All of which is besides the fact that you didn't actually find any hypocrisy or double standard: just posts that you characterized as "pointless semantics" or "wordplay."

Sorry if I wasn't clear or gave any offense.
