  If Pascal had done extensive research on every religion and that was why it was obvious most of them were false that would be an actual sign of his quality of knowledge, same with you.
#+end_quote

In a world where he did that research or a world where he didn't, the final results are irrelevant because he still asserted demonstrably untrue things that he apparently took as truth, such as that people who accept the logic of his wager but can't force themselves to believe should just study and immerse themselves in Christianity, or even any religion, and its truth will reveal itself to them. If he was simply ignorant then he was ignorant, and if he was not then this was evidence of a clear bias and irrationality in him.

Which is fine. No one's perfect. He made a mistake. I'm not sure if you just hate Dawkins so much that you decided to plant your flag on Pascal and defend it to the bitter end, but even if you genuinely admire and agree with the man on many things, as he was fairly brilliant in many ways, it's okay to admit that he made mistakes, even if they're not the same mistakes Dawkins charged him with.

  I'm not really sure what you were saying back then anymore or why Pascal was supposedly hypocritical or had double standards this is getting rather pointless
#+end_quote

For the seventh time at least, he was hypocritical because he dismissed other religions who could say the same of theirs, and had a double standard because he made the assertion that one could immerse themselves in Christianity and its truth would be revealed. This is /only/ excusable by someone who styles themself an intellectual or rationalist if the person saying it is /fundamentally ignorant/ of other religions or the views of other religious believers. People who say it in today's age are no less hypocritical or ignorant, and Pascal shares their burden. To speak with such supposed authority on theology and rational skepticism, and yet hold forth such conclusions, is the mark of a seriously biased or fundamentally ignorant mind.

The former of which is potentially understandable if you want to go into issues of his near brush with death, "religious vision," and subsequent conversion. But those things do not make his words less wrong or his wager less flawed.

  You're also seeming rather rude at my lack of knowledge of whatever criteria you're using for searching which likewise makes me not care.
#+end_quote

Please don't try and play the victim now, we were doing so well. Above us are posts of you being far ruder than my pointing out the simple fact of your ignorance, especially when I did so in response to you expressing bafflement of what could possibly constitute popular religions, which you should have made some effort to check before you nitpicked my wording and held it forth as a "paucity of information." You said something earlier about taking the "least charitable" interpretation of Pascal, and you're not doing a particularly good job of leading by example if you draw the smallest possible box in the sand every time you're given new information.

  On prejudice- both feminists and men's rights activists are similar in that avada kedavra from a powerful wizard with killing intent kills them. That doesn't make that a useful definition in distinguishing them. Likewise, noting what criteria make two traits indistinguishable in your mind doesn't actually make a definition, it just excludes all the differences which would prove you wrong and is a rather poor start for a semantics debate and not very good for research.
#+end_quote

I didn't note what makes the two traits indistinguishable, I described the bedrock that links both, and in fact mentioned the distinguishing variable.

You can argue this issue on your own if you want, I won't indulge you in whatever point you think you're proving by dredging up a post from almost a year ago and criticizing it for not meeting your standards for debate or research. Here, another concession for you: you're absolutely right. It was a poorly worded post. Mea culpa.

Now what? You declare victory and sweep the board clean? I'm afraid not. You're so far afield in this criticism that I honestly don't know what you think you're accomplishing: I don't care in the least what you think of my "research skills" or ability to semantically define arguments. If you can't counter my arguments, you can talk till you're blue in the face about how poorly I worded my definition of prejudice in a tongue in cheek post 8 months ago, and my arguments about Pascal will still stand, and yours will still fail. Give it up.

Or don't and tilt at windmills on your own. I'll be ignoring this point if it's brought up again.

  People get annoyed when you have a statement that makes a vague hateful comment towards a group they're a member of. It's a prejudice, a prejudgement about a group, where you're judging an entire group by the actions of the few you know about. It is a predictable end result that doing this to a major group will result in bad debates. You can make some justification but the predictable end result is flame wars and bad debates. If you cared about other's feelings and wanted to change your irrationally rude feelings you'd probably do so in a polite non in your face manner like "CMV, I have irrationally rude feelings about MRA." People should be polite to others and avoid antagonizing them for minimal reason.
#+end_quote

I agree with this completely and will henceforth attempt to be more polite in expressing my potentially irrational but likely offensive beliefs. Thank you for helping me see this point.

#+begin_quote
  If you mention a particular criteria of the group that you disagree on that lessens it. People are happy to prove a statement like "Palestinians are terrorists" wrong. You can't prove an emotion wrong.
#+end_quote

You kind of can, assuming there's criterion for it. That's why it's a fine line, really: "CMV: Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they support terrorists," is more useful than "CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state," but asking someone to admit "CMV: I have potentially irrational views on Palestinians deserving their own state" presupposes that they have reason to believe it's irrational. Emotions are not always irrational, even if the beliefs they're based on are incorrect.
