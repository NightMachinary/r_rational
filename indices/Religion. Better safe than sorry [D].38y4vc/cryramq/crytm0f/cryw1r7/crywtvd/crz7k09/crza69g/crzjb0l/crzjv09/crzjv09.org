  Then please revisit my post and read more carefully, because that's not at all what I said: I very specifically criticized his beliefs with the phrase "I don't base my dismissal of religions I disagree with on standards that my own beliefs can't meet, as Pascal does."
#+end_quote

I'm not really sure what his standards were. From the short phrase they could have been something silly like whichever religion has the stronger culture which would probably only apply to Christianity. Still, I don't know your beliefs or what standards you hold, so it's rather useless as a comparison for a debate.

  I've met quite a few of them, and they all engaged in the same double standards and special pleading Pascal does. They're not unique in that, the Jews I grew up with did it too. Religious indoctrination is a powerful thing, and intelligence is not as important in ridding yourself of as disposition that's discontent with easy answers and constantly searching for other perspectives.
#+end_quote

You seem to be taking this very personally, which is rather useless for me since I don't live inside your mind. Whatever random experiences you've had don't really mean much for people who have no idea what they are.

  He made a very clear prediction: "Study this religion, be part of its culture, and go to Church, and the truth of it will reveal itself to you." He was wrong. Demonstrably, obviously, blatantly wrong. I don't know the man's personal life, but if he would hold such a prediction despite the many people who do not believe in his religion after doing those things, he was either being intellectually dishonest, or as I said, very isolated, or more distressingly, just bigoted toward non-Christians.
#+end_quote

Very personally, since he didn't say that. He said that, once you've convinced yourself rationally you can learn to believe by talking to people and such "But at least learn your inability to believe, since reason brings you to this, and yet you cannot believe." So how to deal once you rationally know Christianity is true but still don't believe. With other religions he didn't actually assume any conclusion. He just said " But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail."

He likely assumed that the result would be that people would come to believe but he didn't predict it.

This isn't really convincing me of your rationality in choosing religion, especially since you're making up a quote for Pascal. You're not distinguishing between reality and things you just made up seconds ago.

#+begin_quote
  Once you've spent enough time learning about Christianity and arguing against apologetics, for religion in general as well, you'll start to pick up the thread of their arguments and predict what they'll be.
#+end_quote

It does read like you're doing that, you're not actually reading what people say, you're using some sort of prediction matrix in your mind to predict their views.

Someone in the past who was religious seemed to think x and said y to me therefore pascal who is religious must believe x and y.

#+begin_quote
  While it's technically possible that in all the years I've spent being religious, studying religions, and arguing with the religious that Pascal has some silver standard that invalidates other religins while upholding Christianity's truth, I find it very, very, very, very unlikely that I would not have encountered it by now, whether by other religious apologetics or by fellow non-believers.
#+end_quote

I was never really arguing for the truthfulness of pascal, more for the falseness of Dawkins and people not reading arguments. I'm interested in old literature and in various arguments.

And there are no sides, Pascal being right or wrong about something isn't actually evidence that he's right about something else.
