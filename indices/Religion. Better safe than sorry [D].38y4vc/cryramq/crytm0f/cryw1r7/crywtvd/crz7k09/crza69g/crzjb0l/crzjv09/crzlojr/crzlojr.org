  I'm not really sure what his standards were.
#+end_quote

The very thing you quoted and emphasized elsewhere showed it: that the study of the religion and immersion in it would make the truth of it reveal itself. This is something that every religion believes about itself.

#+begin_quote
  You seem to be taking this very personally, which is rather useless for me since I don't live inside your mind. Whatever random experiences you've had don't really mean much for people who have no idea what they are.
#+end_quote

I'm not actually taking this personally at all, and making the statement that I am is a rather underhanded form of ad hominem. Your other post which I just responded to did that enough please, let's keep this one straightforward: if you don't know what I mean and describe them as "random experiences," please ask me to elaborate and I will happily do so: I thought it was obvious within the context of the conversation, but was clearly mistaken, for which I apologize.

#+begin_quote
  Very personally, since he didn't say that. He said that, once you've convinced yourself rationally you can learn to believe by talking to people and such "But at least learn your inability to believe, since reason brings you to this, and yet you cannot believe." So how to deal once you rationally know Christianity is true but still don't believe.
#+end_quote

No, I'm sorry, you are literally ignoring the exact lines that contradict you that you yourself quoted: "Rather, in the passage following the establishment of the wager, Pascal addresses a hypothetical person who has already weighed the *rationality of believing in God through the wager* and is convinced by it, but *remains unable to sincerely believe.*"

That is not dealing with rationally knowing Christianity is true but don't believe, at all. It is dealing with rationally knowing the *wager* is the *safe bet,* but being unable to believe. Those are two very, very different things.

#+begin_quote
  With other religions he didn't actually assume any conclusion. He just said " But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail."
#+end_quote

The context of this was very specifically referring to the difference between Christianity and other religions, as you yourself quoted, again:

#+begin_quote
  "Do we not see," say they, "that the brutes live and die like men, and Turks like Christians? They have their ceremonies, their prophets, their doctors, their saints, their monks, like us," etc. If you care but little to know the truth, that is enough to leave you in repose. But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail. That would be sufficient for a question in philosophy; but not here, where everything is at stake. And yet, after a superficial reflection of this kind, we go to amuse ourselves, etc. Let us inquire of this same religion whether it does not give a reason for this obscurity; perhaps it will teach it to us."
#+end_quote

This is a very clear remonstration against the idea of judging Christianity as like other religions because of superficial similarities, and is calling it a mistake, and asking people to dig deeper. Which is commendable, but still reflection of an obvious bias, and assumes that anyone who has done such deeper reading wouldn't still disagree with his assessment.

#+begin_quote
  He likely assumed that the result would be that people would come to believe but he didn't predict it.
#+end_quote

Please do not accuse me of playing semantic wordgames when you throw yourself into it so enthusiastically.

#+begin_quote
  This isn't really convincing me of your rationality in choosing religion, especially since you're making up a quote for Pascal. You're not distinguishing between reality and things you just made up seconds ago.
#+end_quote

Says the person who literally misunderstood or ignored parts of their own quote? You've become wholly insulting and combative in this post, and I've tried very hard not to take it personally, as you say, but telling me I'm "not distinguishing between reality and things you made up seconds ago" is incredibly inflammatory and not worthy of a CMV mod.

#+begin_quote
  It does read like you're doing that, you're not actually reading what people say, you're using some sort of prediction matrix in your mind to predict their views.
#+end_quote

A prediction matrix based on previous data from what other religious apologetic have said and the responses.

#+begin_quote
  Someone in the past who was religious seemed to think x and said y to me therefore pascal who is religious must believe x and y.
#+end_quote

Incorrect; "Millions of people have put their minds toward arguing their religious beliefs, and the arguments have been distilled and debated over the generations until the best and most intractable have emerged, therefor Pascal probably uses arguments I've heard before in other forms despite not knowing that he specifically might have said or agreed with."

#+begin_quote
  I was never really arguing for the truthfulness of pascal, more for the falseness of Dawkins and people not reading arguments. I'm interested in old literature and in various arguments.

  And there are no sides, Pascal being right or wrong about something isn't actually evidence that he's right about something else.
#+end_quote

Great, I agree 100%. But since that has absolutely nothing to do with what I said or the general trend of the discussion, I'm not sure what it has to do with anything.
