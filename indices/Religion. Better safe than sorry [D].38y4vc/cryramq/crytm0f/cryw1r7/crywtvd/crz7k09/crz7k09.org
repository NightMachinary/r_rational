  Pascal's wager doesn't presuppose the non existence of other gods, it says that an in depth analysis would show them false, which is fairly normal for arguments, they say that if you look at the matter closely then you'll see they're right and have other writings on the matter.

It's fairly normal for arguments, and it's hypocritical from someone whose own beliefs do not fit the standard he has set others to. Unless you are asserting that Pascal literally never met a non-Christian who he considered intelligent enough to have reasons for their disbelief? I suppose he might not have been intellectually dishonest, just very isolated or bigoted.

  Here, you do the sort of thing Pascal does. You presuppose you're right based on other writings. This is a normal thing in arguments. You have to take a really uncharitable interpretation to see it as unusual. Almost everyone does it. "I know I'm right, do some more reading."

No, this is false equivocation of the worst sort. I don't take for granted that I'm right in the same way that he does: he used what amount to literal double standards and hypocrisy to assert his own religion's truth and dismiss others'. That is intellectual dishonesty and bias that is very transparent to those who recognize it and have lived that particular double-think.

I used to be religious. I studied every religion when I started doubting mine. I don't base my dismissal of religions I disagree with on standards that my own beliefs can't meet, as Pascal does. If you can point to some hypocrisy or double standard my beliefs have, by all means attempt to do so, but the idea that Pascal's blatant bias for what he took for granted as true should be excused among rational people is ridiculous.
