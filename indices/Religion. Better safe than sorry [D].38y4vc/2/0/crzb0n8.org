I'd like to counter that with my religion, Dualcosuperchristianity! According to my religion, anyone who says the words "I believe in Superchristianity" will be duplicated and will go to Superhell twice. Also, if you don't say those words, you will spend your next life as a completely satisfied duck.

Obviously, it's better to be a Dualcosuperchristian than a Superchristian, and by transitivity, than anything else. I look forward to never seeing you again!
