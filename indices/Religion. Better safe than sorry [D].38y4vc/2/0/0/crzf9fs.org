Actually Superchristianity seems superior to me. Superheaven seems preferable to being a completely satisfied duck (mostly because the former is more vague and I thus can assign my own values to it easier. Being duplicated and sent to Superhell twice in turn is no worse than Superhell as two identical beings will have the identical eternal experience, only one of which is me at any given time.
