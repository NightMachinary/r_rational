From the wikipedia article on pascal's wager.

#+begin_quote
  However, as noted above, nowhere in the establishment of the wager does Pascal appeal to feigned belief; God, being omniscient, would not succumb to such trickery and unwittingly reward the disingenuous. Rather, in the passage following the establishment of the wager, Pascal addresses a hypothetical person who has already weighed the rationality of believing in God through the wager and is convinced by it, but remains unable to sincerely believe. Again, as noted above, Pascal offers this person a way to escape the irrational sentiment that compels him to withhold belief in God after the validity of the wager has been rationally conceded. This way consists of applying oneself to spiritual discipline, study, and community.

If you rationally believe that god doesn't exist then you have minimal reason for accepting the wager, and Pascal would agree with that. Pascal first sought to disprove other religions and prove his own religion. This argument was just the final capping stone to his ideas.
