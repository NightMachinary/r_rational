It's more like, "How large an ontological commitment is necessitated by this claim?" So "follow a specific moral code", provided the moral code makes sense, is actually somewhat simpler, since it means you're /just/ positing a humanlike superbeing, whereas "paint a glyph on your left knee" means you're positing an /autistic/ superbeing.
