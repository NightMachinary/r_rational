Honestly? Not really. Degrees of wrongness only apply when there's a reality to match it to. We have no idea, no idea whatsoever, whether the human sacrifice guys were right all along. We have no idea what might motivate hypothetical gods. So while there may be degrees of wrongness, there's no indication of which axis that wrongness is measured on.
