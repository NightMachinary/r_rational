I'm afraid that according to Metasuperchristianity (which I /am/ the prophet of) all interpretations of Superchristianity are metaphors for the Jesyspan Superchristianity interpretation. Now of course, you are free to not be a Metasuperchristianity follower, but such people are doomed to being an eternally unsatisfied platypus burning in a thousand Superhells. I advise, therefore, that you follow Metasuperchristinity, which then proves that Dualcosuperchristianity is superior to any interpretation of Superchristianity.
