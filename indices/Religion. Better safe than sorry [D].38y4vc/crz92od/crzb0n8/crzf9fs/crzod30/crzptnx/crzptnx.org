  Both are you at all times and you are both at all times. The duality is complete and cocomplete.

So essentially I'm still just one person but with double the surface area available for eternal Superhell torture? I must admit that that sounds worse.

  Superheaven isn't vague at all, it's just the state of being an imperfectly satisfied goose.

Here I have to object. Nowhere in the extensive holy scripture of Superchristianity (all 76 words of it) is there any mention of imperfectly satisfied goose. You can describe your own religion's dogma in comparison to other religions but you can't just nilly willy add to the texts of other religions in question without creating your own denomination. Your explanation for what Superheaven is is just one interpretation of many. Only the rightful authorities can do that. In this case the Superchristian Superprophet [[/u/topiary_quail]].

All I know now is that Orthodox Dualcosuperchristianity is better than Jesyspan Superchristianity. If I happen to value perfect satisfaction more than the superiority of being a goose that is.
