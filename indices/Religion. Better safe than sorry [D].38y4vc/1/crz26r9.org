The answer to your question is mu.

The argument you are referencing supposes a great deal many things for which there is no evidence, or even contradictory evidence. To single this idea out in conceptspace is privileging the hypothesis on an absurd level. One must discount an outcome by its probability, and by any reasonable standard, the probabilities in question are so small as to not warrant consideration. The only reason this idea has been thought, and why it is consuming your attention rather than some other harmful meme, is due to the particular defects of the system which generates the idea.

Even if that were not so, one must realise the sheer magnitude of competing, mutually exclusive possibilities (and I am reluctant to use the word "possibilities" here, as it presupposes these sorts of ideas are coherent). For every benevolent god who would grant you eternal bliss conditional your belief, there is a malevolent god -- identical in all respects, but who would reverse the outcomes; belief gets you eternal damnation, whereas disbelief gets you admittence to heaven. Even presupposing the possibility of existence for such beings and the validity of such scenarios, there is no optimal criteria for decision.

Do not worry overmuch; modern reductionism has done all the work for us. You can be about as certain in the falsity of supernatural claims as it is possible to be.

(Personal note: I am committing to not respond to any comments. Discussion on these topics is immensely counterproductive.)
