I'm discussing a separate litany, the litany of pascal.

#+begin_quote
  Litany of Tarski. It changes every time you use it. On this occasion it runs like so: If Pascal's wager is a good wager, I want to believe in it's quality. If Pascal's wager is a bad idea I don't want to believe in it's quality. Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.

  If we're living in a world where Pascal wager is good, that's what we have to believe, we have to know what's coming, so we can choose what book to read next, or in the very worst case, choose what audiobook to listen to. Not believing it won't stop it from happening. So the only question we have to ask is whether Pascal's wager is good, and if that's the world we live in then that's what we want to believe.

  Litany of Gendlin: What's true is already so, owning up to it doesn't make it worse.

I'm not actually discussing the existence or non existence of god, a long and tiring process, I'm discussing the value or lack of value of Pascal's wager.

Also, Pascal suggested that you study a matter in more depth to find out about other religions and their validity, he didn't ignore that issue.
