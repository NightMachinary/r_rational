[[/u/Nepene]], I respect your position in taking all evidence into account before arriving at an appropriate decision.

Here's two phrases you may adopt to help us think similarly in this matter. (keep in mind that I'm simply doing a word replacement from HPMOR.)

  Litany of Tarski. It changes every time you use it. On this occasion it runs like so: If Pascal's version of God exists, I want to believe in God. If Pascal's version of God does not exist, I want not to believe in this God. Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.

  If we're living in a world where God exists, that's what we have to believe, we have to know what's coming, so we can go to Heaven, or in the very worst case, be prepared to do what we can in the time we have left. Not believing it won't stop it from happening. So the only question we have to ask is whether God exists, and if that's the world we live in then that's what we want to believe.

  Litany of Gendlin: What's true is already so, owning up to it doesn't make it worse.

Okay. Now, change the Litany of Tarski to Yahweh. Okay. Now change the Litany of Tarski to Buddha. Okay. Now change the Litany of Tarki to Zeus/Jupiter and the (Greek/Roman) pantheon.

After doing this for all religions, you will be on the first step toward critiquing them based on their merits and relinquishing the beliefs you have that do not fit your version of reality (using an Interpretivist Paradigm.)

Now, regarding Pascal's wager: if I died and met The maker/creator/ruler/recorder/judge/etc. of What is True, it would feel like the scene of "the Mummy" if I approached this being with a lot of religious symbols around my neck, showing it each one until I found the one that 'worked' to prevent my damnation. Keep in mind, in this scene, the character shows Imhotep the Star of David and he is mistaken for a member of the servile slave race (the Jews) and is stopped on completely different principles rather than the intent of brandishing a holy symbol of faith with enough religious zeal,that it turns the undead.

Similarly, my personal feelings on the merit of an argument of something like Pascal's wager is that, if the Litany of Tarski v1.0 were True, it doesn't necessarily mean that my faith is required to fulfill the requirements of entrance into heaven and/or exemption from hell.

Perhaps my personal quest of seeking virtue as an ethical member of society and decreasing the morbidity and mortality of our community will be the mark that is needed to be deemed deserving.
