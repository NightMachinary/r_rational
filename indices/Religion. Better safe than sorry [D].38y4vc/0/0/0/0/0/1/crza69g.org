There may be some vast difference to you between saying something is wrong because it's based on "demonstrably faulty reasoning" and someone saying that it's wrong because whoever lacks intellect but reasoning means, among other things, " a. The capacity for logical, rational, and analytic thought; intelligence:"

So to me your argument reads like 'Pascal's argument is wrong because he lacks intelligence' and his like 'Unbelievers would agree with me if they had intelligence.'

Both of you have actual arguments for and against your positions, and that's what I'd use to evaluate your truthfulness, not a turn of phrase. You've probably met Christians with the capacity for reason or intelligence who disagreed with you likewise.

  I don't take for granted that I'm right in the same way that he does:

I'm sure you believe your intellectual arguments are right, as did he. If I wanted to agree or disagree with such arguments I'd have to read them, although it certainly read to me like you taking it for granted- you didn't feel any need to explain why his arguments were demonstrably false.

  he used what amount to literal double standards and hypocrisy to assert his own religion's truth and dismiss others'
#+end_quote

He didn't really explain why he dismissed other religions there, you'd probably have to read other works by him to find out, just as you didn't really explain your arguments in much depth and just took them as given. He probably explained why he asserted his own religion's truth somewhere in there.
