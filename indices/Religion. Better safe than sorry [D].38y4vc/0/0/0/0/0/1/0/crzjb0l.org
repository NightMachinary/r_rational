  So to me your argument reads like 'Pascal's argument is wrong because he lacks intelligence' and his like 'Unbelievers would agree with me if they had intelligence.'
#+end_quote

Then please revisit my post and read more carefully, because that's not at all what I said: I very specifically criticized his beliefs with the phrase "I don't base my dismissal of religions I disagree with on standards that my own beliefs can't meet, as Pascal does."

#+begin_quote
  You've probably met Christians with the capacity for reason or intelligence who disagreed with you likewise.
#+end_quote

I've met quite a few of them, and they all engaged in the same double standards and special pleading Pascal does. They're not unique in that, the Jews I grew up with did it too. Religious indoctrination is a powerful thing, and intelligence is not as important in ridding yourself of as disposition that's discontent with easy answers and constantly searching for other perspectives.

  I'm sure you believe your intellectual arguments are right, as did he. If I wanted to agree or disagree with such arguments I'd have to read them, although it certainly read to me like you taking it for granted- you didn't feel any need to explain why his arguments were demonstrably false.
#+end_quote

Except I did, again, by pointing out the obvious privileging he holds for his beliefs despite the existence of people who have studied his religion and remain unconvinced.

He made a very clear prediction: "Study this religion, be part of its culture, and go to Church, and the truth of it will reveal itself to you." *He was wrong.* Demonstrably, obviously, blatantly wrong. I don't know the man's personal life, but if he would hold such a prediction despite the many people who do not believe in his religion after doing those things, he was either being intellectually dishonest, or as I said, very isolated, or more distressingly, just bigoted toward non-Christians.

#+begin_quote
  He didn't really explain why he dismissed other religions there, you'd probably have to read other works by him to find out, just as you didn't really explain your arguments in much depth and just took them as given. He probably explained why he asserted his own religion's truth somewhere in there.

Once you've spent enough time learning about Christianity and arguing against apologetics, for religion in general as well, you'll start to pick up the thread of their arguments and predict what they'll be. While it's technically possible that in all the years I've spent being religious, studying religions, and arguing with the religious that Pascal has some silver standard that invalidates other religins while upholding Christianity's truth, I find it very, very, very, very unlikely that I would not have encountered it by now, whether by other religious apologetics or by fellow non-believers.

So yes, it's technically possible that by reading every word the man wrote I might find such an argument, but my priors make it about as unlikely as there existing another continent on the planet earth that I've just never heard of or heard anyone else speak about.
