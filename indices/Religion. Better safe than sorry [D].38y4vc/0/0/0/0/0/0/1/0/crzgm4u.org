My point was that Pascal didn't believe better safe than sorry in the way OP noted, he believed in various arguments of reason and evidence that eliminate other options first. In particular.

"What say [the unbelievers] then? "Do we not see," say they, "that the brutes live and die like men, and Turks like Christians? They have their ceremonies, their prophets, their doctors, their saints, their monks, like us," etc. If you care but little to know the truth, that is enough to leave you in repose. *But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail.* That would be sufficient for a question in philosophy; but not here, where everything is at stake. And yet, after a superficial reflection of this kind, we go to amuse ourselves, etc. Let us inquire of this same religion whether it does not give a reason for this obscurity; perhaps it will teach it to us."

You may well draw a different conclusion from Pascal if you examine the options due to different reasoning and evidence, but he did advise those who truly cared about the issue to study it further.

I think the father of this argument arguing that you should study the issue more lends some weight to it being a foolhardy decision to believe in whatever just because of the bet. The learned philosopher didn't, why should you?

Edit. Also, his argument was something like "If through whatever methods you've reduced the existence or non existence of the Christian god to a coin flip chance, go with whichever one makes you happier." I can see some flaws in that sort of reasoning- it's probably not going to be a coin flip, if you throw your weight behind one option you'll be invested and therefore biased on other things, you should probably just instead have a probabilistic belief- but it's not a wholey bad reasoning of what to do. Most atheists aren't going to have coinflip probabilities in their beliefs so it won't apply to them, with lots of beliefs going with whatever makes you happier is fine. It's a belief I hold for shipping for example, shipping characters together.
