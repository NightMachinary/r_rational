The length of this is causing me to stop caring enough to respond.

My short responses.

- You made a claim about doing religious research that showed that your standards were better than whatever research Pascal did. CMV is a common research place, and how you go about it shows your general approach to learning things and changing your view on topics. Any double standards of Pascal or you depend on the skill of your research.

- What you left out was the actual names of the religions you studied or any hint of what you looked for. Some argument like "I have studied Christianity, catholicism, protestantism, islam, sunni and shiite, many varieties of hinduism, buddhism, aboriginal beliefs and all of them showed a lack of any convincing miracles" is the sort of actual research that would show some a clear definable standard. That was what was left out, some of the actual names or details of the argument.

- On definitions, we'll have to agree to disagree since I can't actually see you do any definitions of prejudice in the opening post, and your first post is arguing about the definition of prejudice.

- Saying a group of people are bad in some way is a common trolly action. Regardless of your intentions many trolls use that tactic because it predictably results in negative emotions. If you use that tactic you'll get the same result.
