  If you didn't intend those two sentences, about you reading from every religion and you not having hypocrisy about knowledge of every religion then your sentence construction is confusing to me.
#+end_quote

The standards of belief are completely independent from the research: I just mentioned the fact that I started religious and had researched other religions to say that it I'm not judging his double standard from the perspective of someone who never believed.

#+begin_quote
  I now know four religions you've studied. I don't know what you find obvious and populated. Christianity and Islam presumably at least, and probably Roman Catholics, plus Aboriginal religions. I still have little clue what you studied. With that paucity of information it's hard to make judgements.
#+end_quote

Then your ignorance is what needs correcting: google a list of the most populated religions and you'll get much more than just Christianity (including Catholicism) and Islam and Judaism. I also studied Hinduism (mostly Vaishnavism and Shaivism) and Buddhism (Zen, Theravada and Mahayana) as well as Zoroastrianism and Jainism and others.

But again, all of this is beside the point and ultimately doesn't matter: there is no tipping point where I can list enough religions I'm familiar with and you'd go "Oh, okay then, well you're definitely more knowledgeable about religion than Pascal was, so your criticism of him is fine." *Nor should you*, because it just *doesn't matter.* My criticism stands on its own whether it's made by me or anyone else. The only reason we're discussing this at all is that you made a false equivocation that forced me to bring up my own beliefs, and then presented a semantic error as me exaggerating my claims to undermine the arguments. The entire concept of one's level of religious research doesn't tie in any way to my criticism of Pascal's biased and hypocritical beliefs, unless the defense of him is literally that he simply was unaware of other religions in depth enough to be judged for his irrationality.

#+begin_quote
  That was more you noting the common elements of what I suspect was racism and astrology than you giving complete definitions. As you later noted, racism can also include negative comments about skin colour, not just personality. You didn't define prejudice.
#+end_quote

That defines it pretty well in my mind. I don't know why I'd need to specifically say "This is the definition for prejudice that I'm using" when I already noted what criterion it fulfills that makes it indistinguishable from other prejudices such as those based on skin color.

#+begin_quote
  CMV and any argument are bad places for changing your positive or negative feelings since they are based on lots of things like what you ate, how bright the sun is, whether you've got laid that day. They are emotions, you are free to feel what you want.
#+end_quote

Maybe your emotions and opinions on things are based solely on such arbitrary factors, but without speaking for others, I can and have had my opinions on things changed by argumentation before, and see no reason why CMV wouldn't be fit for that. Of course I'm free to feel what I want, I'm also free to think what I want, but I want what I think and what I feel to be as based on logic and evidence as possible, which is why I ask people who disagree with me to explain why.

#+begin_quote
  You could easily have just said "CMV, MRAs have no major accomplishments or feats." which would have been factual and non emotional.
#+end_quote

You're right, I could have put it that way, and it probably would have gotten slightly less inundated with irate and toxic responses. Maybe one out of every ten posts that took it as a personal attack on their beliefs wouldn't have done so. But that wasn't the thing I wanted my mind changed on: I wanted my mind changed on the *potential unfairness of my negative judgement.* Just asking for the accomplishments excludes the possibility that other arguments I had not thought of or could not predict might surface that would change the root problem I was there to have solved.

Similarly, this:

#+begin_quote
  "CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they're annoying and I don't respect them." is a rather bad post that I would suspect was trolling.
#+end_quote

Very much sounds like trolling, yeah, because you've constructed a strawman. But "CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they support terrorism" is far less obvious whether it's a troll. It's inflammatory either way. And as for these two:

#+begin_quote
  "CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they have no legal right to it" is better, though deserve is a complex term whose meaning should be unpacked.

  "CMV, Israels shouldn't feel guilty about not giving Palestinians a state because Palestinians have no legal right to it" is even better.
#+end_quote

Now you've changed the entire belief that the person has completely in order to make it less offensive. But that doesn't change the fact that people have negative opinions of Palestinians for reasons other than these, and that those people can and should be able to bring such feelings up and ask for them to be changed if they recognize they might be unfair and genuinely want other perspectives.

You're pigeonholing everyone into either looking for factual arguments that they could essentially debate elsewhere, like AskHistorians, or being a troll who asks emotional questions that you seem to believe can't be handled by logical argument or intellectual discourse. I'm happy to say that such restrictions don't actually exist on the complexity of the mind.
