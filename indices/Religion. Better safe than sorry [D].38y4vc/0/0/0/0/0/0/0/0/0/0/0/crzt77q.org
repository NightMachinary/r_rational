  You made a claim about doing religious research that showed that your standards were better than whatever research Pascal did.
#+end_quote

That wasn't my point at all: you actually transplanted a response from one part of the conversation to a specific question about the difference in standards. Reread what I said.

#+begin_quote
  That was what was left out, some of the actual names or details of the argument.
#+end_quote

Granted, but under basic context of the conversation I thought it would be understood that "researched all the religions" would be taken as covering all the obvious and most populated ones. My mistake.

  On definitions, we'll have to agree to disagree since I can't actually see you do any definitions of prejudice in the opening post, and your first post is arguing about the definition of prejudice.

"...arbitrary categorizations for personality that utterly lack evidence or rationale... If anyone can offer an operational definition that distinguishes astrology from racism besides that one is based on someone's skin and the other on their birth-month, I'd be interested in hearing it..."

  Saying a group of people are bad in some way is a common trolly action. Regardless of your intentions many trolls use that tactic because it predictably results in negative emotions. If you use that tactic you'll get the same result.

The entire point of the subreddit is to have your view changed on something. There is no way to assert that you want a negative view of a group of people to be made positive without making it obvious that you don't have a positive view of them. To say this is a "trolly action" or it's a "tactic" is pretty disingenuous: it would classify everything from "I find the WBC to be evil, CMV" to "Palestinians don't deserve their own state, CMV" to be "troll tactics," even though they are simply stating their opinion in a forum for opinion changing. Actual, specific troll tactics and actions include, but are not limited to, ignoring opposing arguments to repeat their points, deliberately insulting personal attacks, and sweeping generalization that are not treated as negatives or asserted as absolute facts.
