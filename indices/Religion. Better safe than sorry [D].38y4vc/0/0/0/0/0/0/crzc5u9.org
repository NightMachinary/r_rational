To be more precise...

Your or his studying of religion, I don't actually know much about them. I don't actually know much about why you're atheistic or agnostic or whatever you are. You haven't really explained much. Likewise with Pascal, he doesn't talk much about it in that particular segment.

What you learnt from your research is what I'd use to evaluate any conclusions either of you drew. You both have turns of phrases indicating your correctness and not much substance.

I don't know the actual quality of your research. You didn't study every religion for a start, many of them are regional and you wouldn't be able to find much online. You studied some subsection of them, likely major ones that were popularly available. So I know you're exaggerating about your studying.

I don't know how good you are at researching. Did you actually read the religious texts of the varying religions? Did you consult scholars? Did you consult scholarly texts? Did you try to get a balanced perspective? Did you check archaeology to see how well their claims were substantiated?

I don't know how good your reasoning is. Do you adhere to [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/axn/6_tips_for_productive_arguments/]] basic argument etiquette? From what I remember of you from CMV you mostly don't.

Here where you seem to try and win a semantics debate on what a prejudice is.

Here where you try to convince people that a group is annoying and that you don't respect them with wordplay.

Here where you try to convince people that we should transplant an inflammatory phrase to another unrelated situation, another wordplay heavy argument.

I'm not really convinced from what little I know that your reason and evidence is so strong I should trust you just based off your word. You seem to focus more off trapping someone in some wordplay argument than focusing on the facts and the evidence. So your statement that whatever research you did was better than Pascal's doesn't feel convincing to me, as you haven't proven you have done any good research or given me evidence of such.

Good evidence and facts are what matters, and as is normal for a casual conversation neither you nor Pascal drew that many in.
