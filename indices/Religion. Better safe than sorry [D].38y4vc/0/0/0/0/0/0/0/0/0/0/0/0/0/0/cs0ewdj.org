If Pascal had done extensive research on every religion and that was why it was obvious most of them were false that would be an actual sign of his quality of knowledge, same with you. Anyway, since I still don't really know what you researched much, beyond a few names, and I'm not really sure what you were saying back then anymore or why Pascal was supposedly hypocritical or had double standards this is getting rather pointless. You're also seeming rather rude at my lack of knowledge of whatever criteria you're using for searching which likewise makes me not care.

On prejudice- both feminists and men's rights activists are similar in that avada kedavra from a powerful wizard with killing intent kills them. That doesn't make that a useful definition in distinguishing them. Likewise, noting what criteria make two traits indistinguishable in your mind doesn't actually make a definition, it just excludes all the differences which would prove you wrong and is a rather poor start for a semantics debate and not very good for research.

Just as I am sure the many posters who post "CMV: Black people are stupid" want their mind changed on the potential unfairness of their negative judgement.

People get annoyed when you have a statement that makes a vague hateful comment towards a group they're a member of. It's a prejudice, a prejudgement about a group, where you're judging an entire group by the actions of the few you know about. It is a predictable end result that doing this to a major group will result in bad debates. You can make some justification but the predictable end result is flame wars and bad debates. If you cared about other's feelings and wanted to change your irrationally rude feelings you'd probably do so in a polite non in your face manner like "CMV, I have irrationally rude feelings about MRA." People should be polite to others and avoid antagonizing them for minimal reason.

If you mention a particular criteria of the group that you disagree on that lessens it. People are happy to prove a statement like "Palestinians are terrorists" wrong. You can't prove an emotion wrong.
