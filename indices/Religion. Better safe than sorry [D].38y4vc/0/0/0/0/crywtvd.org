I'm not really enamoured with a person who challenges the weakest possible argument of those who are ignorant and know very little. Dawkins addressing hypothetical stupid people who follow the wager is rather weak.

  In other words, the fact that Pascal thought he his wager was correct because Christianity was correct, or that he considered the criticism itself "weak" because he believed anyone who studies it would be convinced by it, both established on demonstrably faulty reasoning, does not negate the criticism that the wager presupposes the nonexistence of other Gods.

You take the most flattering possible interpretation of Dawkin's arguments while taking the least flattering interpretation of Pascal's.

Pascal's wager doesn't presuppose the non existence of other gods, it says that an in depth analysis would show them false, which is fairly normal for arguments, they say that if you look at the matter closely then you'll see they're right and have other writings on the matter. Dawkins certainly could have riffed off this point, perhaps with something like 'He looks at all those religions and sees falsehood and deception. I agree with that. I just add one more religion to my list.' Or something like that. But he didn't make any effort to do that as he didn't actually know what Pascal said. He targeted a weakness that the argument didn't actually have.

Here, you do the sort of thing Pascal does. You presuppose you're right based on other writings. This is a normal thing in arguments. You have to take a really uncharitable interpretation to see it as unusual. Almost everyone does it. "I know I'm right, do some more reading."
