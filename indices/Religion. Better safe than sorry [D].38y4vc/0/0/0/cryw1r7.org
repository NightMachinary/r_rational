Overall Pascal did not actually address those things. His brisk and routine dismissal of, say, other religions and concepts of God as "obviously false" shows the exact weakness in his wager that Dawkins is referring to.

In other words, the fact that Pascal thought he his wager was correct because Christianity was correct, or that he considered the criticism itself "weak" because he believed anyone who studies it would be convinced by it, both established on demonstrably faulty reasoning, does not negate the criticism that the wager presupposes the nonexistence of other Gods. If anything it confirms it as an obviously flawed bit of apologetics from an obviously biased man.
