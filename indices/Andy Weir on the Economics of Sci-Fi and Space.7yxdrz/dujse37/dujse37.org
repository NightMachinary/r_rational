I recommend listening to this interview in audio form if you have the time (put it on your phone and listen during a commute), but the transcript is contained in the link for those who prefer using their eyeballs.

The first chunk of the interview is especially recommended to those who have yet to read Weir's latest novel, Artemis, as it explores the economics of what might make a moon settlement profitable, and how the economy of a private moon base might be sustained. The later portion of the interview also delves into a number of topics related to science fiction. Some highlights:

On teleportation:

  WEIR: That would have massive, tumultuous effects because there would no longer be any such thing as borders or territory. Like, if people can teleport, then how . . . Let's say you've got a country. How do you defend that when your enemies can just teleport into the middle? Ultimately, you would end up, very quickly, with a global government.

On Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics:

#+begin_quote
  COWEN: Now, Isaac Asimov, as you know, he came up with his Three Laws of Robotics. No harm, obey, self-preservation, in a strictly hierarchical order. Those date from the 1940s. That's now a long time ago. We've seen a lot more from technology, and, in fact, in robotics. Do you think that you, Andy Weir, today in 2017, could improve on Asimov's Three Laws?

  WEIR: I've got to say yes. Because I was a computer programmer for 25 years, so I'm actually pretty good at that stuff.

  One thing that those three laws hid, and it's OK because science fiction is science fiction, but it requires the robot to make moral and ethical decisions. What constitutes allowing a human to come to harm? And a lot of Asimov's stories explore that. But in order for a robot to have those ethical dilemmas and considerations, there's a lot of programing that has to be done under the hood. [...] You would need a very, very detailed description of what constitutes harming a human. What constitutes allowing a human to come to harm. What constitutes obeying a human, and what constitutes self-preservation.
