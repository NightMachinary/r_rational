  You know, you've got a rebellion, so “yeah, we'll throw off the yoke,” and it has historical parallels and it's all awesome like that. But I don't necessarily think that's going to be the case. Partially because as long as we keep following the rules of the Outer Space Treaty, which I believe we will, there's no such thing as sovereign territory outside of Earth. So Artemis is, functionally speaking, an offshore platform.
