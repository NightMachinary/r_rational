I was talking about regular people, not condemed prisoners or enemy combatants. Your example was a entire bus full of people. I understand a bodyguard priortizing his clients life over a couple people but an entire bus full of people..... that's a lot.

You can't take an absolutist position and say you always have to do your duty to your job, i guess the same way I shouldn't say you should always save the most lives possible.
