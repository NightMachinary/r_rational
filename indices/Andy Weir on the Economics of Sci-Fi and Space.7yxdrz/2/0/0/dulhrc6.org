The interesting thing about Asimov's three laws is that he often explores their consequences and caveats in his stories. (Ad the above quote also points out). I sometimes read people critiqueing Asimov's three laws with arguments that Asimov himself already explores in his stories. Those people have kind of missed the point.

There's a story where two robots end up defining themselves as human. There's stories about robots with different sets of laws, or with conflicts between the the laws. One very important story has a robot derive a 0th law (do not harm humanity or allow humanity to come to harm) as a consequence of the first, allowing him to harm humans in limited way as long as it helps humanity.

Of course what Asimov doesn't explore are the details of how to program such laws. Thats the hard part.
