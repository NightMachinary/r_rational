I mean, it's already pretty clear that Zorian's psychic powers are bloodline related. There's basically no other reason Daimen would be a psychic too, even if he IS a weaker one. But that doesn't make him the chosen one; LOTS of families have bloodline magic going on, including many minor characters. If anything, that's a little LESS unique and chosen-one-y than Zorian's natural psychic abilities being something unique to him entirely.
