I think that if it does happen, his grandmother won't be part of it.

Instead, his dreams (seas of glowing suns connected by threads, volcanoes, etc) will turn out to be vaguely prophetic. Maybe that he was primed for some of his actions by the angels (who lied a little). Or, if she is part of it, that he has a second bloodline effect he is unaware of, involving the last two images of his dreams - the most recent chapters made it clear that the first part of his recurring dreams was of the 'great web' or his sigil network, and could be his psychic abilities or something else interfering.
