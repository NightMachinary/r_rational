There's stuff going on with Zorian's family. His witch grandmother seems surely to have more relevance to the plot than she's had so far. It seems a likely bet that the psychic bloodline that Zorian and Daimen share comes from her. I seem to recall some suspicious connections between his family and the weeping too, but I don't remember the exact nature of the connection. Some of this may never be relevant to the main plot though, just remaining a piece of the background mysteries. Against Silverlake, though, would be a good time for her to step in or become relevant.
