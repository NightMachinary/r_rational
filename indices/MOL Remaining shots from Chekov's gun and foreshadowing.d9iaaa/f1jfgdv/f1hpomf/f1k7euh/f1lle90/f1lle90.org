Real Chekhov gun in the MoL is Fortov. For some chapters I was even thinking that he is the RR(and then, when it came to simulacrums, I thought that RR could be one of those, I just couldn't find a sufficient explanation for the timeline. But man, sentient copies of yourself, knowing that they were created only to be spared - this is a Chekhov's time bomb.
