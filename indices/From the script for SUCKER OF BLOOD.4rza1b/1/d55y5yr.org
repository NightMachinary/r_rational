It's worth mentioning that in the real world there is also examples of mosquitoes engineered to be resistant to Malaria and the corresponding gene drive to spread the trait. There's still some dangers there, but I'm very much in the camp of this stuff needing to be used in the very near future. If I was in charge of one of those labs, I don't know that I could or would refrain from releasing them.

The best argument I can come up with against that type of unilateral action is that these kind of things exhibit exponentiation growth. I looked up the equation in an earlier comment which I'll link below, but basically the number of individuals with the trait you start with makes a huge difference to the amount of time it takes the trait to basically take over the population. My worry is if by only releasing a few individuals you exposed malaria to the trait, but gave it time to evolve some sort of counter before the protection had spread widely enough. It's similar to why we don't just give people a little bit of antibiotic.
