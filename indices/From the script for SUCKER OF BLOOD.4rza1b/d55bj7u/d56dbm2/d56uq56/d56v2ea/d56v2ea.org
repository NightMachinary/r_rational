I normally deal with things that one-shot humanity. DDT did not kill off humanity, and while that's true you can play the game multiple times and look at net winnings. /Not/ building a ton of nuclear plants was such an awful mistake as to overshadow a lot of things and give all caution a justifiably horrible reputation to this day, and a lot of earlier "risks" turned out very favorably. If something had gone wrong and caused two hundred million annual cases of malaria, it would have been literally the worst technological disaster in history. Something going wrong with mosquitos is incredibly unlikely to top it.
