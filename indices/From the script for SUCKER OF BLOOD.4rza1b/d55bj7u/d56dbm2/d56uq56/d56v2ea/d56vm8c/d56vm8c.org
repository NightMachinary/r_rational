  Not building a ton of nuclear plants was such an awful mistake as to overshadow a lot of things and give all caution a justifiably horrible reputation to this day

Oh come the fuck on. Not building a ton of nuclear plants /was not about caution/. It was about the public and the decision-making apparatus being terminally misinformed and also bribed by existing energy interests, paid not to understand the relevant science.

  If something had gone wrong and caused two hundred million annual cases of malaria, it would have been literally the worst technological disaster in history. Something going wrong with mosquitos is incredibly unlikely to top it.

Luckily, we are running live experiments every day in what happens when you basically destroy Nature in large portion, for any reason or no reason. Currently, it's not going well, to the tune of trillions of dollars per year in actually-existing damage.

On the other hand, it's worth stating that my model here is what you wrote in the Facebook post: a /four-year delay/ in deploying interventions against malaria, during which we remain able to use /other existing interventions/ against malaria. Under those conditions, I side with caution and with not making /even more/ environmental scientists, ecologists, etc start a bout of alcoholism to cope with how fucked we all are because we disregarded the substrate of our daily lives. Under the condition you seem to now be implying, that "caution" means the well-tested, well-understood intervention against malaria /never gets deployed/ because people are too goddamn technophobic, I agree that some helpful terrorism would be helpful.

The question is the actual causal structure. I'm normally pretty much suffering radical uncertainty as to how many scientifically effective technologies or medical interventions have never been deployed because the cultural tide just said no, getting past obvious examples like nuclear energy. I can just about /plausibly imagine/ that we could have had fusion power and thorium-salt fission /if we'd actually fucking invested in them/.

"We could have destroyed malaria but the bioethics board was too cautious" is in conspiracy-theory territory for me: low prior and too noisy a likelihood to investigate.
