The problem there is that for most relevant definitions of "wipe out the planet", there are a whole lot of things that could wipe out the planet. In fact, at this point, you basically have to redefine downwards to "wipe out the planet worse than it's already being wiped-out right now".

Gene drives to eliminate a non-native species not tightly integrated into the food web that also gives human beings deadly parasites are an intervention that probably will be achieved. But the ethical-review process does actually take all that fucking time for a reason: DDT was once considered an /obvious/ intervention with /no possible downsides/, as has been, in certain communities, "build a superintelligent AI and ask it what to do".

In short, the supervillain isn't as much of an ironic hero as he thinks he is, but for your choice to use the "WHY DIDN'T YOU SCIENCE AT IT" trope instead of the "There are gates you do not open, there are seals you do not unseal" trope /which you normally use/.
