  However, the higher homing rates observed for CRISPRh at AGAP007280, combined with the milder fertility reduction observed in heterozygous females indicate that this construct could spread through a population, at least initially, and impose a reproductive load on the population as it does so, fulfilling one of the major requirements for a functional gene drive measure for vector control (Fig. 2f). To investigate the ability of the CRISPRh allele to spread at the AGAP007280 locus, caged populations were initiated with CRISPRh/+ and WT individuals at equal frequency and monitored over several generations. Consistent with the modeling predictions we observed a progressive increase in the frequency of individuals positive for the CRISPRh allele from 50% to 75.1% over four generations (Fig. 2g). Such a reproductive load will impose a strong selection pressure for resistant alleles, some of which will be generated by the gene drive system itself through NHEJ or MMEJ repair of endonuclease-induced chromosome breaks, as we previously showed molecularly (Supplementary Fig. 4). The longer term dynamics will depend on the efficiency of spreading on the one hand and the fitness cost of mutations arising at the cleavage site on the other hand.

Basically, the simulations say that it will spread (to a degree) and the actual caged study suggests it will spread (to a degree).
