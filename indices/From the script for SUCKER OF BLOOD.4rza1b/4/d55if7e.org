I noticed I'm sort of confused about whether the technique would work. Part of me is thinking that genes that each child has exactly one father and one mother, so if some gene tends to increase the proportion of one at the expense of the other and it becomes relatively common then the alleles that allow for daughters will have more reproductive success and the gene should reach equilibrium at a low incidence.

On the other hand in some species, such as humans, the gender of offspring is fundamentally controlled by the male's contribution so maybe we should only be analyzing the spread of this sort of sex fixing within the male population?

On the third hand, if this sort of disaster was possible I'd expect it to happen in nature and maybe I'd have heard about it?

But on the gripping hand the people who are proposing this probably know more about population genetics than I do and have run actual sims.
