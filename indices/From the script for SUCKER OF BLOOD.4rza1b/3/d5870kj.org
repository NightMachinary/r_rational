I dunno. The way the proposed gene drive for mosquito extinction works makes me very uncomfortable, on a technical level.

The problem is that the proposed approach behaves like a "endo-virus" with two ways of propagation: (1) Transmission along germ line. Simple, all kinds of virii do this. (2) Cross-chromosomal infection: One chromosome is infected (from the father), and then infects the other one. The proposed payload is basically "become male during embryogenesis", which will drive the target mosquito to extinction.

Why is this scary? Because we put in all the required mechanisms for infections to occur, minus a protein shell for the virus. Hence, "endo-virus". The cross-chromosomal infection is the "gene-drive" thing, and it is a pretty universal construction that can easily evolve to carry a different payload, or infect a different species. The different payload is just a copy-paste away, as well as the different target site for other species. The latter thing is the amazing property of CRISPR, as opposed to usual gene-binding proteins.

Now, no protein shell for the virus is built in, so in principle no other insect should become infected. But this appears to be a really flimsy wall against catastrophe: killing off some vital pollinator? More apocalyptic, but also more unlikely: The novel way of virus design beeing picked up by evolution.

To repeat: The proposed attack does NOT need extremely rare horizontal gene transfer to occur to infect a different species. Instead, it only needs the different species to take up genetic material floating around; the machinery for building this into the chromosome is shipped along the proposed attack.

How would a "safe" gene-drive (A) look like that does not release the innovation of CRISPR-based virii into the wild?

(1) A parent with one or two versions of (A) produces a toxin and a corresponding anti-toxin. (2) Gametes (unfertilized eggs or sperm) that carry (A) produce the anti-toxin and survive to be fertilized / fertilize. (3) Gametes without (A) do not produce the anti-toxin and get killed by the toxin produced by the parent.

Since the "bad" gametes get killed and recycled quickly, the fitness load is pretty limited.

This is entirely sufficient as a gene-drive, no scary novel Rube-Goldberg way of virus transmission needed.
