The Archmagi's summoning ritual didn't create information, it took all the written information within the summoning circle, burned it, and implanted the contents in Jake's head. It was effectively a reversed Scholar's Touch spell -- it let him memorize the written information very quickly.

Loki created a set of books containing things that he knew. He's a lesser God so his power is limited, but he's a very old and clever God, so he's had a long time to learn stuff.

Suze doesn't have the knowledge to start and is currently facing unknown unknowns -- she doesn't know what she should be asking. She's also been a little busy these past few days flexing her newly divine muscles to really sit down and think through the implications.

There's a little more to it, but I'll stop there.
