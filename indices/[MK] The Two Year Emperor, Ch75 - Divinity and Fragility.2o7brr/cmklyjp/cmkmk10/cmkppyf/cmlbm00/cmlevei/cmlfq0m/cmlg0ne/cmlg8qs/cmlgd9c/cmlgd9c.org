"If it was good, why would anyone want to undo it?"

Maybe not everyone likes "good"? :)

Do everybody want to undo it? In some cases that might be the other living people who resurrect the guy who might not even want that. At least in some versions of resurrection, the victim must be willing. Why is that clause I wonder? :) [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:True_Resurrection]]
