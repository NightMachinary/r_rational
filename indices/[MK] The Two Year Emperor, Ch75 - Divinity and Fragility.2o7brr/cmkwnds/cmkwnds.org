I'm surprised at how mundane Suze has been acting the past two days, and that Herr√∫n took all that time to just go talk to her about basic godhood rules. Given Loki can just generate the full library of all knowledge about the gods at will, and given the senior magicians of Flobovia were similarly capable of implanting rulebooks into Jake's head, should Suze even need someone to tell her explicitly?

I don't know how much I should expect of eaglejarl, so for now, I'll just stick to noticing I'm confused.
