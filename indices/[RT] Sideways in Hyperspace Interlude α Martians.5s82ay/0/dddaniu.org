Interesting take on Martian colonisation. I didn't feel like the scale of expansion was very realistic, though. The environmental hazards alone would make industry on Mars a much trickier prospect. Sure, it would expand, but being able to fight Earth within the first century? Being able to dedicate its economy to military production? It felt overly optimistic to me.

Also, I was a little surprised at the idea that anyone would expect profit from colonising Mars. I would expect it to be a huge money sink, without the possibility of much return for a very, very long time. The advantage of low wages can't easily offset the cost of interplanetary shipping.

But maybe all this is influenced by having read The Sands of Mars a bunch of years ago...

No doubt Mars giving Earth the finger was fun to write :D
