The main characters are all mad-scientist experiments made a few generations after Dr Frankenstein "cracked the code" so to speak, although Wildbow refers to this as the "Wollstonecraft Ratios of Life."

The team of children are gang pressed to do their evil Academy's bidding. Each Arc is a new mission that the Lambs are sent on, with anywhere from 0-9 months passing in the time jumps.

Without giving too much away, they all have very unique takes on rational thinking. The most recent interlude does a SPECTACULAR job revealing their internal thought processes, some of which are downright alien and others that are very Professor Quirrell and HPMOR.

I do think it has a slow start into the world and the characters, but the story has finally hit its stride by Arc 8.
