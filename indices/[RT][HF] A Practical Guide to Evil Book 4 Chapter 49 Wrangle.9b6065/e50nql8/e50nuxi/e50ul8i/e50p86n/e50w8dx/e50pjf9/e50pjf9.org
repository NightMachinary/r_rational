Malicia's and cat's end game are not compatible eachother.

Cat wants an independent callow free from procer and praes both.

Malicia needs callow beneath her because she needs callow's food to keep her country alive.

This both need to weaken the other for if they are both alive by the end of the crusade and zombie epidemy they can kill the other with impunity. But they can not weaken the other too much or allow herselves to be weakened or the dead king/crusade will kill them piecemeal.
