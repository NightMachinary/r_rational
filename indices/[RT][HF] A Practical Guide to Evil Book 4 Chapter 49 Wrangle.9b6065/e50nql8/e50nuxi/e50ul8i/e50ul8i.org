How long has Catherine been gone? Won't/haven't her subjects gotten a little bit antsy, waiting for their Queen in Black to return? I can't imagine not being present for current events would reflect kindly on her.

Also, I wonder what Warlock could /possibly/ need his son for, so badly? Have we heard anything about Thalassina up until this point? Could it have to do with the Witch of the Woods, perhaps? (I would imagine so - their fight was the most recent thing of import that happened to Warlock, so short of something out of left field, it would have to be about the Witch.)

Also, the next update is gonna be an Extra Chapter (or would that be the update on the 3rd?). I'd love to read about Ratface and co. getting offscreened, but EE has said that the second Cordelia interlude is to follow.
