I mean all of the Woe are fairly terrible people if you take a step back and look at them. We just get to see them making jokes amongst each other and justifying their actions. But none of them are people you'd really want to have near you.

Same with the Calamities - people like Black, for instance, because he's cool and funny and is putting himself against the world with nothing but his wit and his will. But he's still a guy who's butchered and oppressed many thousands of people. (Although people seem to like him and the rest of the Calamities less, naturally, the more he opposes Cat).

Really it's the same with most of the Evil side. I guess that's why they're evil?
