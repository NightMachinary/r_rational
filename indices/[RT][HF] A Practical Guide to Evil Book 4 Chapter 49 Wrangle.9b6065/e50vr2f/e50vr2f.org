  You need the entire kingdom's granaries reorganized, you need to get massive amounts of steel to arm all those soldiers the Hellhound is recruiting, you need someone to steady the treasury and rebuild the King's Council and -- Gods, do I need to go on?

So there's more confirmation of the massive issues Callow's facing. Sounds a bit grim, especially with the context around why those issues are so hard to solve (moreso than typical complex socio-economic problems, even). No trade, no allies, the destruction of the second largest city and the surrounding countryside. Riots and rebellions ready to go off at any moment. And those are just some of the /internal/ factors.

  There will be battles, Hakram, and there's only so many Callowans of fighting fit. Only so many we can afford to lose. We need someone to share the casualties with, or it won't matter that we have good farmland: there won't be enough people left to till it.

And population issues are also a concern. I figure there's also the issue that if they can't afford to /lose/ people, then /recruiting/ them is also a problem - whether they're dead or enlisted, there's one less person farming.

Maybe they can pull manpower from those refugees? Although I don't think Malicia would just lob them a softball like that. She's got too much experience with destabilising foreign powers to accidentally just up and give them a solution to their problems.

  Procer would be occupied with the Dead King for the foreseeable future, but there was no guarantee part of the crusader host would not try Callowan borders again if it saw weakness. The Dominion still had two armies on the field, and the League's intentions were opaque to me. My instinct had been that the Tyrant of Helike and his madman of a Hierarch would be taking a swing at the Principate, but that'd been while it was still the dominant force on the board. With Keter on the march, the League might be feeling adventurous enough to aim for other territories. And that was without even considering Malicia, who sure as Hells wouldn't let me bind the wounds of Callow in peace.

Yep, and everything outside of Callow is exploding. That doesn't strike me as good.

I've got to say, Thief and Hakram have their work cut out for them. Thief with outmanoeuvring Malica, who's maybe the best person at these shadow games on the continent and has decades of experience, and Hakram with everything else. Callow's been on the brink for a book or two now, and sooner or later I think something has to give.

Meanwhile, Cat and Archer are off to do diplomacy with the Drow, with the Diabolist as their foreign policy expert. That can only end well.

I figure things are going to get very interesting for Callow from here on out.
