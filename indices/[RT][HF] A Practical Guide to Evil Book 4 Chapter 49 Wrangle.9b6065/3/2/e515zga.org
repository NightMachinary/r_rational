I'm not sure about Malicia's inner thoughts, but I'm suspecting she'll be out of her depth by the end of this book, if she's not already. What we're seeing is merely the first steps in her plan (the ones guaranteed for success).

I think Malicia is, sort of, drunk on her victory over the Truebloods, her brilliant planning shattering the Praesi aristocracy that many Emperors/Empresses failed to take down. What she fails to recognize is the fact is that it took the 8 most powerful/skillful villains (9 if we count Scribe) and a good part of the best army in Calernia working together to clean up her loose ends. And she now commands /none/ of them.

She is somehow trying to replicate that same success against Procer, using Black, Dead King, and (I suspect, for north/south symmetry) the Tyrant. However, this is probably going to bite her, because Dead King, Tyrant, or Cat will be coming after her once they're done with Procer. And Malicia lacks the narrative weight or the raw power to deal with any of the three. She's been safe from her own schemes because Black has been clever, but Black will be outmatched by the Dead King or the Tyrant and is vulnerable in narrative to Cat (contingent on if, after all this, he still sides with Malicia/Malicia hasn't betrayed him).

And if the Heroes win? A Hanno who been tempered against the Dead King, Tyrant, Black Knight, and Cat is going to be extremely powerful and have terrifying narrative skill. Malicia /will/ lose.

If this "Warlock" that left a message for Masego is Assassin on Malicia's orders, setting a trap in cooperation with Tyrant (or even if Warlock is clean and Malicia is "just" setting a trap with Tyrant)... Malicia might have shot herself in the foot for when the Woe comes for revenge. With the Woe maturing, the Calamities (who aren't really fans of her in the first place) are either narratively vulnerable to their successors in a mentor-pupil story or will be utterly livid at Malicia (cough, Warlock, cough). It goes without saying that Tyrant /will/ betray her, and he just might be a better schemer than her.
