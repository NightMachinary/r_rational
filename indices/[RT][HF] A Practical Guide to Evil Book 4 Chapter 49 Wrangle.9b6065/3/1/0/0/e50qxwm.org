  "I don't think Cat prioritizes Callow being free. She wants it free of influences that will abuse her people, but Praes has shown they can avoid that for the most part."

That is exactly the thing that Cat cannot trust, the empress already was the final cause that liesse died (she enabled akua to succeed) and even if the calamities could be trusted not to fuck up callow they are the exception not the rule. They cannot die of old age, but someone will inevitably knife them and they will die. (Or so cat believes) the next emperor will most likely be a loonie, because most are, and because THAT guy is why Cat ultimately fights.

Is almost the same reason real absolute monarquies are out of vogue, the guy right now might be ok but the next guy might not.

And Cat fought with that concept in the previous books. She is always thinking of how to ensure that Callow will be ok after she and the calamities are out of the board.
