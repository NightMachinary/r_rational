But cat is a threat. She has confirmed that she needs malicia to die so her Liesse accords can happen (whatever those might be) and besides every power cat gets in callow is power she stole from malicia, even if cat didnt wanted to rebel, having a vassal state about as strong as you is asking for a rebelion in the worst possible moment.

Out of sheer self preservation malicia needs a weak callow and so long cat is there, callow is not weak.
