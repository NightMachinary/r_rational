I'm not really sure what Malicia's plan is here. I get that she wants to keep Cat on her back foot so she doesn't strike back, but I thought she was also trying to be “practical” and allow for a fruitful alliance eventually as well. Even though Cat no longer trusts her a bit, she would be content to leave the place alone if she could be assured Callow got a bit of breathing room, and she doesnt have the same limitations as the first prince there.

This pretty much assures that Cat will have to go for her throat eventually, and I don't think Praes has the same heroic protection against the “Bonfire” plan. If Cat decides to point it there, it will create a lot more mess than just working with her.
