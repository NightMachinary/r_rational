I have a vague feeling Masego might have to choose between saving Cat or saving his father and he ends up choosing Cat, if only because she doesn't keep him in a gilded cage and allowed him to truly *Witness* creation. I mean, he would have never become Hierophant if Cat hadn't met him.

EDIT: Masego making the choice is also the only way he'd grow as a character and also the only way for and Cat to remain friends. If she murders his father, that bridge is burned
