A lot of that character progression happened during the time skip. Masego let a lot of himself turn into Hierophant. Notably, only spending time with other people when Indrani literally smacked him until he stopped ignoring her. He had mild obsessions and fantasies with miracles when he was first introduced, and being constantly in contact with them really brought it out.
