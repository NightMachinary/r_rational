Sorry, I thought the Drow are also elves? It was just an assumption on my part. The point I was trying to make is that I don't think she should let Masego go alone.

As plans go, I am feeling like her best bet is still messing with the story via trying to make herself appear Good. The outsized reaction from the church appeared to me like it hit a nerve.

If she made another move like that towards Malicia, she might be able to play the heavens against the hells and ride the wave.
