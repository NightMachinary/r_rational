I kind of hope the drow negotiations don't last too long. I'm interested in seeing what drow society looks like in Calernia (D&D drow society is bullshit), but I don't really want Cat to have dedicated adventures there; she's been away from Callow for a while now, and that's where the interesting stuff happens.
