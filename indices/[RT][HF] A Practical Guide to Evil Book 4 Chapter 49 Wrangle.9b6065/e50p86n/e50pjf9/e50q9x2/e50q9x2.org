I don't think Cat prioritizes Callow being free. She wants it free of influences that will abuse her people, but Praes has shown they can avoid that for the most part.

A large part of why Cat pursues the highest powers was because of abusive nobles- Malicia has culled them. If she could convince Cat that long term, Callow will be well treated I think Cat would agree. Cat's biggest issue before would be worrying about Callow after her death, but as a fae immortal she could safeguard it both during and possibly after Malicia's reign (and ready to swoop in if evil starts getting stupid with her country)

On the other end, prior to the end of book 3 Malicia seemed ok with the idea of a free Callow that gave favorable trading with Praes. This is not as optimal, but so long as Callow has an evil ruler Malicia doesn't have to worry as much about all the food going to the other countries that refuse to deal with evil.

I'm honestly kind of annoyed with this direction of the story; since it seems counter to many of the earlier principles. I would expect them to not trust each other one bit but be open to these mutually beneficial relationships.

My suspicion (especially given the recent quote) is this is that heroic redemption story in affect forcing the idiot ball on them- that's the only in universe logic I can think of justifying this, in which case I hope for a reversal soon
