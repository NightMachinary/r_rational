The Accords are meaningless if Praes doesn't sign. They're called the Liesse Accords because they are likely meant to prevent the kind of escalation that happened there. Peace cannot be had on Calernia so long as there is an empire willing and able to build magical superweapons; you can't trust the country with nukes unless you have them yourself. Therefore, Cat needs Praes humbled and weak, its nobility scattered, and the Tower reduced to rubble. Nothing less will bring the Good nations to the table.
