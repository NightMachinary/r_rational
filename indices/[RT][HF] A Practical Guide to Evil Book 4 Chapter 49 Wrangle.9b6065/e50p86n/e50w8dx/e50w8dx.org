Bonfire was a plan to draw the Crusade's conscripted forces away from the border by applying political pressure. It works because of internal faultlines in the command structure - split loyalties among the leaders who would want to pull their forces back to defend their personal turf.

The Legions of Terror, on the other hand, don't answer to the cities. Its leaders won't much care about civilian deaths behind the lines. Hells, Malicia would likely be happy to see some of her rivals put to the sword without having to lift a finger. Add to that the fact that Praesi cities are forces unto themselves, with their own private army defending much more massive fortifications. And if you break through them, they loose chained horrors. There are no quick, clean sieges letting Cat fade away to the next target.

Bonfire is a strategy for a specific foe, and doesn't work as well applied to the Wasteland.
