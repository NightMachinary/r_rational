Maybe but there's clear shoring up Cat can be doing at home that has much clearer benefits (kicking out Klaus, stabilizing the cities/bureaucracy, rooting out spies, monitoring what Black is doing etc). Going into an unknown players land, with unknown benefits and unknown motives, and a very real chance of getting killed, seems really desperate, and it seems to me like she should no longer be that desperate. It's not like we've been given any reason to suppose the drow would be predisposed to help her, there's no obvious alignment of incentives. Cat has what to bargain with? and even if she did have something substantial , what would the drow want?
