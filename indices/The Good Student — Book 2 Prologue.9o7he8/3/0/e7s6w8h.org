The main character studies a lot, absorbs information and uses it to answer questions and solve problems.

In most stories I read I get a little impatient and want to skip ahead. Either because I'm tired of the details or because I just want to know what's going to happen with the main plot. I rarely had that desire with this story. I enjoyed reading it but did not want to skip ahead. The main character's perspective and thoughts were the interesting part.
