The main character is very, very book smart. He knows how to study, and he knows how to view facts from a bunch of different perspectives to come up with exactly the right answer for his audience. However, he's also really, really, incredibly bad at understanding other people and ascribing human motivations to what they do. Almost comically so, but not in a way that is played out for humor. After reading the first book, I'm still not sure whether this was done on purpose for really subtle humor or if it he is just a shallow character. Usually that's an easy distinction to make, so I'm assuming it is done on purpose until more is written.
