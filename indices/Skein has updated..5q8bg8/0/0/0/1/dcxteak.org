So far its pretty slow with mostly just Taylor and Lisa gradually trying to feel each other out, and Taylor manipulating people's associations.

Their powers interactions lead to very different sorts of mental "fight" scenes where Taylor tries to rearrange Lisa's associations, while Lisa keeps making new associations fast enough to figure out what is going on.

I'd say its pushing that sort of psychological soft-power angle more than a rational angle, but the story is fairly new, so its hard to judge.
