I don't understand. I know that the flashback with Ehud took place in Marad's hometown. Where did I contradict that?

Edit: Oh I see, you're saying that Rome's attitude towards homosexual relationships is different than Marad's hometown. But Marad is a slave and therefore has much lower social status than Aurelius who is a priest of Somnus, right? Wouldn't Rome still frown on their relationship because of that?
