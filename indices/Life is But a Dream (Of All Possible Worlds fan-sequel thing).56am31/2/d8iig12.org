OMG, I am absolutely floored, I've never had someone produce a fanfic of something I've written! I'm smiling like crazy right now. Thank you! :D

As a historical note - the Romans wouldn't really care about Marad/Aurelius at this point in their history. The flashback with Ehud took place in Marad's hometown, rather than Rome. I tried to imply that in the text, but I was over wordcount and it wasn't as clear as it could have been. Sorry! But again, ty! And you know, it's your fanfic, you can change the world however you like to serve the story better! :)
