Hi Xamuel! Unfortunately, not for free. The publisher has full rights over the story for 12 months, I was only able to make an audio version because they approved it for promotional purposes. If you're willing to buy a full anthology, it is Swords v Cthulhu, available at Amazon and other retailers.
