  "That is the only reason I'm talking to you. I know the Brand and I know what it means. Most have forgotten it, dormant as it has been in the *past few Cycles*, but I am older than the mountains and rivers, and I remember. I remember the crimes they did -- the way they made me fall..." "They were regular like the progression between night and day," Ghost Serpent replied. "Every four hundred years, whenever the planets aligned.

It's notable that based on the Ghost Serpent's words, the Ikosian Emperor might very well have been the last person to use the Gate. You could even argue that there's a chance that QI was the Emperor. But if had ever used the Gate himself he would probably figure out Zach and Zorian with much greater ease. I think he only has the crown because he's aware of its history, not its function.
