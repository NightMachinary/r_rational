Hmm, could it be that there is another, higher-level meta-simulation containing Sovereign Gate simulation as subsimulation, which started with Silence of Gods? First-order simulation is unable simulate Gods but able simulate spiritual planes, second-order simulation already unable simulate spiritual planes. Bu this logic there could be third-order simulation inside Sovereign Gates which will be unable to simulate magic at all. From the other side there could be zero-order simulation, simulating Gods, and zero-order simulation could be far future of our timeline...
