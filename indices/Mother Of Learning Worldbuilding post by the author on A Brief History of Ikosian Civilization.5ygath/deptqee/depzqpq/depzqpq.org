The Ghost Serpent said that this was a regular occurrence, every 400 years (until it was interrupted, only to start this time round). If so, Shutur-Tarana came into power 1500 BC so that wouldn't tie well with it. And the gods fell silent a 100 years before the Cataclysm, so it'd be off again.

Of course, we do have precedent that the time loop can run before it's time, but it'll have less power (Ch 54/55 when the Guardian tells ZZ that it started a month ahead of regular schedule)
