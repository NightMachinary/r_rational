Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

We know that the the gate was used around 1500 BC, and that planar alignments happen every 400 years. Thus, the gate could have been used at 1100 BC, 700 BC, 300 BC, and then 100 years after the Cataclysm.

Thus, the gods fell silent right between two gate openings.

*Edit:* The [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2017/03/09/a-brief-history-of-ikosian-civilization/#comment-313][author says that it's 500 years post-Cataclysm]]. The Ghost Serpent says that the gate has dormant for the last few cycles, thus it wasn't used in 300 BC or 100 AC, at least.

Not that it makes difference in regard to your point; I just put those things together and thought it was interesting.
