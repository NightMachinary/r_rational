Reading this I was fairly certain Shutur-Tarana was the first looper. Though I'd forgotten the passage, the story itself more or less confirms it.

From chapter 33:

  "Sovereign Gate?" asked Zorian.

  "Never heard of that story?" Alanic asked. Zorian shook his head in negative. "Well, do you at least know who Shutur-Tarana Ihilkush was?"

  "How could I not?" Zorian scowled. "My history teacher made us all memorize the first three chapters of 'The 13 Cities of Salaw' by heart. That would be the last king of Ikos, yes? The man who conquered all of the city states around the Umani-Re river and created the Ikosian Empire. What does he have to do with anything?"

  "The Sovereign Gate is an artifact supposedly dating back from his time," Alanic said. "Like many great rulers, Shutur-Tarana has a great many fanciful stories and grandiose claims associated with him, and this particular one claims he either made or found a doorway into another world. Having found he did not age at all while on the other side, he spent '11 lifetimes' there, learning their secrets and honing his skills. Eventually, he grew homesick and decided to go back home. Once he was back in his own world, however, he found the doors forever barred to him. He stored the Sovereign Gate in his royal vault, there to wait for a worthy successor who would repeat his feat and usher the empire in a new age with the wisdom gained from the other side. Or, well, resurrect it... since it is thoroughly dead at this point."

I suspect Zuwa might have been attempting to use it to prevent the Cataclysm, but it failed (or succeeded, but the subject killed them all after going mad in the loop and escaping).

*EDIT:* It occurs to me that if the latter occurred (the person in the loop became evil during their experience) it could potentially be Quatach-Ichl, although I don't know if the timeline matches up and I think he'd be better informed about Zach/Zorian if he had been in their situation himself.
