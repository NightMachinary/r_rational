Strange Loop was written because Hofstadter thought that one of the core messages of GEB had been lost on the average reader. He decided to be more direct.

Strange Loop is half as long, has linear structure, doesn't play around as much, has much less math, and is written to persuade the reader of a single idea (that consciousness arises from self-referential patterns in the brain) rather than playfully weaving a tapestry of interrelated ideas and defying categorization like GEB.
