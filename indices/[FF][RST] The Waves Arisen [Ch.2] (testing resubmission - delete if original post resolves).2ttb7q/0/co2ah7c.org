I have a few comments. The bit with the TV isn't so much mood whiplash as it is mood severe-spinal-damage. Even without the ending that portion is pretty jarring. I'm not sure if that section is primarily there to be funny or to let us know that this is a post-apocalyptic future, but either way it should probably be shortened.

If it's mostly just there for the setting, you could maybe take out the parts with the chanting and the translation of the symbols and let us figure things out from the description and story behind it.

If it's primarily there for comedic purposes, then cutting down on the explanation should help, since that kind of joke becomes less funny the more it drags on.

I'd go with the first suggestion, since having a joke section right there is, as I said, pretty jarring.

Otherwise this seems good so far and I really want to see where this is going.
