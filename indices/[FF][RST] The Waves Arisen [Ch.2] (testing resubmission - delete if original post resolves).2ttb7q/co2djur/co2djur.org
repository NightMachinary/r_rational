I know that the word "terebijon" is a crude (possibly Japanese) mispronunciation of "television", but what is the word "panasoniku" supposed to be?

This is a really intriguing chapter and I'm coming up with a crazy number of theories such as ninja-blood is automatic nanotechnology, the Bijuu are semi-intelligent nuclear weapons, chakra is simply near-100% efficient energy conversion, the Elemental Nations are either the result of millennia of geological forces reshaping the world or humanity had control over tectonic forces, and a few more similar ideas.
