Game theory as magic is pretty accurate - Collapsed civilization background, so what we are seeing here is surviving bits of lore, but not the underlying mathematics or actual understanding that spawned said lore.

This is also the kind of place I would expect to have cam/pulley bows.. and no ability whatsoever to deviate from the exact specs they copy endlessly because the math they use is beyond them.

That is likely to be a pervasive problem - Naruto-verse has absolutely toxic information handling practices. It's like the place has had the exact opposite of an enlightenment, wherein everyone started to conceal information and lie about everything. Note that even his very "helpful" teacher blatantly misleads him here, about the magnitude of his reserves.

On the other hand, this version of naruto did just have pointed out to his face that the shadow-clone technique is for spying, not combat. It'd be quite interesting if he actually uses it for that.
