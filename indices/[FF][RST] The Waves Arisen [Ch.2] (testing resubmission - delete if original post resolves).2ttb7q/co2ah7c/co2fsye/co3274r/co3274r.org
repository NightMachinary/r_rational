As a third opinion the TV bit is right on the line of making me drop the story. Just way too 4th wall and off tone.

Otherwise enjoying the story way more than I expected I would, I don't generally like Naruto being 180'd so hard.

I'm also unsure about the Hyuuga just revealing the inner workings of their clan in Naruto's presence, both with their "worship" and with their clan politics. Very out of character unless this AU has totally changed them.
