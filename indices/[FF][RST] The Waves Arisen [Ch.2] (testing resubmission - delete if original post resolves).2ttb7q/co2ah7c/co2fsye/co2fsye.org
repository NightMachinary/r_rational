I'm not sure if the author is reading this, but if s/he is and wants a second opinion, then I didn't find the panasonic TV thing comedic or out of place at all.

Having the story set in a presumably post apocalyptic world that at one point possibly had advanced nano/bio technology is one of the few ways I can think of to believably explain chakra and hand signs. Even other good Naruto fics like Time Braid didn't really go into as much detail as I would like about how Chakra works.
