I like the story so far. The auther came uo with several good reasons why canon turned out the way it did. Although I am a bit annoyed that Sakura was replaced with Hinata. She had a lot of great potential for character growth and its annoying to see her sidelined. The story did mention the concept of "ninja blood" so maybe in this universe civilians can't become ninjas or lack charkra networks or something.

I also hope that chakra doesn't become some sort of advanced tech nanites nonsense or something.

Overall it's a promising story, can't wait for more.
