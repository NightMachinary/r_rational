A great start. Nice to see a rationalist (and it's clearly intended to be rationalist, not just rational) version of Naruto. I'm glad you gave us Hinata instead of Sakura; she's a more interesting character with actually believable lines for growth. The only way for Sakura to grow as a character is to completely change, since she is mostly one-dimensional, but Hinata is nicely fleshed out with real story hooks.

Speaking of which, you went with the demoted-from-heir thing right up front, huh? Not the Caged Bird yet, although I could easily see a plot arc later where they go to put it on her and she has to escape with Naruto's help...or perhaps he'll use game theory to convince hem not to.

Speaking of game theory, that part of the discussion with the Hokage didn't fit very well. The words "game theory" got used in a way where "magic" would have made more sense, and then they didn't go anywhere...you had the discussion of "clans are better off individually", but it wasn't tied back to specific GT practices the way I would have expected a teacher to do.

As to teachers, it was great seeing "the Professor" actually do some teaching. I don't think I've seen that in any other FFN anywhere; nice job. The thing that needed to be taught (the hand seals) also made a lot of sense -- if the other villagers don't know that Naruto is the jinchuuriki, his teachers wouldn't have known to give him the filter seals. Why did you have it be the Henge that he had trouble with, instead of the Bunshin (regular clone) technique? In canon that was the explanation -- he couldn't do a regular Bunshin because his power was too high and his control too low, but he could do the Kage Bunshin (shadow clone) because it required lots of chakra just to get it off the ground.

More on teaching: at the assignment ceremony, Naruto thinks about how it's illegal to teach jounin level techniques, although it's ok to know them. A few paragraphs later, Naruto offers to teach Sasuke the shadow clone. What happened there?

Final thought: the television bit was a nice device to show us that this is a fallen world scenario, but it didn't fit well into the narrative. Why were the Hyuuga worshipping at the altar of TV just at the moment that Naruto walked in? It seemed a stretch. The idea that the world is our own and the implication that it's based on physics seems to play poorly with people who create mass and energy on a daily basis just by literally twiddling their fingers.

Again, this is a great start and I'll be eagerly looking for more.
