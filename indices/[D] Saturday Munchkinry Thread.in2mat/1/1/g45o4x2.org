Can you take on illnesses that cancel each other out?

Like if someone's body temperature has dropped too low, and another someone's body temperature has gone too high: could you transfer both to you at the same time and so cancel them out?

Or hypotension and hypertension?

Or malnutrition and obesity?

There are plenty of other medical issues that should be able to cancel each other out, since human bodies have a tendency to suffer from having too much or too little of everything. Go around finding and matching cases that cancel each other out, and you will be able to keep helping people without causing harm to yourself.

Just need to be careful that no one ever discovers the true extent of your ability, otherwise you will likely be kidnapped and forced to de-age the powerful old people until you die from old age.
