personally, most efficient use, from emotional and happiness perspective would be to sacrifice yourself to extend the health and life of your children, by taking their injuries and health problems onto you until the day you die.

Assuming you have kids in your late 20s, and live until your late 60s (taking other people disease on you would shorten your lifespan considerably), you would die leaving kids that are in their 40s but look like extremely healthy 20-somethings.

And since these kids (I assume 2) would never have any health problems in their childhood, they would grow to be absolute peak physical and mental specimens their genetics allow.
