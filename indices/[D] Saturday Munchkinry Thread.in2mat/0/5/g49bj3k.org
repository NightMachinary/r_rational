The maximum speed of a Minecraft flying machine is [[https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/redstone-discussion-and/2199884-speeds-of-various-flying-machines][3.33m/s]]. Geosynchronous orbit is 35786km up, so you can fly there in 124 days. You'll want to use geosynchronous because you can't generate much lateral speed to enter other orbits, and because orbiting anywhere else is probably going to interact horribly with minecraft physics (which I assume are Earth-referential). It'd be faster to convince a space program to give you a lift, or to switch to a conventional-physics propulsion system once you're in space and back when you near your destination, if you can manage one of those.

Long periods in space aren't really that big of a deal because of your absurd inventory capacity. You're going to be safe from radiation, micrometeors, and air leaks because the one of the easiest materials for you to build a hull out of is a meter thick chunk of solid rock. It might be tricky to find a source of air that stacks, but you can afford to just build a large enough farm to get oxygen from plants.

Once you have a space station, set up a cobble generator and start expanding it. Maybe invite some scientists to use it for actual science.

A minecraft explosion can only destroy blocks in a 16x16 area centered on the explosion, so only 8 out. So make a 10-block thick crash pad where the asteroid is expected to collide with your space station (btw, guess where you're putting your space station). Hopefully colliding with minecraft blocks means the asteroid has to follow minecraft rules. Otherwise you're going to want to hit the asteroid off-center to deflect it, but you'll need an awful lot of rock to do that, and it depends on how fast the asteroid is moving.
