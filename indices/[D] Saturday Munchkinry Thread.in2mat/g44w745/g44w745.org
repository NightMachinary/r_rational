Fortnite powers: You can break down wood, brick/stone and metal structures with a pickax impossibly fast, even the toughest structure take a dozen well placed strikes at absolute most. As you break them, you can store the raw materials in a pocket dimension accessible to you, around 3 tons of each type (wood, brick, metal). You can build sections of structures out of the materials in your pocket dimension, around several hundred pounds per sections, and you can place sections as fast as you can think, so long as at least part of each structure section is within arms reach. Sections take several sections to assemble from the materials in you pocket dimension.

Edit: To make the power a bit more Fortnite: as the sections are built of materials, the material are arranged and fused together in a way optimal for yours purposes whether that be structural strength, blocking bullets, or easy reprocessing/demolition. Also, the center of mass and balance of the structure is redistributed in impossible ways for the purposes of optimally supporting the structure. You can drop materials from your pocket dimension at will.
