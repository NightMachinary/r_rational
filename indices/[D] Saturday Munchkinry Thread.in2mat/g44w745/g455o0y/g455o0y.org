But do you have the power to utterly ignore structural integrity like in Fortnite? As in, building massively tall towers that absolutely should fall over in real life but don't in Fortnite?

If so, it's time to build a space elevator! (Or well, a space ramp, since elevators aren't a thing in Fortnite.)

Edit: Did some googling, turns out working elevators can be built in Fortnite!

If not, then your abilities are almost entirely for combat (as in, for collapsing structures on your enemies), since your structurally questionable buildings are too unsafe to use compared to regular buildings. Especially since you are completely unable to use one of the best building construction materials ever: concrete.

You also can't even work as a human wrecking ball, since people expect the raw materials back, but they are now stuck in your pocket dimension unless you use them to build yet another structure that would need to be wrecked anyway. (Though if the destination for the raw materials is quite far away, you may help save on transportation costs. But not by much since you can only carry 9 tons.)
