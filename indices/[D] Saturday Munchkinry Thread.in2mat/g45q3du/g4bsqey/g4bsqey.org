you would be still vulnerable to "offer you cannot refuse" solutions to your wishes. Example:

- A wish for immortality might be powered by the souls of your children and grand children. You begrudingly accept, because it is still better than death in your view, but you suffer the emotional consequences

- reversely, you wish for your loved ones to have a very good and long life, but your life force is given to them and you drop dead. In your dying moments, you would consider it a good deal, but still, you ded.
