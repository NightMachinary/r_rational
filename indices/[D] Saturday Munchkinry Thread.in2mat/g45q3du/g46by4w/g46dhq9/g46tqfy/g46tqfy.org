I think that depends on how your utility function counts a wish. Either it doesn't count it at all, so a wish that provides net additional utility equivalent to the opposite of a dust mote in the eye but also removes a wish is valid (in which case the genie can't /on net/ harm you, but can at least waste your wishes), or it counts as its expected value, which could be so massive than nothing would be worth it.

There's also a lot of ambiguity around "utility function"; supposing that it is a real enough thing about your mind seems just plain wrong to me, and even then it is probably quite limited. Wishing to follow your CEV would be better, again if "my utility function" is sufficiently meaningful.
