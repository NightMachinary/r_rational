Aircraft flight testing. Normally it would involve painstaking and exhaustive modeling and simulation, then extensive ground-testing, then several years of cautious flight testing. Take the F-22 for example; companies began their designs around 1981, their design proposals were submitted in 1986, then the two remaining competitors spent 50 months gradually completing all of the ground testing in preparation for the maiden flight of the prototype models which occurred in 1990. Flight testing of the first production model began in 1997, and that took eight years before they were designated as having Initial Operational Capability, though it wasn't until 2007 that they were designated as being fully operational, and even then testing continued, with one F-22 test pilot dying in a crash in 2009. In all, it took 26 years to get from concept to finished product with no test pilots dying.

Instead of all that slow and cautious nonsense, you can just get in a prototype plane that was assembled yesterday and run dozens of tests with it per day to see how small tweaks improve or worsen performance in various high-risk aspects like carrier landing, aerial refueling, landing with a strong crosswind, etc. With you in the cockpit, designing and prototyping a new fighter, helicopter, or small private plane would likely take closer to 3-5 years instead of 2-3 decades. By yourself, you could save an aerospace company hundreds of billions of dollars.
