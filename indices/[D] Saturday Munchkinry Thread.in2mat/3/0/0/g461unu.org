My belief is that my "insane from information overload" self lacks capacity to make the wish, so the hypothetical layer would have to work in some way that's less incapacitating.

That said, I do think you're onto something in a more general sense. This wish does have potential vulnerabilities in the hypothetical layer. Is there a way that being provided that information could change me so much that I would still make the wish after receiving it, even if it results in something I would consider bad prior to actually making it?

Is there a way to close this loophole while still being on the lookout for subtle downsides that won't be apparent until later? Of the two, I'd consider the latter a more important threat, but ideally the guard wish would defend against both potential attacks.
