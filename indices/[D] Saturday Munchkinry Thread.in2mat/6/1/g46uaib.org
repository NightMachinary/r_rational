I mean, you could have a pretty lucrative career as a daredevil or extreme stunt person. You could literally walk off a terminal velocity fall without noticing the deceleration.

Best use I can think of is to freeze particles produced from a collision in a particle accelerator. I don't know enough of how all that works to know how fundamentally earth-shattering that would be, but I'd imagine getting to watch very short-lived particles degrade without moving would allow a lot more data, and more data about what turns into what and why.
