Still magic from WtC. You can apply counterforce in the reference frame of the earth to any object you can touch, including indirect touch. Counterforce goes up with skill level, but even college graduate equivalents can apply hundreds of pounds. Indirect touch is limited to tens of feet, but you can easily bring everyone in a vehicle to a standstill without them feeling any deceleration. You can also sense any changing object that you are able to still. You don't expend any resources to stop things.

The combat applications are obvious, you can just laugh off bullets, but I'm more interested in the non-combat uses, the ways it could replace some mundane thing in a way which can make you money.
