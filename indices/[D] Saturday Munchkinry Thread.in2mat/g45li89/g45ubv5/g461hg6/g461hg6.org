Good ideas. I would say you can take on a fever without taking whatever caused the body to respond with the fever, but you could only take binary things once. Like with not breaking an amputated arm, you can't give up your sight if you're blind. It would depend on the details of how the power worked, of course. Let's say you took on somebody's flu, moving all the viruses to your body. Well... You can still fit enough more viruses inside your body to take somebody else's flu as well... Although you'd have to consider that the number of viruses/bacteria inside you does affect the severity of the infection. In reality, doctors and nurses who catch diseases from patients often have more severe cases than random infectees, because they are around the infected person longer, so there is more time for the disease to spread, and they end up with a larger invasion force.
