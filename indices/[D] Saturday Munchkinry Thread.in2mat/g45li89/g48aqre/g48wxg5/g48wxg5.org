I suppose it would be reasonable to take on gender dysphoria and a non-straight sexual orientation. Not because the people are bad, of course, just because it's a thing about their brain that deviates from the norm in ways that are significantly detrimental to their chances of reproduction.

You could probably only take them on once each, though.
