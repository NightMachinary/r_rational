Also, depending on definitions of medical issue, "I don't have the anatomy/hormone balance/etc. that corresponds to my identity (or brain structure, depending on how hard you have to medicalize it)". If it's binary (i.e. "body does not fulfill gender properly" is a singular condition), that's not so great, but if you can stack it you could perhaps attain truly massive amounts of dysphoria before perhaps taking on some sort of clinical inability to experience gender (not to imply that being agender is a medical issue, but conceivably there could be some medical issue that makes one not care about gender). If it's more nuanced, e.g. "too much testosterone/testes/male-typical fat distribution for my gender" and "too much estrogen/ovaries/female-typical fat distribution for my gender", then it makes more sense that those could cancel out, and you could match binary trans people (or non-binary trans people with roughly opposite desires) and give them what they want.
