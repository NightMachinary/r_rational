How do we define "medical issue"? Does there need to be a good faith, widespread belief among qualified professionals about what constitutes an "issue"? Does it need to be recorded in a formal medical document, and if so, does that document need to be a good faith effort, or can it have a sticker on the front saying "Do not cite; for benefit of superpower only"? Could we declare deviation from some hypothetical norm an "issue"? If so, you could effectively benefit from all the best that humanity has to offer physiologically (or even psychologically, depending).
