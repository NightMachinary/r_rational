Make a player tnt cannon to get out of orbit, bring sheets of metal to build off of, aim for the asteroid and make another cannon, decelerate eventually with another cannon. When I get there, blow it up. Minecraft explosions either drop blocks as harmless items or destroy it entirely, so there's little risk of this making it worse.

The problem is inventory though, I can't bring enough TNT with me to blow up a 20k wide asteroid. But I could bring something else, like nukes, and maybe doing that way ahead of schedule would be fine? I did some quick math and I mining out the asteroid all by myself isn't feasible, assuming the asteroid is roughly spherical.

Actually, if I could make a regular nuke into a Minecraft nuke, nuking the asteroid directly would also work, and is a lot less involved.
