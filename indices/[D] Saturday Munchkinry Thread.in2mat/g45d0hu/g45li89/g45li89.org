You have the power to transfer medical issues from other people to yourself. No backsies, no offloading your issues on others. You can heal naturally if it's something you could normally heal from. So if you heal an athlete's broken arm they can compete immediately and you can go through the normal fun procedure of healing a broken arm. You can't take on injuries you can't get - if you have an amputated arm you can't then break the bones in that arm. You can de-age someone by aging yourself the same number of years. You can do partial transfers where that would make sense.

How do you squeeze the most out of this power? It can't be transferred, copied or studied to reveal the inner workings of the cosmos. You can prove you have it, but it's magic, and science cannae contain it.
