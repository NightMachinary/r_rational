You can instantly teleport from any chain store to another store in the same chain, as long as you aren't directly visible to anyone else in the store. You don't have to be fully hidden, you can do stuff like duck under a table with chairs, but you can't just stand in an aisle where no one else is. You can't use this power if you're carrying something you haven't paid for.

Assuming you want to keep this power hidden, how do you exploit it?
