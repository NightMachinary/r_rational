#+begin_quote
  "I wish that all wishes granted to me, including this one, will be fulfilled in such a way that if I knew all of the effects ahead of time, I would still make the wish"
#+end_quote

Evil Genie: Can't be done.

You: Why? Because you only fulfill wishes in malevolent ways?

Evil Genie: No. Even a perfectly benevolent genie cannot grant your wish. To know the effects of a wish is to know how it could be done better. Worded better. Changed for the better. Stated at a different time after different actions to maximize the benefits of the resulting butterfly effects. With only 3 wishes available, you would never settle for a sub-optimal wish when you know a different wish that is so obviously better. As a result, you would never ever make any wish that you knew the effects of ahead of time, regardless of how it is fulfilled.
