For a while now I've been fussing over a "guard wish" for genies and whatnot meant to protect from bad effects and horror stories of making a wish.

#+begin_quote
  "I wish that all wishes granted to me, including this one, will be fulfilled in such a way that if I knew all of the effects ahead of time, I would still make the wish"
#+end_quote

Am I missing any failure states that could give a hostile wishmaker an opportunity to harm me? Any improvements (perhaps a variant that constraints the wishmaker for all future wishes, regardless of whether they are made by me)? Alternative ways to guard?

As I see it, most "wish gone wrong" media exists to provoke a reaction of "ooo, bet they wish they hadn't make that wish". In some cases literally, like the conclusion of Monkey's Paw. More generally, there's a moment where the audience sees how the wish was twisted and realizes that it may not have been what they actually wanted, but it does fit the wording of the wish.

My guard here is meant to use that same reaction as a means of protection. If you knew that the bad thing was going to happen, you wouldn't have made the wish. In general, you wouldn't make the wish unless you knew that the results were a net positive. At worst, you would be left with a series of tepid disappointments that didn't give as much as you wanted, but still offered enough that you'd grudgingly accept them. Not a perfect win, but still a win.

Some obvious issues that cropped up as I was thinking this over:

- Can't ask to be happy with the wish, or similar, because this could easily be solved by altering your mind as part of the wish. And while that may be better than the alternative, it still leads to some pretty obvious failure states.

- Can't ask to actually know the effects ahead of time, because this could be used as a denial of service attack against you. In theory, a genie could use that wish to cram minute details of the world's particles, in as much detail as they had access to, as long into the future as they could see, stretching out in a light cone starting from where and when you made the wish. No chance a human could begin comprehending that, so a big risk there.

That's what I have so far. I think it's reasonably solid against most malevolent wishgranters, but I haven't put it out for others to pick over either, so it's possible I'm missing something big.

Any thoughts?
