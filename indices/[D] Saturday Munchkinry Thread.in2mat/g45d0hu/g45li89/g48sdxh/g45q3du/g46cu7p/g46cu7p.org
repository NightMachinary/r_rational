An object that looks like an ordinary plastic bottle, except that the inside is 1% bigger than the outside. Mass is conserved, so this bottle will sink in water.

If cut, the inside of the bottle will shrink, (if it can do so without applying too much force).

You can't get explosion levels of energy by filling it with concrete, and then poking a small hole, it will just stay bigger on the inside.

This shrinking is a local phenomena, you can't transmit data by filling the bottle with concrete, sawing it in half, and then removing the concrete from one half.

Shining light through the bottle wall does not change its frequency/wavelength.
