You can tell whether or not any Turing machine is a busy beaver in the time it takes you to read the state diagram. You have to read the Turing machine state diagram, you can't tell if the Turing machine written down in the next room is a busy beaver. No signaling.

You will loose this ability if you are mind uploaded.

The only information you get is a single Boolean representing whether or not the TM is a busy beaver. As busy beavers are exponentially rare, and a significant portion of TM's aren't easy to rule out, it will take a while to find large Busy Beavers.
