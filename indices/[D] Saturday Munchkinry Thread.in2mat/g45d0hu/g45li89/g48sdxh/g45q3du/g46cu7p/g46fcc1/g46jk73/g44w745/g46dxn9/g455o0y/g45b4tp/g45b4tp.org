  But do you have the power to utterly ignore structural integrity like in Fortnite? As in, building massively tall towers that absolutely should fall over in real life but don't in Fortnite?

  If so, it's time to build a space elevator! (Or well, a space ramp, since elevators aren't a thing in Fortnite.)

I added an edit to my comment to split the difference a bit between reality and Fortnite. Center of mass and center of balance are magically redistributed through the structure. And the materials are arranged in an optimal way for your goals as they are built. So it won't fall over due to balance issues (like if you built a giant ramp). I think space elevators are still out, since if the force is magically redistributed perfectly you would still run into issues with strength of the materials.

  Especially since you are completely unable to use one of the best building construction materials ever: concrete.

By Fortnite logic concrete counts as brick.

  You also can't even work as a human wrecking ball, since people expect the raw materials back,

I edited that to since I forgot to mention you can drop materials. Demolition or material reclamation would be valuable uses.
