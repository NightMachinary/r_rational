Can you do partial transfers? If so, there's a lot more that could be done with it.

Going by your virus example, for instance, you could use a partial transfer to inoculate yourself by taking progressively larger doses. As you build up an immunity, you could eventually be inoculated enough that you might be able to cure people without actually getting sick yourself. Or at least drop their current load enough that they could safely fight it off themselves. The tricky part would be balancing the amount so that your body had a strong enough response without actually developing the disease yourself.

You could also perform load balancing on acute, lifethreatening, but recoverable injuries. If you took half of some immediate condition, that might be enough for doctors to stabilize and treat you both where it would result in death for a single person taking the entire load.

As an aside, how does this work for something like blood loss. If you heal a person who's lost a pint of blood, does it transfer over? Do they get /your/ blood, or the equivalent amount of their own blood. Does it work by volume or percent? If a toddler lost a huge amount of their blood, how badly would you suffer healing them? The relatively small amount of absolute volume it would take to restore what they lost, or would it be a proportionate amount to the body's total volume?
