Depending on how fine grained you can be in choosing what ailments you take, it could be really good. Any ailment that is temporary and can be dealt with by a healthy human would be easily treated. Low blood sugar, low blood pressure, dehydration, fever, things like that. You're not going to feel /good/, but those things absent their causes are bearable, even if you pass out. You might be able to cancel some things out, like too high and low body fat content, if those count as things you can transfer. If the magnitude of the medical issue is conserved, you could heal children extremely well. Malnutrition would be a pretty good thing to treat for people who have medical problems eating food. Transferring the diseases of people with autoimmune disorders, or the various things that suppress your immune system like cancer drugs, would be extremely helpful, since they have a weakened ability to fight off otherwise minor diseases.

For permanent stuff, you might be able to do a lot of good if diseases don't stack with each other. Sickle cell anemia is difficult to deal with, but there aren't really degrees of it, since it's a genetic thing. At the cost of having sickle cell anemia, you could cure everyone you can get in contact with it. Similarly with blindness, deafness, or whatever essentially binary affliction you can come up with, or when an overabundance of an affliction doesn't kill you. Though doing the above would make treating the shorter lasting things harder. Deafness + tinnitus would be a way of mitigating the effects of one condition with that of another, and you could probably come up with a bunch of things like that.
