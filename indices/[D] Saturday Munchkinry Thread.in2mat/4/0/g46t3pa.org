Okay, but where is that 1%? What part of the bottle is it not touching, or is the entire inside of the bottle 1% larger than the entire outside? If you put a rod that was half the length of the outside of the bottle in, would it appear to shrink, or would it's apparent dimensions be maintained, or would it depend on where in the bottle the rod sat? Could you make some object that was less than 1% of the volume of the bottle disappear? Shining light does not change frequency or wave length, but does it take longer to get through?
