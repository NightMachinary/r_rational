I don't have a great answer worked out, but the question reminds me of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Cadets_%28TV_series%29][this TV show]] where they faked a space mission.

Their selection criteria seems like a good place to start if your aim is to convince someone at all, rather than someone in particular.

  The intention was to obtain a group of Cadets who were highly gullible, conformist, and ignorant about the show's subject matter

Which was quite a necessary condition...

  Particularly questioned was how weightlessness, which would be present in a real space flight, would be handled on a ground-based set. The Cadets were told that they would be in "near space" (as opposed to "outer space"), causing only a 30% loss of gravity; which was compensated by "gravity generators" built into the ship. Due to the Cadet-choosing criteria, this profoundly absurd explanation was believed (any object in orbit of another astronomical object will experience free-fall, and thus weightlessness).
