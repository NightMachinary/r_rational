Aside from solutions like directly sending input to your brain in a vat, or raising people from age 4 not to question it, I don't think it's possible.

Convincing someone that they're in a spaceship when they're not is a lot like psychics' attempts to explain why psychic powers work, or like any attempt to save a scientific theory that has a lot of evidence against it. You can always add epicycles to any theory--"well, some unbelievers exude a psychic field that keeps experiments from working near them" or "yeah, there's something weird going on that makes a Foucalt pendulum work like it does on the Earth, even though were in space". But enough of those and the most logical explanation is that there's no such thing as psychic powers, not that psychic powers are real but they just happen, for a whole bunch of reasons, not to be detectable.

This is an especially good comparison since there are a number of active psychic fakers. Ask yourself: what could a psychic faker do to convince a rational person that he actually has psychic powers? The answer: Nothing. He can do things that are /consistent/ with real psychic powers, but he can't do things that are /unique/ to real psychic powers. Likewise for fake spaceships.
