Simple math, assuming you're watching Ascension. They were provided with a fake window, through which they could see they aren't rotating. (There would be all sorts of potential ways to try to pierce the window's deception; looking for the CMBR temperature and firing lasers outside come to mind.) So if they know (via their ancestors) that they've been living at 1 g for 51 years, [[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/acceleration.html][SR tells us]] (you don't need GR) that v = c tanh(a T / c). This is tanh(52.6459346), which Wolfram Alpha helpfully tells us is 1 - 3.7 * 10^{-46.} The relativistic kinetic energy of 1 gram of the spaceship would be 270 years of solar luminosity. 30,000 kg going that fast would have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foe_(unit)][1 foe]] of energy.

You're not riding a spaceship. You're riding a supernova.
