Ultimately, this is an enormous magic trick. I'm assuming from context that we have to do this with a group taken from contemporary Western society, containing at least one rationalist, and using only current technology?

First, distract the targets. Drug 'em, if possible. Life on the spaceship is tough, so force them through some pretty cultlike/military-style training. The targets are completely isolated from outside media influences, everything is filtered and doctored to twist things our way. (That last bit isn't critical, just a good general principle for this sort of thing - and it should start /before/ they enter training. Break into their houses if you have to.)

The "ship" is small, cramped. It contains ludicrously top-of-the-line IT hardware, and enough tech to provide life-support indefinitely if you don't mind a lot of hard work, and bugger-all else.

So what does the ship look like?

It looks like a goddamn centrifuge, that's what it looks like. A literal centrifuge, underground somewhere. Running 24/7. The budget for this plot is insane, why the hell /not/ do this? Build several vaguely-conventional centrifuges, stack the damn things. Also, personally, I'd be inclined to put in some sort of vacuum chamber thingy, and have one or two stooges be the only people capable of operating the spacesuits.

I actually think you could get away with "we invented a gravity generator", and have a trained magician "demonstrate" it. There are any number of magic tricks you could use for this; levitation is the oldest thing in the book, you can tamper with the instruments, and if worst comes to worst you could sell a literal descending lift as a "low-gravity room" if you had to. But this is the absolute hardest way to do it.
