Sure all of these configurations work, whatever suits the narrative can be used. As for the takeoff, I had assumed they were drugged unconscious during that. Realistically they would be taken in a space elevator to the ship (since it would almost definitely have to be constructed in space). I suppose you could possibly simulate a launch by having the entire room in a super powerful centrifuge (irl) but that would probably be ridiculously expensive. Edit: actually you could just have a smaller room connected to a centrifuge and have it stop when its next to the room which would be vastly cheaper). IMO, its best just to have them drugged and wake up already in "space".
