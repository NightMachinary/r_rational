I would argue that those are neither easier nor more sustainable, even if you do have the tech.

It's one thing to hijack sensory inputs, and another entirely to be able to identify memories in short-term memory and disrupt them before they can be encoded in long-term memory -- we have an idea how to do the former, but the latter is going to run into problems in both figuring out what concepts are involved in a given thought and how to prevent them from being stored without having painfully obvious side effects.

Nanobots would have to be able to identify what apparatuses are relevant to the such an experiment, identify what changes would need to be made to generate a "space" result, and somehow avoid tainting all other experiments in such a way that would raise anomalies.

Education is MORE plausible than the previous two scenarios, and it's certainly easier, but it's hard to say that it's more sustainable.
