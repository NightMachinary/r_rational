  What do you need to do to accomplish that deception?
#+end_quote

If you have the tech, the easiest, most sustainable way is, of course, a brain-in-a-jar kind of approach. But that's sort of cheating.

With currently existing technology, I'd imagine the most plausible solution would be to put on board a majority of confederates who will continuously assert that it is a spaceship, and systematically deny evidence to the contrary, like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments][Asch conformity experiments]].

  Contrarily, let's say that you're in a spaceship, and you have a creeping suspicion that you never actually left Earth. How do you test it?

If possible, get or make a magnetic compass. While the designer can probably easily interfere with this, it is good practice to cover all possible vulnerabilities.

After that, ultrasound, maybe?
