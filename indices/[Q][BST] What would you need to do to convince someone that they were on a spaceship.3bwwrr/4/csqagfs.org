Well, as you pointed out, gravity is the biggest giveaway. You're going to have to hand wave that with continuous acceleration, which brings in the fuel/reactor question.

The next one is food supply. A crew needs to eat about 2000 calories per day, each. More people means more food. More food means more mass to accelerate, and more waste to dump.

Actually, food is probably where I'd start looking. Trace the food supply as far back as I can, and trace the waste system as far forward as I could, and see if it doesn't add up. See if I encounter resistance to my search.
