This, I think, is the best answer. It's tempting to reach for physics, but all of that can be hand-waved pretty easily, especially without proper tools and knowledge. Ecology is a lot more intuitive and has way more variables. There's no way they'd be able to construct a genuinely functional and sustainable enclosed ecosystem. Hell, Earth isn't even one of those at the moment.
