J. G. Ballard wrote a short story, "[[http://www.ballardian.com/thirteen-to-centaurus][Thirteen to Centaurus]]", with a premise like this.

One of the inhabitants of a generation ship performs two tests: he hangs a plumbline from the wall and measures its angle to determine the ship's rotation rate, and times the fall of a known mass to determine the ship's mass.
