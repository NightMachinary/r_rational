A: If we're in space, why is there gravity?\\
B: The ship is spinning to produce a comfortable and healthy amount of gravity.\\
A: So the ship's a circle? Can I walk all the way around it?\\
B: You could, but only a small part of it is inhabitable. The rest is storage areas, reaction mass, the nuclear reactor... and it's not airtight, so don't go exploring too far.\\
A: How come gravity isn't detectably weaker on the top floor than on the bottom floor?\\
B: We measure the mass of things by putting them on a scale with some lead weights on the other side; you'd need a spring-loaded scale to measure a difference in gravity. Anyway, the effect is too small to notice, gravity is only 3% weaker on the top floor.\\
A: I measured the floors and they're all the same size. Shouldn't the ones nearer the center be proportionately smaller?\\
B: You must have measured it wrong. Or perhaps it's just the way the architecture is designed.\\
A: I found a spring scale, and it says gravity is the same everywhere. Also I built a Foucault pendulum and got some really strange results. Also there's no cosmic radiation.\\
B: That's impressive, considering you've lived on-ship all your life and we don't teach you about Foucault pendulums or cosmic radiation here. I suspect you are a spy for the Communists/Fascists/Lizardmen; would you please follow me to the interrogation room?
