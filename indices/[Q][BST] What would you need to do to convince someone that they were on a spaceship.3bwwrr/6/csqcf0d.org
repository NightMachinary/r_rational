Centripetal force! Any ship meant to carry humans for a long time will have to have a spinning ring essentially. Because of the centripetal force, someone inside the ring essentially gets flung into the outer rim of the ring with enough force to equal Earth's gravity. If you tell them they are on a small section of this ring it can work. The bigger you claim the ring is, the shorter the room is in one direction and the shorter the roof the better. Those last two factors are because you'd expect curvature and the Coriolis effect respectively. I'll edit in a diagram later

edit: Ok, here are the diagrams (and yes, my artistic skills are clearly rivalled by none, I am a god of the visuals :p):

The red arrows indicate the direction of the force from the perspective of people inside the ring. That force can be just as strong as gravity. As you can see in that picture, I've made the height of the room and the length in one direction relatively small. However the other length can be as large as you'd like, [[https://imgur.com/zH7wQAZ,T2F30CW,d8e7pEG,B8CCwMt#1][as seen in this isometric view of the same ring]]. Now if the room was too long in one direction you would expect to either feel gravity to be a little sideways or for the ground to be curved. That's because of how the force always points in the opposite direction of the centre. You can see the effect [[https://imgur.com/zH7wQAZ,T2F30CW,d8e7pEG,B8CCwMt#2][here]]. Finally, if you make the roof too tall, the people would expect something dropping to not hit exactly below the drop point (from their perspective). This is because any point on a rotating ring is going to be moving more slowly the nearer the centre it is (since it has less distance to travel for every rotation). That means objects nearer the roof are moving slower (from an outside perspective) than objects near the floor. Which means from the perspective of the people inside the ring, its like there is force pushing things in one direction (that direction being the opposite direction of the rotation at that point). You can see that in [[https://imgur.com/zH7wQAZ,T2F30CW,d8e7pEG,B8CCwMt#3][this diagram]].
