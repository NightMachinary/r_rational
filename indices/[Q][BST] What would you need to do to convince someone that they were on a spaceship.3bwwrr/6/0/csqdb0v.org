That's what I was thinking. There are still a few problems. You'd expect to be able to walk around it. Either there has to be a plausible excuse for only being allowed on a small section, or you have to actually build it into a ring and in addition to hiding the lack of curvature you now have to hide the addition of curvature in another direction.

Instead of a ring, you could claim that there's just two areas circling the ship. Since going from one to the other would be inconvenient, it would be easier to claim that people aren't allowed to move between them. You could also try claiming the ship is lopsided, and there is only one such room, but that would make the rocket more complicated.

There's still the problem of taking off. Depending on how far you're willing to go with the deception, you could actually take off, and then claim that landing was a second burn.

Edit:

You could also fake the take off by actually building it on some kind of pendulum, so you can make it circle faster to add artificial gravity and make it feel like it's taking off.
