Just wanted to point out that on the show, they've got a crew of 600 people. If the average person weighs 69kg (which they do, according to Wolfram Alpha) then that means that they have 41,400kg worth of weight /in people alone/, even before you start adding in the food, water, animals, reactors, etc.
