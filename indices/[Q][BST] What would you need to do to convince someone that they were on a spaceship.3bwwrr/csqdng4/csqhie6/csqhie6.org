Well I don't think it would be that hard to sell the idea that a novel means of artificial gravity has been invented. Telling the mark about it and injecting news articles, papers, etc. on this new technology. Unless the mark is a physicist I don't think it would take much to sell this. And even if the mark is a physicist your material just needs to be convincing and bullet proof enough. Same thing with the EM drive turning out to be a huge success. With that out of the way the rest should be easy.
