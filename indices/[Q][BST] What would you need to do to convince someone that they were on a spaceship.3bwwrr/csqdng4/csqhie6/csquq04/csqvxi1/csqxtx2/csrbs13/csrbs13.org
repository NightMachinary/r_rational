Hmm, but the idea is that you explain the underlying theory as not allowing for differences in gravitational field and other loopholes like that. Assuming that whoever is dong this has lots of resources and is competent at pulling this off I think you could come up with a very convincing amendment to gravity. At least for me my understanding of advanced physics and gravity in particular is very shallow. I mean you could enter it thinking that a strong uniform field would be very difficult, but if everyone says no, here are all the developments in the last 10 years while you were in a coma, see this stack of papers and this textbook I don't see how I would be able to find flaws in it.

And all my usual avenues for poking holes in such a theory would be doctored/ not available. The possible objections all countered befor
