I was briefly insulted, until I realised you were in-character as a denier/confederate. Ignoring for a moment that due to the space-curving nature of gravity a strong uniform field across a small object should be massively harder than a varying one. I'm no physicist, but you'd have to lie about the basics of gravitational theory itself to get me not to realise that, which is more a problem of indoctrination than convincing. So lets say for the sake of not having an argument that we're taking an adult and convincing them instead of raising a child to believe something (which you could totally do, cults manage it all the time).

I can't imagine owning a gravity device and building a colony ship without designating certain areas as lower or higher gravity for convenience sake. Mass transit for example, works so much better in zero-g, as does moving resources and stores.
