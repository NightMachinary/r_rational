The constant one gee is easy - it's a Heinlein-style generation ship spinning for gravity, or a pair of ships in a "bola" configuration, or something similar.

To test it, you need to make really accurate measurements of the vertical at a distance, along two lines at 90 degrees (ideally, you could do it at a smaller angle).

If the verticals are parallel, you're either in something like a Culture Orbital, they have artificial gravity, or you're on a large planet.

If they converge towards the top, you're in space. You can also measure the size of the vessel (or distance between the heads of the bola) and calculate the rotation rate. Also, you're in a novel by someone like Heinlein or Harrison or Clarke.

If they converge towards the bottom, you're on a small dense planet, or a ship built around a black hole or chunk of neutronium, and you might be in a novel by John Stith or Stanislaw Lem or Greg Egan. Or Stephen Baxter, in which case you're in big trouble.
