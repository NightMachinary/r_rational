The ending episode had some rather ridiculous moments (production of water and oxygen from lithium dioxide and carbon dioxide, not to mention the league of villians and their wootastic xanatos gambit behind the whole experiment). However, the opening was solid and had a lot of promise. I might have liked the real spaceship scenario better, but the fake one was fun too.

My suggestion for gravity is to convince the population that they are under constant uniform acceleration due to atomic bombs exploding behind them at a constant rate. This would be accompanied by an oscillator that causes slight vibrations that can be detected with instruments inside the ship, supposedly dampened by a massive hydraulic spring.

The 1 gee acceleration is too much for the multi-generation story though. They would have to be convinced that the gravity is at least partly from centrifugal force, or fooled into thinking gravity is less than it is with some kind of psychological manipulation.

A longer distance could be chosen, but I'm not sure that does much good (since relativity should kick in and make you need less velocity to travel per unit subjective time, as the universe around you is experiencing lorentzian contraction). Maybe they could get blown off course, miss their destination, and have to head back.

A plausible fuel source is also needed for an accelerator like this. A variant of Bussard Ramjet is probably the most reasonable source, but might not be up to the plausible tech of the time. Maybe (given the threat of being left adrift in space otherwise) the inhabitants could have invented high-strength industrial fibers (with planted scientific data to help them get lucky), enabling them to make really long, thin electrodynamic cables which collect interstellar hydrogen for nuclear fuel while thrusting off of stellar magnetic fields.

There could also be a fake AI, and fake nuclear fusion, as those are things that smart people are often sure should be easy (even though they aren't).
