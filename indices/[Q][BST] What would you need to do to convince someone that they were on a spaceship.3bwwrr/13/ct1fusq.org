It's important to note that any proposed solutions to maintain the deception should be significantly cheaper than /actually/ building a colony ship.

That said, I don't think you'll be able to devise a plausible mock-up of stars on a budget less than building the real thing. Someone could easily go to a window and do trigonometry by hand to show that the 'stars' aren't more than a mile away. Even making a building which is a cube measuring a mile on each side might be expensive enough to make it cheaper to just build a real colony ship.
