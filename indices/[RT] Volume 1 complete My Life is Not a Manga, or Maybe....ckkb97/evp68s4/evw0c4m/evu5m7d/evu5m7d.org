Congratulations on finishing. It was an interesting read; I've seen a few stories of this sort before, like [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/no-matter-what-happens-i-still-wont-become-an-anime-character.9848/]], but this was a bit of a unique take on it. It's also completed which is a plus; only two of the others in this category have finished a full plot that I remember.

Thanks for posting this here!
