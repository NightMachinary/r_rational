Okay, here are some comments. I'll put them in spoilers just in case.

1. I felt that in some sense, Xavier wasn't really trying. His initial thoughts were more or less 'I want to get Emily back' and 'I want to get out of this manga'. Yet in practice, he was only aiming for the second (aside from a few half-hearted texts). I feel that there was at least some potential to aim for both, using the genre to help him, and he didn't even seem to think about it. Consider this. Your girlfriend was put on a bus by the manga, and you're surrounded by a harem. It's more or less guaranteed that if things go on long enough, your ex-girlfriend shows up to disrupt the status quo. Just make sure that one girl appears to be winning, and something is bound to happen. By law of conservation of detail, Emily's return is a very likely option.

Of course, the above is at least sort of unfair towards the one girl you give the appearance of winning, so I can imagine Xavier dismisses it based on that. Or maybe he dismisses is because he wants Emily to be safe from the manga. Also, even if Emily gets back, there's bound to be some complication. But not even thinking about the option feels kind of thoughtless.

2. I think Samantha's reveal was well done, and greatly increased the feel of the characters being real rather than stereotypes.

3. The author on the other hand had plenty of options to throw a curveball with how Samantha was 'released from the harem'. Xavier appeared to genuinely want to help Samantha, and I imagine Samantha would be able to figure this out. I would say there's a decent chance she would actually start to appreciate him because of this, rather than being removed from the harem. Instead, Xavier's plan appeared to work perfectly. (Actually, I count this as 'the way Xavier was thinking about his problems failing him at a low level'. "I want to get rid of potential romantic interests? Let's do something to genuinely help them personally!"). I'll also make a little note here that the plan mostly worked because Jewel also happened to be into anime. Quite convenient. I'll come back to that.

4. The harem in general didn't feel like much of a harem after Samantha. Samantha was just acting out, Paula just felt like someone who likes teasing, Rachel didn't indicate any romantic interest (aside from the blushing in chapter 2), leaving only Jill as a potential candidate. Xavier seemed to sort of pick up on that, but still kept thinking he was in a harem situation. Sure, he could think that there's actual romantic attraction deeply underneath all the facades, but it's getting more and more farfetched.

5. Then Seamus shows up, solving Xavier's problem with Jill more or less automatically (Jill feels she's plain, and we get someone who is interested in her just from seeing her). At this point, all the warning bells in my head start going off. Either this is bad writing, or we've left the harem genre entirely. Xavier doesn't seem to notice that this is suspiciously convenient... Again.

6. Regarding Paula. From the harem manga point of view, I expected her to be mildly impressed by Xavier initially, and for her teasing to become of a more serious nature as she grew closer to him. Instead, the teasing never seemed serious, and was directed at Samantha half of the time. She didn't seem to grow closer to Xavier at all, and around the Halloween party, I was partly suspecting that she would reveal herself to be a lesbian, using her obvious teasing of Xavier to try to hide that (this would also neatly explain why she wanted Xavier to pretend to be her date at the party). After the date, there's still a lot of mystery left, but again Xavier's problem resolves itself (and was apparently never a problem to begin with).

7. Rachel is still a big mystery. Chapter 2 has her flush a lot; chapters five and six flesh her out a bit, but after that, nothing much happens. It feels like she takes things in stride way too much; there seems to be very little emotion. The last two chapters hint at some romantic attraction, but it wasn't really visible otherwise. It's also unclear why she has such social manipulation skills.

8. Did the Debbie plot just... get dropped?

9. On the whole, it felt like there was very little challenge for the protagonist. Sure, he did some things, but there didn't seem to be any real challenges (aside from Samantha maybe), and there were no setbacks (unless you count Debbie). Things just... worked out. Anti-climax was sort of the point, but I at least expected Xavier to have to work for the anti-climax. Maybe some of the above points will come back with a vengeance next book of course. Still, I like to see a book, especially a first book in a series, stand on its own, while this one just seemed incomplete.

10. Since the above might seem mostly negative, let me at least point out that I did finish the entire book, and took the time to write all of this. I'm sort of hesitant to start on the next book if it'll be very similar to this, but I do think there's a lot of potential in this series.

P.S. In case it's relevant, I've read quite a few manga series, including some in the harem genre. In addition, I've spent a lot of time on tvtropes.
