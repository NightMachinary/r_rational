Congratulations on making it all the way through! Producing good writing is hard, and writing a complete novel without giving up is impressive.

NotAManga was a little outside my normal strike zone, as I don't read manga myself and I therefore don't know the tropes that well. At points I found myself thinking "Why not just try dating Paula or Jill? Or, for that matter, just enjoy it, at least once he got Samantha out?" On the other hand, there are questions of free will -- the harem were all being forced to act in unnatural ways and show romantic interest in someone they might not have been romantically interested in otherwise, which is a little squicky. OTOH, they were clearly independent agents, since Jill could choose to simply exit the harem when she decided to.

It was odd reading a work where the entire point was to /prevent/ anything interesting from happening. It's like the hero's journey being actively stalled at the Refusing the Call stage. I'm glad I read it, although I'm not sure it could be sustained for another entire book. What are you planning to do for Volume 2 that will be different from Volume 1?
