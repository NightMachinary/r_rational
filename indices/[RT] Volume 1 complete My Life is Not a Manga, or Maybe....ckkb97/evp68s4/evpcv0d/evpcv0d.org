I'm not sure what I can say without spoilers. :-)

Suffice it to say that the stakes in volume 2 are completely different. At stake in volume 1 is Xavier's sense of autonomy/independence of self (and arguably integrity; things could have spiraled out of control fast if he'd tried dating all the girls at once, solicited sex from them in an attempt to cash out on his protagonist status, etc.). So the risks were mainly existential, and reasonably small in scope (for an external observer; he would undoubtedly argue otherwise). Xavier also had a support group/safety net (parents, and arguably some of the girls themselves) and the leisure to experiment.

Volume 2 will force him into a situation where many of the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph are no longer true.
