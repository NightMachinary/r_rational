Thank you so much for the in-depth critique! This is really useful feedback, particularly since I am planning to revise the story prior to publishing it and you've helped gel some of the issues that I'd been feeling myself but having trouble explicitly identifying when I was head down writing it week-to-week.

Seriously, I can't thank you enough for taking the time to leave such thorough feedback. I hope you will give the second book a shot when I start publishing it in a month, because it's going to be quite a bit different (assuming all goes well; I'd really rather avoid books where it doesn't feel like the protagonist has any real challenges).
