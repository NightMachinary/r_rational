It is being worked on. That is not dead which can eternal lie etc.

But I can't give you anything concrete in terms of a timeframe, much as I'd like to. There's a bunch of bigger-picture planning I need to get done before I can get back to writing actual updates, and that is a thing which requires quite a lot of time, energy and motivation to get right so I don't write myself into a corner later on (which is oh so easy to do with rational fiction, /coughoverpoweredplayerabilitiescough/).
