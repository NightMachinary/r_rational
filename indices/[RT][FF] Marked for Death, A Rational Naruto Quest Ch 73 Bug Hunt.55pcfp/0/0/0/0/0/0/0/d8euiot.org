Well, we're not talking Nyarlathotep here. Shub-Niggurath is a being of the primal wilderness, and unlikely to be au fait with online forums, or indeed technology at all.

Granted, seeing as Nyarlathotep has a thousand masks, can probably pass for Shub-Niggurath to anyone without serious occult knowledge, and is capable of functioning perfectly in human society, it's impossible to be sure that we're /not/ talking about him here.
