Well, QED.

At least once a fortnight, @eaglejarl and I stop in mid-discussion and one of us goes, "oh Shub-Niggurath, Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young, do you realise that because we gave them X ability/ruling, they can now potentially do Y and effectively end the quest at the next voting deadline?"

Edit: to make it clear, neither of us, to my knowledge, is Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young. Its dread name is being invoked solely for emphasis.
