Well, to help you write a story - what is the most interesting "hook" you can imagine that follows from that question? If the reply is something like:

#+begin_quote
  Answers are constrained to full English sentences shorter than 140 characters. The world ends in 59 minutes contingent on your inaction.
#+end_quote

Or like:

#+begin_quote
  The optimal course of action to maximize your values is for you to immediately call 1-800-555-9678, inform them that you have the oracle, leave the oracle where it currently sits, and self-terminate in the most expedient manner possible.
#+end_quote

If you need to add constraints to get a better story, do it. If you can't tell the story that would interest you with an oracle that can do coherent extrapolated volition, then make it unable to do that.
