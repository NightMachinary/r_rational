Alright, what's the first thing you do when you have twenty questions from an infallible Oracle? What's most advantageous, given that I have nineteen other questions? Or, maybe, what pair is most advantageous?

"Do you only answer yes/no questions?"

"No."

"How does your power work?"

"My answers must be true in such a way that they're true in the future."

Hmmm... so the Oracle chooses self-consistent timelines instead of mutable ones? Alright, I could ask how to bring a good timeline about. How many questions did I have now?

"How many answers do I have left?"

"Eightseveneightseveneightseveneightseveneightseveneightseveneightseveneightseveneightseven - "

Shit.
