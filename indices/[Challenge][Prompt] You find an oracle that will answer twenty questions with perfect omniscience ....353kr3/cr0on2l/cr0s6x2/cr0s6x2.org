Better: What answer you could say in this situation would maximize +my coherent extrapolated volition+ the number of paperclips?

OP: Sorry, having our character win everything forever is too fun. (Although I can well imagine this kind of question would cast us into the kind of slavery that [[#s][HPMOR 119]] was under for a long while. Coherent extrapolated volition != volition, and knowledge of a happy ending after the hardship of the story wouldn't detract too much from it.)

More problematic might be that the author couldn't /actually/ know a true Oracle's answer. The Oracle's inevitably resulting fallibility might at some point be discovered by the protagonist, so never mind, this is a good plot point too.
