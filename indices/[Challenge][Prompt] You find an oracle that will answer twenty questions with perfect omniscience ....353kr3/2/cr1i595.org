The Oracle was powerful. The Oracle was omniscient. The Oracle did not tell you what it /thought/ was true, to the best of its knowledge, or as far as it knew, or anything else. It just told you what was irrefutably /true/, so that anything it said, you could trust to be a /fact of the world/. It did not give probabilities, it gave full and complete certainty: P(thing the Oracle says) = 1.0, unable to be contradicted by anything else in the history of everything ever.

"What," I asked it, "Are you going to say next?"

And that's how we lost that entire planet to a Reality Breakage. The lesson, kids, is not to violate the laws of thermodynamics by trying to obtain infinite information!
