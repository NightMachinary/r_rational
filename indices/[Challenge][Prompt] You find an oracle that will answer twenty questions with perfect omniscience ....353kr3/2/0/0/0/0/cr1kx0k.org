The Oracle has proven itself genuinely clever, and it will take /original research/ for me to come up with an infinite-information Goedel Sentence to paradox-attack it. If the Oracle's mind is /really/ well put-together, there will be no sentence driving it to attempt to achieve infinite information at all, at least, no sentence it would /understand/ as anything besides pure chaos.

I remember what this reminds me of, and leave. /Quickly./

When I get home, I write a letter to the editor of the newspaper, declaring that two hours locked in a room with the Oracle should be used as a punishment for violent criminals.
