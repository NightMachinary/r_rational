I don't think there's any good way to define "nested questions" so you can't cheat. You'd have to make the whole thing so weak that it's practically worthless. It's like how Peano arithmetic doesn't allow theorems about itself, but Godel managed the incompleteness theorem regardless.

You could also ask for everything you're going to write somewhere, which would effectively let you ask for any question that you'll ever answer. Or if you really want to munchkin this, you can just cause a contradiction unless you get what you want so that what you want happens. The whole thing about the future changing due to future knowledge can be avoided by asking about a hypothetical future such that the answers to the questions match the answers the oracle gives.
