No, I think the rules for the Oracle specify that it follows your words as you meant them. I do imagine it's being disturbingly tricksy with your questions, though, as Full Information is half the superintelligence superpower in the first place, and because frankly a lot of the kinds of questions people /think/ they should ask a Prophetic Oracle are the ones were they'll be more disturbed than satisfied by the answers. Even if the Oracle's being /nice/, as /we/ interpret "nice", it's going to conceal a lot and trick a lot, because just giving things away isn't really safe with people who don't have some analogue to the [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin][Litany of Gendlin]].

I mean, maybe it's me being stuck on this "rationality" kick, but it seems to me that when people /really want to know/, they just investigate, or pay someone else to do so, but when they want someone big and important-looking to tell them It's a Grand and Valuable Mystery, /then/ they consult a Prophetic Oracle.
