It's internally consistent with my fictional universe though, the visions of the oracles are granted by the fates, and thus any answer given would be in line with the fates' interests. Within the universe Mordred is the only individual free from the wheel of fate and able to make decisions the fates have no control over. I don't write rationalist fiction so I could care less what EY has to say on the matter
