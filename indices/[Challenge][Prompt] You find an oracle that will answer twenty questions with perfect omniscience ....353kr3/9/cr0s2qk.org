Inspired based on a book I'm currently writing:

Mordred returned to the temple of the Fates for the first time in ten years, the memory fresh in his mind of the day Pan took him as an apprentice and he met his brothers Fenrir and Jormungand. Knowing that the Triptych were technically his family he decided against trying to con the Fates, too much time with Pan had taught him the consequences of interfering in the realms of the other gods. Instead he chose to ask one singular question that would allow him his free will.

"What course of action must I take to ensure my life remains my own, free from the interference of the Triptych, Clothos, Lachesis and Atropos?"

Upon receiving his answer and deliberating on it within the temple for the rest of the day, he left and proceded to do the exact opposite of the answer to his question.

Because seriously, who asks an oracle of the Fates for advice on how to leave their realm and actually follows it?

Pan had taught him well.
