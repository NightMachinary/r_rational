Backstory:

I imagined a medival world where anyone could ask the Oracle any question they wanted, but only once in their lifetimes. The conditions...would be horrendous as the population density would be extremely high. No one would be able to force their way to the line without a bloody massacre and there are multiple factions in the area who would band together against the hypothetical threat.

Money wouldn't work either since no one has the wealth available to bribe enough people to leave after waiting months to make a difference. In addition, no one is allowed past the first tenth of the line without waiting in the line itself. There just isn't enough room!

The Temple of the Oracle is wholly self-sustaining for this reason and therefore has a catapult with disposable parachutes to help visitors get past the crowd when leaving.

Don't forget the chances of an epidemic killing off the people and the difficulties the people face in bringing enough food and supplies to last through the line. It's not a good thing for this world that Bags of Holding (from DnD) exist.

Of course I then started thinking about the game-theoretic strategies behind what Questions could be asked to give one an advantage. It became very likely that people would rarely ask questions not immediately relevant to themselves and the Oracle's power would go to waste. Hence the story of someone who hopes to improve things for the better by 'wasting' a Question to let others know the truly best possible Question to ask...
