I bit my lower lip in worry as I stared at the paper with my Question. It wasn't fair. Every fairy tale I had ever heard of always, /always/, *always* had three chances for the protagonist. Three wishes, three quests, three trials, three, three, three...

I had the chance of a lifetime to have any possible question answered Truthfully. Not the truth were you are 99.99...% percent certain with a lot of nines trailing off with a only small niggling doubt that you /might/ be wrong, but a Truth that couldn't ever be false. A Truth so self-evident that if reality contradicted the Oracle, then reality itself was wrong. The magic of the Oracle allowed visitors to convince others absolutely the Truth of the Answer to their Question. No one could lie about their Question and what the Oracle told them for their Answer.

And I only had one question I was allowed to ask the Oracle.

Oh well no crying over fantasies that won't come true.

I dropped the paper into my Bag of Holding as I glanced up. The temple doors remained closed and the sun was almost at its highest peak. I would be entering precisely at noon and be the only person admitted in for the day. I looked at the List hanging above the doorway:

1. You get only one question. Stop asking for a repeat!
2. Yes only one question. Go away!
3. No you don't get any refunds. How do you refund a question anyway!?!
4. Be polite. This is common courtesy. If you are getting an Answer, then you could at least be polite to the Oracle!
5. Got your Answer? Then go away!!!

I got the impression that a lot of people tended to be rather annoying about their Question.

I looked back behind me at the crowd of people waiting. Well 'crowd' was a poor word. Perhaps an ocean of people? The city was called the *Filthy Ocean* for a reason. I was just glad to be out away from the smelly, disease-ridden line I had spent the past three years working my way through. You had to keep a sharp eye out for anyone willing to cut you out of the lines. Literally in some cases as I eyed the nearby graveyards.

It was no wonder that people were always so selfish about their Questions. With only one question allowed per person and with the enormous cost of waiting in this potentially lethal line, people were cutthroat about their Question. It was amusing how even though the Oracle didn't charge anything, the price of waiting in silence was still high enough to keep people away and to madden the ones waiting to the point of paranoia. No wonder people rarely asked selfless questions. They always asked for something to make them richer, more powerful, or something to get ahead of the rat pack that was life. I must be insane to be wasting my question like this after sinking years of my life into this task, but at least I'll be done with the lines after this. That was the important thing.

/OH/

The door just creaked open a crack. It was my turn.
