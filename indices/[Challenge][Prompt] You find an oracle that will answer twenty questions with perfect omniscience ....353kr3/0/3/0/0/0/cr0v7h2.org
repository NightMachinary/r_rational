Hmm....well Plan A, B, C, D, E,....., X, Y, Z and all the other letters no else uses, are all a bust. That Oracle is good! Too bad I can't actually get back inside since the Oracle was the one who told me about her danger to humanity.

Ah, screw it! I'm waiting in the gods-damned line for the next few years. I'm sure that I can think of something on the way!

Finally! I'm here. Just one more person in front of me and then it's my turn! Who knew pretending to be an identical twin would work? Oh well, I have my trusty stabbing knife with me.

Hey, what's going on with the guy ahead of me? It looks like he's tenderly hugging the Oracle and he's whispering softly 'Don't worry it will all end soon, my beloved.' I wonder what's with the gurgling sound I'm hearing....Man they really should clean up the tomato juice on the floor. It looks like the Oracle spilled a lot down the front of her dress.

Wait-one-cotton-picking-minute..........THAT GUY STOLE MY ROLE!!!!!!
