To create another rough analogy, you could take this rough idea and write a screenplay based on it, and then use that screenplay to create a movie, but you can't call the original rough idea a screenplay. You want a better story, look at the one partially based off that story: [[http://thoughtcrime.crummy.com/2009/Error.html]] which is actually rationalist fiction. This Hell is the Absence of God story is just nonsensical. When I first started reading it I thought it was crazy Christian propaganda, and once I hit the end I realized it was crazy anti-Christian propaganda, but being an idea (or propaganda) doesn't somehow elevate it to being an actual story. I'm not saying it needs to be longer, but this "story" is just a rough idea and absolutely doesn't fit in this forum.
