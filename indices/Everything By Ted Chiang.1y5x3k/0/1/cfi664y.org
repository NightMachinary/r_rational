I'd never heard of this guy, so I looked up this Hell is the Absence of God story and I don't think it's rational fiction. A universe has been set up where Hell and Heaven are real, actualy biblical "fear not (even though you presumably have good reason to fear upon seeing me)" angelic visitations occur, and a man's wife is killed by an angelic visitation, and then goes to Heaven on account of her devotion. This man needs to love God to get into Heaven, otherwise he'll go to Hell. So he comes up with this plan to either see the light of heaven during an angelic visitation and be changed into someone who loves God, or die trying and go to Hell. He ends up dying, wishes he hadn't chosen to do that, sees the light, becomes utterly devoted to God, dies, and goes to Hell. Another character uses the first guy as evidence that God doesn't care, that whether you go to Hello or Heaven is random, and that you should love God anyway. Where are the smart people making smart choices? Where are the "rules of life or the universe that are perhaps completely undefined initially, perhaps even completely misunderstood or backwards from what one thought, but ultimately knowable" when we learn that the whole point in the story's universe is that there aren't really any rules?

Look over on the right of this page, at the general characteristics of rational fiction. 1. The main character is stupid. He takes an admittedly risky shot chance of "convert or die" because he's caught in the throes of grief instead of waiting to perhaps let time abate his woes, as clearly happens to virtually everyone who has ever lost someone? The story even spells out that this isn't the smart choice. 2. The main character did not solve a problem through the intelligent application of anything, see #1. 3. The story is a puzzle, yes, but only because it turns out that there aren't really rules and everything is random. 4. Well, factions are defined and there is some conflict because of their beliefs and values, not just "good" or "evil", but still, it's really poor writing. 5. The rules of the fictional universe are not sane and consistent, there are no rules, God is random.

And this author is a terrible author to boot, his story isn't really a story so much as an idea or summation of a story that could have been written.
