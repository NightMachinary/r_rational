Here's an [[http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/tower.html][almost complete collection]] featuring Tower of Babylon, Story of Your Life, The Evolution oh Human Science and other stories plus some not-very-enlightening author commentary. I think the only missing stories are Dacey's Patent Automatic Nanny (which is a short one you might as well skip) and The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling, which has already been posted here.

If you like listening, here are some [[http://www.sffaudio.com/?page_id=4811][Chiang's stories in audio format]]. Quality of reading varies.
