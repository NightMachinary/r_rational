I dunno. I took a night to think about this, but I still don't think Hell is rationalist fiction. It's really good, and it's thoughtful, but it doesn't fit the criteria. Honestly, there is /very little/ fiction out there that counts as rationalist, which is probably why this subreddit exists. Just the fact that half (or so) of Chiang's stuff counts as rationalist is pretty amazing, IMHO. Even getting that stuff published is a challenge.
