I agree! Chiang's a great writer and lots of his stuff could be called rational fic. I think 'Hell is the Absence of God' totally counts, and so do the rest of the biblical stories. The central idea of all of those is to try and build self-consistent rules out of all of the craziest shit in the bible. The stories about golems and the tower of babel both feature rational protagonists who are able to gain a deeper understanding of their world through observation, even though their world runs on totally different laws than ours. It's kinda the Old Testament and the Methods of Rationality.
