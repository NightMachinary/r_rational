For my part, I absolutely adore "Tower of Babylon" as far as rationalist fiction goes. "The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate" is also amazing and goes into a sort of time travel, and "The Evolution of Human Science" is short but powerful, and might be of particular interest to the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] crowd.
