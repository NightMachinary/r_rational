I had a guy like that in a superhero setting that never really got off the ground. His super-speed just sort of got stuck, and the physics of it was such that it just seemed like everything was moving really slowly.

So yeah, assuming that you can still interact with the world in a meaningful way, then you're golden. My guy set up special computer monitors for himself so that he could view them without the refresh rate making it unintelligible, and of course there are lots of books to read. He used tape recorders to leave messages for people, and special equipment to speed up speech to the level that he could actually hear it. His ability to respond nigh-instantly to local disasters made him a hero - he could rush into a burning building and extract people from it (suiting up in milliseconds to avoid smoke inhalation). He could respond to gunshots as soon as they happened through the microphone system around the city. And he could kill anyone who really deserved it by slitting their throat, which meant that he didn't /need/ mach speed punches.

He didn't actually have an immunity to starvation though, so much of his effort was put towards fulfilling his ~x3,600 dietary needs. His other big problem was staying sane - mostly accomplished through having tons and tons of pen pals (that were, from their perspective, communicating in realtime).
