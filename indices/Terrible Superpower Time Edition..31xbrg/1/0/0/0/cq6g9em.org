Our protagonist needs the same amount of facilities as 3600 regular people. That's not too much. An army base would suit him fine, and in a big city he'd be a rounding error.

There are other problems, though.

1) What about breathing? Ambient air pressure won't supply you with enough air in time. Without special equipment, you suffocate immediately. With special equipment, everyone around you is going to experience some strong air currents.

2) What about heat transfer? The molecules around you are moving 3600 times slower. That feels the same as a near-absolute-zero environment, so you quickly freeze to death. If you counteract that by making your power act as a heat source, then the people standing next to you are cooked in seconds.

3) What about the shockwaves that follow you wherever you go? Your walking speed is supersonic. Sure, try standing still for a moment. You're still moving your chest when you breathe, and your heart is still beating. That's already a staggering amount of sound energy escaping every second, because it scales with the square of speed. And God forbid you clap your hands!

4) What about traction? Gravity is 3600 times weaker. Making a normal step throws you kilometers up, and jumping takes you to orbit. You're also leaving large gashes in any surface you try to walk on, even diamond.

5) What about material objects, like clothes? Let's be generous and say the superpower is transferred by touch, and then cancelled when the touch stops. That means touching any object, including the ground, will create shrapnel that can kill bystanders. At least the ones who are not already dead due to points 1-3.

6) What about interacting with bigger objects? Pop quiz, what happens when you try to open a door? Depending on how far your superpower is transferred, you might melt the door handle, or rip the lock out of the door, or blast the door off the hinges, or any number of other things.

All in all, this superpower turns you into a human-sized wrecking ball, which moves impossibly fast and constantly emits deadly amounts of noise, heat, and shrapnel. A kind of self-propelled explosion.
