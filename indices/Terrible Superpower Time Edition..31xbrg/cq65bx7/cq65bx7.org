I imagine with the food budget Alexanderwales mentioned, there would be issues with cost. You would need a lucrative job if you didn't want to steal.

Government work is an option here. Logistics is your superpower. Imagine if the moment a crisis happened you could instantly upon receiving the information collate all the information on what has happened and get everything needed to all the right people.

Basically set it up so in any potential situation needing a rapid response people can contact you through an email or message system. As soon as they get the message off you're on the scene and everyone who needs to knows about it through exhaustively documented reports. It won't probably work for instant disasters like bombs, but it works for lots of other things. Examples are tornados, terrorist attacks, flash floods, wars, espionage, intelligence coordination (You would be terrifying at this).
