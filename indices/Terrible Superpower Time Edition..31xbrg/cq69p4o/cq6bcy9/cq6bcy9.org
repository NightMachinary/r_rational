this is almost exactly Quicksilver. I recall an amusing issue of X-Factor from the early/mid 90s where the team was subjected to therapy, and in the time it took the shrink to ask a question, Quicksilver completed a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle conveniently laid out on a table in the doctor's office. As I recall, the therapist concluded that he was "surprisingly sane, considering," or something to that effect. Though it's a legitimate question of whether he could /actually/ remain sane or not, existing that way, and marvel comics are not, on the whole, particularly rationalist.
