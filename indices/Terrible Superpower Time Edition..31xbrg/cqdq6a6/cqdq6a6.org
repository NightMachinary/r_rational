  He has no transport. If he wants to travel, he has to travel in a conventional car or train or bus or plain. But the field might accommodate a bicycle. And in theory he can run for as far as he likes. He can take a full night's sleep inside the envelope and be vulnerable only for a second. He can walk into a building and kill everybody inside it just by waving a finger through each throat, and be out of the building and a mile away before anybody can blink, leaving just shattered doors torn into pieces like this steel plate and a hundred people all falling and hitting the ground at once.

  This is not a comic book. Somebody shoots a bullet at him? He just walks around it-- if he sees it coming. Someone sneaks up on him? As soon as he feels something touching the back of his head, an iron bar, let's say, he can go to high speed mode and duck or dodge it. A trip-wire? From his perspective, he runs into it at regular pace and hits the ground like any normal human. It's not fatal, he recovers in a second. An explosion? He walks away from it and watches it happen. We're at T plus ten minutes and democracy in this country is over.
