I don't think you would be able to avoid going at least a little mad.

The only things you could interact with that would be fast enough to not bore you would be high end computers, and even then, any sort of internet lag would be intolerable. You certainly would need a different kind of monitor though. 60Hz just isn't going to cut it. Fluorescent lights are similarly not good. You will spend a lot of your life in the dark unless you use incandescent lights.

I'm not entirely certain about how LED lights and LED monitors might work.

You would likely gravitate into a Google facility, and start programming for a living between page refreshes on reddit.
