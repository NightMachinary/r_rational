Yeah, if you figure that a person spends maybe $240 a week on food, that means that the food budget for the year is $45 million, which is a whole lot of money. Depending on what the hero does though, he might be worth it (he's definitely worth it if he's the only one with any superpowers).

Logistically speaking, he needs to eat every eight real-world seconds, which is a bigger issue. I imagine pallets of MREs and bottled water disappearing at a steady rate from his base of operations. The logistics of waste management are also something to consider - the average person urinates 0.8 liters to 2.0 liters per day, which becomes a torrent when it's happening at 3,600 speed. Special facilities are required for our protagonist.
