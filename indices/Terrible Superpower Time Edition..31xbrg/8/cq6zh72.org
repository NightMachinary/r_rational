I did a play-by-post Mutants and Masterminds rpg following such a hero, which went on for 5 years. Only my character had it worse to start - only his mind was sped up. Fortunately, he was able to get a mental computer interface surgically installed (which exist in that universe, though it's prohibitively expensive for most). He probably still would have gone mad anyways, but he happened to befriend the internet - or rather, a virus that was designed to capitalize on computer downtime worldwide to build a supercomputer, and somehow went sentient. Jane from the Ender sequels, if you will.
