Easier said than done, since designing and building chips probably involves a ton of testing and waiting for chemical reactions to happen or something.

More importantly the max rate of 1,000 Hz is based off of the max polling rate of the USB standard. You'd need to find a standard port that polls faster. Thunderbolt might, or maybe you could find a mouse that somehow plugs directly into a PCIe slot or comes with its own custom expansion card that does the same.

Older motherboards used to have Serial or Parallel ports on their backpanels, which might have a faster polling rate.
