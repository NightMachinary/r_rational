The bigger issue might be the monitor itself. It's a pretty specialized piece of hardware, and I don't know if it's feasible to make one with a 1000 Hz refresh rate. The fastest that I can find is 144 Hz, which works out to one refresh every 25 subjective seconds. On the other hand, as long as you're a careful typist one frame every 25 seconds might be sufficient.
