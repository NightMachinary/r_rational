Besides interesting questions about what this does to language choice and the tradeoff between CPU and programmer time...

I'd be willing to bet that you could get to a 'normal' response speed by throwing enough money at the computer, though it would look like something from a past era. Custom-built keyboard and mouse. Lightweight/realtime custom Linux distro. 240Hz monitor for color, and a custom CRT for real-time-to-you monochrome terminal interface. With care and a good deal of money, I'm confident you could get about a 1995 computer (with better software etc) at 3,600 times normal speed.
