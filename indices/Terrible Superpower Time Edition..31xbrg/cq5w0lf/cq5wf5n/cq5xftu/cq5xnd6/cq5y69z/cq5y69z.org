A high-end gaming keyboard could have a polling rate of like 1000hz, which would be about 4 seconds. If you set that up with a very fast-polling gaming mouse and a fast computer running a lightweight linux (hopefully you already have one, otherwise it's probably faster to steal one) you could make something happen. one keystroke per 4 seconds, or 15 keystrokes per minute, would let you program, but you'd still be very slow. If you were smart about it and planned out your programming carefully, a computer running in realtime could definitely help you.
