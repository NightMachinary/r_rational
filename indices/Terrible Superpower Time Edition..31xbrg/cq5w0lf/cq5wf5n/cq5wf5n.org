Why are you limited to mechanical tools? If a mechanical watch on your wrist functions, why shouldn't a digital watch? If you can extend the time aura over an abacus, why not a calculator? If a mechanical typewriter, why not a word processor on a +computer+ laptop?

The /internet/ would be glacial, but you can use digital equipment offline. It is possible.
