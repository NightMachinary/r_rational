Computer use could be extremely viable. Simply steal "ie: walk in and take and then leave" a few dozen computers. Set them all up in a single room whee they can all be used at once. You could read a huge number of things online by utilizing multiple machines to do the lookups asynchronously. Most sites load in ~0.5 seconds on a modern machine. That's a 30 minute wait. Also, scrolling via pageup/down would take at most a minute or two. Slower than most people are used to, but within a reasonably speed.

Also, you could emulate a much older machine and play older games that way. Some of them can run at tens of thousands of frames per second. You may have to write your own controller software for a keyboard that uses capacitance changes to trigger keypresses though.
