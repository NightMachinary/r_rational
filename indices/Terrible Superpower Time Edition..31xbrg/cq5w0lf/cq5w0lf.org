Assuming that we handwave away things like inability to move, and say that somehow your caloric needs are the same (which is to say, real time, rather than you-time) so basically you just have 3600 hours of free time for every hour that passes in real life, and you don't need to eat, sleep, etc during that time, then we have a start.

This will also ignore issues like being able to open/close doors, and so on. We will not ignore issues of computers, though. Computer use will basically be impossible, and you'll be much better off walking to libraries, or doing original research yourself, than using computers for most things.

The first thing you'll need to do is look up things like abacus and mechanical calculators that are hand-operated. Slide rulers would be good. We're assuming your aura of "this object starts operating by my physics rather than realtime physics" extends to things you're touching (which is reasonable because you need to be able to move your clothes and open doors and stuff without causing instant plasma and fusion). So we start experimenting and looking for the largest objects you can interact with and "pull" into your physics.

We'll do things to track time within our physics, too. A mechanical watch kept pressed against the skin, perhaps.

If we can get a mechanical typewriter working, that's great. With an abacus, a slide ruler, a mechanical calculator (if it works) and a mechanical typewriter, we're ready to get started living. First off, although the internet is right out, there's tons of reading to do. Take all the time you never had to read and learn literature, physics, philosophy, life sciences, and history. Go and see the sights. Do what you want.

Take time and read more. Get the equivalent of bachelor's degree level knowledge in all the fields you can think of, and go further in as many as you can. Become the impossible modern polymath. Learn to read and write in all the major languages, and ancient ones, too.

Read encyclopedias and textbooks. Learn indexing. Learn library science and paper organization methods.

Begin your career. Write. Write fiction and nonfiction and philosophy and art. Write science. Write your experiences.

Index everything carefully and present it well. Tables of contents, careful bookbinding, summary papers, documents, and even summary books will be important. If you want, start by translating texts and documents between Mandarin and English. Or just go where your mind takes you. Write a dozen books, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, write until everything has been said, and then some. Carefully catalog everything and make summaries. Make the diligent indexing nature of your work, the process, and the orderliness itself part of your nature. Know that when you lose your mind, you will lose it to order, not chaos. Decree that when you do imperceptibly go over to the madness, you preserve your early works.

Let your insanity be the insanity of right angles and catalog cards and preservation, rather than destruction.

All this learning, all this writing, it's the work of an entire life, more than entire life. You'll be an expert in every subject matter, and have written more than any human ever has. The task before you, the total cataloging and synthesis of humankind's knowledge, is monumental. None would dare even begin to try it alone, armed with only mechanical tools. This doesn't bother you, though.

You have all the time in the world.
