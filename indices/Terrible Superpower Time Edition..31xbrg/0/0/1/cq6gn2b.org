A laptop might be workable, but there's the matter of power requirements. How often are you going to need to change the battery? How many batteries and chargers are you going to need charging continuously in slow-time to keep your fast-time laptop going? Or would you transfer power via specialized hardware (laser system with safety cutouts etc)? What will the power draw be for that location? What will the cost of electricity be?

Comms... /should/ be feasible. If you were only writing plain text, and were a reasonably experienced typist (as you would most likely become), you'd be punching out maybe 5Kbps on the keyboard, 15-20Mbps slow-side. The problem is when your laptop comms chips are running 3600x as fast as the receiving corresponding chips outside the effect. You'd either need custom "slow" hardware plugged into the laptop, or you'd have to do all your communication via something like USB drive - upload your writing, plug it into a port on another machine, move until that machine is out of your effect. Assuming USB3.1 drives at 10Gbps, and assuming you can get half that rate as a transfer speed, the drive could still upload in slow-time a couple hundred times as fast as you could type in fast-time. That's plenty of wiggle room for adding in things which aren't just plain text.

In fact, your major bottleneck would be your internet speed. If you could set up a server which handled the store-and-forward aspects, and had Google Fiber speeds (~1Gbps), that would translate to you /effectively/ having at least a few hundred kilobit. Old ISDN speeds, more or less, and of course the lag for anything would be dozens of minutes to hours, but it would still be a viable communication channel, even if not exactly a real-time one from your perspective.

You could send and receive email, even if it took subjective years for people to respond. You could browse websites (probably with images switched off, a lot of filters active, and by massive prefetching and cache stuffing on the slow side, but it'd be /possible/), although you'd probably have to give up things like noodling idly through Imgur. Non-image-based subreddits should still be workable-if-slow in text mode, for instance. And you could preload all links in image-heavy subs and come back in a day or three.

You might never be able to communicate in person face to face with anyone ever again, but you could write, you could send and receive photos, and you might even be able to do the same with short videos if you were patient. Even so, it'd be like living in a frozen solitary confinement jail cell the size of the planet. I imagine you'd be able to temporarily pull small animals into the area effect (hopefully without damage going in or out), so you'd at least get to pet kittens and puppies if you wanted, but would the effect be large enough to encompass an entire additional human being?
