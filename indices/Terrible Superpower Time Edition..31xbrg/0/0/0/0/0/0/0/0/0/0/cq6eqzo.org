I've recently designed a similar computer tower for my local bio/ecology lab - the brief was "our software needs more cycles thrown at it". And it actually does need that, being bound by storage, io, memory, CPU, and GPU; it's the kind of hardware that you usually look at and decide there's never going to be a case where the marginal performance is worth the difference. Except when used for structure-from-motion processing of forest-scale image sets, and VR visualisation for the resulting data, that is.
