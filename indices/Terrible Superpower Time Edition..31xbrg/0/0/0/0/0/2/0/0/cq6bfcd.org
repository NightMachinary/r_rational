You don't need to build new chips. There already are chips that run fast enough. You just need to use different chips. You'll likely need to program them, giving a chicken-and-the-egg problem, but if we're doing long term you could just hire someone else to program them for you.

If you're already building your own keyboard, I don't think wiring it directly into the computer will be that much of an additional problem.
