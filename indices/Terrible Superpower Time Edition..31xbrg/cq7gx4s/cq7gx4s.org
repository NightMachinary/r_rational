Well, once you get past the obvious things, like finding a natural disaster and hauling people out of it... I would go somewhere quiet, somewhere away from people, and spend a few months appreciating the beauty of a still and silent world. Got to find something I can come to terms with living as, and I think a hermit would do just fine. First, work out a schedule. 1 day realtime = about 10 years your time, so find some people that can make a real difference/do cool things with the right information, and update them every decade. Hell, with all that time, you might as well pick your top 1000 and leave notes explaining the issue. Also, sleep is important, so try to kind of mimic regular sleep patterns. Also, loved ones. Write them notes, give them 60 seconds to respond, come back in a couple days. Remember, brevity. Learn how to read expressions and body language very well. Solve crimes. Bullets move at about 3.5 kph. Do as you see fit. You could go around for a while just finding people doing interesting things and helping them. And, of course, with effective immortality, you could make some really neat things. Cover entire cities in beautiful graffiti. Assassinate corrupt political figures. Build something that can fly.
