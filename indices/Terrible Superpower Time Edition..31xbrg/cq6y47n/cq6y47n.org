  So your power effects physics enough that nothing crazy happens there.

If what's happening to your body is, subjectively and from your perspective, 'nothing crazy', then something /quite extraordinarily/ crazy is in fact going on with the underlying physics. Differential time rates between observers without a substantial gravitational gradient or velocity difference is simply Not Allowed.

The question I'd be trying hardest to answer is: just what the /hell/ is going on with my body? How can it possibly be doing what it appears to be doing? What's the nature of the effect, what is its /boundary/? If I swallow a watch, does it start running 3600 times faster? Is gravity accelerating me downwards at 36,000 m/s/s? If so why don't I hit the ground with unfathomably horrific force from a twelve-inch jump, and if not why can't I [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28escape+velocity%29%2F3600][jump into orbit]]? If I spit, does my /saliva/ fall at ten meters per second per second or at thirty-six thousand m/s/s?

The prospect of running experiments with water clocks filled with my own excreta is not an appealing one, but I could easily see it being necessary.

  Is there a productive and "heroic" thing you can use this power for?

Ultimately, if you can figure out what makes you ageless and apply it to another person, you have just cured Death. And if you can figure out how to harness and manipulate the time-acceleration phenomenon that applies to you, you've just given mankind an almost unimaginably powerful technology.
