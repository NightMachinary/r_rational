If only my perceptions are sped up, then yes I can imagine going mad almost instantly. Being stuck in a body 3600 times slower than my mind would be intellectually excruciating. A single day would feel like almost ten years. Traveling across a street at a run would take subjective hours.

Worse, there'd be 3600 times less light with which to view everything... probably less given that visible light would hit my eyes with a frequency like deep radio and what few higher frequency emissions the sun produces, the atmosphere likes to block. Sound would be just as warped and diminished, frequency so low as to be inaudible. Deaf and blind, I'd be sense-limited to taste, smell, and touch. With the temporal difficulties I would find myself profoundly alone.

Speeding up my body only helps a little, since now my mass would be travelling with great momentum and my blind flailings would be terrifyingly destructive. If I can be destroyed, I would be, by any force for good and mercy the world could manage.
