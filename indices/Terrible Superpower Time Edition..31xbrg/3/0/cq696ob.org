You should still be able to see. The retina isn't sped up. The frequency of what effects the photosensitive molecule doesn't change. And I mean, for the sake of the story you have to assume the body accommodates basic sensory and motor stuff to remain mostly functional. (If not, you immediately die of hyperventilation)

Also, why would you /ever/ walk down a street? It's not like you urgently need to extend your life expectancy by exercising, it's already really long in subjective time. (If you must - sprint on a treadmill for 10 minutes and work simultaneously, you've got the motor coordination for it)

People will accommodate you once they know what you can do. Gadgets to make communication and writing keep up better with your faster motor control. Maybe you can talk to 1000 people simultaneously for company, it won't be the same but it's something, akin to getting several letters everyday in the mail.

Except for the extra lifespan, it wouldn't be as good as normal, but it wouldn't be hell either. I'd consider it. Maybe if I work hard enough I can speed up others too, I have lifespans to learn. It would not be fun in the short run but it would be for the greater good.

I imagine for a personality more quiet and introverted than mine it wouldn't be so bad at all.
