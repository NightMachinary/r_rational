The Dust itself answers the questions, and is essentially a lightly sarcastic oracle.

If you die, you go to the Afterlife, where you float as a ghost. You gradually fade away, losing memories and personality until you're not there. Heaven, hell, and everything else is a walled island, guarded by harpies. Lyra and Will visit the Afterlife by using the Knife to open a window in an area where a bunch of people died recently. The world of the afterlife is the same as the world of the living, no matter what world you're in, but it is only populated by the recently-departed. They find their way to a local dock, where a ferryman carries them across to the island. Daemons cannot ride on the dock, and the separation is painful.
