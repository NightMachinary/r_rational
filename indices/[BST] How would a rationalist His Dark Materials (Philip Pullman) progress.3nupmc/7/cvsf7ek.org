Hmm. Wasn't it possible for humans to become immortal angels somehow? That seems like a good idea.

I'm not sure if the Compass (I'm not typing it's name on my phone) actually ran on Pure Sapience or just asked a helpful Angel/devil questions. It's a pretty big distinction.

The afterlife is weird and doesn't make a lot of sense.
