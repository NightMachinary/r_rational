Some notes on The Subtle Knife:

- Two edges, one which is merely the sharpest knife in the worlds, and the other which cuts between worlds.
- The Subtle Knife invariably wounds its current master. Will loses some fingers.
- By the end of the series, the knife is broken, repaired, and broken.
- Cutting between worlds requires intense focus. Distractions can break the knife.
- The windows which the knife cut /are not flat/. They have a slight depth, which is a void that Dust leaks out of the universes through.

Some notes on Dust:

- Dust loss is Bad.
- Dust is produced through +love+ [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nupmc/bst_how_would_a_rationalist_his_dark_materials/cvsj2k1?context=2][consciousness]].
- All the worlds can produce enough Dust to leave one (1) window open and keep Dust levels in equilibrium.

Some notes on windows:

- Can be produced through a number of things, a list which is known to include the Subtle Knife, Lyra's father's apparatus, the Bomb's machinery, and natural occurrences.
- Anyone can be taught to feel the edge of a window.
- Windows have an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for resizing.
- Natural phenomena can pass through windows, like rain.
- I don't recall if wind passes through windows, or if air pressure differences were noticeable.

Some notes on denizens of the Universe:

- Angels exist, and can fly. They are not Dust.
- Humans from Lyra's world have daemons, who are physical manifestations of part of their soul. Humans from other worlds do not, but can be trained to see daemons. Witches from Lyra's world can see non-Lyra's-world humans' daemons. Daemons are generally not able to live away from their human, but there are solutions: training to stretch the bond, or cutting the bond with a special knife. Those so cut are ... different. Not in a good way.
- There are Lilliputians, who have trans-universe resonator fiddles that allow vibration-based communications.
- God exists, and is merely the first angel.
- If a being from one universe lives too long in another, without returning home, they will die.
- Will and Lyra are from different universes.

Some notes in general:

- This is not a happy series.
