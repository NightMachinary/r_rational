I read the books when I was eleven, and IMO it's definitely one of the best YA series there are. Anyway: was Dust drawn to sentient/sapient/conscious /individuals/ or /species/? If it's the first case, it could be used to determine whether brain-damaged patients are vegetative or locked-in/minimally conscious (but it could've been of no use in the universe of HDM - I don't remember if Dust was a cause for consciousness or a product of it - if it was the cause, I guess brain damage could be irrelevant).

The alethiometer was really vague since it replied with allegorical images - Mary Malone's computer was better for the purpose of communicating with Dust since it allowed conversation via text.

Also, if someone wrote a HPMOR-esque fanfic of HDM, I'd love them forever.
