The glowfic Milliways is... /descended/ from Hitchhiker's. But not all that similar. It is a bar, and it is at the end of (some) universe. But it's actually taken from a common conceit of sandbox livejournal RPs, where the door to Milliways can suddenly show up behind any door in any world at the whims of a capricious, inscrutable force, time passing in Milliways doesn't pass in the world you came from unless you hold the door open, and the bar is a (female) person and can generate an almost unlimited supply of nonmagical objects for sale. (First drink is free.)
