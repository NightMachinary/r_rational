I think it would be a cheap move to remove that restriction.

It's much more fun to find ways to work around it. For example, could Lyra have taught another (younger) child how to read the thing before she loses her 'innocence'?

You could even ask the alethiometer itself how to solve that problem. In canon, the alethiometer actually told a human scientist (through Lyra) how to make a computer program that works like an alethiometer. This opens the door for recursive improvement!

In addition, maybe the alethiometer has a mind of its own, and it could be possible to negotiate with it.
