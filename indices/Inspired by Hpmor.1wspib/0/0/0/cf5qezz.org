I don't remember. I'm on chapter 7 and mostly it seems to be moving slowly. Hermione seemed weirdly younger than him. There's not enough new happening, and Harrys thought process isn't different enough, or more like unique enough to make it too interesting. Like he went to Diagon Alley which was filled with way too much description, especially given that we've all read about it before. Then he had classes. I really can't understand his pursuit of mediocrity in the eyes of others. He also mentions bad bullying, but its never shown, not even with Draco. Mostly its try not enough unique stuff happens.
