Thanks for the update. I wanted to really explore the magical world from a different perspective at first to have fun with it, rather than change everything to make it unique. So I admit, it's not fast paced or extremely creative yet. Merely building up the world and characters to have it come crashing down with future conflict.

I probably should trim out a lot of the unneeded/wordy details and add more action instead of mentioning it, but I wanted to keep it light so far.

As for Harry, he's still unsure what's possible and the intentions of the people around him, but he's all for power and greatness, just so long as he doesn't draw too much attention achieving it. Living with his relatives and hiding his powers out of fear made him that way, although things are slowly changing.

Anyway, thanks for the input and if you keep reading I could always use more.
