Silly Catherine, she's too old to be your Squire!

If Abigail takes to Cat's teaching, I'll be surprised. The mind of Our Lady of the Blaze takes strange paths and, besides Black, no one sees the world quite like she does. She's a decent general but half of that is quick-thinking with enough military background to come up with almost workable plans, and the other half is madness that allows those plans to work anyway.
