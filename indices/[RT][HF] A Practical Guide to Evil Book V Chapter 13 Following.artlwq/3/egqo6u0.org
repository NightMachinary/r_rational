Can someone explain what, precisely, were drow needed for in this scheme? Catherine broke the river on her lonesome, and if she needed an appearance of an army to bait the charge, she could have used legionnaires. I distinctly remember three turtles being destroyed in the fire last chapter. If each of those is 50 people, 2/3 of them drow, that comes down to 100 dead drow to... What? Keep cat company while she did magic?

Why is Catherine wasting her heaviest hitters like that?

Why is Sve Noc going along with this murder of her people due to gross negligence?
