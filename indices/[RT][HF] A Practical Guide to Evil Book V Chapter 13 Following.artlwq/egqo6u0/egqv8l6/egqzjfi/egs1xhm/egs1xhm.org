I mean, in daytime sure. At night, Jindrich alone would wreck that entire force. The sheer ludicrous power of some of the mighty basically means that Cat's army is invincible at night to conventional forces (Minus dwarves or gnomes obviously), she basically has 30 odd lesser named following her around. Also, if she didn't have them following her, Ravin most definitely would have tried his luck at killing Cat then and there.
