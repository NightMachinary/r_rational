Cat has been bleeding friends for years now, things were bound to change and Abgail is perfect for the situation. A decent callowan soldier with decent morals, a knack for tactics, and one that don't think she should lead. A good recipe for a good general.

That aside, did Cat just initiate a pattern of three with Razin? God dammit Cat.
