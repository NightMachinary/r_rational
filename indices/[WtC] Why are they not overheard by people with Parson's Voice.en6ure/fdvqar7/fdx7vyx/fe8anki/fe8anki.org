  it's really easy to see how they would realistically be the only people with that sort of technique simply because Black wouldn't take no for an answer on making realtime cross-battlefield communication

I'm not sure I'd agree with this at all. Battlefield communication and coordination is one of those Big Obvious problems that soldiers/generals have been aware of and solving for... basically as long as there have been soldiers and generals.

There's a reason so much of the communication. technology we use was developed by/for the military, and what wasn't was quickly taken up.

Trying to solve that problem isn't particularly new or innovative, and solving it with magic is just... what would happen in /any/ competent military in a magical world.
