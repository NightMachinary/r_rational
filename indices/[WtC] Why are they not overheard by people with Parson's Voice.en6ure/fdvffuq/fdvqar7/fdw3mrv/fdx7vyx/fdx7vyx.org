I really like the offhand mention of the Calamities solution to battlefield communication in APGtE being little balls of silver implanted under the skin near the jaw/ears that Warlock basically enchanted into bone induction microphones. It only gets like 2 lines of discussion but it's really easy to see how they would realistically be the only people with that sort of technique simply because Black wouldn't take no for an answer on making realtime cross-battlefield communication happen and Warlock is exactly the sort of person who would come up with a solution like that. Actually taking advantage of magic to jump several hundred years ahead on the conventional tech tree instead of just finding new and more creative ways to blow the enemy up.
