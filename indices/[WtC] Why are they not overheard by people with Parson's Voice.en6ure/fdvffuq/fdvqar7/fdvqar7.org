Kinda interesting that you got stuck on this.

Parson's voice always struck me as saner "Worth The Candle" type of implementation of the old party chat trope found in LitRPG/The Gamer fics. (Oh I'm sure you can trace it - in some form - to a D&D sourcebook from before time or something. Let's not.)

As far as security goes, in gamer fics it's usually a power that's exclusive to the gamer.

/Hurr durr it's just like Discord/Teamspeak/Ventrillo/Xbox-voice video games./

In it's transition to Aerb, as a power that's available to anyone skilled in Skin magic, both the average reader and I'm guessing the author just kinda assumed that it works like Discord or Teamspeak or whatever and that was that. Because I do not remember the mechanisms for Parson's voice being explicitly explained. And in all honesty - not everything needs to be explained in excruciating detail. /It's party chat. Got it./ And so, this is probably where you're getting hung up on - you missed that little wink between the audience and the author.

Anyway [[/u/Hydroxxx]]'s explanation makes sense. There's some space for customising the tattoo to "tune-in the frequency".

I wonder if a hostile skin mage could steal one and just spend ten hours screaming into it, just like that griefing asshat on <your favourite video game with voice chat>.
