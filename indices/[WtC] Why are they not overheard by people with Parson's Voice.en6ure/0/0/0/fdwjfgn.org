They don't explicitly say frequency, but the first explicit mention of Parson's Voice in ch 110 compares them to walkie talkies, which generally do need to be set to the same frequency/channel. "Local network" in that context just means "every one else who is in the group". It's distinct from a channel, in that not everyone can join just by knowing the channel number.

It's not in the text, but the method for joining is to press two of the Parson's Voice tattoos, which will set them to be on the same "network", e.g. if A, B, and C are communicating with each other through Parson's Voice, D can gain access from either A, B, or C. It wasn't mentioned mostly because I hoped it would be clear enough without that, and including a line or two about its function might be taken as foreshadowing. It's secure, so long as you trust the other people not to share/give access.
