At the start it literally has no ability to spend any money. Attracting any human to it and writing "take X dollars in exchange for Y service" in slime will just end in the guy taking all of the dollars and start pimping out the intelligent snail. At least until it solves some big problem and starts slowly getting the right to program afterwards. Then it uploads a copy its mind, takes over the world and has flying drones connect the two of us.

If I don't catch it first that is.
