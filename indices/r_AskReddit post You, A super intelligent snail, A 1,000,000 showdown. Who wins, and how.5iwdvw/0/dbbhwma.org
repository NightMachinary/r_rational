If intelligence is all it has then it's screwed due to having no ability to make tools or ask others to make tools without, you know, showing people that it's a snail that can write shit or something.

So the question is, where's the snail relative to me at the beginning of this scenario? If it is anywhere near me it gets deposited in a black box which then gets encased in a "modern art" cement sculpture somewhere where I see it every day.
