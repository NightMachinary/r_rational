The game plan of keeping it away from me would be shooting it out into space on a capsule that had no features it could manipulate. Eventually me and the snail would leave each other's light cones and become inaccessible.

Now, it becomes a lot harder if you don't know where the snail is, because then you'd have to find it before you could send it on its journey.

Though the 'slowly crawls toward you' is a bit confusing. How is it superintelligent if its behavior is that simple? I guess it could be thinking about all kinds of other things but if all it /does/ is approach you then its intelligence is moot.
