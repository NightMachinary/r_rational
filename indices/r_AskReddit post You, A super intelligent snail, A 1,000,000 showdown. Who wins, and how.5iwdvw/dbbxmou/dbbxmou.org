...Both? Cooperation is the ideal state, here. You don't pose much more of a threat to the snail than every other human, you just have more of a motive. Presumably, you also know about the snail; it will have the easiest time convincing YOU that it's super-intelligent.

But really, insufficient information. Do (either of) you age? Does the snail actually WANT to kill you? Can it do something other than crawl towards you? What does super intelligence mean? Can YOU do something to end the snail?
