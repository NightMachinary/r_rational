If you can trap it long enough to fund a sun impact probe project (which is actually a trap the snail in the sun machine, but sun impact probe is more likely to convince people to help) and while I want to put it on an impact trajectory, you will naturally tell people it's just to see what happens as things approach the sun and you don't expect anything to impact, which should make you sound less mad. It will probably never escape the sun's gravity, and if it does then it'll be floating in space with no means of propulsion.

Putting it in space would likely be enough in and of itself, but when it comes to immortality there's no such thing as too much.

Oh and you obviously encase it in concrete in the meantime.

The fact our snail is intelligent actually doesn't help it much, snails lack the anatomy for tool use, tool making and effective communication (I guess it could try writing with a slime trail, but that's very slow).
