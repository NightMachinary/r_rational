That was my answer in the thread, as well. You ought to see whether you and the snail can cut a deal first, clearly.

Of course this depends on the level of intelligence, like you said. A negotiation will go very differently with average Joe the talking snail who just got a million dollars than with a terrifying paperclipper AI style hunter-seeker snail with memetic powers. (Did I just type that?)
