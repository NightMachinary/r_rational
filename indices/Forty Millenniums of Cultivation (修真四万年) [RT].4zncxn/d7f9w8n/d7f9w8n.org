At 1300 chapters, has the author dragged the story on like so many others? And isit nearing its end or still a long way to go till it finishes? How's the romance? And how difficult is the chinese? I can read chinese so i feel abit like reading it. After all, I saw in one of your comments that you read cultivation chat group, and as a raw reader of that i can say very rationally that you have very good taste.
