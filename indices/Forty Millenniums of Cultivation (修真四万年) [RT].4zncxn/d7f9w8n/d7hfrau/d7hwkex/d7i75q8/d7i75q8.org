Oh, sorry.

I think I addressed how difficult the chinese was in another post, but, really, the best benchmark is to give it a read yourself and see how comfortable you are with the story. The link's right there in the post, after all.

The romance isn't a huge deal. It's pretty solidly written and the characters are quite three-dimensional, but love isn't what I'd call a major draw of this story. You won't find drama or misunderstandings or romantic conflict or love triangles in this story; the author devotes their energy to other sources of conflict.

One good thing about the protagonist's love relationship is that you can really tell the author is trying his damned hardest to stay away from the 'powerful man earns love by casually protecting helpless damsel' trope which is unfortunately prevalent in xianxia. This love interest has her own life and motivations, and isn't just an accessory to round out the protagonist's self-insert wish fantasy like so many other romantic interests are.
