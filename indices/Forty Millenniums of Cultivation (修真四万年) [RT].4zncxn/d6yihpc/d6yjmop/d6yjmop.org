Oh, the 40k in this is /real/. The primary weapons of the human military are /by name/ the chainsword and bolter, and part of the backstory includes an "Emperor" who formed twenty "Primary Sects" but was ultimately betrayed by his most favored son, and forced to retreat to a sealed pocket reality in a state halfway between living and dead.

(And legends say that the man who finds the lost Emperor's sealed reality will inherit all his techniques and manuals and powers, and become a new Emperor for the new age...)

However, so far, all of this seems quite irrelevant to the actual plot, and mostly seems to be textual reference that the author stuck in because they liked WH40k's worldbuilding. (If the story DOES turn out to just be an overblown warhammer fanfiction, I will admit that I'd be /pretty/ disappointed.)

E: Also, I have never been to [[/r/noveltranslations][r/noveltranslations]] before! Didn't even know there /was/ a centralized place for all this stuff.
