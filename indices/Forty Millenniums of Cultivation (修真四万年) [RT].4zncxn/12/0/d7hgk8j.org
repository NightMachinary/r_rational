I personally find this novel quite easy to read, but I'm a native chinese speaker, so my subjective experience probably isn't exactly representational. (That, and I don't really have any experience with what level of reading comprehension 3rd year college chinese represents.)

The story definitely isn't shakespearean in linguistic sophistication, though; the characters speak with modern chinese internet slang to reinforce the central setting theme of 'a rational magic-using culture that's adapted to the modern age'.

The author also loves coining neologisms that combine real-life STEM/engineering terms with traditional xianxia/taoist-mysticist terminology to create entirely new words- again, to reinforce that 'magic in the age of science' feel the story has. Depending on how familiar you are with physics/chemistry/mathematics terms in chinese, this may or may not be difficult for you.

As an example, the protagonist talks about Dyson Spheres in this setting and wonders if their civilization could eventually aspire to the construction of one- but in this setting, the concept of a circumstellar energy-harvesting device is known as a Pangu Sphere (named after the mythological world-creating figure in taoist mythology who divided the earth from the heavens).

Because obviously Freeman Dyson doesn't exist in this story's setting.

Other similar examples include the renaming of the Pythagorean Theorem after a fictional historical Cultivator who invented the mathematical theorem, the renaming of the unit of measurement 'Newton' after a different historical figure, etc.

The author even writes in a segment where the protagonist freaks out when he realizes that the 'Galactic Standard' he speaks is identical to modern chinese, which should have been impossible since modern chinese has since adapted some loanwords from other languages. (This eventually became a plot point of the overall story.) This particular segment depends on one's familiarity with modern chinese diction, obviously.

(If you do decide to read the story, feel free to bother me if you don't know what a particular segment really means! I'd love to be able to talk with lots more people about this story.)
