Aw, that's a shame. (Fun fact: this story actually has a lot of references to Three Body Problem built into it, too- the repeated symbol of the 'dark forest' and 'chain of suspicion' were lifted directly from Three Body, according to the author of Cultivation40k- and both stories deal with extremely similar themes!)

...Maybe when I finally buckle down and get going with that translation I want to do.
