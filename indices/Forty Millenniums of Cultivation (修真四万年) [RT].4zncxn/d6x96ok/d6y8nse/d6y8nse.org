I might just in fact do the 'translate a few chapters to gauge interest' thing, but I might not pick the first few chapters for that, because the first few chapters are still somewhat fixed in the traditional mold. The story takes a while to get going, and it doesn't begin to introduce the 'enlightened self-interest vs. regular old self-interest' themes until the end of the prologue, which is around chapter 90.

The story begins with a schoolyard bully arc welded together with 'the protagonist applies to kung-fu college', most of which is worldbuilding setup. HPMOR had the advantage that its readers were likely already familiar with the Potterverse; this story had to take a bunch of chapters to explain what it was subverting before it could go and subvert it.

(The story has a little bit of early-installment weirdness going on, which is reasonable when you consider that the author basically posts two chapters a day with probably literally no time to edit whatsoever. The real thematically juicy stuff starts showing up around chapter 90 and only gets juicier and juicier from there on out.)
