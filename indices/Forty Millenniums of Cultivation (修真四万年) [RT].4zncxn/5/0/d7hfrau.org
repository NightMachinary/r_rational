I definitely wouldn't say the author has dragged the story on a lot at all! I've read some /awful/ stories where the story clearly has no long-term meaning. This story definitely reads like it has a powerful ending that's been planned from the get-go, and generally speaking all the major plot arcs have progressed the story towards that ending.

I know exactly what kind of story you're talking about with xianxia- there's a ton of xianxia stories that just meander around from place to place, not really accomplishing anything, running the same hamster wheel over and over at increasingly large diameters. This story most certainly does /not/ suffer from that particular ailment.
