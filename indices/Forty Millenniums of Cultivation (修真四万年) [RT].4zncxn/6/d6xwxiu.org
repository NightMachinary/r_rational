Sounds very nice, I would love to read it)

Speaking of xianxia, have you read "[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/my-disciple-died-yet-again/][My Disciple Died Yet Again]]"? It's a genre deconstruction novel that follows most of the common tropes yet lampshades and explains their many faults. It also has an adorable protagonist, good comedy and a very nice english translation)
