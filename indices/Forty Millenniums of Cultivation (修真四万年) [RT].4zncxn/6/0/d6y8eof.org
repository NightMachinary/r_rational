Yep! Finished it a while back.

My primary criticism of it would seem to be that the ending doesn't provide a strong answer to the question posed; it's not quite a deus-ex-machina everyone-lives-happily-ever-after ending, but it definitely veered in that direction just a little at the end. Otherwise, it was a pretty great Xianxia novel!
