Wow, You do a good job selling the story to me. I'm going to give it a read. You hit every thing I don't like about the Xianxia genre, but it sounds like FMoC deals with them in ways I enjoy.

If you decide to translate it, feel free to PM me if you want help. I'm fairly busy, and I haven't done big translation projects before, but I wouldn't mind helping out, especially if I get into the story.

It also might help to translate the first couple of chapters to see if the English speaking rational fans like it, as I'm not sure how many people can read Chinese in this subreddit. And its hard to tell just from a blurb if people will like it or not.
