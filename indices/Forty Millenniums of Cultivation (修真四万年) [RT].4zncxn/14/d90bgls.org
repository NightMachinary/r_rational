Hey, I hope I'm not being rude by asking this, but are you, by any chance, translating a few sample chapters of this like you mentioned [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4_rt/d6y8nse][here]]?

If you don't have the time, ability, or energy to translate it, have you considered recommending it to sites that translate wuxia novels as a new project? The only one I found with a five-minute Google search which seems reliable and high-quality is [[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/][WuxiaWorld]]. But maybe you know of a better site?

I'm just really hopeful about this being translated sometime in my lifetime without needing to learn Chinese to read it.

EDIT: NEVER MIND! I /just/ checked on [[/r/noveltranslations]] and found that someone started translating it. Is it you posting it to [[https://friendshipispower.wordpress.com/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation-chapters/][here]]? I'll put up a post about it on this subreddit.
