I'm at 693 in the raws by using MTL, and have yet to see any giant mecha. A ton of powered suits (2-2.5 meters), and a bit of disposable additional armor for the powered suits that make them into large mecha. (3-4 meters)

And a lot of plots within plots with backup plots, executed by both the MC and antagonists. Which I really do enjoy, but occasionally wish were less wordy, since there are limits with MTL as to how clear their discussions are. MC is constantly hiding his power level (metaphorically, almost everyone is doing so literally).

The "Who/what are you?" line followed up with his response of a pause, then "Actually, I'm a good person." was one of the funniest lines I've read recently.
