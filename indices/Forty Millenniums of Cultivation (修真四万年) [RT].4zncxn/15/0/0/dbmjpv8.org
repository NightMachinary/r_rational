There's definitely humor in the other Chinese web novels I've been reading, but that just struck me as one of the funniest lines I've seen lately.

It was like the "Nice bird, asshole!" line from the Lies of Locke Lamora, something that without context and buildup wouldn't be too funny, but with those, becomes absolutely hilarious.

I'm at 713 right now, and curious as to whether the space pirate king will become an ally or just be an "enemy of my enemy". He's only just been introduced, but seems pretty cool.
