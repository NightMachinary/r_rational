Yeah, you're right- it's all 2-4 meter powered armor until, um, around chapter 1300-ish, which is where they start piloting properly giant mechas. While wearing their powered armor. Y'know, the ol' Gurren Lagann thing.

And, yeah, this protagonist is fucking hilarious and I wish more protagonists were like that.
