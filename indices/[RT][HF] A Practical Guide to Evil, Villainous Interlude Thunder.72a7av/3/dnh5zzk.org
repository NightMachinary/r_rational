Not sure why everyone's so certain Anaxares is on the side of Evil. He really doesn't seem to care for either side (he certainly doesn't like Kairos), and we do have examples of Names that are "grey". +I also thought Bellerophon was nominally Good, though I could be wrong about that.+ Especially with his Mend aspect, I see Anaxares as very not-Evil.
