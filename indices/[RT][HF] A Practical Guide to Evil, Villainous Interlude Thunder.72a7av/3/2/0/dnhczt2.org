I also thought that. But unless the real story is about a truly radical shift in the setting cosmos, the Name of Grey Knight doesn't exist.

Cat will come into an existing name (theoretically the Black Knight, presumably something unexpected) unless she does something like burn down Heaven and Hell, or create a new Role by altering society.

It depends on how big the story gets. I hope it doesn't overreach like I felt Worm did.
