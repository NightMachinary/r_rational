Hierarch is the leader of the free cities which iirc have an ongoing divide between Good and Evil. The leader being neutral on the topic would make a lot of sense, as Evil men leading Good polities or vice versa doesn't sound like a long-term solution.

Then again, the first Hierarch was also the last until Anaxares stepped up.
