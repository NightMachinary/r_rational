Ooooooooooh, nice thanks, so the sigue is basically done since Hierarch is here, the tyrant can turn his attention somewhere else, and having Hierarch as one of his general would mean waging war against him would be making war in all the free cities, man I love this plan.

Would the tyrant have to submit his will to the Hierarch?.
