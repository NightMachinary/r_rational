  “No no no,” the Tyrant said. “You're looking at it all wrong. Even if my pretty little mages had been untroubled, the Beast would have survived. The Healer should have too, life split in half with her sister. A touching story of sisterly love, if you care for that sort of thing. She didn't because she was a sacrifice. Her weight was stolen, because there was another use for it. With nothing you can only trade for nothing.”

She should have surived but didn't cause she was a sacrifice for... what? It can't be for Anaraxes ascesion cause he's alligned with evil.
