I'm not sure what the tyrant's game is.

He's terrifying and seems to always be winning....

But I have to believe that every dread emperor was like this, before Malicia. The name of Tyrant is designed with a definite arc and it doesn't end well for the Tyrant.

The Tyrant seems crazy and unconventional... But that's what makes him conventional. He's a flying fortress crazy emperor. He is setting up the heirarch to kill him, and his lack of longevity is making him more nihilistic, but he's not a threat the way the calamities are.

He thinks he's got the Calamities and Bard all figured out... But why should we take his word for it? Every Tyrant knows that their days are numbered by their names. This Tyrant is only different in that he was going to die any way.

I guess that's why Bard isn't worried about the Tyrant, because the Tyrant won't break the story... Rather he is the pressure release of all of the Capital E evil that Praes hasn't been doing for 20 years.
