I... need to reread this chapter. And maybe a few of the previous ones with Tyrant. I can't tell if he's crazy-sane (as in, he's totally nuts on the ground but has a clear view of the "big picture") or just completely biased like all good Tyrants seem to be. I really don't know what to make of this chapter, but it sure sounded interesting!

- *Mend* is obviously one of Hierarch's aspects, but it feels like he failed to use it when it was mentioned? I'm not even sure what kind of mending could happen, because it sounds like a very rift within the fabric of his society.

- Tyrant obviously sees at least part of Black as he truly is - the wheels and cogs. Think he sees it right about how Black incorrectly views himself, and how he'll react as the Calamities start to die?

More later as I think of them or reread...
