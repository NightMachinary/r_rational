The use of *Mend* seems paradoxical, though I suspect he used it inadvertently on himself. The laws were broken, and *Mend* should fix things so the laws so they are not broken AKA making Anaxares the Hierarch. However, Anaxares has to be named to use an aspect so he is already the Hierarch. What it did was allow him to accept that he was the Hierarch. Additionally, it may have caused the other ruling members to outlaw his suicide / death so that Bellerophon is whole.

Random thought, I wonder if Bellerophon is a name derived from Isabella the Mad, though it would make more sense if she was the first Hierarch and she was not. However, I could totally also see the first Hierarch picking a random crazy lady out of the crowd to be a military leader / namesake of the nation.
