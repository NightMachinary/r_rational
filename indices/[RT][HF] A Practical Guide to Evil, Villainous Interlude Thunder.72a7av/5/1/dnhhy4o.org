That wouldn't make that much sense would it? i mean, Anaraxes is alligned with evil, the ash priestess with good. And the two maintain some sort of balance. it be weird if you can sacrifice heroes to get new villains.

Unless Anaraxes now proceeds to be good. (technically, the name doesn't seem inherently evil)
