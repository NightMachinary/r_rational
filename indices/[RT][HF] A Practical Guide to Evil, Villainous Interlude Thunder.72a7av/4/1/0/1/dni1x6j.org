Black and his crew don't have to be a threat to "Good always wins". If Good and Evil are constrained to narratives that fit within civilization instead of breaking down into endless warfare, Black and crew have won. Ex: If a Good campaign to is to run for President instead of raising an army in revolt to overthrow the government, or an Evil plot is to become Vizier by manipulating votes, stay in power by manipulating votes, and be deposed by a Hero touting election reform, Black's won.
