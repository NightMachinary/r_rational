That's what I'm saying. The Tyrant of Helike doesn't threaten "good always wins" because he's mustache twirling evil of the old Praesi style. The Story can make one of his name powers fail at a crucial time or just remove him.

Black and crew are a threat to good always wins because they are using institutions instead of names. He is still more of a threat to the Bard than the Tyrant.
