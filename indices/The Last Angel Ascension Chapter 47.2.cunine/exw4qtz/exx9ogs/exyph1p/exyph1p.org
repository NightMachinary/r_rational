I would highly recommend starting with the first, as the second is a direct continuation of the first, so without it you're missing some significant context. That said, the author did make some efforts to make the second readable without context by subtly reintroducing characters and major concepts, but I'd still read the first.

I mean, the first is a fantastic read as it is, as it gears up from creeping horror to full on space opera.
