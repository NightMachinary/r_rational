It's only sort-of Mary Sue - the writers do have self-insert characters in the universe, but they're C-listers (or maybe D-listers), with either minor superpowers (just enough to justify them being at a super-academy) or serious downsides/problems. They don't tend to affect - or even show up in - the main storylines.

The characters in question also do not hold much influence in-universe: they're not teachers, or faculty, or heads of student groups, or aware of their nature as self-inserts. And given that it's the kind of universe which has a cast of thousands (or at least hundreds), they're not even mentioned in 98% of the many, many stories generated by the writing group/team that makes up the Whateley authors.
