I think that the biggest thing that you're forgetting - and rightfully so, as that's what Erratic is trying to do - is that it's NOT /just/ Cat. Cat doesn't /have/ to overcome a dozen heroes with demi-god tier backup. She has people for that. In fact, that's pretty much all of the previous chapter have been building up to in the background - Cat now has people she can trust to actually do things/be competent.

So no, I don't think Cat can overcome a dozen heroes + Grey Pilbitch + Saint Cunt just with skills and smarts. But I think Cat, Adjutant Hakram, Juniper, Nauk, Robber, Vivienne, Masego, and the ARMY OF CALLOW can overcome them.
