this is a clever writing trick that is brilliant but skirts very very close to the sort of despair you're feeling right now.

Cat has allies. The end of the chapter pits her against extreme odds and you think "well that seems pretty impossible to beat". But she has the entirety of the woe behind her. Thief, archer, Zeze and Hakram are all currently doing other important things, slowly setting the stage. Not to mention robber and his band.

Black, Malicia, the tyrant and ranger are all wild cards who all have varying motives that /might/ convince them to help her in different places.

Remember that cat also has a huge story advantage and the holy war has mostly been reduced to being an invasion by the terms with the pilgrim. Cat has yet to use the "absolute positioning" trick and goblinfire. There are still many unused cards that she can play. The author deliberately drives your attention away from them, which is a great story trick to build up suspense. Unspoken plan guarantee is in full effect.
