I don't think I agree. It's possible that Cat will do something Pyrrhic and fuck over Callow again, but that seems more the type of thing to happen at the climax of the arc. All I see happening right now is a typical end-of-chapter cliffhanger where our protagonist faces seemingly insurmountable odds. It's a normal story trope. It doesn't mean she's not going to use skill and smarts to overcome this challenge.
