Man that last paragraph, I could /feel/ the despair at her effort getting completely invalidated. Erraticerrata brilliantly toes the "only the author can save them now" line by making us temporarily forget about all the secret plans and powerful people on Cat's side, just for a moment.

Also that conversation with Zeze feels like it's foreshadowing some super important stuff, like the "end" of the great debate of the gods... will creation unravel if/when it happens? Also foreshadowing potential pantheon woe replacing the old gods?
