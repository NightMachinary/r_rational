Yeah, that's why I think it it happened at all it would have to be at a climax of the arc. Cat's not going to casually abandon her new ideals over some skirmish. Resorting to a Foundling Gambit would be a /big deal/ because it would mean the failure of the objectives she laid out earlier in this arc. I think she's going to be tested on this in a serious way at a proper plot-fulcrum moment--then and only then will she be confronted with a really compelling temptation to burn everything down to eke out a win. Hopefully she'll pass that test.
