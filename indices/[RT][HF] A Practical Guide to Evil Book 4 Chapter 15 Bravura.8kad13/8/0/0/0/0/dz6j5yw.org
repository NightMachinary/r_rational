I think the biggest argument against Cat doing a Pyrrhic Victory is that she is /actively/ fighting against that. Her outlook upon battle has changed, and we've seen her ideals shift from a "no matter the costs"/"Justification is for the just" to wanting to stop the bloodshed and destruction of her country.

It might be a little too literal, but I think Cat truly does believe what she said to Juniper before - she's sick and weary of the costs of war. It's because of this that I think that she'll not pull another "Foundling Gambit" and instead rely upon her gathered allies and their plans to pull her through.

Although, the story just wouldn't be the same if Cat just all of a sudden gave up her impulsive nature, or her personal battles. After all, Named fights are the realms of near demi-gods.

As a side note, has anyone else noticed how much Cat has grown from the impulsive girl in the beginning? I just re-read through the entire series, and I am SERIOUSLY impressed about how much growth she's shown as a character. It makes sense when she's been thrown through the ringer for the past years, but for a girl of 18, almost 19, she's had to become so mature. Grey Pilgrim was right about that, she is a casualty of war - be it God's War, or just the war on creation.
