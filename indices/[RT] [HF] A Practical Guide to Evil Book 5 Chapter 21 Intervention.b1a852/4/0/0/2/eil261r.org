It's not like the bulk of the cavalry and officers could recognize her at that distance. Especially when you're busy keeping yourself on your charging horse and have your vision restricted by a helmet.

- I did some archery in college, so I know how hard it is to see details even at 50 meters. 500 meters away? Even with my spectacles on, a car looks like a toy. No way to recognize any details.
