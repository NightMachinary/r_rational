I still think that most reasonable people would interpret what they see as a vulture or some large bird and forget about it. At least until they get closer and have some reason to look again. But at that time, would Zombie's wings still be visible?

And don't forget that they are cavalry in formation. So only the front row have any kind of vision. Furthermore, you can't easily stop a formation, even if you are the ranking officer.
