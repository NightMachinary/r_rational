The question was never "will Cat be able to turn back this cavalry charge?". It was "What's her plan to turn back this cavalry charge, and how does it showcase who she is and how she's grown?"

​

In this case, the answer was "play into the narrative - not the one the world's watching, the one that gives weight to Names and lets a Callowan orphan draw a sword from a stone, but the one that's playing out in the heads of every horseman charging right now."

​

Cat is no longer the underdog, the one that has to *prove* she's scary. She's moving too fast for the slow course of Fate, out of the grooves worn by her predecessors. Instead, she's using the stories in the minds of her enemies and allies, laying down new cultural precedent through trickery.
