The way I see it, a name is not just something gods grant some people. It doesn't define you, you define it. It's a reflection of what you are, at your very core.

Vivienne saw that she was no longer acting as a Thief, no longer thinking as a Thief. She changed and the name no longer suited her. In the same vein, Cat became a queen and broke away from the Black Knight. She is no longer a his Squire, or anyone else. Be it in title, in actions or in personality.

They have the potential for a new name and will probably awaken one, specially now that Callow is free and they are from there. I just worry there is not that much of the story left to tell those tales properly.
