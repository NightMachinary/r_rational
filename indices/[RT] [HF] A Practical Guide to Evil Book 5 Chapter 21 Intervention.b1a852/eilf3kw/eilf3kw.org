Now that I think about it, it kinda makes sense that Cat and Vivienne are no longer Named.

I always kinda took being Named to mean that you help a conviction in something that would not ever change.\\
Basically, I thought they needed to be insane over something really specific to their names that they could never compromise over.

And basically the whole of Vol 4 was Cat learning to compromise.

I do realize that this probably has some holes to it, but I like it.
