Cat's well being, as far as she was concerned, was not in any realistic doubt; she may not be able to take on 7,000 horse but that's not the same as her realistically being unable to retreat if need be. If you're saying that it's normal to feel doubt because it's hard to think clearly when 7,000 horse are running at you then sure. That doesn't create any tension though for the reader who can look at the situation more dispassionately and see that the horse are going to stop unless their commander is holding the idiot ball.

Sure, but this was a non magical named getting hit by an arrow. Apart from Cat being on a whole other tier (and Procer along with very soldier in their army /knowing/ this) and able to drop lakes on armies still as far as they know, there is a big difference between a zero risk pot shot with an arrow and the 'likely sending 7000 cavalry to their death' gambit.

Do you think the Proceran army would have informed all their officers of note of the Black Queens capabilities? Do you think charging the Black Queen without heroic assistance would be an approved course of action or one that anyone informed of her capabilities would do?
