If i'm going to work from the baseline that the PGtE world is internally coherent then i can only presume that this was due to the soldiers charging the Black Queen being from the Dominion and thus the commanding officer didn't know what she was capable of. If you know someone can drop lakes on armies (afaik the fact she (probably) cannot do this anymore is not known to any of her potential enemies) you do not charge them unless you're holding the Idiot Ball.
