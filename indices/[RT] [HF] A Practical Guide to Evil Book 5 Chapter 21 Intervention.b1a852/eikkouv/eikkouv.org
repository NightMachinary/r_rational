I didn't really buy that there was a significant risk of Procer, who are quite familiar with the Black Queen, throwing 7,000 cavalry at her. Seems like it would be standard procedure to not engage powerful Named without heroic assistance - any army doing otherwise wouldn't last long. I'd expect that this army in particular would be informed to not assault the Black Queen specifically, unless they have heroic assistance.

You see the Black Queen, you turn around, you go grab Pilgrim and Saint to deal with her and then you proceed from there. This may well be what happens but the will they/wont they tension (and subsequent Cat's a badass vibe) didn't really connect for me.
