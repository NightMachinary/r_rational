Mh, anytime I throw away litter instead of, well littering I give myself a pat on the shoulder for cooperating.

Anytime you use beeminder or leechblock you precommit to stuff.

I play a lot of boardgames and every so often you will find someone who is willing to reap the C rewards for not waging war against each other. Of course unfortunately most boardgames have a single person win condition, so this makes this especially hard, yet the more satisfying.

In Boardgames you also see applied iterated PDs all the time; someone defected spectacularly by performing an epic backstab, breaking a non-agression pact? For months nobody would trust that person again with any pacts.

I try to reward people who C in boardgames.
