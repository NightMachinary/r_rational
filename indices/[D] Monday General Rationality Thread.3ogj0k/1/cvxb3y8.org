I think I may have fallen victim to the planning fallacy, and want some advice to recover from it before I end up homeless and destitute on the streets of Tacoma.

Some background: I'm from a small town in upstate NY, and had been getting really sick of the place. My roommate and I decided we wanted to go out west and started making plans. We paid for bus tickets, and the first month of a two month planned stay at a converted bus supplied by AirBnB. Then we started saving. By the time we were ready to leave (Sept 28th) we had amassed about 1600 dollars in savings, which would pay for the second month's rent as well as food and transportation and other assorted expenses during the trip and subsequent job hunting period.

We've now been in Tacoma for a little over a week, and have put in over 30 resumes each in that time period. We've gotten callbacks for interviews and I'm optimistic about mine, but I don't want to bet too heavily on it working out because I really really do not want to be homeless in Tacoma in December.

Now here's the worry, while discussing the planning fallacy with my roommate, it occurred to us to look at how long we were between jobs the last time we were looking for work (him: 4 months and me: 6 months). He'd put in five applications a week during that time. The planning fallacy tells you to look in very broad strokes at how long it took you before, and the answer we get is "Way longer then we have." Not only this, but once homeless, our hiring chances drop even further since we have no safe places to sleep or store our things.

I'm looking at ways of avoiding a catastrophe. During his 4 month period without work, my roommate was averaging 5 job applications per week. If we increase that number to 20 per week, it should help, but do those sorts of details also fall prey to the planning fallacy? there are also way, way more jobs around here then there were in my hometown, but that seems like exactly the sort of details that the planning fallacy tells you to pay no attention to.

I try to be as forward thinking and rational and proactive as possible. What sort of steps should I be taking /now/ while I still have a month and a half buffer, to avoid ending up homeless when our deadline to move out of our AirBnB housing hits?
