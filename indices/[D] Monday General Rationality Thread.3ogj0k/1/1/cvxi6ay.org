if the last time you guys were looking for jobs your werent picky(i.e. didn't skip lots of jobs because they sounded bad\didn't accept because the pay was low) than assuming your old city and new city are with similar jobs offerings you are probably right in that it is very possible you won't get a job by the time you need.

the question is how expensive is your current rented bus? are there cheaper alternatives? you may be able to scrape up enough money with self employment. for example by making sandwiches and selling them, or other such jobs were basically the pay is for some simple work and requires very minimal investment. it probably won't make you too much money, but it may be enough to let you last till you do land a job.
