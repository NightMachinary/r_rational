  if the last time you guys were looking for jobs your werent picky(i.e. didn't skip lots of jobs because they sounded bad\didn't accept because the pay was low) than assuming your old city and new city are with similar jobs offerings you are probably right in that it is very possible you won't get a job by the time you need.

Our new city has a lot more people, businesses, and thus hopefully, employment opportunities. I'm not sure how much of a compensatory effect that will have though, or how I could go about modelling it in terms of probability of employment.
