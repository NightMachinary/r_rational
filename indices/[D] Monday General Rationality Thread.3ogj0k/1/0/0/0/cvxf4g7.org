Alright. Then as absolutely crappy as minimum wage jobs in the US are, I recommend you start pursuing even jobs that are absolutely awful. If you become homeless, getting a job becomes harder. A lot harder. Or you may already be doing this, I don't know. Your original comment obviously doesn't go into all the details.

Also spend some time looking for ways to actively save money. Is there a soup kitchen you can go to? A place where you can fill up on free water? Make sure there is always food at home so you never get hunger nauseous enough that you say fuck it and buy ready made food/eat out. Hunger nausea is vicious.

I have always hated it when I've been unemployed and my mother has been like a broken record telling me things I already know, because it felt like she thought I was an idiot who couldn't figure basic things out for myself, but you asked for advice, so hopefully not everything I say is rehashing something you already took for granted.

It might be worth asking your mother's friend, just so you know one way or the other. If it's flatly impossible, best not to have false hope. If not, it might be an option even before it reaches an emergency.
