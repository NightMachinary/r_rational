Alright, so, this won't work often, but it /can/ work. Some few places, it pays to write an email after a week or two and politely ask if they have reached a decision. Obviously if they have said in their recruitment post that they will get back to you/start processing applications by a certain date, you should wait as appropriate. But for some reason there are people out there who think that if you contact them a second time, tht means you are more 'keen' on the job.
