There really isn't a fallback plan. My parents told me years ago they wouldn't let me move back in, even if they weren't all the way back on the easy coast, and my roommate's parents are currently in the process of moving to Germany for jobs. We won't have enough money at the end of the period to afford emergency bus tickets to anywhere further away then maaybe Portland. My mum has a friend there who might let us stay with her, but I haven't asked yet and I've no idea if she has the space for us. I don't know anyone around here so I can't crash on someone's couch.
