I don't know of anything which matches exactly to 3d plots over 2d spaces in python; if I was trying to display generic data over 2d spaces like that in Python, I'd be using [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369492/generate-a-heatmap-in-matplotlib-using-a-scatter-data-set][heat maps of one sort or another from matplotlib]] to view it, or I'd be tempted to move to Matlab which has great plotting 3d functionality built-in (I think that the free equivalent Octave has similar functionality also). If you specifically need Python 3d plots for whatever reason then I don't know. Best of luck.
