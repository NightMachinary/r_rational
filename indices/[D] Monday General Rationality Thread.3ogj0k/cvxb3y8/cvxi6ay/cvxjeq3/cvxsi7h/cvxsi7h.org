Sorry if this sounds like the exact same advice as everyone else here, but the absolute basic thing to do is to make applying for jobs into a job of itself.

Wake up at 7 in the morning, get ready for "work", and sit down at your desk by 7:30 and start looking for applications. At 9:00 break for 15 minutes and then start filling out and submitting all of the applications you have gathered so far. At 12:00, break for lunch, and then start e-mailing back prior jobs you applied for to check if they have accepted you or not. At 3:00, start planning for upcoming interviews and other ways you can make yourself a better candidate. At 5:00, make detailed notes on what you got done and what you need to do next tomorrow.

This is just a random schedule I made up for a day when you have nothing you need to go out for. I once stuck to a routine like this when I needed a job for the summer and it was in May. I churned out like 50 applications in 2 weeks and got a job within that time period. I felt like dying of boredom by the end though.

Addition advice is to start being a miser with your money like using as little electricity as possible, cook only cheap groceries, use public services like the library's computers to save on Internet bill, and so on.

Good luck!
