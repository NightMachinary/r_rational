I actually spent a great deal of time a while back looking into online work, because the idea of working from a home office appealed to me (still does), however, after a ton of digging, I wasn't actually able to find any real legitimate online work.

I think most people working from home must start working in an office and once established they're allowed to take their work home with them. I couldn't find anything like an outsourced call center position or anything like that. Lots of pyramid schemes. All the pyramid schemes. Such triangle, very pyramid, wow.
