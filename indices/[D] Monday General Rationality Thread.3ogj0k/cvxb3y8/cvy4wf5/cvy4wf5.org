What about applying for jobs that don't require you to be in a specific geographic location? I haven't applied for online work, so I'd imagine that there's a risk of some questionable work like being a spammer or some other crap low-end survey-completer... but maybe you could do some online training and be a telephone IT consultant or something... ?
