  Alright. Then as absolutely crappy as minimum wage jobs in the US are, I recommend you start pursuing even jobs that are absolutely awful. If you become homeless, getting a job becomes harder. A lot harder. Or you may already be doing this, I don't know. Your original comment obviously doesn't go into all the details.

Yeah applied at McDonalds which said they were hiring full time and has "Now Hiring" signs plastered all over the place. Haven't heard back from them yet. I'm used to minimum wage. My last job was minimum wage in my old state, and the minimum wage there was lower, so even a minimum wage job would feel like a promotion. I've been mostly focusing on those sorts of low hanging fruit jobs. Places that say they're hiring, fast food joints with a high employee turnover, gas stations, convenience and grocery stores, anywhere that might pick me up fast. So far none of them have messaged me back, but I've no idea how long to wait before I assume they didn't hire me.

The only callback I've gotten so far seems really promising, and I think I did well on the interview, but I've no idea how that will actually pan out. Hopefully well, but you can't put all your human-eggs in one planet-basket, as Elon Musk would say.
