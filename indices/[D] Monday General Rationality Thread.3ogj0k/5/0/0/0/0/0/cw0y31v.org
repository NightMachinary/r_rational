Okay, sorry took a while. Here's what I got.

Fear vs. Anxiety

It may not be immediately obvious what the difference is. Fear is an emotional and physiological response to a known or definite threat. Let's say you're walking down a dark street and someone points a gun at you and says, “This is a stick up.” This would cause you to go into the fight-or-flight-or-freeze response to fear. The danger is real, definite and immediate. There is a clear and present object of fear. If you feel fear, it's because you believe there is a danger to you, could be a physical danger, could be an emotional one, could even be an imaginary danger that you just /believe/ is real.

Anxiety, however, “a diffuse, unpleasant, vague sense of apprehension...” It is a response to an imprecise or unknown threat. To a threat you believe is possible, perhaps even likely, but not certain.

If you're walking down a dark street, you may feel uneasy, perhaps you have a few butterflies in your stomach. You're worried that someone /might/ try to mug you. You have no indication that someone /will/, but you are considering the possibility. That feeling is anxiety. It's the feeling you get when there is the potential for a threat to you.

When you feel anxiety, it doesn't necessarily cause you to go into fight-or-flight-or-freeze mode, because the danger is not immediate.

However, even though fear and anxiety /are/ different, they are obviously closely related. Fear can cause anxiety, and anxiety can lead to fear. A person may become so anxious over a possible threat that they do in fact have a fear response, and run, even though the threat has not manifested itself.

Generally speaking, anxiety is a bad thing.

Fear can be irrational sometimes, in the case of a phobia, but it's often the right response to a real danger. If something is a legitimate threat to you, you should be afraid! And the fear response is to DO something, run, or fight, or hide.

Anxiety, though, is a feeling we get about possible dangers, that might occur... and because they are only possibilities, there is not actually much for us to actually DO.

I myself am particularly predisposed to anxiety, and it's been a real problem for me for as long as I can remember. But I have been working on it, and I have definitely made some progress.

“Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, but a good word makes him glad.”

Suppose your rent is due tomorrow and you don't have the money. You can spent the rest of tonight worrying about that, but worrying isn't going to make the money come, is it?

Worry is pointless anyway, because it doesn't actually change our situation. You don't get more money by worrying. You don't live longer because you spent time worrying. The opposite, actually, worry is bad for your health!

“And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?”

None of us. Worry doesn't accomplish anything. It doesn't help us.

If the thing you were worried about never happens, you wasted your energy and made yourself miserable for nothing.

If the thing you were worried about DOES happen... the worry didn't help you actually prepare for it... all it did was make you miserable in advance.

Have you ever needed to have an unpleasant conversation with someone, and you put it off? You keep putting it off, because of anxiety. And you try to prepare by imagining what you'll say, and then imagining what they'll say, and so on.

It's an unpleasant conversation you don't really want to have to have... and you put it off, and you have entire simulated conversations in your head, maybe, to try and prepare, or more accurately, to make yourself /think/ you are preparing.

And then you finally have the real conversation, and how much did all your imaginings actually help you? Maybe a little. Maybe. But you could have done 5 minutes of imagining, and then just got right into it. All the “preparation” past the first five minutes didn't really help, because it never goes in real life like you think it will in your head. And all the time putting it off was just more time spent in anxiety and worry.

“No plan survives contact with the enemy.”

There is no point in excessive planning and the anxiety that goes along with it, because it won't actually help. It may /feel/ like you're being productive by thinking about your problems and planning for them... but is it?

Once you've prepared all you can... once there is nothing left for you to actually DO... find something truly productive you can do instead. Something to take your mind off the worry.

Suppose your child got their license and is driving alone for the first time, and you're worried they will get hurt? Unless you're going to forbid them to drive... there's nothing you can do. You give them a cell phone so they can call you if they get in an accident. You make sure they don't use it while driving so they don't cause an accident. Then you stop thinking about it. You stop imagining all the ways it can go wrong. You read a book, do some chores, go for a jog. But there's no sense in dwelling on the possible danger.

We can't eliminate anxiety completely. If we recognize when we are in its grip though, that can help us at least break the cycle of anxiety causing more anxiety.

I got some bad news a couple of weeks ago. Some potential bad news... some probable bad news... I thought about it and thought about it. And finally I realized that thinking about it wasn't going to change the outcome. Either things would turn around, or they wouldn't. I had no power in the situation to change anything. There was nothing for me to do, very few decisions to make or plans to make.

So I said to myself... I'm feeling anxiety. This is an emotion. This is something that is happening to me. I'm sure I'm going to feel this the rest of the day, and tomorrow as well, but it won't be quite as strong tomorrow, and in a few more days I will be mostly over it. This intensity I'm feeling now, this panic... this is not going to last. This will end. And at no point will this feeling actually change anything. So I don't have to try to figure out what to do... there's nothing to do. It's just something to get through.

It's like if you bruise your knee, and limp for a few days. It hurts, but there's nothing to do. The pain will eventually go away, you have no decisions to make... it's just something to endure.

I will feel this way for a while, and then I'll have other things to deal with. I know that any time I think about this bad news, I will restart the anxiety again... but I won't have any new insights. So I will just try to... not think about it. Not worry about it.

If there is cause for /fear/, you /don't/ want to just ignore it and not think about it and just /hope/ things work out. That's foolish and dangerous.

But with anxiety, you already know it is unproductive. If there was anything to actually DO, you'd know, and could be doing it. So at that point, yes, trying to stop thinking about it... that's the way to go.

If you bruise your knee, does it help to keep thinking about how much it hurts? How much harder walking is? No. You try to take your mind off it.

I don't know if that helps you. But it was tremendously helpful to me. To think of anxiety as something that just happened to me. Just something to endure. Not something to feel guilty about, not something to keep thinking about... just something to endure.
