But the challenge is anticipating these trends. It's easy to tell right now that Dystopian young adult fiction is hot, but could you predict that 3-5 years ago (when the trend really picked up), or better yet, 5-7 years ago (when the Hunger Games was first being published). Ideally, you would be able to anticipate the beginning of a trend 1-2 years before it starts to give yourself time to start a book series corresponding to that trend.

So I think the earliest a prediction could have been made in the case of the Dystopian YA genre would be when the Hunger Games movies was first announced (2009 or 2010?). The book was pretty popular, and based on the reasonable belief that the movie would do well, an author seeking to cash in on trends could start writing their take on the genre around then. It would go to the publisher right as the trend got big... And lets see, Divergent was published in 2011, and the Hunger Games movie was released in 2012...

It might be that publishers already know how to predict these trends fairly well, and they just sort through manuscripts looking for one that come close to the latest trends.

edit: Some additional thoughts... It occured to me that Uglies, Pretties, and Specials (by Scott Westerfeld) were all published before Hunger Games was published, much less got big... did they experience a boost in sales in correlation with the Hunger Games getting popular? If not, then doing thing the way alexanderwales envisions is even harder, because publishing well before a trend starts isn't helpful either, the books need to be ready right as the trend begins.
