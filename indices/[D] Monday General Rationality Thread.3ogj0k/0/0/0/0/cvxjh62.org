Yeah, I hold with Charles Stross' advice, which is basically that if you want to take trends into account, you should steer clear of what the current trend is. Maybe your rip-off of Tarzan isn't going to be what's in vogue, but at least you're not going to land right in the glut of other manuscripts centered around whatever is trendy. And hey, maybe you can get lucky and wind up catching some different trend.
