I have not-so-lately become interested in applied rationality as it applies to writing/selling creative content. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3n8fep/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cvopcem][See here]], for example. So much of what publishing houses, television networks, and Hollywood studios do seems to be random flailing around. When it's not flailing around, it's following formula, which doesn't work half the time anyway.

People are doing [[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-how-pan-turned-831240][post-mortems on /Pan/]], which is the latest box-office flop. I really love these post-mortems, because when I see something like this I wonder how in the hell it happens. They had a budget of $150 million on the line! There were literally hundreds of people trying to make it work! Some of it you can maybe explain by people only doing enough to earn their paycheck, or a studio shifting resources mid-stream when they realized that the movie wasn't going to be good (attempting to avoid sinking resources that weren't going to make their money back). But I don't think that's all of it, because publishing (which is a completely different world) also puts out flops; [[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/books/review/Meyer-t.html][7 out of 10 books don't earn out their advance]].

So let's say that you're an author of middling quality. You don't really care what you write, you don't really have any difference in skill with regards to drama, and you've hit some level of diminishing returns on skill. What is your ideal strategy for Making It?

You can put your finger on the pulse of the market, but everyone else is already doing that, and the time from sitting down to write a novel and seeing it on shelves is [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/01/the-next-big-thing.html][5-6 years if done traditionally or 1-4 years if you self-publish]]. So if you see that vampires are currently the next big thing, you can't really get in on that, because by the time you finish writing your vampire novel, the market will be flooded with them. If you want to hit the market /right/, you need to anticipate where the market is going to go next, which is very difficult to do. Efficient-market hypothesis strikes again!

I feel like there must be aspects of human psychology that you can exploit in order to beat out the competition. If you know how and why people are compelled to share things with each other, you can craft something that will spread without having to pay for advertising (or in addition to advertising). I'm of the school of thought that sees stories as being predicated not just on culture, but the structure of the human brain itself; books, movies, and television shows are about delivering hedons, so it makes sense that they would be calibrated for that task. But since most authors/writers don't study human psychology, their calibration is based only on trial and error to see what works and what doesn't. I feel like there's got to be a better way than that.

(I hope this doesn't edge too far into the rationalist dark arts. I'm not really that interested in applying any of this myself, because writing is a hobby that I do to destress and entertain myself, not something that I'm trying to sociopathically profit from.)
