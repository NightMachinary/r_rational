See, this is part of the problem with chasing the market. /Hunger Games/ came out in 2008, /The Maze Runner/ came out in 2009. The market has been saturated with YA dystopian novels for the last five years. So yes, you could probably churn out a new YA dystopian novel in a handful of months, but then you'd be in competition with all the YA dystopian novels that were trying to ride that wave.

In fact, back in 2010 when /Hunger Games/ was ascendant, the publishers were probably picking already-written manuscripts up from the slush pile, so even if you had seen the trend coming, you'd /still/ be behind by however long it took you to write your book.

It really boils down to game theory; you don't want to go in the same direction as everyone else.
