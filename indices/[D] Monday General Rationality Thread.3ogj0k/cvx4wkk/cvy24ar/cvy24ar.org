If you are truly an author of middling quality then probably the best thing to do is make friends with people in the industry. They are more likely to publish/advertise your admittedly mediocre stuff.

The impressive example of Eliezer Yudkowski who apparently is just that good at writing that hes able to write, on purpose, an excellent propaganda piece thats actually gets popular is unfortunately not replicable by your placeholder author.
