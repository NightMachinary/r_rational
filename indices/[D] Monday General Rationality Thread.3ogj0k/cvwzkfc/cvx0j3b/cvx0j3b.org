A little bit. I was introduced to it when I happened upon [[http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/games-people-play-game-theory-in-life-business-and-beyond.html][this course by the teaching company]], though of course I was a dirty underage pirate, so I didn't pay their ridiculous prices. We also touched on it in an Evolutionary Psychology course I took at uni. But other than feeding into my armchair psychology, no I haven't used it much.
