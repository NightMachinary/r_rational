Depends on what you mean by "real life":

- Often, at various meta-levels, when playing games with postgraduate economists. This can be a lot of fun, but I'm not sure it counts as real life.

- Selection of various things - research topics, books to read, etc - can be made much more productive by starting in areas you have reason to believe are under-investigated for some reason. Basically just a technique to work out where you might have an advantage.

- Implicit negotiations - whenever interacting with a corporation, think about how to hack it's incentive structure (/and/ that of the person you're talking to). In what scenario will it be easier for the company/organisation/whatever to give you what you want than deny it?

  - This is just for companies though, since they're generally model-able as rational actors. People tend to respond better to psychology than game theory though; for negotiations read the book by the FBI hostage guy and the Harvard Business Review.

- Avoiding situations which resemble negative-sum games, or where it would likely be negative for me (eg dominated by experts, high loss rate, etc). Basically avoid most forms of speculation and check typical outcomes for your demographics before doing anything really important.

Most of it is really just understanding a system, and game theory is one useful tool among many.
