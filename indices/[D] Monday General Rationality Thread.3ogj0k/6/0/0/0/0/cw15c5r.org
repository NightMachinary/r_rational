I strongly doubt that we ever achieve the kind of permanent, global equilibrium between /all/ our thoughts, feelings, and opinions that Parfit imagines reflective equilibrium to consist in. In fact, I think we need to understand more about our minds before we can even talk about what it is we're putting in equilibrium and how.

Otherwise, people will tend to just select some few things as overriding and rationalize away all disharmony.
