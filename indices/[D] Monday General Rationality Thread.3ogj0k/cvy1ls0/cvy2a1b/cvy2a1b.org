Pretty sure that utility function complexity follows some kind of bell curve distribution. This automatically means some people are on the right and left sides, eg. more complex/less complex.

There are indeed people whos UF strongly include kids+family life and who dont need much beside; other people are deeply unsatisfied with such a life.

Of course wether or not all these modern day human UF hold up in reflective equilibrium and wether or not they converge or diverge in extrapolated volition is still up to debate.
