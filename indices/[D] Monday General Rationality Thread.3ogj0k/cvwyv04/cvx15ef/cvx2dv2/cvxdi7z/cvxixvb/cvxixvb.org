  Title: Sugar Substitutes May Reduce Tooth Demineralization in High Caries Patients Clinical Question: In a patient with high risk caries how do dietary sugar substitutes compared to sucrose affect demineralization on teeth surfaces? Clinical Bottom Line: Sugar substitutes have shown to decrease the chances of tooth demineralization when assessing for enamel pH, caries incidence and tooth surface hardness compared to conventional sucrose diets. Comments on The Evidence: There were no systematic reviews or quality meta-analysis studies found over the connection of aspartame and demineralization. The validity was very questionable as this was not a very common study and was mostly from lab experiments. There will need to be more in vivo studies to be analyzed before a definite conclusion can be made.

My 5 minutes of looking at the literature confirms that there are no clinical trials or anything really, beyond the "Lisa Simpson" experiment with a tooth in soda. But diet sodas seem like they may be better for preventing tooth decay. This may change once our microbiota develops pathways to metabolize artificial sweeteners.
