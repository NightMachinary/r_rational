Meh, I'm a hardcore Coca Cola fan. It also makes a great substitute for brushing your teeth occasionally; people think that the acid will melt your teeth but that's not actually true, it's not in your mouth long enough, it doesn't have time to melt your teeth. It only melts the bacteria and shit on your teeth. Amazing, I know!
