From a sample size of one (myself, obviously), I'm tempted to say:

Going from a poor diet with regular brushing of my teeth (and next to 0 acidic food / drinks) to beginning a healthier diet (with acidic drinks and fruits) with the same health care habits led to degrediation of my enamel. My dentist said this was likely due to softening my enamel via fruits or juices before eating harder foods or brushing.

So while the acidity itself may not be harmful to your teeth directly, the temporary weakening of your enamel can be an issue.

I would be tempted to see what the effects of highly acidic drinks such as diet sodas (to be without the sugar) are on the ecology of the mouth.

Might be worth poking around for an hour or two.
