I'm going to answer a different question (because I have something to say about that question, but not so much about your original one): "What's the best way(s) to utilize our conscious, rational conclusions and understanding to deal with /thoughts that make us anxious/?"

There are two approaches I know of.

The first is to engage with the content of your feelings. For example, you ask yourself "what's the worst that could happen" and keep asking back "so what if ...?" (or "how likely is that", or "is that really so bad?"). For example, you are anxious about a job interview. "What's the worst that could happen?", "I won't get the job", "so what if I don't get that job?", "I'll feel disappointed", "that's okay, we can deal with that". That would be roughly a CBT approach. Doing that in writing might be superior (I don't know). Thinking of concrete counterexamples to your fears (evidence that the fears are unfounded) might also help.

The second one is kind of the opposite, but might be better suited if you already know that your fears are irrational. You realise that thoughts are not beliefs (we sometimes have thoughts we know not to be true). You accept them as 'mental chatter'. Like a radio that's running in the background and, even if can be annoying and distracting, is not really worthy of your attention.
