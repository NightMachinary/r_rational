I have a similar issue with Anger. It was actually my intro post here, before I realized that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] was for rat fic, not merely the concept of rationality.

I now realize that when I'm confronted with Anger, I rationalize it as a reaction to specific sets of actions that others do to "set me off" when really, it's more about acceptance of my personal limitations and relinquishing my personal domain of control in my home life.

I typically have to recognize when the primal emotion is present and allow it to pass, since any action I take in reaction to anger is irrational, even if I perceive it to be rational at the time. It's tough for my fianc√©e to accept that she needs to give me space at random times, but we generate better discussions and solutions an hour after I start getting irrationally grouchy about something.
