Sure, and I wouldn't call Delve Rationalist, but that is one Characteristic out of the ~6 there, delve at least attempts at:

World with sane and consistent rules

Realistic motivations

Intelligence (In the MC)

Deconstruction (If you can count gaming the system as deconstruction)

Topics (Rationalist stories tend to be about science, technology, transhumanism, futurism, or artificial intelligence.) - which Delve is more about this than 95% of stories.

Again, I wouldn't call it Rationalist, but it hits those points more than 99% (or at the very least 95%) of other fiction out there, so definitely would include it in the sub on these grounds even if it doesn't fully qualify.
