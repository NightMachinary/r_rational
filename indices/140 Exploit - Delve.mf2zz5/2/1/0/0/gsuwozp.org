I agree completely, I'm really taken aback how someone can post "I really hate this story!" If you hate it why would you read it in the first place?

The only answer seem to be that these people felt (or actually did) get "bait-n-switched", pulled in by an awesome concept and then kept reading on the hope it would improve but being disappointed each time.
