I wouldn't really define it as rationalist myself but, it absolutely is trying to be more so than most fiction: Most fiction does not have an MC who tries to apply the scientific method, math and reasoning to their magic system. <- This is what rationalist means (right?) and Delve does it more than the vast majority of fiction, hence I would absolutely include in the sub along those grounds.
