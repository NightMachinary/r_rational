I think it's because of disappointment. Delve used to be quite popular here, little more than a year ago you'd be hard pressed to see people complaining it shouldn't be in the sub, even though it wasn't universally liked. The simple reason being that those who didn't like it wouldn't read it and that was that. But then the quality declined, some of the people who liked it before, now hate it and argue that's it's not even rational to begin with and shouldn't be here.

Delve didn't loose the characteristics that make it rational, there's still a lot of time spent on analyzing things, reasoning and justifying actions, even when people make mistakes, it's in character, not something that can only be attributed to an idiot ball. The story has many other failings however, the glacial pacing being the worst in my opinion, the MC's personality isn't very appealing to many people (the constant memes and idioms that no one else understands are very grating imo) and overall the characterization has always been the weakest part of the story. Add to that the fact that since he has been capped for a long time, the exploration of the system, a part that I imagine many people here find very interesting, has taken a back seat to other things like the mystical mumbo jumbo of fixing his soul.

So overall I think what's happened is that people got frustrated that something they liked declined in quality and “got bad”. Some might even have been patrons at some point which probably adds to the frustration.

ps: obviously that's just my opinion based on external observation and I'm no expert on what each person is thinking, but I don't think I'm too far off, considering the level of “hate” some people have demonstrated in the past threads, not to mention the whole report to get the thread removed thing.
