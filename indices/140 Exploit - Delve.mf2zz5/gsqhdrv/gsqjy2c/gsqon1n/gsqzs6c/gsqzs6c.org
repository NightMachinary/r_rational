That's like expelling the bullied kid from school because half the year is bullying them.

Frustration aside, it is an attempt (whether successful or not) at rational fiction, that is worth more than 50% of what is normally posted here and exactly what the sub is for.

Delve is 100% free and given to you with no obligation. If you don't like it don't read it, and especially don't try and bully it off a platform it belongs where at least half the people like it.

Personally though I actually LIKE the criticisms people write on these threads, and would rather have them here then not.
