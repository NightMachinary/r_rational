See, I can't possibly imagine how anybody could say that. What's this 50% of things posted to [[/r/rational]], say out of the first 25 on [[/r/rational]]'s front-page right now, that Delve is â€˜worth more than'?

Quite a few of us /don't/ feel that Delve is "exactly what the sub is for", and I begin to think that perhaps the mismatch here is that you and Delve's proponents have a /very/ different idea of what the sub is for than I do.
