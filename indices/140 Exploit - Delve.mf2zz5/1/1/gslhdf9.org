  Rain's being a little harsh on himself

I haven't read it(and won't), but based on what you said he's actually being an imbecile. Some perceptions are natural to be colored by one's emotions and ego, can't avoid it without experience. Others are a sure sign of low intelligence and bad reasoning skills.

The author doesn't seem to know the difference, which makes his portrayal of Rain into a caricature.

How I fucking hate this story.
