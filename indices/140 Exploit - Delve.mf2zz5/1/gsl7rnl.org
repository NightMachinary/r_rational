A very numbers and mechanics chapter, setting some more limits on the benefits of accolades.

Rain's being a little harsh on himself in the first half of the chapter, what with taking on like four melee-specialist characters in melee while handicapping himself with not using his primary spellset, and then being disappointed at how much they're kicking him around.

And tinfoil hats really are good protection from mind-control rays. Wonder if aluminium's strength in that regard will come up at all with there being a major player with mind control powers running around. Maybe a long way down the line.
