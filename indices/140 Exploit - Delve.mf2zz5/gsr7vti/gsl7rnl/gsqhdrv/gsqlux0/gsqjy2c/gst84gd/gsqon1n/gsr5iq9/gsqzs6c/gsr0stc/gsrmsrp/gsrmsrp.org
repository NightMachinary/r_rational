So in the 25 most recent posts I see about new chapters:

The daily grind

Pith

Animorphs

WtC

New humans

dear spellbook

Hermine and the silent country

Out of those, the only ones which are without a doubt better quality than delve is Pith, Animorphs, WtC and Hermine, while the ones which are more rationalist (again, whether it succeeds/does it well or not is irrelevant) is Animorphs, Wtc and Hermine.So yeah, about half those are just as good or more off-topic than Delve.

  Quite a few of us /don't/ feel that Delve is "exactly what the sub is for"
#+end_quote

And "quite a few of us" don't like some of the other works mentioned above, and the mature ones "of us" don't try and remove posts about them because they don't like something about the story.

Instead they just ignore them, or post a comment if the criticism is particularly interesting or would like to share their opinion.
