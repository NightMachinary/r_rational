I can't speak for anyone but myself. But if I were attempt to guess ... mods remove it because they are tired of all the drama and mod reports and sneers from both sides, which together with Delve being routinely downvoted to 60% eventually became enough to overcome their natural desire not to gatekeep.

Users like myself don't like it because we've been burned by having read it long enough for disgust at the memes and zero-velocity pace to become so great that animosity was born. And then the "You just want numbers-go-up (because you have poor taste!)" smears from within these comment threads extends that animosity to a subset of the people who post in these threads.

[I guess I should add also that I think I'm not alone in viewing Delve as far off-topic for this sub and downvote it the same I would downvote, e.g., Power Ranges television discussion in this sub.]

I'm probably leaving out important viewpoints and portions of the dynamics, but that's what I think of when I consider what's going on.
