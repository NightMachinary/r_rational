Rationalist fictions, along with being rational, try to teach the readers (and characters) rational modes of thinking. From the wiki,

  * Teaching rationality

  Rationalist stories make a deliberate effort to reward the reader's thinking, and teach him to get better at it. Characters are explicitly using and teaching others rationalist techniques, and showing the practical thinking processes which can be applied by readers.

  We can see characters being smart, not just be told that they are smart. They think of brilliant things to do which we ourselves could have realized are possible. The character's "brilliance" is conferred not by mutation or native brilliance alone, but follows from the explicit rules of thought, which readers are intended to pick up from the story and use in real life.
