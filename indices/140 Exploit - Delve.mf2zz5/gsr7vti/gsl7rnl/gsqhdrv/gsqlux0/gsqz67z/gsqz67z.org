Yeah, When I saw it removed I thought: "That's like expelling the bullied kid from school because half year is bullying them".

Getting frustrated with a story is fine, but in the end its completely free content with no obligation on you to read it. Going to the extent of wanting to remove it from the sub is the height of entitlement IMO, and mods encouraging that is like exact opposite of the job description.

EDIT: Its was auto-removed, not by mods. Good to know.
