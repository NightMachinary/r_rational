This chapter wasn't really to my taste -- it was essentially just a math discussion at heart -- but I think it's the opposite of your critique. It showed Rain working hard to prepare for a dangerous situation, being smart about figuring out the rules of his new world, and finding a powerful exploit in those rules as well as important implications of them that will affect his actions going forward.
