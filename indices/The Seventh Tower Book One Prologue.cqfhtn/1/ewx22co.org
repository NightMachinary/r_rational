Whoa, props to you for doing this!

I auditioned the opening minute or two, a couple paragraphs in the middle, and the last couple minutes. Here are some thoughts, in order of significance:

1. Your enunciation is quite clear to me. There's a little room for improvement but I think it wouldn't be a high priority to do so.

2. Your pacing is very stable! This is good, except where it may detract a little bit from dramatism/emphasis. I'd absolutely prefer to err on the side of steady, so great job here too!

3. As suggested above, you could use some more dramatic tone/dynamic shifts; the recording is a little monotone.

4. I think the slight amount of /timbre/ change I heard at the end (for the shadow?) was good, and sufficient in magnitude. If you're good at the latter, feel free to expand on it, but I don't think that's necessary.

5. This one's fairly minor, but I noticed a difference in volume between the middle and the end; this is a slight editing or mic placement/usage issue, and may not be of significant impact. It's /maybe/ enough to make someone want to adjust the volume on their device while listening, which isn't great.

6. On the subject of editing, I noticed a slight jump in the last minute or two where you either stumbled or perhaps edited two cuts together a bit too suddenly. This is also quite minor.

Overall, great job! This sample is far better than I could expect from this context!
