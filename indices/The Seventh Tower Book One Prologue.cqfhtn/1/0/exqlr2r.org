Thank you!

Yes enunciation was my biggest priority. I have a doc of words made up for the story and their phonetic pronunciations. I hope to stay as consistent as possible with that.

3.In what way would you say it is monotone? Dramatic shifts as in speed of reading or my pitch? I definitely do not want the book to sound the same the whole way through. I thought I was getting the tone down but perhaps it was all in my head.

1. Thanks! I was actually very nervous about how that would come off. I'm glad someone liked it. I plan on attempting different voices for each character, we'll see how it comes out.

2. Yes, I'm still struggling with making everything sound the same on audacity. That's something I hope consistently improves as I record. Once I get it down pat I plan on rerecording this first prologue.

3. Thanks for the heads up! The last couple of minutes took me a whole hour and a half to record, as I kept stumbling over myself due to anticipation of almost being done. I think it is composed of over 35 separate recordings so I'm not surprised the spacing is strange.

Thank you for the critique! I found it really helpful while reviewing my recording!
