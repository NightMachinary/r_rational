No. This is not rational at all. It's just a story I enjoyed. I know there's been a clamor for a Pokemon: the Origin of Species audiobook and I want to do that.

But I dont want to mess it up, not having done audio narration before. So Im doing this and posted it here looking for critiques.

I trust this community's judgment on quality. I didnt really know how to label it or where to post it otherwise.
