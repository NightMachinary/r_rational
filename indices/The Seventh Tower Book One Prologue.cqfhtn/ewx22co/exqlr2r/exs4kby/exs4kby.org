Glad you found it helpful! It was not at all obvious (i.e. I didn't realize) that you stitched quite so many takes together; good job on that.

Re: monotone -- it wasn't quite to the point that I would call "monotone" but overall you might want to try some /extremely/ dramatic swings of emphasis and get some feedback (including your own) on how extreme it sounds upon playback. I think it might be one of those things that is much more obvious to you as the performer and much less noticeable to the audience; I have had the same issue while playing piano :)
