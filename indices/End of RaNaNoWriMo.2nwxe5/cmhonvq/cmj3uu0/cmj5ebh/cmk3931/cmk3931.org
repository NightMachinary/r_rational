That makes sense. By the way, definitely sell it. You're talented and I'm sure a lot of people here would gladly buy one of your books.

That said, one thing I'd definitely pay for is something like a patreon where a writer I like works on a book and shows all of the drafts as they progress. It wouldn't matter if the chapters are published in order or if things are rewritten due to flash of insight since the whole point would be to see the creation process. Being a programmer, I'd suggest using git for that :-)
