I think my current plan is to take everything down and then work on fixing all the things I know are wrong, then put it all back up later, or alternately, sell it. I do like posting drafts, but writing with continuous forward motion (like I do for NaNo) is sort of unnatural because I have flashes of insight and need to go back and change things - which I tend to do right when the problem/solution occurs to me. If writing tended to be a more linear process I would put up the draft chapters the whole way though, but there's no easy way to do it when you're hopping around a lot.

(Thanks for reading, by the way!)
