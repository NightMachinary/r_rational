I limped across the finish line tonight. The story itself is nowhere near done, but I think I wrote some things that are worth keeping, and came to some useful realizations about what needs to be done with the story (she's going to find her mother, how did I not see that before!) - which is about what I'd hoped to get out of NaNo. I think that now that the month is over, I'm going to do some editing (to make the story conform to what it should have been) and then continue on. Writing characters helps you learn about those characters and who they are, which is part of the reason that long-running series have early installment weirdness. With some of that out of the way, I can rewrite the start so that everything is consistent.

It's at least nice to know that I wrote 50,000 words this month, which is above my average.
