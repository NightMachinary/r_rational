First off - I am not going to even look at my story again until January.

Even though most of what I wrote is probably going to be rewritten completely, the information and character familiarity I got from writing it in the first place is going to be immensely useful. I wrote everything in first person, and switched between ~7 characters. The rewrite is going to be in third person, but getting inside the characters' heads makes them much more fleshed out, even when they're not even going to be a POV character. Every character, whether you're focused on them or not, should be a fully realized individual with quirks of the personality, and the main character of their own story.

Also, voluminous amounts of worldbuilding and ironing-out of the magic system was accomplished as well. All in all, a very productive month.
