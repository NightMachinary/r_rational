I started strong and then stopped. I kept missing days due to school work and house work and the like(and once a lack of power) and the catch up piled on, so I gave up.

I think I got to a measly 10K words. It is the most I've written in such a small span, so I know I'm capable of doing it. I just lacked direction, and time.
