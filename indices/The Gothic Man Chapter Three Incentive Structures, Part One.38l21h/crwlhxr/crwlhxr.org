I fear that with the trend of this quest being focused on politics, economics, sociology, crime and morality on a large scale it doesn't really lend itself well for purely rational discourse and decision making. Too many topics with nothing akin to scientific consensus in sight. And all that with a main character who isn't really constrained by any rules that need rational workarounds. Not to mention that the consequences of our actions have to then be judged by one or two persons (the writer plus anyone who helps him on his side) who, probably not being an expert on all of these subjects at once, can't really be completely objective and will thus lead to rather large scale polarization whenever a plan goes wrong for reasons that people don't "believe" in. Not to mention that I have no idea where the data of our statisticians to be hired and such is supposed to come from.

I'll continue following this but I hope that issues become more small scale and "Batman-y" instead of just "A filthy rich man with many skills in a corrupt city" + the occasional supernatural event.
