"La Porta et al. have argued that common law systems *(found mostly in Britain and its former colonies)* differ on this dimension from civil law systems (found mostly in continental Europe and its former colonies). Whereas the *common law tradition developed first in England* to some extent as a defense of parliament and property owners against the attempts by the sovereign to regulate and expropriate them, civil law systems in their Napoleonic, Bismarckian, or other forms developed more as an instrument used by the sovereign for state building and controlling economic life (David and Brierly, 1985; La Porta et al., 1999). Common law developed from precedents established by judges, usually allied with the property-owning aristocracy against the Crown, while civil law developed from codes drawn up by jurists at the sovereign's bidding. They hypothesize that the greater protections of property against the state embodied in common law systems improve various aspects of government performance, including /reducing corruption/**"
