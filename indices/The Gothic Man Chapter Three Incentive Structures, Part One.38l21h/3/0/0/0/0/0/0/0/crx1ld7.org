Is this supposed to be some form of sarcasm?

I know that common law was developed in and propagated by England but I don't know how those two points you highlighted in your quote ameliorate my issues. I saw them the first time too.

But maybe you just didn't get what I was trying to say as I also only highlighted some text. I seem to have been mistaken in the assumption that my previous comments provided enough context. I'll try to remedy that.

#+begin_quote
  *differ on this dimension*
#+end_quote

I interpreted this as the dimension in question being corruption in government. Now that I think about it this may be a false assumption as the quote may be partially out of context. If that is the case then what was meant by "this dimension"?

If it actually is corruption that is being talked about then you must understand how it reads as if common law systems somehow differ in corruption level from civil law systems.

#+begin_quote
  They hypothesize that the greater protections of property against the state embodied in common law systems improve various aspects of government performance, including reducing corruption"
#+end_quote

I assume that "They" are David and Brierly? What I understood from the sentence quoted above (in context with the rest of the same paragraph) is that common law (and its supposed greater protection of property rights) is better at reducing corruption than civil law. After all the whole paragraph goes on and on about the differences in development of those two particular systems and then concludes with a sentence on how one of the to systems has positive outcomes because of how a particular aspect is /'greater'/.

I have to admit that I kind of missed the part where the particular paper you quote only /mentions/ that /another/ paper hypothesizes such a thing while making no judgment or hypothesis on its own. On the other hand why would you quote that particular paragraph if not in support of British common law?

I hope all this sheds more light on my reservations.
