  If it actually is corruption that is being talked about then you must understand how it reads as if common law systems somehow differ in corruption level from civil law systems.

Common law in places that are Britain and its former colonies.

I'm not sure how many ways I can state this. I have, and always have been saying that the paper said that places that are or were british and had common law had lower perceived corruption on average, not that everywhere that exists anywhere and has common law has lower corruption. Until you understand that this is the view I have I see little point in continuing.
