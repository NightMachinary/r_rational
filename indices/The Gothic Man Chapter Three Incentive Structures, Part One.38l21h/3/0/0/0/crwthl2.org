To say it differently, according to [[http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results][transparency.org 2014]] 11 out of the +17+ 19* best scoring countries don't have a law system based on common law. In the top 10 only the second and tenth places do. This may be confirmation bias but coupled with my own limited knowledge and experience I see no reason to believe that civil law somehow leads to more corruption and I dispute any claim that that single paper should be enough evidence to convince anyone otherwise.

If of course you have other evidence to support the superiority of common law when it comes to decreasing corruption or instead can dispute the legitimacy of Transparency International's methods in a convincing fashion then I'll rethink my stance. As I said my opinion may be partially based on a bias of mine that comes from comparing the US and British legal systems with the other few European legal systems I have any knowledge on (which is mostly but not exclusively Germany).
