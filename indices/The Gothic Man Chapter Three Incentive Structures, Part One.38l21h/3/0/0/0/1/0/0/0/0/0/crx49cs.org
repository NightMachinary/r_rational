  I agree with the paper's maths, I don't agree with your made up view for me and the paper.
#+end_quote

I guess I'll do that tomorrow. Do you have a convenient link?

Regarding bribery:

You seem to be misunderstanding what I am saying. Of course a culture of bribery does massive harm to a nation in all kinds of sectors. I would always be against bribery happening within my own country. And of course most legitimate corporations would rather not resort to having to bribe officials to get things done. I would also be in favor of general crackdowns on bribery in other countries because I am of the opinion that all humans deserve equal rights regardless of where they were born.

What I am saying is that I don't think it to be a smart move for a government to persecute cases of bribery happening /abroad/.

#+begin_quote
  Anyway, in reality there are notable positive and negative sides to bribery.
#+end_quote

I actually can't think of any net positives effects for the general population in the corrupt country taking the bribes.

#+begin_quote
  Bribery can have a local or countrywide impact on the moral fabric of society, increasing corruption and misallocation of resources.
#+end_quote

Believe me I know. I've seen exactly these things happen due to chronic corruption.

  The constituency probably is being harmed since the business is focusing on helping those that bribe it and ignoring everyone else.
#+end_quote

The constituency /there/. In the country that is already corrupt enough to take money from foreign corporations (in this case corporations coming from your country).

#+begin_quote
  It can lead to corruption purges that ruin the reputation of the company.

  It can lead to massive amounts of money being wasted and businesses going into the red.

  It can lead to other businesses harassing you for giving bribes.
#+end_quote

I don't see why potentially harming their own reputation should be a crime.

#+begin_quote
  It can lead to crappy people who suck at work and rushed cheap jobs.
#+end_quote

I seem to be too tired to see how bribes in particular cause that.

#+begin_quote
  It can also lead to those in poverty having decent wages, smoothing over of bureaucratic issues as you said.
#+end_quote

At the cost of the money not going to whoever actually deserves it. I'd rather the corporations paid that money in actual taxes that then get distributed in a fashion governed by democratically ratified legislature. And I'm pretty sure all the less shady corporations would also prefer that if the net expenses in money remain the same.

But all of those things are already happening in corrupt countries and a few more corporations participating in it will only marginally worsen the situation especially if they do so reluctantly or if they take up a niche that otherwise would be taken by a different corporation from a different country.

By forbidding the corporations based in your nation from issuing bribes abroad you essentially forbid them to do serious business in any country corrupt enough to make bribes mandatory fr smooth functioning. And that benefits no one but said corporations' rivals.

Keep in mind that I went off on this tangent solely based on [[http://www.icij.org/blog/2014/02/worlds-least-corrupt-nations-fail-police-bribery-abroad][this link]] of yours that mentions how the top 4 least corrupt nations (according to the TI Perceived Corruption Index) do far less to stop their own corporations from participating in corruption abroad and how that is a bad thing that should be remedied. That and this line of yours:

#+begin_quote
  That we shouldn't import the Scandinavian tradition of not caring about foreign corruption.
#+end_quote

Caring about foreign corruption only matters insofar as you care enough to use your power to batter the corruption out of other countries. If all you do is restrict your citizens from low level participation in corruption abroad (bribes vs actively supporting corruption) then you only very marginally do anything positive abroad and you definitely don't help your citizen. In fact you probably just harm them economically. Making it illegal to do worse things (like destroying the environment, putting employees abroad in danger or exploiting them or even funding violence) I can perfectly understand though.
