  I'm not trying to say that the common law system is objectively worse than the civil law system, just that I fail to see how it has been proven to be objectively better.

I'm not sure why you feel a need to repeatedly take me for task for a general statement I never made.

I was talking about the British version of common law, not every version of common law that has ever existed. Suppose you said "LOTR is the greatest fantasy story ever." If I took you to task and said "But the eye of argon was a bad book" that wouldn't be an actual challenge as, while eye of argon is a fantasy book, it's not lotr or in any way related.

Likewise for this, there are two conditions for my argument to trigger. Common law and British.

  I'm confused regarding what you mean by that.

That we shouldn't import the Scandinavian tradition of not caring about foreign corruption.

  On the topic of corruption abroad, is it weird that I wouldn't support the scrupulous persecution of locally based corporations for bribery related crimes abroad?

Bribery is often a poor way to do business. It encourages governments to ignore regulation environments and endangers the consumer. There's a potential benefit of allowing bribery and a potential downside. If you just have basically no rules about it as they have then you get the benefit and the downside.

You could require bribes to be registered instead for example and check that each was legitimate.
