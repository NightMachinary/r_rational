I did some research on legal systems.

Historically, a lot of people have had rather crappy laws and then as such have adopted roman or british laws to improve their own systems. From a study called The causes of corruption: a cross-national study by Treisman, he noted that local laws tend to be written up at the behest of local governments, and as such, tend to have a low respect for property laws. The government is free to seize houses and such for its own corrupt goals. Some points of note.

"First, I replicate in this dataset the findings of La Porta et al. (1999) that countries with Protestant traditions and those with more developed economies have higher quality governments."

"hird, federal states were more ‘corrupt' than unitary ones, presumably because the competition between autonomous levels of government to extract bribes leads to ‘overgrazing of the commons'."

"Fourth, while the current degree of democracy was not significant, a long period of exposure to democracy was."

"La Porta et al. have argued that common law systems (found mostly in Britain and its former colonies) differ on this dimension from civil law systems (found mostly in continental Europe and its former colonies). Whereas the common law tradition developed first in England to some extent as a defense of parliament and property owners against the attempts by the sovereign to regulate and expropriate them, civil law systems in their Napoleonic, Bismarckian, or other forms developed more as an instrument used by the sovereign for state building and controlling economic life (David and Brierly, 1985; La Porta et al., 1999). Common law developed from precedents established by judges, usually allied with the property-owning aristocracy against the Crown, while civil law developed from codes drawn up by jurists at the sovereign's bidding. They hypothesize that the greater protections of property against the state embodied in common law systems improve various aspects of government performance, including reducing corruption"

"In Britain and some of its former colonies, scholars have noted an almost obsessive focus on the procedural aspects of law. In Eckstein's words, ‘‘The British . . . behave like ideologists in regard to rules and like pragmatists in regard to policies. Procedures, to them, are not merely procedures, but sacred rituals'' (Eckstein, 1966, p. 265). By contrast, in many other cultures social order is associated not so much with adherence to procedures as with respect for hierarchy and the authority of offices."

"A willingness of judges to follow procedures even when the results threaten hierarchy --- to side with Dreyfus against the Army --- clearly increases the chance that official corruption will be exposed."

"Where more ‘hierarchical religions' --- Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Islam --- dominate, challenges to office-holders might be rarer than in cultures shaped by more egalitarian or individualistic religions, such as Protestantism. 4 Religions may also influence how individuals view their loyalties to family as opposed to other citizens --- what Edward Banfield has called ‘familism' --- which, in turn, may affect the level of nepotism"

"In religious traditions such as Protestantism, which arose in some versions as dissenting sects opposed to the state-sponsored religion, institutions of the church may play a role in monitoring and denouncing abuses by state officials. In other traditions --- such as Islam --- where church and state hierarchies are closely intertwined, such a role may be absent."

"For a number of reasons, the risk of exposure may also be higher in more democratic, open political systems. 5 Freedom of association and of the press engender public interest groups and reporters with a mission and the right to expose abuses."

"The cost this entails depends upon the benefits provided by that job --- the level of salaries in public office --- and the length of time for which an honest official could expect to enjoy them (Becker and Stigler, 1974; Ul Haque and Sahay, 1996; Van Rijckeghem and Weder, 1997; World Bank, 1997). A high degree of political stability will lengthen officials' time horizon, while a bureaucracy that offers long-term careers with chances of advancement will promise greater future benefit to a low-level bureaucrat than one in which jobs are more insecure and promotion less likely"

So conclusions from this.

1. Seek to import the british legal system and replace some of the more insane laws, with a special focus on property rights.

2. Meet up with protestants and catholic dissidents in gotham. If they can be strengthened then they can serve as a valuable way to encourage a good work ethic and challenge the corruption of organized government and religion.

3. Encourage freedom of the press to expose crimes.

4. Encourage a legal culture where procedure is held to be sacred above hierarchy. If the law says someone is bad that should be more important than political pressure from above.

5. Encourage a stable political system where a career in politics is long, advances with time spent in there, there's a strong social stigma against bribery, and that advancement within it is very possible, as opposed to an unstable one where people need to grab what cash they can.
