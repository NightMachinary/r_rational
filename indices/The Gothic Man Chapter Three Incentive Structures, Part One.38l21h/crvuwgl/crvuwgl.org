The bribery issue.

[[http://blogs.worldbank.org/futuredevelopment/six-strategies-fight-corruption]]

There are dual issues here. We want elected officials to avoid being bribed by criminals and other billionaires, but we also want to control them to ensure our laws are carried out.

1. +We can pay them better, but this gives them resistance to our bribery too. How about a bonus scheme/ sideways promotion scheme decided by the leadership? A general rise in pay, but more controlled. If we can get relative control of those at the upper levels via political manoeuvring and legal bribes we could encourage them to have a bonus scheme that rewarded loyalty, thus insulating them from cheap bribes and allowing us better control over who they accepted bribes from. Encourage internal infighting for increased pay, not seeking bribes from the outside, and a clear threat of demotion if someone behaves inappropriately that we could legally push with our contacts. Something for internal affairs to attack.+ in another post I noted what works. Bribery occurs heavily because people feel political careers are insecure and they need to grab what cash they can. Encourage long term stable political careers, where an honest person can rise in pay and a dishonest person will face a social stigma and a loss of their job if they're found to be corrupt. Encourage long term thinking.

2. Better transparency. We need a well funded press that's protected from violence to ensure corrupt and evil schemes get exposed. It'd be good to seek out contacts in the press, research with them what could be done to strengthen them. Campaign donations and bribes for the rich should be easier to conceal than bribes to the poor so this shouldn't have too much exposure risk.

3. Cutting red tape. We want certain rules and regulations. If slumlords are ignoring fire regulations that's bad. But if companies are blocking people from making new companies that could challenge them via legal challenges that's also bad. We need to use our media contacts and study the bureaucratic burden of various rules in terms of cost, time taken and openness of whatever criteria are used to say yes or no, whether the rules are in clear English. After this some sort of powerful task force should be established with in house inspections and the ability to fine people and close businesses to ensure whatever rules are carried out, again with careful use of charity.

4. Reducing poorly used subsidies. We need our statisticians to analyze where government money is going. If it's going mostly to the rich then it's probably being misallocated, and we should seek to change that. For that we need to find out the budget.

5. Public education of people about their legal rights. We need people to know what rights they have under the system so that people can't enforce crazy laws by just blustering their way through and there is public demand for changes in crazy laws. This again needs control over the media. Perhaps our radio program could aid that? If we could give people household radios or have public broadcasting areas we could educate them about appropriate matters and their rights simply by educating comedians and actors and encouraging them to talk about the issues. On this, we should also see to find the best radio spectrum for broadcasting such things, and seek legal control over it.

6. Internal affairs. [[https://www.aclu-nj.org/theissues/policepractices/crisis-continues-inside-police-internal-affairs/]] "“The average citizen encounters numerous obstacles to registering a complaint. Finding information about how to file a complaint is an immediate barrier. Then, contrary to the law, many police departments insist that complaints be submitted in person and that juveniles cannot file reports without a parent present. Most departments surveyed are not able to accommodate non-English speakers. Many said they would report complainants who were undocumented to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Police employees who fielded our calls too often took on a tone of hostility or defensiveness. These and other obstacles discourage community members from lodging complaints against police officers.”" We need to research their access to the public, whether people can anonymously report issues, whether they allow third party complaints, whether they allowed minors, whether they allowed immigrants or people of certain races to report. We need to address any of those issues. We then need to ensure they have strong powers to punish people and do so in a transparent manner. Do they have backing from the local government if they do try to fire a police officer? Is there any civilian oversight?
