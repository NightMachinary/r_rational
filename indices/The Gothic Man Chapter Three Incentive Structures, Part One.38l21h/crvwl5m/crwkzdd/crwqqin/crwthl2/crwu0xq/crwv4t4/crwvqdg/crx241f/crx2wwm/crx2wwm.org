  Maybe my mistake is taking you to task for statements made within quotes you used to support your plans on what Bruce Wayne should push for. It's hard to know how much of the contents of your own post you agree with when they are short excerpts of a paper you selected as being relevant.

I agree with the posts, you seem to be taking them further than I stated.

Again, I am just saying that the paper noted that countries that were ruled by britain and had common law had lower corruption. You are free to look up the paper if you want further details. I am not saying it is physically impossible to have less corrupt systems, I am not saying that common law is always better, I am not making many arguments that I nor the paper never made, just what is stated. I agree with the paper's maths, I don't agree with your made up view for me and the paper.

  I am of course only talking about bribery done in foreign jurisdictions. The kind of bribery that both doesn't really harm your own constituency and is only such a small fraction of the total amount of bribery going on in the foreign country in question (most of the cases probably being local) that taking actions to inhibit it probably won't have much of an effect on the policies of the corrupt government in question.

If you exclude bribery to the sort of which there are no negative consequences then predictably there will be no negative consequences.

Anyway, in reality there are notable positive and negative sides to bribery.

Bribery can have a local or countrywide impact on the moral fabric of society, increasing corruption and misallocation of resources. The constituency probably is being harmed since the business is focusing on helping those that bribe it and ignoring everyone else.

It can lead to corruption purges that ruin the reputation of the company.

It can lead to massive amounts of money being wasted and businesses going into the red.

It can lead to crappy people who suck at work and rushed cheap jobs.

It can lead to other businesses harassing you for giving bribes.

It can also lead to those in poverty having decent wages, smoothing over of bureaucratic issues as you said.

All of those things can go on simultaneously. They don't necessarily involve any criminal activity, especially since you can pay the police off to look the other way if someone dies or gets poisoned, but they can have an immensely negative impact on the reputation of companies and countries, hence why many want to reduce bribery or regulate it.

From my experience with countries where bribery is common it's not so good for those who aren't rich enough to afford lots of bribes.
