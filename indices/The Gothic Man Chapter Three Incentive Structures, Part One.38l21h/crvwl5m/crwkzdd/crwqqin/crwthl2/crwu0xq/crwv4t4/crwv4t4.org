  not a negative comment about British ruled countries.

I'm not trying to say that the common law system is objectively worse than the civil law system, just that I fail to see how it has been proven to be objectively /better/.

  And lack of laws not imported.

I'm confused regarding what you mean by that.

On the topic of corruption abroad, is it weird that I wouldn't support the scrupulous persecution of locally based corporations for bribery related crimes abroad? It would make them rather uncompetitive within corrupt nations where bribery is a daily fact of life. Which in turn would mean less taxes and employment with little positive change in return, including for the corrupt countries where a fraction of bribes coming from out of country were now stopped.

To give an example: Persecuting US corporations for bribing Chinese agencies would give no benefit to the US government or its citizen. It would also change nothing in China for the better so long as it isn't coupled with some kind of much more large scale anti-corruption sanctions.
