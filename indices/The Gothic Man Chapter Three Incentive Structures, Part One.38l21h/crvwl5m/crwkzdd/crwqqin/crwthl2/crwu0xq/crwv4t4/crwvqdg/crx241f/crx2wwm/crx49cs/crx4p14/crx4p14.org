Since we both agree that bribery is quite negative for countries I won't contest that. More ethical countries have a reputation for low corruption that they want to uphold and empathy for the suffering of countries, as does Bruce Wayne, so they want to reduce bribery. They generally don't accept the argument that a little cruelty is ok because everyone is doing it.

As such, they prefer to get deals via diplomacy, where they get politicians in their country to pressure governments to let them have contracts.

  I don't see why potentially harming their own reputation should be a crime.

Bribery is generally illegal and crimes that harm the reputation of a country are more likely to be prosecuted.

  I seem to be too tired to see how bribes in particular cause that.

Bribery selects for the most corrupt person doing the job, and the most corrupt person often does a crap job.

  If all you do is restrict your citizens from low level participation in corruption abroad (bribes vs actively supporting corruption) then you only very marginally do anything positive abroad and you definitely don't help your citizen. In fact you probably just harm them economically. Making it illegal to do worse things (like destroying the environment, putting employees abroad in danger or exploiting them or even funding violence) I can perfectly understand though.

Low level bribes includes bribing the media and local officials to not care when you do dangerous things. If you allow bribery with few restrictions then the inevitable corruption will lessen your ability to stop them bribing away crimes.
