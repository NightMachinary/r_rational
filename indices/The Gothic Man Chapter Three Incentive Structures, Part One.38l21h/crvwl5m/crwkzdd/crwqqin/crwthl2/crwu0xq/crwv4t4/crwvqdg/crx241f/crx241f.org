  I'm not sure why you feel a need to repeatedly take me for task for a general statement I never made.

Maybe my mistake is taking you to task for statements made within quotes you used to support your plans on what Bruce Wayne should push for. It's hard to know how much of the contents of your own post you agree with when they are short excerpts of a paper you selected as being relevant.

  You could require bribes to be registered instead for example and check that each was legitimate.

I am of course only talking about bribery done in foreign jurisdictions. The kind of bribery that both doesn't really harm your own constituency and is only such a small fraction of the total amount of bribery going on in the foreign country in question (most of the cases probably being local) that taking actions to inhibit it probably won't have much of an effect on the policies of the corrupt government in question.

And of course I am only talking about the crime of bribery. If the corporation uses said bribes in order to directly harm the environment or the foreign country's population without local consequences then that is a different crime of which prosecution back home should be considered. But there are many countries where getting even regular permits, having smooth bureaucratic processes and avoiding undue harassment all requires various bribes. I currently live in a country where this was the case until very recently at least for medium size businesses and even individual entanglements with the bureaucracy. Bribing isn't always a preface for larger scale criminal activity.
