The civil forfeiture issue.

Popular among police, the basic idea is that if something is involved with a crime then the police can seize that because there's a crime involved. You can seize the drug plane of someone smuggling drugs even if the owner is in another country and thus can't be taken to trial.

The problem with this is that if you make it not based on a vigilante smashing things up but based off the police doing it they may use it as an excuse to loot the poor who can't complain and get rich.

Studies on asset forfeiture have often shown that this is what happens. Rather than confiscating the factory that's used to push drugs and illegal weapons into cities low and mid level dealers are targetted, along with many innocents who can't easily say no.

If he does this wrong he'll make the police into another gang with the legal right to steal from the poor.

As such, he should have several requirements.

1. Proceeds of seizure don't go to police, they go to education, charity, positive causes, whatever.

2. There is a reasonable standard of evidence that whatever property is being used for criminal purposes, and a minimum limit on the value of that property, ideally connected with a criminal conviction. You can't just take property based on a suspicion it's being used for crime.

3. Open and transparant procedures to get property unseized and to detail why property was seized.
