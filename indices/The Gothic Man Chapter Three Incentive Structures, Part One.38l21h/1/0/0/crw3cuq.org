Yeah, sounds good. Stuff like funding schools, making houses for the poor, making jobs for the poor, all with auditing. I'm not too fussy on exactly what they do, the other option was just smashing them up, so long as they have a vaguely positive impact.

You could have the local community vote on what is done with them. That would give them an incentive to turn in crime bosses. Reveal their crimes, your neighborhood gets a new school/ church/ factory/ bar/ apartment.
