Stylistic nitpick for the beginning: You're doing a cold open. From my perspective, characters to track are:

- Speaker 1
- Speaker 2
- 'She' from paragraph 4
- Man in front of Peter
- The "Them" who might eat some of the corpse
- Guy in spectacles
- Ben
- Alabaster woman

I think there's some overlap. But its the kind of thing where I have to go back and re-read.

I'd drop a couple paragraph breaks, and just commit to the distant 3rd person you're using elsewhere. Sarah seems to be the viewpoint, and since she knows Peter is her familiar, we can just acknowledge that, with her reactions, in paragraph 2.

--------------

Some logistic details: You're not going to drag a person with broken knees through a forest and have them conscious/not screaming. The characters would have to be very cruel to try.

And a woman dragging ~200 lbs of dead weight through a forest is athletically impressive, especially if she can banter while she's doing it

Bleeding dude will leave one hell of a trail if you're worried about being followed.

--------------

World building: You're using real places in an unreal setting. Identifying all those accents means that your narrator is extremely well traveled, and several centuries old, since she know about Mongol ships and Frisbees.

That seems incongruous when you put it up against the bad tradecraft in the first chapter.

None of the characters seem particularly worried about surveillance by the locals. So, if their goal is a mutually-cautious talk, they could just go somewhere public and near guards. That way, neither can start shooting.

If the main characters are forced to accept Cynisus' terms, then I'd send the rat to scout, as opposed to jogging on to the store.

I'm also confused about the other patrons who showed up. Are the extremely bad body guards? Or are they actually bystanders? I think they kinda stood around after the main characters shot a dude (5 rounds left), used magic, and then sewed his lips up with thread for some reason.
