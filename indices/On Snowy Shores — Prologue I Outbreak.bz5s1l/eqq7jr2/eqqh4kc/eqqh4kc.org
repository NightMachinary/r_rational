To start off with, dropping your reader into the middle of your setting without any preamble explaining what they're getting into is a really bold choice. Maybe too bold. If you were a writer I'd spent a lot of time reading, I'd trust that all of that detail would be filled in later. That's an awful lot of trust to extend to someone I'm unfamiliar with, though.

Next, it's very dialogue- and action-heavy, with almost everything else being visuals. We don't get into the characters' heads very much at all, and there's not a lot of setting exposition going on. It doesn't give me much time to breathe and absorb what's going on, and, as previously noted, there's not a lot of context that's being explained, so there's a lot that just doesn't make sense to me yet.

What isn't dialogue tends towards the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_prose][purple]]. And while that can be an appropriate stylistic choice, you have your characters talking in very plainspoken dialogue, and when that's interwoven with purple descriptions of the action and the visuals, it's giving me tonal whiplash.

And a prologue should generally accomplish one or both of two things: it establishes the tone of the work, and/or introduces the audience to the central conflict of the work. At the end of the third part of the prologue... I can't really say that I know what either is supposed to be.

Finally, unrelated to my impression of the work itself... By the sound of it ("spent the last four months writing and decided for a total rewrite"), you got a good part of the way into the story before deciding to stop and start over (I apologize if that's not the case). As someone who has read a lot of advice on writing, and who has many times gotten stuck on the write/get halfway/rewrite/get halfway/rewrite cycle... I'd advise you to finish off the work first, and /then/ start rewriting it. Getting to the ending is the hard part; going back and fixing the parts that made you cringe along the way is a lot easier. And, the second time through, it's a lot easier to put everything in place if you know where everything will need to be at the end.

I hope this helps.
