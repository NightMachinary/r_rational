Wow, this is some fantastic critique! Thanks for putting in the effort to write this.

Having finished the first arc, I found myself immensely dissatisfied with it, hence the rewrite. Getting the first few chapter right is important, need das hook. The prologue is an interesting thing, the main story will be in first person, I've considered third-person heavily, getting into characters' heads is challenging.

I hate giving exposition. It feels cheap and cheesy to do, however, it will become a necessity when the main protagonist takes center stage. Coloring the world from his view is something I've been prepping, and it's going to require a lot of peering through his perspective. I've learned to try and flex show-not-tell. I hope to show the world piece by piece in the future, bringing a world to life has required a shocking amount of research, reading history books, acquainting myself with other cultures, and trying to capture how people would speak in this world. I don't want my story to tire people out, I remember reading Wildbow's /Pact/ and that was a emotionally draining read. Breathing space to fill in those missing lines of world-building through dialogue and scenery is something I didn't wholly consider.

Purple is something I didn't even consider when writing, nor have I heard about it until now. That's something that will disappear after the prologue, but if you hadn't told me, the future interludes would've continued doing that. Thank you.
