I will read your work soon, but before that, I need to convey that giving exposition is not a sin. It's mandatory, even! It's only distasteful if you did it in the beginning of a story without having much else going on. In other words, exposition dump. Also, in-media-res demand exceptional writing skill. I'm interested to see how good you are given your insistence on doing it. I'll write my evaluation on a review once I'm done.
