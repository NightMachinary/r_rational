Hello, I'm CremeCrimson, and I am writing /On Snowy/ /Shores,/ a hybrid of high/low fantasy and urban fantasy. I've spent the last four months writing and decided for a total rewrite, starting with adding to the prologue. I would appreciate constructive criticism that the rational community could provide.

Please enjoy.

I insist.
