Boring (but true) answer:

Such a timer is impossible--or at least, it's impossible if it /only/ does what it's advertised to do (which is display someone's date of death), and nothing else. To be more precise, there exists no timeline such that (a) humans exist, (b) the timer exists and is accessible to said humans, and (c) that timeline is self-consistent. But of course all possible timelines /must/ be self-consistent, which means that there /are/ no timelines in which this hypothetical timer exists and is accessible to humans. Therefore, asking us to imagine such a timer is equivalent to saying "Imagine you had a device that could force 2 + 2 to equal 3." The only correct answer you can give is "No can do; it's impossible."

(If the timer is actually a reality-warping device that violates ordinary causality in order to force its own predictions to come true, then it /could/ actually exist. If you were extremely unwise, you could then attempt to use the timer as an [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/][Outcome Pump]] and end up inadvertently causing a series of huge disasters because Outcome Pumps are not Friendly.)
