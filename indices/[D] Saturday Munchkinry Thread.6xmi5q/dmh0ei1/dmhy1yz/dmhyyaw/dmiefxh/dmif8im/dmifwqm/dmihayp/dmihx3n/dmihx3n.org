  Our positions are not symmetrical. You seem to be claiming (at times) that my setup is logically impossible; the onus is 100% on you to justify this claim.
#+end_quote

My claim is that your setup leads to inconsistencies, yes. I already gave my argument as to why it leads to inconsistencies: time-travel does not have a natural tendency to generate self-consistent timelines, so there's no reason to suppose that said timelines exist. Your counterargument (so far as I can tell) is literally "well maybe it /does/". Do I really have to "disprove" an argument of /this/ caliber? How do you suggest I go about doing so?

  How do you know this? Perhaps the laws of the fictional universe where the Foundation is investigating the timer were actually designed with the timer in mind.
#+end_quote

Okay, so /give an example/. Give me a set of laws of physics--/any/ laws--that has the property you describe. Because right now, I can't even /imagine/ such a set of laws, and my hunch is that you can't either (otherwise you would have described them in your initial reply).

#+begin_quote
  The function was not chosen randomly. In my hypothetical, the function was chosen by a designer, who designed it in such a way that the timer would exist.
#+end_quote

There is literally no reason to suppose either (a) that this /is/ the case, or that (b) such a function is /possible/. Again, you have given no examples of a function that behaves this way, and until you do, it's all just nonsense.

#+begin_quote
  If you don't see a reason to consider my hypothesis, then don't. But don't go around saying that it is "impossible" (or that certain claims are "false") when what you actually mean is that it's not clear whether they are possible.
#+end_quote

You haven't even given a coherent way to guarantee that they're /not/ impossible. My point is that without such a guarantee, the probability of them turning out to be possible is /literally 0/.

*EDIT:* Also, I'm puzzled by your assertion that the onus is on me to disprove your claim. You have provided a claim with zero justification behind it; how the /hell/ is it my job to disprove it, especially when it's as vague as it is?
