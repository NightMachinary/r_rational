  However, I think it's more likely that the machine would cause all of the astronauts to get diarrhea on the day of the launch or get hit by a car and break a leg, or something. The rocket doesn't have to be the thing that fails.

That would also be interesting just as a way of gathering data - if there were life on Mars, the rocket would be more likely to take off, so we can lower our probability estimate. Enough similarish trials can get you a lot of bits of evidence for/against something.
