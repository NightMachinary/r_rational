Robert Heinlein's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-Line][Life-Line]] (full text available [[http://www.baen.com/Chapters/0743471598/0743471598___2.htm][at Baen's site]]), features such a machine. IIRC the story talks about how it would affect insurance companies.

There are a bunch of questions that such device would raise, for example:

- What's the precision of the information?
- How does it work wrt human constructs of date/time (e.g. leap seconds, time zones)?
- How does it work wrt time dilation effects?
- Where does the energy to prevent the early deaths or ensure the timely deaths comes from?
- What does death mean? Can the dead person be later resurrected? Could the dead be cryopreserved and thawed later on or they would be dead forever?
- What counts as human beings? What would it show for people that are already brain dead?

We can probably get FTL communication out of it, maybe even free energy and entropy reversal, depending on how it behaves.
