Imagine a timer which, when held, displays the date on which the holder will die. Works only on human beings.

All attempts to avoid dying on the provided date meet with failure. Refuse to go on a dangerous mission, a car accident kills you instead. Try to shoot yourself a day early and the gun misfires.

I've been thinking about trying to write an SCP about this item. What are some non-obvious things you could do with it?

Keep in mind that a lot of bad things could happen to you short of death. Jumping off a building while shouting "I am invincible!" (because the timer has told you will not die today) might land you in an excruciatingly painful near-death state.
