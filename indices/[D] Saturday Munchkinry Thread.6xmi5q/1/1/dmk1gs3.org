Well, there's an obvious right answer here: +free the benevolent genie+.

Basically, there's two possibilities: either the Library is a malevolent bounded wish-granting omniscient being, or a benevolent one. If former, you've most likely already lost; if you didn't, you should run away from this place and never come back.

If latter, you should word you request in such a way as to force the Library itself to decide what book to create. PtV-lite? Self-help books that let you self-modify into superintelligence? A "Write Your FAI In N Easy Steps" book? Outcome pumps, prophetic books? Those are all ideas baseline humans came up with. An actual superintelligence would think of something /much/ better, so, my idea:

Specify "a book which is the best book for me to find in this situation".
