In response to [[/u/vi_fi]]'s work, and my response to it. Spoilers for the latest chapter of [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/27124041][The Library Unpublished]]

  36) I woke up hungover and disoriented. It was raining outside. I wondered what... oh shoot, Sein was in the library and I needed to... I had already been to the library? My memory was a disoriented mess of fragments and I seemed to recall dying multiple times, being brainwashed by a cult, and obtaining near omnipotence at the expense of losing my ability/interest to return to ordinary reality. The most recent memory was accepting my own death in an attempt to avoid suffering. Worse yet, my thoughts felt off, as though they were being generated by a different source than usual. I checked the time and the date... had I not even left to rescue Sein yet? Well, assuming I wasn't insane, I think I knew the "winning" strategy, save for the fact that the chance of self-modifying would become addictive. The "winning" ending also seemed to have made a logical error... Sein had somehow been able to get text out the library so it wasn't true that I couldn't take anything out. I just needed to restrict what I wanted to take out to a single book bags worth (and avoid a runaway feedback loop of self-modification). It would also help to write into existence a useful book to use ahead of time. I had just the idea... I could make a reddit post and get munchkining ideas for the best books to take out. The post's responses itself would be sufficient to write books into existence.

And the rules for those that don't plan on reading it:

  After a few minutes of writing and a few hours of searching, as my books did not turn up in the Index, I had established some ground rules. The Library had a very specific notion of what counted as a book. Books made of non-typical materials were out, as were sentient books, magic books and (sadly) rocket launcher books. However, books with information that was unknown to me were possible, as were books with subtle but mundane effects. For example, implementing something like the King in Yellow wouldn't have been possible by stating it to be magic, but stating it to be a particularly maddening and insidious piece of poetry was possible. After all, even something as innocuous as Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther had driven people to suicide.
