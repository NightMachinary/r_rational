I mean for one it's pretty trivial to hook up any number of complex systems designed to kill somebody unless a given event happens. All you need to do is ensure the likelihood of your system failing is less than the likelihood of the thing you're trying to force to occur.

So with a reliable enough method you can definitely leverage the future to a staggering degree with many, many probability pumps.
