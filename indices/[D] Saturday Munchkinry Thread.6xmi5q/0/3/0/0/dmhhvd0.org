I'm not thinking of anything concrete right now, but physics is very finicky about space and time, so depending on how the time of death works (e.g. ignores time dilation effects) or how the effort to ensure the timely of the death works (e.g. entropy reversal shenanigans) we could end up with something that violates locality or some other essential law.
