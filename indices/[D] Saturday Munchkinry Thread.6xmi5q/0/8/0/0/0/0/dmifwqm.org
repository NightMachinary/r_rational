  If you want to say my setup is impossible, give a proof of the impossibility (at any level of formality).

This is not proper debating procedure, but if you were using this as a rhetorical technique to force me to admit that I cannot /prove/ my assertion in the strictest sense, then fine, I do admit that. This doesn't actually impact the argument much, though.

  There are tons of theorems in math that say that under such and such conditions functions have fixed points. I fail to see why someone could not design the laws of the universe to make the map have a fixed point.
#+end_quote

There may be "tons" of functions that have fixed points, but there are tons /more/ (literally 100% more, in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics][measure-theoretic sense]]) that don't. For any arbitrary function that you pluck out of thin air, the probability that it has a fixed point the way you describe is mathematically 0, and the laws of the universe are /not/ designed with time-travel in mind.

That alone pretty much suffices to demonstrate that you're not getting a fixed point in your function that comes out of literally nowhere. If you want to say that the laws of the universe are such that the existence of a fixed point is certain (why? how?), the onus is on /you/ to give /me/ a proof (at any level of formality); otherwise there's no reason to even consider the hypothesis.

Of course, you can't actually give me such a proof, just as I can't give you a proof of /impossibility/. So I suppose one possible claim someone might think to make is that because our positions happen to be symmetrical in this one respect, they are equally likely to be correct. This claim would be [[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/01/05/they-must-not-teach-probability-in-seminary-school/][false]], of course.

*EDIT:* I was using a slightly different computational model than you were when writing that section, sorry. To be more precise, I was using Yudkowsky's model presented [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/fok/causal_universes/][here]], but in the interest of saving you the time of reading a decently lengthy article (unless of course you want to!), here's the relevant bit:

#+begin_quote
  Suppose we had a more complicated set of cellular automaton rules, on a vastly larger grid, such that the cellular automaton was large enough, and supported enough complexity, to permit people to exist inside it and be computed. Presumably, if we computed out cell states in the ordinary way, each future following from its immediate past, the people inside it would be as real as we humans computed under our own universe's causal physics.

  Now suppose that instead of computing the cellular automaton causally, we hack the rules of the automaton to add large time-travel loops - change their physics to allow Time-Turners - and with an unreasonably large computer, the size of two to the power of the number of bits comprising an entire history of the cellular automaton, we enumerate all possible candidates for a universe-history.

  So far, we've just generated all 2^{N} possible bitstrings of size N, for some large N; nothing more. You wouldn't expect this procedure to generate any people or make any experiences real, unless enumerating all finite strings of size N causes all lawless universes encoded in them to be real. There's no causality there, no computation, no law relating one time-slice of a universe to the next...

  Now we set the computer to look over this entire set of candidates, and mark with a 1 those that obey the modified relations of the time-traveling cellular automaton, and mark with a 0 those that don't.
#+end_quote

My claim was basically that there are some bitstrings that get marked with 0, and some that get marked with 1 (a claim you find unobjectionable, I hope!). And if all the bitstrings that could reasonably be described as "intelligent beings try to hack time travel" get marked with a 0, I hope you also agree that this is simply how thing /are/, with no way of altering the situation.

Yes, there is an "if" there in that last sentence; that is very intentional. The reason this isn't a motte-and-bailey is because I'm not attempting to swap between these two arguments; they're two different arguments that are related but distinct, and I'm arguing both simultaneously. This second argument is aimed at your (implied) claim that it's possible to somehow fix the "all bitstrings in a certain set getting marked with a 0" problem by grafting on a set of extra laws(?), which makes no sense whatsoever.
