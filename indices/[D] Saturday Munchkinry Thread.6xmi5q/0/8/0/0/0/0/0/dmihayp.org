Our positions are not symmetrical. You seem to be claiming (at times) that my setup is logically impossible; the onus is 100% on you to justify this claim.

  ... and the laws of the universe are not designed with time-travel in mind.

How do you know this? Perhaps the laws of the fictional universe where the Foundation is investigating the timer were actually designed with the timer in mind.

#+begin_quote
  There may be "tons" of functions that have fixed points, but there are tons more (literally 100% more, in a measure-theoretic sense) that don't. For any arbitrary function that you pluck out of thin air, the probability that it has a fixed point the way you describe is mathematically 0, and the laws of the universe are not designed with time-travel in mind.
#+end_quote

The function was not chosen randomly. In my hypothetical, the function was chosen by a designer, who designed it in such a way that the timer would exist.

#+begin_quote
  If you want to say that the laws of the universe are such that the existence of a fixed point is certain (why? how?), the onus is on you to give me a proof (at any level of formality); otherwise there's no reason to even consider the hypothesis.
#+end_quote

If you don't see a reason to consider my hypothesis, then don't. But don't go around saying that it is "impossible" (or that certain claims are "false") when what you actually mean is that it's not clear whether they are possible.
