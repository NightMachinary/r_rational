You seem to be using the words "false" and "impossible" in ways that deviate from their usual meaning.

#+begin_quote
  You seem to be making this assumption for literally no reason except to make the situation you describe possible,
#+end_quote

Correct.

If you want to say my setup is impossible, give a proof of the impossibility (at any level of formality).

There are tons of theorems in math that say that under such and such conditions functions have fixed points. I fail to see why someone could not design the laws of the universe to make the underlying map I described have a fixed point.

#+begin_quote
  the fact that you have an "adversarial" human intelligence trying to actively mess up your timer's predictions for their own benefit may simply lead to there being no fixed point possible.
#+end_quote

First: "adversarial human intelligence" is nothing more than a way of talking about entries of a function in my simulation sketch.

Second: Here you seem to have hedged your claim with that word "may." I agree this /may/ be impossible, but that does not mean it's actually impossible.

*Edit:* After I wrote the above, you added the following:

#+begin_quote
  there is no set of "technical reasons relating to the mathematics of the laws of the universe" that can fix this issue. We're talking about an inconsistency in the most fundamental sense here: for every causal chain of events involving some kind of time-travel analogue, either it successfully loops back on itself or it does not
#+end_quote

This doesn't make sense to me (or, alternatively, it needs to be spelled out more). What does it mean to "loop back" or not? There is no actual time travel in the scenario I've sketched out -- just finding maps of fixed points. '

And then there is your next sentence which says "*if* all chains..." Your argument seems to be a motte-and-bailey trick -- you claim "this is impossible" but when asked to provide reasons you only justify the weaker claim "this may be impossible."
