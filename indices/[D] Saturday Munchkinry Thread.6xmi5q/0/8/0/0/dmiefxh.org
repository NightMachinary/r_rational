  For various technical reasons relating to the mathematics of the laws of the universe, such a fixed point always exists.

Yes, this is the part that is false. You seem to be making this assumption for literally no reason /except/ to make the situation you describe possible, when in fact it's almost certain that the /opposite/ is true: the fact that you have an "adversarial" human intelligence trying to actively mess up your timer's predictions for their own benefit may simply lead to there being /no fixed point possible/.

Moreover, there is no set of "technical reasons relating to the mathematics of the laws of the universe" that can fix this issue. We're talking about an inconsistency in the most fundamental sense here: for every causal chain of events involving some kind of time-travel analogue, either it successfully loops back on itself or it does not, and if all causal chains within a certain subset (for instance, the set of all chains that involve humans playing around with a death-prediction device) turn out to fall into that second category, that's just how the solution space happens to be structured.

  For example, it could be that whatever happens is ironic or gruesome. In the simulation scenario above, perhaps I will examine all the fixed points and choose the one where the user of the timer suffers the most. It isn't merely poor modeling or inability to predict the possibilities that is the issue, but actual malice.

Yes, this is more or less what I described in my initial comment, except that (a) you replaced reality warping with the whole fixed point idea, and (b) replaced neutrality with malice. The first change doesn't really work (see above), and the second isn't really necessary--I already opined that trying to use an Outcome Pump to perform significant optimization would likely lead to disaster, and this is true regardless of whether there's actually a malevolent intelligence inside of said Pump.
