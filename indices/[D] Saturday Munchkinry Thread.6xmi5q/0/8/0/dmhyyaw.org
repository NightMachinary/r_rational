I don't really understand the distinction between doing "only" what it's advertised to do and "reality warping." Some level of "reality warping" necessarily happens in the trivial sense that your behavior will be different if you use the device as opposed to the counterfactual when you don't.

*Edit:* for example, here is how it could work.

- The universe is a simulation.

- The simulation is described by an 4 dimensional array (3 spatial dimensions and a time dimension). Each entry in the array tells me whether a particle is present at a certain location at a certain time.

- This array satisfies some deterministic relationships (i.e., "laws of nature").

- Given the state of the whole array at time t, these relationships allow you to compute the state at all future times.

- I am a being outside the universe (perhaps the simulation is running on my laptop).

- Once I detect a human being in the simulation holding the timer I search over all the possible things I could choose the timer to display and compute the evolution of the universe. Out of all the possibilities, I find a "fixed point" so the displayed time of death is accurate.

- For various technical reasons relating to the mathematics of the laws of the universe, such a fixed point always exists.

Note that *all* the timer does is this scenario is display a time, and otherwise reality proceeds using the same laws as always. Any "reality warping" effect comes only through the way people respond to what the timer shows.

As for using it as a probability pump, there is a further problem. There is no guarantee that all the ways in which you could die on a certain date will happen in any uniform way.

For example, it could be that whatever happens is ironic or gruesome. In the simulation scenario above, perhaps I will examine all the fixed points and choose the one where the user of the timer suffers the most. It isn't merely poor modeling or inability to predict the possibilities that is the issue, but actual malice.
