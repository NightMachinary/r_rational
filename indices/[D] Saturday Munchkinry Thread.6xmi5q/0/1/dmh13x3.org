Sending people with long lifespans on a one way trip to Mars. They can't die, so they must discover alien life or something.

That or the rocket fails to get them to Mars. But how could it? If the rocket explodes, they die, so that can't happen. Especially if you surround the rocket launch zone with a bunch of people with long lifespans too. With enough of them, the improbability of finding life on Mars should become less than the improbability of a rocket refusing to launch several times in a row without killing any of the several fragile people in incredibly precarious positions.
