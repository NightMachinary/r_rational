Keep in mind that the machine can manipulate future events but not past events. If there is life on Mars, there has been life on Mars for a long time, and if there isn't life on Mars, there hasn't been life on Mars for a long time and the machine can't retroactively magic it into existence. The most it could do is convince aliens to stop by Mars at exactly that right time.

However, I think it's more likely that the machine would cause all of the astronauts to get diarrhea on the day of the launch or get hit by a car and break a leg, or something. The rocket doesn't have to be the thing that fails.
