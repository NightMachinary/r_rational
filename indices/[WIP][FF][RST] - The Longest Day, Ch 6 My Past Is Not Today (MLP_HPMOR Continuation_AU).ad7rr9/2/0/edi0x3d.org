If you recall in HPMOR, McGonagall draws a distinction between "free Transfiguration" (the arbitrary transformation of one substance into another) and "Transfiguration Charms" (highly structured charms for a specific purpose). The preservation of Aberforth's head would fall under the latter category. Something along the same lines one might use to preserve a human corpse for the purpose of making a Mummy or an Inferi, neither of which wear off upon the caster's death.
