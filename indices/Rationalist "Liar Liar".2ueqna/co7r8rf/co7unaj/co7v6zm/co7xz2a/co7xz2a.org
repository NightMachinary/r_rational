Pseudorandom means that it appears to be random but is in fact deterministic, as in 'can be calculated with full knowledge of the system'. A true random number is not. There are processes that yield true randomness (at least according to current understanding of Quantum Mechanics), e.g. radioactive decay. Also interesting in this context is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon][Laplace's demon]].
