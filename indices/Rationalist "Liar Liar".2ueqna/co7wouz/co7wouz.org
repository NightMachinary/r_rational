Spend an hour or two here convincing people that I knew the right answers to questions that I should not have answers to, and then start answering their questions and encouraging them to find people to ask me more questions.

I would probably also need to get someone to vet questions to prevent duplication, or just ask myself before answering every question if I have already provided the answer.
