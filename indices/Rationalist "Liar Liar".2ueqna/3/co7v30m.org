It really depends on what creates the apparent "truth field" effect (henceforth TFE).

1. If there's some entity controlling what you say (to ensure it isn't false), it could always make you say something different or nothing at all. I.e. it could stop you from blurting out something crucial without invalidating the TFE.
2. If you can only say things you personally know to be true (or at least could verify), it's not worth much at all.
3. If you have rough control over what you say, but TFE forces your sentences into a truthful conclusion (or otherwise twists your intended speech wholesale while staying relevant), you can potentially rig things. This is really the only way you can do anything useful; in any other model you're more or less a meat puppet for the voice of truth or just a hamstrung version of yourself.

So assuming that 3 is true (i.e. you can choose what to speculate about and where possible get a meaningful result), you've got a few interesting options:

1. Determine the shortest path of actions you can personally and reasonably take to complete whatever goal you wish. As long as this path can be said within 24 hours, you can theoretically do anything within your power.
2. Predict the future, forcing the universe inexorably onto that path - though with no personal input on what that path is, you may end up as a Cassandra-style prophet.
3. Try a sentence of the format "The quickest reasonable method to synthesise the data needed for <x> is...". Again, that's a shortest path thing. You should qualify it with "including the time it takes to describe the method" to ensure you save real time. This lets you use existing data as a shortcut, rather than just manually blurting out the raw data.
4. "Given my values and my current unusual situation, my optimal reasonable course of action is..."

Really, all you need is 4.
