Testing:

1. Generate a pseudorandom number, then try to guess it.
2. Same with a true random number. (This test does not say much.)
3. First guess, then generate.

If all 3 succeed, exploit the time loop: Spend 12 hours asking yourself about the notes you will write (marked in some way, like yelling a password after writing them), then proceed as recommended in the notes, then spend a few years optimizing the notes you could send yourself and finally write them down.

The only consistent timeline has notes you can not improve upon (or a 'DO NOT MESS WITH TIME'). As you can spend 12 hours transcribing them at a rate of maybe 1 bit/s you have 5.3 KB, using some compression you maybe could get 20-50 KB text out of them. As the final notes will include spending the remaining time on transcribing more notes you arrive at 40-100 KB of information (I personally would expect them to be mostly theoretical, as many of these questions can be answered consisely: 'P!=NP', 'Theorem X is true/false/unproveable')
