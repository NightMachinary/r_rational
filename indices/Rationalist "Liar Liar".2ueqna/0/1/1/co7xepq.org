As the number is determined before you test it, you are merely inquiring about the state of the system. The difference to #1 is that it is impossible to deduce from the previous state. Passing #2 would hint the power to have knowledge about the current state and not only extrapolating a previous one. I do not think #2 is impossible as long as the number is stored such that it can be observed.

While #1 tests whether you have access to information of a previous state, #2 the current state and #3 the future state. If you do in fact store the number unobservably #2 and #3 should become equivalent (as in this case it is not determined).
