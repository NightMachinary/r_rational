Do true random numbers actually exist?

I thought "psuedo-random" just meant that it was random as far as a normal human could tell, but not random as far as a /well informed/ human could.

"True random" would just mean that it's random as far as a well informed human could tell, but not as far as an omniscient intelligence could.

EDIT: Laplace's Demon was exactly what I was thinking of.
