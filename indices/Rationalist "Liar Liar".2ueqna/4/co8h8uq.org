- I'd spend an hour playing binary search to come up with winning numbers to two different lotteries.
- Then find the nearest life outside our solar system
- Binary search for the name (starting with languages and working down to name dictionaries) or location (google earth) of someone who can develop immortality within my lifetime
- Obviously magic is real, find a way to tap into it for after my 24 hours are up. Maybe I can duplicate the effect to give myself more time with it.

So I've got money, I've got a reason to live forever, and I've got an affordable (for me) method to live forever.
