You can (probably) become a lot stronger/faster if you have complete control. There's something called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_governor][governor theory]] which posits that there's something in your brain that stops you from using your body to its full extent. That comes on top of making your muscles stronger/faster/better, which you're presumably already doing.

You can remove pain, obviously. You'd still want feedback of some kind, but there's no real point in making it something that you can't ignore, or which debilitates you (stupid body).

Can you change gender or physical appearance? Or is it basically just at the limits of what a person could plausibly do without any power (badass normal)? Can you alter your DNA? If you have that level of control, you could clone yourself pretty easily. Or just turn into a cloud of spores. Or take over a person's mind. Depending on whether there are any limits, you would get into really crazy stuff.

You could study your micro-expressions and control them in order to become a really good liar. A polygraph would never work on you.

You would never need birth control again (or conversely, could get pregnant pretty much at will).
