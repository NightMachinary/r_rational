  The *central governor* is a proposed process in the brain that regulates exercise in regard to a neurally calculated safe exertion by the body. In particular, physical activity is controlled so that its intensity cannot threaten the body's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis][homeostasis]] by causing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)][anoxic]] damage to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_ischemia][heart muscle]]. The central governor limits exercise by reducing the neural recruitment of muscle fibers. This reduced recruitment causes the sensation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_fatigue][fatigue]]. The existence of a central governor was suggested to explain fatigue after prolonged strenuous exercise in long-distance running and other endurance sports, but its ideas could also apply to other causes of exertion-induced fatigue.
