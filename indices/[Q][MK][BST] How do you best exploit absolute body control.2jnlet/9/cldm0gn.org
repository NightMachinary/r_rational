  It is not possible to become grossly inhuman

This one bugs me. If there's control down to the nanoscopic scale, why on earth couldn't nonhuman forms be pushed for?

Essentially, where's the limit? Could the character reshape themselves into a neanderthal? A gorilla? A bear? Look at the most severe medical deformities and mutations on the books - what could be done with cellular-level control over teratomas, polydactyly, polymelia, dicephaly?

Look at human mutations and medical cases which enhance some aspect. Tetrachromacy, UV and IR sensitivity, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoception#In_humans][magnetoception]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haidinger's_brush][polarization sensitivity]], and so on. All kinds of enhancements.
