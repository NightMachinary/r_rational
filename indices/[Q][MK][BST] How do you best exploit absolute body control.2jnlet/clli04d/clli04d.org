Is it limited to cellular control? For example, if she were to eat the eye of an animal that has ultraviolet awareness, could she "understand" the eye, and modify her own to get ultraviolet vision? I doubt it, since eating would destroy the eye before it's considered "hers." But there may be a way to bypass that limitation. Something like skin-grafting, maybe?

Another idea: by consuming small doses of poison, she should be able to get immunity very fast, and maybe even get to synthetise it. A deliver mechanism would be more difficult to develop.

Elsewhere you said that severed tissue does not retain control. Did you consider the case when a severed limb is still alive? Like, rapidly implanted into someone else, or modify some of her cells to become virus-like and "infect" other people, to tag them. Maybe even giving limited control over their physiology (releasing hormones or painkillers to boost allies, for example.) This would easily spiral out of control and become too powerful, so to limit it, it may need a lot of concentration, having to fend-off the host's immune system constantly.

I think many uses would be chemical-oriented. I'd started making the liver bigger, since it's the chemical factory of the body, to have more to work with. Besides liver-things, I wonder if she could control the gas exhaled in respiration. Some kind of killer-kiss made of pure CO2 or pure oxygen?

Also, she has lots of intestinal bacteria to tinker with. But the delivery mechanism is the problem. I guess you don't want her flinging poo.

As far as delivery mechanisms go, we humans are fairly limited. Besides spit, what else do we have? Lots of ideas here, but they would require some major modifications. That's were my "eye" idea at the beginning would be required.

Another way would be to further the perfected physiology to beyond human, while retaining a human shape. For example, pre-programming reflexes. A reflex signal goes from the hand (for example) up the arm, to the brain, then back. If she modifies the nerves on the hand, creating some sort of mini-brain to control it without needing to go up to the main brain, response times would be vastly improved.

Or she can just modify her brain to give herself telepathy and control over bugs ;)
