Being able to grow new brain tissue (so damaging it isn't a problem, and you have unlimited tries) as well as locally and selectively disable immune response, and maybe small muscle clusters for generating electric current like those eels and such, would make brain machine interfaces trivial. Possibly to the point where it's more like growing an organic USB port.

There are a /bunch/ of ridiculously potent toxins with the exact formula know as well as being easy to make yourself entirely immune to once you know it.

Lots of systems are really only limited to conserve energy, going on full power only in rare emergencies. With a bit of tinkering you could get the thinking speed and strength of split second emergency response, constantly and without most of the downsides, for example.

Take that, and if you beef up your lungs and heart, add a coolant system (wich may very well be partially technological, extremely energy consuming, or at the very least rely on filling up on liters and liters of ice cubes), and disable safeties on damaging things you can repair easily, you can soup things up even more.

Temporarily turning of boredom, warning signals, induce hyper-focus, hunger, etc. means you could work like a machine singlemindedly on a single task for weeks just sitting in the bathroom with a laptop and a glass. Then you eat a lot.
