This sounds a lot like the Bene Gesserit or possibly the Tleilaxu from Dune, but without the galaxy wide conspiracies. You might get some ideas from those books or even Dune fanfiction.

If you can control everything in your body down to the molecular scale then breaking down cellulose into base sugars should allow you to eat very little of almost any plant, and you could create useful artificial chemicals, such as tritium, or nearly anything if down to the atomic scale.

Though that might make it completely overpowered.
