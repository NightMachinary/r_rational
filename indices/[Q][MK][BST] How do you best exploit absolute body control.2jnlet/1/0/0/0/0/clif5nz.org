I see two problems: overheating and short-term energy supply. Overheating comes from the increased activity. You can't eliminate heat just by shifting things in your body around.

Short term energy supply: increased activity means increased energy use. ATP is in extremely short supply and hard-limited by how fast you can recycle it chemically. Oxygen supply can be increased by forcing away diaphragm fatigue, but the alveoli already have nearly the maximum possible surface area and haemoglobin already has a near 100% affinity for oxygen. Once you run out of oxygen, you go down anaerobic pathways for energy. They are less efficient and accumulate cell-damaging acid in the muscles and blood. You character can't control chemical reactions, right? Then this is a weakness.
