Depending on what means "grossly inhuman", Alice (let's call her that) can alter herself pretty efficiently. For example, it may be possible to duplicate her brain (hide it inside the body, so nothing actually gross). She may then tinker with it (always keeping "backup" for safety), for example optimize it for performing rapid calculations and controlling of her ability, thus increasing speed to conscious levels (already x12 or even better if optimization worked). This may also make sleeping redundant (there are papers on sleep being mandatory to cleanse the brain).

Alice should study biology+chemistry, and study HARD. If she finds good scientists (who won't vivisect her on the spot) she can provide them alot of answers about human body. Also, with dedicated team, she should be able to engineer and craft different specialized self-replicating bacteria (and that's what Panacea should be doing instead of inefficiently healing people one-by-one).

Actually, depending on exact mechanism of "gross" limit, it may be possible to craft and eject "parts", designed to combine into "flesh golem" (working completely on regular biology). It may be possible to make this flesh golem Intelligent, Friendly and self-replicating. I don't need to tell what it means, not in this subreddit.
