I read a book series ([[http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/superpowereds/][Super Powereds]]) that features a character with similar powers, albeit faster, it seems. His name is Chad, and he's done stuff like bone sheaths on the outside of his skin, eidetic memory, and some other stuff. It may be worth reading for ideas, but the series is not from his POV
