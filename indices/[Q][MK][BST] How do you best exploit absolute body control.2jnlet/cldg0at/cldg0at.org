Er...if you're saying that you have total and complete control over a human sized bundle of mass down to the nano-level then there has got to be some better defined limitations in place here (or at the very least, an extreme rigor requirement for the language used to program the mass) because at this point I think it's harder to talk about what /can't/ be done.

As in literally - name almost any random thing which doesn't grossly violate the laws of physics, and we can probably figure out a way to accomplish it..

In other words, if you want to write a hard munchkinproof fiction you've got to start from something more well-defined. You can't start with intuition-driven nano-tweezers or you'll end up with rational! [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryb9IIiB100#t=6326][Tetsuo]]. It sounds like you want the powers to stay body-themed, so we should probably BST a set of premises which remains mostly within those constraints.
