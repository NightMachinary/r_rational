I can't answer this question unless I know what the character wants. Also, you should look up Sandersons laws of magic. “A character's weaknesses are more interesting than his or her abilities”

I've actually written a full length novel with a main character who has a similar, though much weaker power. He could self edit, but only at natural speeds. So for example he could regrow a limb, but it took a couple months for the flesh to grow.

He did many of the obvious things, of course. Upgrading touch until he could feel the footsteps of opponents, upgrading hearing until he had sonar and could hear heartbeats, upgrading smell to be better than a dog, upgrading taste until he could taste poison, things like that. He could put half his brain to sleep at a time, and so never sleep again, but it caused him to act oddly (Dolphins actually do this).

I explored the way he invaded everyone's privacy. There was one moment where he started smelling blood everywhere, then he realized it was menstrual blood. He could tell if someone was pregnant with a sniff. He could generally tell if someone was lying. Knew people better than they knew themselves.

I explored his ability to self-edit. He could make himself feel euphoria. He could orgasm with a thought. Could wire head himself at any time, for any reason. Could remove any pain or trauma. Magic in this world was tied to your emotions, where stronger emotions gave you more power, so he would make himself insane with rage or pain for short periods, then wipe the memories.

That said, all the best tricks were for specific opponents. At one point he was fighting vampires, so he changed the circulatory system so that major veins were deeper in the body, and what blood he did have was less useful to them. There was a fortress surrounded by a moat of poisonous gas that he needed to break into, so he made himself able to go for long periods without air. He threatened to become a typhoid Mary. There were people that used mind control, so he created a second brain (He could only use the brain for short periods, as otherwise it would overheat. Brain produces huge amounts of heat).

The entity that he got his power from was even stronger. It had turned all its enemies into giant worms that were immortal and exquisitely sensitive to pain, then turned them loose. The worms felt everything as pain, which caused them to thrash, which caused them to leak poisonous blood, which burned them even more, which caused them to thrash even more. The end result was that an entire ocean was poisoned and full of giant insane monsters constantly trying to kill themselves by attacking anything that they thought could threaten them. The entity also saved the brains of people who were exceptionally skilled or unique in some way, then gave their abilities to itself. It created a giant clone army, star-wars style, made out of half a dozen supremely skilled and loyal fighters.
