I was thinking mostly in terms of the character wanting to exert more effort or run faster... Humans produce lots of waste heat, yes, but it is short bursts and released for long after the exercise is over. To exceed your limits would mean to run against your body's capacity to regulate its internal temperature.

You see, the body is mostly a bag of water, and conduction of heat from the muscles to the blood, and from the blood to the skin, and from the skin to the sweat and air, is mostly done through aqueous conduction. Water is a poor heat conductor. There are limits to how much heat you can remove from the muscles over time.

The longer it goes on, the worse things get. The core temperature builds up, meaning the difference in temperature between muscles and the blood lowers.... Thermodynamically, lower heat difference means less joules can be transferred per second. Also, as the muscles heat up, the enzymes move outside of their optimal efficiency temperatures. Each mole of glucose you provide will give you less energy. It goes downhill from there. Your breathing is limited by how many times you can pulse the signal to the diaphragm per minute... Long story short, you won't be evacuating enough CO2. Its much more of a problem than providing O2. Once CO2 starts building up in the blood, there ability to regulate your blood's acid levels decreases. Enzyme efficiency is affected by your blood's pH too.

So while your character can push herself to her limits, she's going to run headlong into chemical barriers.

What I suggest is that she carries drugs and solutions with her. While a regular person would die from a litre of basic solution being pumped into them, she would be able to control her blood vessel pressure and osmotic pressure so that she could make use of that injection to quickly act against acidosis. A human would be greatly damaged from 100g of glucose being released directly into the blood, but she could artificially increase her insulin levels in preparation for the injection.

There are many things she could do like that. A regular human cannot prepare their body for treatment, while she can force her body into a short-term lethal situation in preparation of outside intervention,
