  How do you best exploit absolute body control?

--------------

But seriously.

#+begin_quote
  It includes full, constant awareness of everything inside body.
#+end_quote

Awareness does not equate to understanding. Unless you have a body OS already installed, or a masters in medicine or the like...

Actually, that sounds /seriously/ distracting. See brain enhancement notes, below.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Little to no sleep required.
#+end_quote

Nope, sleep is not a well understood effect, and might be structural to your huge humaniform brain.

Your...your mind /is/ still running on your brain, right? No way that isn't safetied. So too little sleep == damage. If anything, you'd be *less* able to intentionally miss sleep, as that might count as damaging and engages safeties.

#+begin_quote
  Improved productivity, by editing away how mental fatigue accumulates.
#+end_quote

Right, but again: how /exactly/ does this work? Unless your body control works on magic, or has instinctual or automatic elements, this won't work without a greater understanding of neuroanatomy than the vast majority of people actually have.

#+begin_quote
  Improved memory.

  Intelligence enhancements.
#+end_quote

Same issue, just more so. This is your /brain/. Safeties engage the moment you try to make it "better" with some abstract, pop-sci thing you came up with.

What I've got:

- Muscle fatigue disappears as recovery times and repair becomes instantaneous. You can run your body forever, any way you want.

- Not bruising or bleeding for significant amounts of time.

- No more coffee, as you can control attention and focus after reading up on what common drugs do to affect your systems and replicate this (carefully) through trying the drugs, then trial and error to get the same effects.

- Unaging, as all decay is stopped.
