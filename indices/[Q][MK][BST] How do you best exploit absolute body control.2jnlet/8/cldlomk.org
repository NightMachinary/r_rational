Get fat. Experiment in your fat deposits, preferably on the outer edge near the skin, just in case you need to cut it out on a quick notice.

Unless the power comes with some understanding of how chemistry works or some complex safety limits on what can be made, then you shouldn't mess around with your body.

Chemistry is complex and so is the human body, building something like nanotubes over your bones can be poisonous, turning your right hand into a bionic claw can strain you the rest of your body with weight.

Ideally you would build parts in your self, and then wear them. But get an engineer to do it for you.
