Thankfully, I've left RAW far behind in worldbuilding. No divine spellcasting where they're from. No common interactions with the gods, no Candles of Invocation.

One of the characters in the party is a medic. You can get pretty far with the germ theory of disease and /prestidigitation/. The character's homeworld is somewhere around the mid-19th century ability-wise, but the "industrial revolution" has been replaced with modular and multiperson enchanting.
