Oh, very minor stuff - the party just hit third level and are colonists on a different world, so some of the RAW Stupidworld stuff fails the common sense filter. However, the one that stands out at the moment is one of my players pointing out that D&D doesn't have facing with regards to movement during a combat.

I may have made a mistake, though. I told my players that I'll only allow them to get away with breaking the gameworld /once/. I think they're just plotting now so as to achieve maximum worldbreak.
