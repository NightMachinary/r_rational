/laugh/ Tell them thank you for me. :)

Tell them to wait until Wizard/11, Sorceror/12 when they can cast Wall of Iron and Teleport. Then they can orbital strike their foes. (The Dedicated Wrights weren't strictly necessary, they were mostly for Rule of Cool.)

If you don't like them doing that, force them to deal with environmental factors -- cold, no air, can't see when your eyeballs freeze/wind pounds on them. Also, I let the Wrights figure out skydiving with remarkable ease. (shhhh, don't tell anyone!) -- you should give your players a tough Dex check to avoid out of control tumble and redout. (You get into a flat spin, blood rushes to head and feet, you pass out.)

Let me know what they end up doing. :)

(Oh...or they could just buy a Candle of Invocation. They're cheap.)
