Easy solution is to start it as a god of Death. It would be a pretty easy religious drift (scope creep) from "Death" to "terminal threats" to "outside context problems". If you were writing it, it would also offer some slow introduction to the concepts, because at first you think that the clerics in black robes are just there for the funerals, but then you start to wonder why one of them is always sitting in on the city council meetings, and finally when a giant crab rises up out of the bay and attacks the city, he's the guy that steps forward and takes command through some ancient wording in the city charter.
