That could work; the kind of god of Death who doesn't particularly 'enjoy their job', and whose priests do ER-variety medicine as well as funerals, which gradually extends to fighting wider-scale existential threats.

If I was making this deity, I think I would have it be an aspect of the god of Heroes, who had a specific conflict with their brother/nemesis/something the god of Catastrophe. With the idea that dealing with an unforeseeable, almost incomprehensible problem is the purest form of heroism.
