Note to self: next time I build a religion, build it around a God of OCPs. It'd neatly group together existential risk, applied epistemology, and black swans, and you could probably throw in the pile of general rationality knowledge that usually gets spread out over wisdom, trickster, knowledge, secrecy, and arcane deities. It also provides a nice clean counterpart to the Arcane Deities that are usually opposed by an ill-fitting Secrecy Deity; "using knowledge effectively" is much better balanced by "using /lack/ of knowledge effectively" than it is by "keeping secrets".
