Mayhaps a nice version of Tezenich. The abyss that stares back? That which does not go gently? I'm guessing it would be a mystery religion with an external opinions characterizing it as a god of mysteries, plots, power, ect. Basically it'd be perceived as a LE/CE portfolio with a more positive internal message. Though I'm betting the god would turn out to be the /meetfuc@er/ or the /Mistake not. . ./.
