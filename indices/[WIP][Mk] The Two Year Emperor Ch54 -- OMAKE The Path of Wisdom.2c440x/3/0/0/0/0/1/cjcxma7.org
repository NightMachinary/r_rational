Catastrophe or Surprise, maybe? A little bit of "it's more complicated than it sounds" goes a long way here given the deity in question, particularly if the rest of the pantheon is similarly complicated (god of technology+magic is actually the trickster in the style of Neal Stephenson's tract in Cryptonomicon, Shyamalan the reader with "âˆƒ Secrecy Deity!" halfway through, Undead are under the Sun God because he's the one that destroys them, etc). It helps that the concept is only one sentence away from sufficient understanding even though it's not primitive.
