Most likely reddit's score-fuzzing algorithm - downvotes (and upvotes?) are added to posts, comments etc as their score increases. Something about making it difficult for votebots to verify that their votes are being counted, which won't be the case if they've been spotted.

In short, if you're seeing 'some', you're probably not getting more than one or two downvotes.
