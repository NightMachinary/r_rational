In theory, this is no longer the case since the recent update that removed raw vote totals from the API (and hence RES). From what the admins have said, the vote percentage on the right-hand side of the submission comment page is strictly correct. I'm not 100% sure that I believe this was implemented correctly, and it has some problems like showing 99% on submissions with 9 votes (which indicates a rounding error).

So when reddit says that this submission has 7 points, and a 83% approval rating (11 votes total, so 2 downvotes, 9 upvotes), I think that you do have to conclude that those are real numbers.

As for why people are voting that way - I dunno, it's probably that some people just don't like the submission. There's nothing inherently wrong with downvoting content that you don't want to see for whatever reason. There's nothing wrong with asking them why that is, but it seems unlikely that there will be a response (downvoting is anonymous, commenting is not, and there are definite social pressures involved). But it's only a small handful of people, and even in a small community like this, a small handful of people will dislike anything, no matter what it is.
