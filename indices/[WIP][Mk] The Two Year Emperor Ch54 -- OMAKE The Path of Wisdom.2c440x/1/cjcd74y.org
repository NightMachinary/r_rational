I've noticed that when I post chapter links, they are mostly upvoted but also get some downvotes. I'm curious -- are the downvotes due to the content itself, to the way it's listed, or to something else?

If you've downvoted any of these threads, please let me know -- I'd be curious to see if there's something I can optimize so that you are seeing fewer things you object to.
