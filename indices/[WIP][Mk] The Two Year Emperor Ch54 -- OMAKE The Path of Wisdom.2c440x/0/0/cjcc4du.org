That would be a smart thing for him to do, yes, but it would break the story. Jake has two flaws: he's not terribly good with social situations unless he's making a concerted effort, and he's not terribly forethoughtful. If I gave him CHA and WIS boosts those flaws would go away and he'd just be a Gary Stu.

Until now I've been quietly ignoring it, but I should probably have it come up and have Jake go "forget it, you are not mucking with my personality again"
