Depending on the soldier and what you're offering them, they might be willing to come for free or in exchange for things that you've promised them on the other side. Since everything is worth what its purchaser will pay, then a soldier might be worth $0. Heck, if you had the right pitch you might be able to make people pay for the privilege of coming along.
