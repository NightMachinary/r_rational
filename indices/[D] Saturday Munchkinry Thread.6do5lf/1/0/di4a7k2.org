You might find [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a66h4/dbst_you_have_2_days_to_prepare_to_transport_to_a/][this thread]] of interest, because although the circumstances are different, it would follow some of the same pathways. Adapting my answer from there:

- Get a bunch of older e-readers with e-ink displays that don't drain battery.
- Get a few low power netbooks.
- Download copies of Simple English Wikipedia, a wide selection of material from Gutenberg, and as many books as possible about pre-Medieval and Medieval technical advances.
- Get a few different ways of generating moderate amounts of power (e.g. hand cranks).
- Get a bunch of cords for your electronics.
- Get high-quality paper versions of books that cover the most important subject matter.

Everything else is whatever you'd consider "essential" to modern luxury. Personally, I'm a good enough cook that I probably wouldn't need to bring along any food, just maybe some durable pots, pans, and knives (and sharpeners) to make more modern cooking easier. Air conditioning and refrigeration in general are problematic technologies, because they'd be nearly impossible to fix and you'd need a ton of technology in order to get the refrigerants they needed if there was ever a failure or leak - 30 years is a long time for a modern appliance. I guess I would head to my local camping store and look at what they had in the way of high durability, low maintenance camping equipment, most of which is designed for emulating luxury in the wilderness.
