Encyclopedia Britannica 1911. "How Things Work". Anarchists Cookbook. Stuff like that. From used bookstores on paper.

Multiple computers, I would recommend low end mid-generation Powermac G5, not the water cooled versions. You can get a stack of them for 30 bucks each easy. Plus a stack of Thinkpads from the IBM era when they were built like tanks. And do a bit of research on reliable displays.

For printers, parallel port impact printers with a re-inking kit. Carbon based ink is not that hard to make. If it's a Japanese based society they are already making it. And you can get them cheap.

Edit: Bug repellent and citronella candles and instructions for making same.
