Problem: This narrative is exactly what the power-hungry nobles would want. They would want to spread rumors that the Queen is being a tyrant, inflicting inhumane control over the MC and generally treating him as a pet or a slave, an object for her to use as she pleases. Once this narrative is established, the nobles can then gain support from the masses, and launch a coup d'etat (or assassination) to "save" the MC from the "evil despot" Queen.
