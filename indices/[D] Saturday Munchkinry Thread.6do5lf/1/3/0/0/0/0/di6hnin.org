For years, the queen governed, and the country was normal.

Then, soon after getting married to a strange man no one has ever seen before, the country suddenly undergoes major technological revolutions, one after the other.

This would be totally suspicious.

[[#s][For context,]]

For analogy, imagine that one day, a ufo comes down from the sky, and then enters a government base and is never heard from again. But soon, all kinds of amazing technologies like teleporters and infinite energy sources start appearing. Technologies that are utterly impossible for humanity to achieve within the next few decades. You would 100% suspect that the ufo is the source.

And then, the logical choice of action is clear for the various power hungry nobles: demand to meet MC. Try to curry favor with MC for more technology. Try to conspire with MC to control the country. Harass the Queen and spread rumors about her confining the MC if she refuses to let them meet MC. End result: MC gains massive influence.
