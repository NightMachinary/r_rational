So I was reading a novel where a modern day guy is given the opportunity to be sent to a fantasy world with pre-medieval technology. (No glass, no steel) The queen wants his bloodline as his parents escaped from the fantasy world to our modern one, but wars and some unique bloodline magic has made him an important commodity. He's not expected to do any work other than make babies in a country with a hot and humid climate and no winter. He's given thirty days and has $25,000 USD before he is summoned to the fantasy world for the next thirty years. He can bring with him anything within a 10 foot cube.

Now, in the story, the guy is politically savvy and actually helps out with politics a little. But completely useless at advancing his new found country in almost everywhere. With his preparation, he brought a hydro electrical generator, a fridge filled with perishable goods, a TV with DVD player and a variety of entertainment shows, a desktop computer with a word processor and excel, some alcohol, and an air conditioner.

So basically he lives in relative modern luxury as royalty, with a queen that feels guilty about making him abandon our modern world. And has done nothing to make his adopted country better in anyway other than sharing a bit of knowledge like Arabic numerals, double-entry accounting, and gear cogs should have co-prime teeth.

In his place you, given the exact same circumstances, now have two goals:

-Maintain whatever modern comforts you bring for as long as possible.

-Improve your adopted country (technologically, culturally).

What do you bring for $25,000 USD that can fit in a 10 foot cube, given thirty days prep?
