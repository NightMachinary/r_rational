For the player to gain the stats from his opponent, the opponent must die.

So if A(10str 20int) and challenges B(20str,10int), for the duration of the match A now has 20str 10int as well. If A kills B they will from the moment of B's death have 20 str 10 int.

If B kills A then nothing changed. The individual challenged gains nothing from the challenge.

To designate a challenge to B, A must lock eyes with B. (Picture/drawing/reflection won't work.) So to start a challenge A must be no more than ~100m from B.

Once the challenge started however, if A and B are more than ~1km apart the challenge is lost.

A gains/loses nothing. B no longer wants to kill A.

The homicidal feeling is a sudden growing rage to hurt A as much as possible physically. The rage grows stronger as the challenge progresses, giving a little time for B to notice that maybe the rage isn't rational and try to resist by force of will. Most people won't be able to do it without a very high Willpower stat, as the affect of the challenge also gives B pleasure for any pain(physical or magical) inflicted on A by B.

If B manages to resist the effect the challenge ends and the anger goes away immediately. A gains nothing.

For A to win and gain the stats permanently he must kill B by himself. (Poison counts but hiring an assassin doesn't)

The problem is that A in my story is against killing people. There are a few exceptions but for right now lets say that no reason is good enough to kill in A's eyes.

What I'm thinking of doing currently is restricting B while A challenges and gains the stats. Then, while B is restricted, A goes to slay stronger monsters or clear harder dungeons than they could normally. Leveling up faster and gaining better equipment than they could without B's stats.

Once done for the day A will leave the 1km radius to break the challenge, returning B to normal. Rinse repeat every time A needs to fight.
