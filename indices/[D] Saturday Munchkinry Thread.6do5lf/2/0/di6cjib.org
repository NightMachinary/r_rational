I see, thanks for clarifying the question. In short: you are looking for a way to exploit this ability without winning any challenges. There are a number of uses.

Most prominently, the fact that this makes you a giant agro magnet. Although it doesn't work on monsters, it still works on criminals. You could help a police force (or the RPG equivalent of a police force) to arrest (not kill) criminals. Especially criminals holding hostages, one look at them would prompt them to forget the hostage in a mindless attempt to attack you as much as possible. The fact that you can only challenge one person at a time is a problem, but better than nothing.

Which brings to mind another question: what happens if A hides from B? Or B is blindfolded by A or some stranger C? Does the challenge immediately end? If so, you can now rapidly challenge a bunch of criminals sequentially. If not, does B magically know your location even when you are hidden?

If not, challenging someone and then hiding would be a good way to use stats without having to kill them. If so, you can use your ability as a reverse tracker, letting your friends track you. Like if you are exploring a dungeon, challenge some B who is being restricted (maybe tied up), and then you can go in alone while your friends waiting with B (or are on the way to B). If B regains his mind, you are further away than 1km. Otherwise, B should be constantly trying to go towards the direction you are in.

Also, depending on whether the "challenge" ability is known by others, this can also be used to frame people. Challenge someone and now they act like a homicidal murderer, plenty of grounds to get them arrested. If you are somewhat good at heart, you could challenge people you know are bad. In other words, you could frame bad people for crimes they did not commit since they didn't get punished for the crimes they did commit.

This ability is also useful for moving people around. For example, if B is stubbornly refusing to believe that the nearby volcano is about to erupt or that a deadly army of goblins is on the way, you can just challenge B and run, forcing B to follow you to safety.

Or if B is the shady necromancer who has been harassing the city while hidden in the dark alleys, you can just go in, challenge B, and run back out, effectively dragging B up to the surface where the proper authorities can deal with him.

Depending on the specific magic system of your RPG setting, this challenge ability may also be used as a kind of magic disruptor/canceler. In many works of fiction, magic requires intense concentration, or peace of mind. Things that are much harder to pull off when influenced by homicidal rage.

And then there are ways to abuse the stats themselves apart from using them to kill monsters. You may not want to kill B, but if B is sufficiently evil, subduing B may still be a goal. In which case, copying B's stats could be a great way to determine B's weaknesses, depending on the stats system of the RPG setting. In many RPGs, things like def, resistance, vit, or even specific elemental affinities are all stats. If you copy B's stats, you can then use yourself to determine what you are weak to, effectively revealing what B is weak to. Then your allies can now exploit these weaknesses to subdue B.

Finally, there is int. Or wis. Or any other assortment of "brain" stats. Suppose B is some kind of evil mastermind, the chess master or the manipulative bastard. Or a demon lord if demon lords aren't considered monsters. By gaining B's stats, you could use your newfound brainpower to unravel his dastardly plans and put a stop to them.
