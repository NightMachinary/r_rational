Amazing. Thank you.

  Also, depending on whether the "challenge" ability is known by others, this can also be used to frame people.

I'll need to rewrite some of the chapters but this gave me a great solution for a story line I didn't know how to implement.

#+begin_quote
  what happens if A hides from B? Or B is blindfolded by A or some stranger C? Does the challenge immediately end? If so, you can now rapidly challenge a bunch of criminals sequentially. If not, does B magically know your location even when you are hidden?
#+end_quote

Eye contact is needed only to initiate the challenge. Once done only distance is a factor. There is no cooldown on the skill but A can't end the challenge he initiated in any other way but killing B. A tracking function could be interesting but I'm not sure about. No current plans on using it but if the situation arises I might decide to use it.

  Finally, there is int. Or wis. Or any other assortment of "brain" stats. Suppose B is some kind of evil mastermind, the chess master or the manipulative bastard. Or a demon lord if demon lords aren't considered monsters. By gaining B's stats, you could use your newfound brainpower to unravel his dastardly plans and put a stop to them.
#+end_quote

In the rpg system I'm using such a demon lord will rely mainly on skills to enhance his ability to plan and outsmart the hero. This is sadly also why I decided that the challenge only copies stats and not skills. As copying skills would be too overpowered in my opinion.

Also a bit problematic is that fact the to challenge B, A needs to be in the ~100m zone for it to count as "locking eyes"with B. So getting that close to a demon lord, even if possible, would mean there's no need to care about any plans as you don't have time to think of it while trying to survive an enraged demon lord trying to kill you :)

  Or if B is the shady necromancer who has been harassing the city while hidden in the dark alleys, you can just go in, challenge B, and run back out, effectively dragging B up to the surface where the proper authorities can deal with him.

I like the idea. Although a person terrorizing a city is less viable in my opinion. Again, because you already need to be ~100m from him. However, when the enemy is behind a barricade or during a siege this can be a great way to flush them out into the open. It can also be very easy to disrupt a military formation as well.

So thank you again. I have an idea how to use it in the story.

Also, on an unrelated note, no undead at all in the story. I refuse to use that trope. No demon lords as well :)
