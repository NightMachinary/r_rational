In a LitRPG setting, one of the players gets a skill that allows him to challenge any non-monster. An "Equalizer" for lack of a better name.(suggestions are welcome :)) For the duration of the challenge the players stats will become the same as his opponent stats. If the player wins he gets to keep the stats.

-1-The player can't challenge more than one person at a time.

-2-Only sapient species such as humans, elves,dwarves, etc can be challenged. Anything too different from human(lizardmen, demons, etc) won't work.

-3-To challenge the player must lock eyes with his opponent.

-4-Once challenged the individual will automatically try to kill the player.

-5-The affects last as long as both are alive or are in ~1km range of each other.

-6-It's possible to resist the homicidal affect but the challenge will be automatically lost.

-7-The player is currently dead set on not killing no matter the reasons.(I'm still debating with myself if this includes death-row prisoners as well, but for now the option is off the table.)

The question:

Is there a way to leverage this without killing anyone?

*Don't know why the numbers don't go in order... everything looks fine until I post.

Ex.:

For the player to gain the stats from his opponent, the opponent must die.

So if A(10str 20int) and challenges B(20str,10int), for the duration of the match A has 20str 10int as well. If A kills B they will from the moment of B's death have 20 str 10 int.

If B kills A then nothing changed. The individual challenged gains nothing from the challenge.

To designate a challenge to B, A must lock eyes with B. (Picture/drawing/reflection won't work.) So to start a challenge A must be no more than ~100m from B.

Once the challenge started however, if A and B are more than ~1km apart the challenge is lost.

A gains/loses nothing. B no longer wants to kill A.

The homicidal feeling is a sudden growing rage to hurt A as much as possible physically. The rage grows stronger as the challenge progresses giving a a little time for B to notice that maybe the rage isn't rational and try to resist by force of will. Most people won't be able to do it without a very high Willpower stat, as the affect of the challenge give B pleasure for any pain(physical or magical) inflicted on A by B.

If B manages to resist the effect the challenge ends and the anger goes away immediately. A gains nothing.

For A to win and gain the stats permanently he must kill B by himself. (Poison counts but hiring an assassin doesn't)
