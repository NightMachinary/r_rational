Need way more detail here, too many undefined points.

Define "win" and "lose" for the challenge. Do you have to kill them? Knock them out? Can you challenge people who are already on the verge of death?

Also, what happens if you leave eyesight range? Is that like a ring-out? Can you throw the enemy behind a rock and out of sight, and thus win the challenge?

  It's possible to resist the homicidal affect but the challenge will be automatically lost.

Who loses? The challenger? The one who resists? If it's the one who resists, you could pay people to purposely lose. Or promise payment after getting your new stats. Even if losing = death, there could be people who care more about their family and would gladly die to give them money, assuming you have money.

Also, even if stats are equalized, I'm assuming the situation isn't. You could position yourself in a superior position (like high ground) before issuing challenges.
