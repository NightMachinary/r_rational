It selects timelines where the random number generador gave you that card, it doesnt matter if its pseudoramdom because there are possible worlds where some bits are flipped on the server, so you will have to be really carrefull when making your server to ensure you are manipulating the stock market instead of just manipulating the circuits of your server or your conection to the stock market , and also making a card game like that is difficult and requires a big investment . But yes I shouldn't have let you make your own game , you win( unless someone finds a even better exploit)
