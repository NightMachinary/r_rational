I thought that would be the best and easiest route to take as well. Which is why the skill doesn't work on anything that is classified as a "monster" under the system. Meaning only sapient species such as humans, elves,dwarves, etc. Anything too different from human(lizardmen, demons, etc) won't work. Beast-men however are ok.

Also, there aren't any undead in this word. Mainly to prevent me from choosing the easy path litRPG series take with the necromancer/lich storylines.
