In Dungeons and Dragons, an attack is Ability + Skill.

The trope is that monsters sort themselves based on challenge. So, I want to be going after the highest ability (and thus lowest skill) creature in the dungeon.

So I guess I'd try to get a +2 to skill by training the normal way. Then go after constructs and mindless undead. Then, I copy their strength, add my +2 to skill on top of that and have an absolute advantage.

Or, if that doesn't work, look for monsters with exploitable weaknesses.
