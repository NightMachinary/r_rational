Solution: Use the power of friendship and trickery.

Protagonist teams up with a mid-level wizard, and a high-stat generalist. The Wizard uses some debuffs to make the high-stat generalist especially gullible for a couple minutes.

Protagonist puts on a hat of disguise and adopts the identity of "Dread Pirate Roberts". Using this disguise, he challenges his high-stat friend.

Protagonist uses a dimension door to escape and takes the hat off.

The party now has 2 high-stat generalists. And the boosted stats will last until the high-stat guy successfully defeats a non-existent pirate.
