(1): It's very easy to win vast amounts of money on short-term gambling. Roulette wheels are probably good - anything where the result comes almost immediately. One can also have fun with appearances on game shows - preferably the sort where there's either a limited number of answers (possibly a multiple-choice scenario), or where the answers are revealed after you get it wrong (but less then five minutes after you give your answer).

--------------

Now that I have an arbitrary amount of money (and have probably been banned from every casino on the continent - they might not know how I do it, but they have certainly spotted that they lose a lot of money to me) I can look into satisfying those values that are not satisfied by merely being obscenely rich. I guess I could be incredibly petty and say the most insulting things to people I don't like - then rewind, smile, and nod, and be diplomatic. This gives me both the short-term satisfaction of blowing my top and the long-term satisfaction of appearing to be in excellent control of my temper. (I've just got to make sure my rant never passes the five minute mark).

I can also do risky things with immediate payoff. If I am, for example, ever in a situation where there is a large bomb in front of me and I know that it can be defused by cutting the right wire but will kill me if I cut the wrong one - well, then I'm not going to end up in a timeline in which I cut the wrong wire. (I need to be careful, though - a bomb which knocks me out and maims me severely on the wrong wire-cut is bad news). Now, I don't intend to take on a career in bomb disposal - but I can certainly start to react five minutes before things go wrong, which is an advantage in all sorts of careers (as a doctor or a policeman, this puts me on the scene where basically five-minute precognition can come in really, really handy - not that I need to work, but I might find fulfillment in helping people in some way).

I an also pump people for information. If I go up to someone and say "Your bank code is 0000", they will shrug me off. Rewind. "Your bank code is 0001." Rewind. "Your bank code is 0002.". Rewind - eventually, he'll respond with shock and "how did you know?" Rewind again. That was tedious, but now I know his bank code and he doesn't know I know it. (Okay, I have arbitrary amounts of money, so I don't need random stranger's bank codes. But I can get similar information out of people by similar strategies if I want, and if I have the patience - I could for example do a seriously convincing mind-reader act on stage).

--------------

Looping the same five minutes with a good internet connection means I can read arbitrary amounts of information on near any subject in only five minutes real time. Always useful. Pity I can't keep notes while doing it. (I mean, I can always reset, write a note, and then only reset to after the note - that causes the entire study session to take more than five minutes, though).

Actually, this will look kind of odd to anyone watching - I open a browser, then immediately write down a bunch of (completely accurate) notes without looking up anything, then turn off the computer. It looks like I don't need it, but I do.

...in fact, given that I have a search engine on my phone, I could look up anything, reset back to before the lookup, and give the impression that I have all the answers in my head. (But I lose my omnidisciplinary answers as soon as I can't get a cellphone signal, which is going to annoy everyone else because they never see me look things up on my phone anyway so why do I need a signal?)

(2) There's an important point to consider here. What do I want to do with this guy when I get him?

Depending on my aim:

- Kill him: Hire an assassin, a sniper. Inform him that he must, under any and all circumstances, observe the target for five minutes by the clock before pulling the trigger. Payment is only for a successful kill. (The assassin will get rather frustrated at the target's apparent ability to suddenly duck into a building or similar the moment he is spotted, but eventually he'll get caught with no five-minute escape).

- Imprison him. If I have legal authority to do so, then I will use this legal authority - after waiting five minutes just outside his estate so he cannot lock it down and get out without running into the people I have watching all the exits. If I do not have legal authority, then it gets trickier - but still, my aim is to make sure taht he has no escape five minutes /before/ he has any chance to notice that anything's wrong. I might also take a hostage - someone close to him - and then wait a good five minutes before contacting him to arrange the ransom.

- I wish to ask him to use his power to my benefit in some way. I will simply find a way to send him a request and ask politely. If he is willing to help, then I have succeeded in my aim. If not, then see imprisonment (above).
