I think there are two approaches to (1):

- Try and figure out how the time travel effect works. If you remember things after moving back in time, that suggests it can either change the state of matter in the past (since your brain is different), or that cognition doesn't happen in the brain. Either one would be very exciting.
- Acquire resources using the stock market, pump the money into whatever the highest-value activity is (AI research?).

It would probably also be wise to take breaks every so often to sit in front of a computer and read for a very long time. (If you can get to where you left off in <5 minutes, you can read and learn things forever.) You'd probably start to go a little batty from lack of human contact if you did this for too long, although you could mitigate that with either drugs or occasional interactions with strangers on the Internet. If you get old enough, and the AI research isn't panning out, you might want to try and do this forever as a form of pseudo-immortality.

I think the key to (2) would be to just knock them unconscious (assuming that stops them from voluntarily going back in time). You could keep them unconscious or drugged while they're captured as well.

If you need to interrogate them while they're captured, I think you'd probably still be pretty safe. Physical escape attempts aren't particularly worrying if you have time to prepare their cage while they're unconscious/drugged. There's a certain level of physical restraint that no amount of being clever can get around -- straight jackets, iron manacles, locked rooms deep underground, severed spinal cords, and so on.

Psychological escape attempts are a bit harder. I think the trick is to make attempting to escape unpleasant so that they aren't willing to do it millions of times in a row without a break. Torture would probably be effective: if every interrogation session is painful, they'll want it to end as soon as possible, and definitely won't be willing to repeat it millions of times.
