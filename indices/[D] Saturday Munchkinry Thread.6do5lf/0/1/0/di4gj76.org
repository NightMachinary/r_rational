For the sake of argument we'll say that time rolls back when they're unconscious only if you kill them.

But the problem is that they /know/ they're vulnerable while sleeping, and that being slipped a drug that takes longer than five minutes to show its effects is one of their failure conditions, so they presumably have taken measures to mitigate these (for example, never drinking something that hasn't been pulled from a random pool by them or unsealed in their presence, hiring private security to guard them while they sleep, setting up alarm systems if anyone enters their room at night, etc.).

Ideally, you'd first come up with the protocol you'd use to guard yourself knowing your abilities and vulnerabilities, then think about how you would go about defeating that protocol.
