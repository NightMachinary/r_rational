For (2), set a bomb or other trap, somewhere you know (1) will be, wait five minutes from when they are in the optimal position, or activate it as soon as they try to escape (probably from that position). It will go off after five minutes, they reset, try to escape, and you set it off. If the trap is good enough there is no way for them to escape, eventually they will get bored and give up. The Sans strategy, basically.
