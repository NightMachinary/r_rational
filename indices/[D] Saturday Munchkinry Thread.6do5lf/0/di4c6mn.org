A two parter:

1. You have the ability to roll back time by five minutes. You can use this power at will, but can never go back further than five minutes; if you have seen 09:15, then everything before 09:10 is forever beyond your abilities, though you can still repeat the period from 09:10 to 09:15 as many times as you wish. If you die, time will roll back automatically until it reaches its limit. How do you use this power to maximize your values?

2. You are pursuing the person from 1. You know the ins and outs of their ability, and further have the ability to sense their location to within 1 mile whenever they use their power. How do you incapacitate and capture them into the foreseeable future, with the knowledge that they can try any five minute long line of argument against you and repeatedly make escape attempts?
