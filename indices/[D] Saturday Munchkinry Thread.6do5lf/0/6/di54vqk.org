(1) Amass stupid amounts of money via gambling, followed by hiring/buying ridiculous amounts of security so the guy from (2) can't kill me.

(2) This really isn't that hard. Person from (1) manipulates time, but can't actually go without sleeping. Since you can sense (1)'s location, you can just stalk (1) until (1) sleeps, then kidnap (1). (1) captured! If you're having problems stalking (1), try befriending (1) instead, or try getting hired as a bodyguard for (1) if (1) starts buying lots of security.

Also, you can get just as much money as (1), since you know exactly where he is and can bet the same things as he does, assuming you don't start much poorer than him or something.

Once you kidnap (1) and bring him to some secure inescapable hideout, you're done. Only problem left is keeping the hideout inescapable. But honestly something as simple as a prison cell would work, prisoners spend years in them without any way to get out other than using super slow methods like digging tunnels or grinding bars. Going back 5 minutes in time won't do (1) any good.
