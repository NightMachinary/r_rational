  I'm a good enough cook that I probably wouldn't need to bring along any food

You totally would, most of the common foods are a mish-mash from all over the world. I'd probably bring a few hardy chilli plants - spices were almost non-existent, and chillis are easy to grow and propagate. They spread like wildfire through Europe and Asia after they were discovered in South America.

Depending on the climate, seeds and seedlings for things like pepper, cinnamon, cumin, etc. Definitely would want some herbs like cilantro and whatnot too.

I'm /really into/ good food so moving to a medieval world would be like, my worst fear because of the lack of spices and ingredients. Like, the foods even the poorest people (in a developed country) have access to today are beyond what the kings of yore would have had. Pineapples were once so expensive that people used to rent them to display at parties as a curiosity.
