Guilty.

Posting this mainly because the MC is frustrating me to no end with his lack of forethought with technological knowledge.

Smart enough to bring a hydro electrical generator, AC, a fridge, a freaking computer, TV and DVD player with DVDs but dumb enough to not download technical knowledge to the computer or DVDs on how to build things. Smart enough to bring luxuries like sugary sweets, alcohol, and sexy lingerie for his waifu but so dumb to not bring a few textbooks. Smart enough to navigate feudal power structures and political posturing but stupid to not work hard implementing wide-scale changes to benefit where he lives.
