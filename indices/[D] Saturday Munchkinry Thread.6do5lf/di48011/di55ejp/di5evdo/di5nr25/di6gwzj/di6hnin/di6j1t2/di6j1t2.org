Reframe the narrative.

Yes, the stranger is the source of the new idea. But the Queen is the source of the stranger. If he doesn't play nice, she can send him back. She can get him /replaced/ at will.

He's an outside expert, present and offering suggestions only at the Queens' sufferance. She can send him back and she makes it clear that she /will/ if he starts dropping tech hints to other people, that she can't control.

His influence is leashed by the Queen's power to send him back (or to the dungeons) and replace him with another expert.
