Someone's reading <Risou no Himo Seikatsu>.

The first goal is easy to accomplish, don't bring any modern comforts. That way, you vacuously maintain them all for all eternity.

The second goal is probably best achieved with:

- As much information about science and technology (and I guess culture for some reason?) as you can stockpile in 30 days. Erm, why culture again? It's not like they are savages, they have their own culture.
- A computer for storing that data, along with additional compact memory storage devices if you need more memory. Don't put any entertainment on it, otherwise it counts as a comfort and you violate the first goal.
- A power generator for powering that computer.
- A printer for printing out the information and spreading it throughout the world. Print the information about how to make paper first, so you can make more paper and print more things.
- Stacks of paper so you can print stuff before people find out how to make paper.
- Stacks of printer ink cartridges so you can print stuff before people find out how to make ink cartridges, or some other way of printing. NOTE: This problem will go away if you get a printer that doesn't use ink. E.g., one of those printers that burns paper to print stuff. People are researching that last I heard.
- Lots of marbles so you can get funding for above projects, if the Queen runs out.

The main problem would be the Queen opposing all of your influence on the country. So... MC is actually doing a pretty good job here. Slow and steady, don't prompt the Queen to murder you so she can keep her power.

Unless of course, your plan is to murder the queen and take over the country for the "greater good". In which case, you may want to look up some slow-acting and hard to trace poisons to bring along you monster.
