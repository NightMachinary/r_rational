With your guessing of the PIN number, wouldn't it be easier to just watch them input it? cause if their number is 9899 brute-forcing could take a verrrry long time. Then, even if you get caught, just rewind. I think it would be easier to figure out someone's pin from watching them press the buttons, or even if you couldn't manage that you could at least watch their hand movement (if it moves left and down it's probably a 4 5 7 or 8 for example) and then brute force the possible combinations after that
