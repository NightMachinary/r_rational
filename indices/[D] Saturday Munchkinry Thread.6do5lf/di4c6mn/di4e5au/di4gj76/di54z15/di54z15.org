If the person from (1) is sufficiently paranoid, the person from (2) won't be able to do anything.

Why? Because (1) will NEVER stop looping the same 5 minutes, repeating the same actions, ad infinitum. Boring yes, but that is the only way to be safe from (2).

If (1) is not that paranoid, then there are any number of ways for (2) to bypass (1)'s security, e.g. seduction or being hired as the private security.
