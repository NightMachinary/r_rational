The problem here is that one OR the other being rational is okay and gives the heroes a fighting chance, but if BOTH are rational, the heroes are screwed. Consider the Jaffa weaknesses:

- Those staff weapons are ridiculous: slow to fire, slow to aim, can't go through tight spaces easily.
- No real sense of unit tactics
- Too much emphasis on honor and hand-to-hand fighting -- I don't think you ever see a Jaffa sniper. Basically, they're barbarians in space.\\
- They use 'armor' which doesn't protect against staff weapons OR P90's. A P90 isn't that powerful -- it's a personal defense weapon, not a battle rifle. It doesn't even have a grenade launcher. (Honestly, the armor should leave them completely blind, since their actual heads are in the neck of the armor. Presumably there are vision blocks in there, although I'm not sure how that works when the armor's head can be retracted. Also, the armor makes stealth impossible.
- They seem to lack industry, research, or most forms of modern tech. I don't remember ever seeing them use a radio, but it's been a while since I watched anything after the beginning of season 2.

The Goa'uld weaknesses are:

- Overconfident
- Overproud
- Don't take enemies seriously
- I get the sense that they don't do a lot of research or create a lot of new etc. Teal'c called them 'scavengers', and they don't seem to have learned the cool Stargate tricks that SGC have. Examples: Time travel, bouncing the wormhole to a new destination, opening it to a black hole in order to destroy the planet it's on, etc. They are never shown to use the gates for long-distance FTL communication. Only one of them ever figured out how to force the SGC iris open.

You could say that the Jaffa's ridiculous equipment and lack of tech is down to the Goa'uld. In that case, you've got a few choices:

- Make the Jaffa rational but not the Goa'uld; the Jaffa have decent war skills but still lousy equipment.\\
- Make the Goa'uld rational but not the Jaffa. The Jaffa have better equipment but lousy war skills.
- Make them both rational. Jaffa have good tactics and good war skills, are supported by good research and such. Heroes lose immediately -- the SG teams lose every battle in the field and then the Goa'uld blow the SGC iris open with a particle accelerator or series of heavy-weapon staff blasts, shove a nuke through. Boom, SGC is gone. Alternatively, have your ships in orbit, force the iris open, go through, open the SGC gate to a black hole, collapse the entrances so no one can get in to shut it off, leave on your ship. Planet dies.
