Pity, I would really have enjoyed it.

As a nudge that you are obviously free to ignore: the only way to learn how to write (characters|scenes|plots|whatever) is to write. Why not take a swing at it? You'll undoubtedly get plenty of comments both here and on FFN about how your characters are flat, trite, whatever, but that's how you improve. Tsuyoku naritai!
