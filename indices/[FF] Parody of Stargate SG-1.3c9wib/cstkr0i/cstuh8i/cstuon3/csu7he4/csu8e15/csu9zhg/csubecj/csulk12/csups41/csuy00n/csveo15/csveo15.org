They do have energy shields that can cover relatively large areas (e.g., miles). I don't know if that could be scaled up to cover a planet or strong enough to stop an impactor but I suppose /in theory/ it could. If it's strong enough but can't be big enough then you could use it as a Macross-style pin defense -- you put up a small shield in front of whatever you detect. That leaves the question of detecting it fast enough, of course.
