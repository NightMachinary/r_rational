My take on it would be 'they still act as gods, but they treat the Jaffa well', with 'providing good gear' as a part of that. The Jaffa get their gods, great tech, and the chance to "travel the stars, meet interesting people, and kill them."

This is pretty much the situation with the modern military, after all -- there are very few civilian commanders (POTUS + Joint Chiefs, equivalent for other countries) but the military take their orders.
