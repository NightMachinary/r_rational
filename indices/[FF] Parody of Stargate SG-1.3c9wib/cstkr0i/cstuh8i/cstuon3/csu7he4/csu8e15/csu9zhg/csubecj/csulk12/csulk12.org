The weakness of the Goa'uld system is that it is feudal. Keep the feudal system, but make the actors within it rational. So the Goa'uld would still fight each other since the potential gain for each individual is quite large. But they would quickly ally against external threats and internal lords that gained too much power. Much of the internal conflict would be political with rare military conflicts. Ritualized combat is another possibility. The Goa'uld should be rational, but there is no need for them to value the same things that we do. Consider that they gained undisputed control of the galaxy for a very long time. So there is plenty of time for them to be relaxed, lose discipline and focus on internal issues. So matters of internal reputation, appearance and martial display may be the highest value to each other. As long as Earth remains beneath notice, it will be left alone. If Earth goes around decapitating Goa'uld system lords, the remainder will join together travel to Earth and flatten it. A rational SG team will know this and not do anything high profile like that.

In these circumstances, a rational SG team would simply focus on intelligence, misdirection and technology acquisition. Any fighting would have the goals of appearing like it was someone else. I would expect the SG team to use Jaffa equipment and since that equipment would be designed rationally, it would actually be useful for wars.

The goal of the Stargate program would be a heavily defended Earth capable of repelling a Goa'uld fleet. The idea is to be strong enough that the Goa'uld would not bother attacking. From there, it would be mainly political cold war between Earth and the Goa'uld with the contested areas being primitive planets.

If the actual events of SG canon really played out with rational actors, Earth would be a dead world. The idea that the Goa'uld were all too irrational to win is stupid and unrealistic. My belief is that the writers wanted space battles and military fighting without thinking about how to realistically get them.
