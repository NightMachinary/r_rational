  gave an enemy a very large idiot ball
#+end_quote

There are a /lot/ of idiot balls being handed around on this show. This morning I was working out; the way I make that bearable is to put on an episode of TV while I'm doing it. I watched a two parter, "Out of Mind" and "Into the Fire". I was amazed -- the villains were /brilliant/. They did everything exactly right, and only lost because script. The heroes, on the other hand, were carrying three or four idiot balls each.

Some of them were even called out in character -- Marouf came to SGC to get their help, but wasn't ponying up a lot of info. Jack said "You know how much I hate surprises", meaning he should read them in before leaving. The next scene was them on a transport ship on the mission, with Marouf in the middle of briefing them.
