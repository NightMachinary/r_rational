I would strongly suspect that they can stop an impactor, but I think that the main limit would be the size of such a shield. My guess is that the energy requirements of covering an entire planet are so great that only the most advanced technologies can afford to do so. (ZPM's should be able to do so in sufficient number.)

As for fast detection, we know that advanced Stargate sensors can detect moving objects within several hundred light years of their position. So fast detection should not be a problem even with inferior sensors.

If impactors were really such a large problem, then railguns should have been much more common in spaceships. That they are not suggests that they are impractical or ineffective. (Either that or the writers simply did not understand the value of railguns or gave an enemy a very large idiot ball.)
