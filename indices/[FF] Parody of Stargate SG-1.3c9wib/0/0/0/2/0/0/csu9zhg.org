eeeh... you make good points but assuming you're talking about starting from the same basic setting as canon, you missed the goa'uld's biggest weakness - that they depend so much on the Jaffa they command for their power, and that they are vastly outnumbered and completely surrounded by this potential enemy. Any goa'uld, turned on by the majority of their jaffa, would be dead, period.

The biggest issue with a rational SG universe, to me, is explaining how the goa'uld, as rational agents, would have let themselves get into that position in the first place.
