There was an episode where a minor Goauld was really impressed with the quality and variety of Earth food. I'd expect sane aliens to be interested in Earth literature, movies, music, etc. I think Baal expresses opinions similar to that as well. Humans also likely have lots of technology that Goauld have never bothered to develop and can develop new stuff given new technology much faster than Goauld do.
