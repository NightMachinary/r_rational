Except that no one understands how it works and it's not replicable; production relies entirely on the continuous extraction of tissue from Superman and whatshername from the Phantom Zone. It can't be shared easily, and it can't be built upon by anyone, even LexCorp. It's Syndrome's plan from the Incredibles, but even more fragile and single point of failure.
