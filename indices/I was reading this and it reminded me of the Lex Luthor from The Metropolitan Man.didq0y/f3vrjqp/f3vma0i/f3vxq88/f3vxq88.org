I'm willing to be that other nerds have also come to the conclusion that Lex Luthor's ideal paradise was to wake up and outsmart death, so that's the one he was slotted into. He's dead, yes, but so is almost every other conceivable iteration of luther, nested fractally upwards to the first time he got killed yet wanted to stay alive and downwards to all future death-and-revival sequences he'll go through.
