The Big hand Theory isn't really a theory as it is fact. Basically the Presence (God) created the universe by unfurling his hand and this is literal as in an episode of Justice League GL and Batman go back in time to creation and see a hand creating the universe. So pretty much Big Bang Theory. As for atheism being an ethical choice it's just the standard why does God allow evil and not help people. In this case Lex has a point because he knows there is a higher power but it refuses to do anything. Also the Presence kind of abandoned the DCverse choosing to explore other multiverses. Michael's daughter is in charge now (or a group of humans I think now). On the bright side there is a definite Heaven and Hell so I guess that's good.
