Intriguing! Logically equally valid, but do I understand correctly that this is a minority-perspective linking of godhood with moral authority? 'divine' (from 'divus'/'deus') just means 'godlike' and so is self-referential, but in most of the stories I remember coming across about things called gods, there are usually lots of them with inhuman levels of power but at odds with each other and often reflecting humans' worst excesses--claims of moral authority being associated being an occasional add-on (monotheistic cases where a religion worships a single hypothetical entity with no internal conflicts exclusively?) rather than a rule.

(And then you get religious wars if groups start saying "Your stories' 'gods' don't have essential quality X of our gods, so they are not TRUE gods! You should worship the true gods with us!" and "No, your stories' 'gods' don't have essential quality Y of our gods, so they are not TRUE gods! You should worship the true gods with us!" in the No True Scotsman fallacy. Or actually even more commonly just "Our stories are true, but yours are made up! Stop telling them!" "Nuh-uh, yours are the made up ones! Stop telling them!"...)
