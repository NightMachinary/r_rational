[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12805575/chapters/29229972][/Tact/]], a /Pride and Prejudice/ fic where Elizabeth Bennet has some. Beautifully written, and the characterization presents everyone at their best /without/ simply fixing their problems.

Period romance obviously, but with a decent treatment of gender roles.
