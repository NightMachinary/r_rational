Knowing a little about Twilight and having read its first few chapters (before giving up) I could appreciate the occasional jab here and there, like Luminosity's Bella being actually nice to her dad who bought her a car rather than an annoying spoiled brat like in the original /ahem/.

That said, it probably works full well without, and it made me often wonder how much of the world building was pulled from Twilight and how much was just made up for the fanfiction.
