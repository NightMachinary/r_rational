Most stories by rationalist writer Forthwith fit the criteria. [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]] is the biggest one and already finished. If you don't want to jump straight into 400k words story then short story [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/219160/twin-twilights][Twin Twilights]] serves as good introduction to the main character.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922890/1/Harry-and-Hermione-Starring-in-The-Digital-Revolution][Harry and Hermione Starring in: The Digital Revolution]] is current project and it's regularly updated.
