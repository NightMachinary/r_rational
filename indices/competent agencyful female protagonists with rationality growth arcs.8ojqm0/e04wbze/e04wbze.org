Are you aware that the sequel to Worm, [[https://www.parahumans.net/about/][Ward]] started late last year? New (also female) protagonist, radically reshaped world, currently fairly early in the "struggles" phase and knowing Wildbow "pulls through in the end" might turn out to be a little too optimistic. There's also a bridging arc that's been added to Worm called [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-pre-worm-2/p-01/][Glow-worm]]. Not strictly essential to understand Ward, but there's some interesting stuff in there.
