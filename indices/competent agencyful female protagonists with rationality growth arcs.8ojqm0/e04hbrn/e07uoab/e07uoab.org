The Doc Future trilogy is absolutely excellent. I don't know how rational it would qualify as, but all the characters tend to act as believable things, and don't do stupid things for no reason.

As a piece of fiction, it is brilliant. It is the only work of fiction I know which shows how ridiculous super speed should be as a super power.
