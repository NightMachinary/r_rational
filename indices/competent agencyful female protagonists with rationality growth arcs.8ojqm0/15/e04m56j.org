I'm not aware of any that fit your requirements exactly, but you may enjoy these.

Branches of the Tree of Time (short) - a modified Sarah Connor from Terminator is the protagonist, but starts out rational.

Bluer Shade of White (short) - Disney's Frozen - Elsa is the protagonist though she is not the most rational character in the story.

Taint and Trials - [[https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/]] - both unfinished. I'd say they are rational friendly but not rational. In Trials the protagonist is a man reborn in a woman's body so don't know if it counts. I find Taint very enjoyable.

Mother of Learning and the Good Student are great but male.
