- Flicker from /[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/179564-doc-future][Doc Future trilogy]]/ --- she's not rational, she's impulsive, and both she and others close to her are aware of that trait of her personality. Throughout the story she often tries very hard to find out what should be the correct decisions to make, to listen to the opinions of others, and to learn to control her impulsivity.
- Ami from /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DungeonKeeperAmi][DK Ami]]/ --- matches the request criteria weaker for several reasons: 1) the story's more focused on munchkining the universe she ended up than on building herself into a more rational character 2) the story as a whole gets a bit penalised as a rational story because the whole character set is zombified at times due to several recurring tropes (fanservice, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvilJustMisunderstood][NotEvilJustMisunderstood).]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][/Time Braid/]] --- though it's more like the circumstances force her into becoming into a more reasonable person rather than she deliberately decides to start improving herself from the beginning.
