If you like time braid but don't like how op they get, try Kill Your Heroes by Evil Is A Relative Term. Not quite finished but getting close. Might be the best Sakura fic I've read, and I /love/ time braid.

Sakura is pretty much rational in it, allowing for psychological trauma bad decisions. Not truly a rationalist fic though.
