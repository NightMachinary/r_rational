The Tiffany Aching sub-sequence of Discworld is /amazing/. The protagonist does not practice "rationality" in the HJPEV sense of "figure out the rules of magic and exploit them", but does in the real-world sense of "take actions that will lead to your goals being achieved".

Part of the reason she improves is that she starts out at 9 and ends up at ~17.
