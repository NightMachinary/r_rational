I write The Fifth Defiance (link -> [[https://thefifthdefiance.com/]] )

I dunno if it quite fits your criteria. 3/5 of the protagonists (and the main antagonist) are women, and they strive to be rational to the extent that it helps them achieve their goals. Things are still up in the air re: their success though.

I dunno, you might like it, you might not.
