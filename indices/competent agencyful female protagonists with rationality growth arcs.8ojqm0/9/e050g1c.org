It may not fit your criteria 100%, but one of the most rational protags I've ever seen in media is Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character in 10 Cloverfield Lane. She's extremely clever & competent and makes exactly zero of the stupid mistakes that horror movie protags usually love so much. I guess minor thematic spoilers ahead.

It's not a story about improving the rationality of her worldview, but it is very much about developing strategies to defeat a physically superior, intellectually equal opponent on his home ground. Each tactic can only hope to work once, and each new thing she tries makes it less likely for the next one to work.

It's also a straight-up awesome movie.
