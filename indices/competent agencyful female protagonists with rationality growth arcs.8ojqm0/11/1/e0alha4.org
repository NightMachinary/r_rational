I'll cheerfully second /Honor Among Thieves/, which in my view is substantially better than the originals. There's plenty of fan music for the canon series available too - search for "harrington filk" and, uh, it's certainly a thing.

Canon basically had two problems: it starts as a straight "Horatio Hornblower /in SPAAACE/", and then devolves into endless sequels and no resolution. The latter problem is obvious; the former mires the setting in a late-20th-c interpretation of mid-20th-c stereotypes about early-19th-c imperial politics and society. If you want British naval tropes plus a clear love of orbital mechanics, Webster delivers; if you want the /human/ part of the setting to be interesting I'd recommend something else. If you want a story arc, as above, read /Honor among Thieves/.
