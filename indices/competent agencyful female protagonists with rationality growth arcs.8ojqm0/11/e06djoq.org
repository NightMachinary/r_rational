[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500916/1/Honor-Among-Thieves][Honor Among Thieves]]. Apparently also the Honor Harrington series which that fanfic was based on, but I have not read the original canon, so I can't be sure.

[[https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-100099632][Harem Herbalist]]. Note that this is not a harem in the sense of a group of women inexplicably fawning over an unremarkable protagonist, but a part of a palace reserved for women. Where while women technically all can be called on by the Emperor, few ever will. And there is a lot of politics based on who is favoured by said Emperor, who the women might be married off to or in love with, poisonings and so on.

aaaand [[http://unicornjelly.com/uni001.html][Unicorn Jelly]]. With sort-of sequels [[http://pasteldefender.com/to%20save%20her%20000.html][To Save Her]] and [[http://pasteldefender.com/cover.html][Pastel Defender Heliotrope]]. It may start a bit slow, but it's seriously one of the most amazing examples of world-building you'll find.
