Read what I wrote. I don't blame him for making mistakes. That's entirely natural.

Fixing typos is not the job of an author anyway, it's the job of an editor. So get one. I'm sure there's dozens of fans of the story who'd gladly do it for free.

Like I said, every chapter there's people carefully listing all the mistakes in the comments. But the author never bothers to fix any of them. It shows they don't care about their own story, at all. And that's rather offputting.
