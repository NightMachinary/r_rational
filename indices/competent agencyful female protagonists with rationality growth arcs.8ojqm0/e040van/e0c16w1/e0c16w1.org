Probably an impopular opinion, but what really puts me off on Practical Guide to Evil is the huge number of spelling and grammar errors, which the author doesn't seem to care about at all.

It's not that the author doesn't have perfect spelling. That's fine. But every chapter there are people in the comments pointing out all the mistakes, and they never get fixed.

If the author cares so little about their own story, why should I?
