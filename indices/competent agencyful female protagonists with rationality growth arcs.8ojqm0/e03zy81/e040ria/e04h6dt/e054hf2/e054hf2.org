It's mostly from the sequel I guess, first book was okay. I dropped it after she went to her parents saying "Guys there are literal wizard Nazis going around, and I am pretty much definitely their Target Number 2, so get the hell out of dodge out of England immediately, and by immediately I mean ideally yesterday" and her parents said "Oh but it'd be too awkward to do it this fast" and she was all "Oh okay it'd be too awkward to press the issue so I'll just accept this"

And then her parents died, predictably.
