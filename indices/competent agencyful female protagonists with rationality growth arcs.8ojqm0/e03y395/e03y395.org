You might like Strong Female Protagonist, an ongoing webcomic. A large portion of it revolves around some of the real-world implications of superpowers (not as well as Worm, but it does a decent job), and it features a mostly rational but flawed protagonist. There's already been a decent amount of character development, with the MC coming to terms earlier on with the fact that not all of the world's problems can be solved by punching them in the face---though more development will likely happen in the future. SFP has its flaws, but on the whole, I would recommend it.
