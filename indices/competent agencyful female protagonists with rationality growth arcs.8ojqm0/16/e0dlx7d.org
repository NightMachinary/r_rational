I can do a bit of shameless self promotion and advertise my /Optimised Wish Project/:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863641/1/The-Optimised-Wish-Project]]

It's a work in progress rational Dragon Ball fanfic, and Bulma is so front-and-center in it you may as well say she's basically the protagonist, with Goku as a co-protagonist. I'm going for a pretty humorous tone so I don't know if it'd fit your bill for a growth arc though; she's pretty flawed and some of those flaws may actually get worse, but she's certainly got /a lot/ of agency.
