I'll plug my current work. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.616857/][Onward to Providence]] Although the character growth is going to be a bit slow going.

There is going to be a lot of "actually being rational/ doing things is hard".

That said the "main" character is not actually as smart/ competent as she thinks she is and a lot of the growth is going to be learning to be better at things and not trying to be everything at once.

So might not be your cup of tea. I'm also taking stuff a bit slow to let the custom setting sink in for the audience and avoid infodumping for pages and pages. So it might take a while to get to what you'd call the "good stuff" in this case.
