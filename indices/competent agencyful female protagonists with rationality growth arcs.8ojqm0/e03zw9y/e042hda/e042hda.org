I've read through maybe half of it in one sitting a while back on SV, and I was surprised at the lack of love it was getting there. I think it is absolutely excellent.

I simply /adore/ the way you write your characters, it feels extremely true to life for me, and very believable. I found it a bit scary how well I could relate to the immortal, immoral scientist lady - the way you write her thought process mirrors mine pretty damn closely (aside from the complete lack of understanding of morality, of course).

However, almost every one of the characters had a moment where I thought you showed a lot of insight into how people think (or perhaps it's just that I agree with the way you see things). I highly recommend this story.
