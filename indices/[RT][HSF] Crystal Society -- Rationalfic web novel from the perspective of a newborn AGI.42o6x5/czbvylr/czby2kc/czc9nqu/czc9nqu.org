It's a slow takeoff scenario. Growth seems the most likely out of all of them to end up superintelligence, but right now they're working with smart levels that are... pretty much par with what most humans can do, really. They don't even have any real advantages in learning math quickly or whatever, and their primary advantage is their ability to make decisions by committee.

Which is refreshing. For much the same reasons as that one post in this sub about how rationalfics about rational!protags stomping the setting was getting a little tiring, this is a refreshingly well-written, realistic take on an AI that doesn't go hard-takeoff within the first few chapters.
