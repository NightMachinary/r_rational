Author here. Make sure you're mentally distinguishing intelligence and wisdom/rationality. Yes, these researchers are not being as cautious as they ought to be, but they also are operating under the common misunderstanding that "if we see something go wrong, we can pull the plug and fix it". And, to be fair, this strategy actually works a couple times. I do not think that the scientists at the university are unrealistically foolish compared with real, modern AI researchers.
