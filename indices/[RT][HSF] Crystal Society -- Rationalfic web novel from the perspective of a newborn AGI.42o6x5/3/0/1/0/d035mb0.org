Yep. I've read that too. In the books, both Gallo and Myrodyn are concerned about takeoff. Others on the team are satisfied that the project has "an ethics supervisor" and leave it at that. Naresh is blind from years of working close enough with the problem that he can't take the outside view. Myrodyn is too arrogant. Etc.

The point is that while we'd love to live in the world where ultra-precise safety measures are set up and enforced with constant-vigilance, we actually live in a world where safety theater is a thing and people routinely make big mistakes. Yes, it's painful to see it failing from the inside, but it doesn't strike me as clearly unrealistic. :)
