This was an excellent read. I was captivated from the beginning. I enjoyed all the characters both in the Crystal and outside it. If this book were licensed or sold in such a way that I could buy a copy, I would do so. As it is, I'll just share it with my friends. I look forward to the sequels. Thanks for writing such an entertaining and thought-provoking novel.
