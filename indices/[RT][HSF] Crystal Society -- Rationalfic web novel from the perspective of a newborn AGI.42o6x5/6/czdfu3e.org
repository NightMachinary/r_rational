Wow this is really good. I'm 36% of the way through and it's so awesome. Ahhhh.

I didn't expect any AI fiction that would be good, but it is. This is easily in my top 10 books.

I'm on the edge of my seat on what's gonna happen. I love them all, except [[#s][Spoiler]] Can't wait to continue reading.

Keep up the good work; I'll be looking at future creative work that you'll be doing. You have a new fan :)
