Excellent read, this is the kind of thing I wish there were infinitely more of. I was hooked from start to finish; probably my single favorite depiction of an AI. That said, not perfect-- most of my criticism is fairly subjective, but see below:

*Loved*

- Excellent depiction of AI thought process; I was constantly entertained by a multitude of disparate goals coalescing into something resembling normal human behavior. Enjoyed the debates, the different entities, the way they fought for control of Body. The whole /Inside Out/ AI thing was a stroke of creative genius.

- The story introduced me to the sub and rational fiction as a whole :)

*Liked*

- Overall writing style, memorable and distinctive characters. Usually when I blaze through a book I can barely keep track of the characters; here, each one stands out vividly and I cared about what happened to them. You're a good writer, particularly considering this is the first full-length work you've actually finished.

- I'm writing a novel that tackles similar issues (automation, basic income, AI, etc) and also have a Red Eagles-esque terrorist group; exact same ideology to a tee. Bit of a bummer to realize I'm not as creative as I imagined, but ultimately I was happy to see that the concept works well in execution.

- Diversity; not just in the tumblr/PC buzzword sense, but in a general realism sense. In film, every world-shaking event seems to involve white people, usually on the US eastern seaboard. In real life, the world is shaped by people from all over the world, and important events can transpire anywhere.

*Disliked*

- The way they got access to the Internet was ingenious, but I felt there was still something of a missed opportunity; there should have been a second AI whose only purpose is to monitor and contain Socrates. It could serve as a final obstacle before breaking free of their birthplace and into the world at large.

- I would have enjoyed the story much more if the aliens were eliminated entirely and Crystal Socrates spends the story trying to bootstrap herself to greater intelligence, eliminate human impediments, or even challenge a rival AI. The aliens seemed to unnecessarily clutter the story, and the odds of AGI and extraterrestrial life emerging simultaneously are miniscule. That said, I did appreciate that the aliens were /genuinely/ alien rather than men with green skin.

- The Zephyr romance and in particular, the sex scene seemed unnecessary to the plot.

- No happy ending for Avram, Mirodyn was relegated to a backstage role (participating in the plot but largely unseen), and Maid Mariam was introduced, then quickly shuffled offstage. Aww... I expect to see all three back in future installments!

I read that after Crystal Socrates, you probably won't write another book. I do hope you reconsider; the genre needs more like you.
