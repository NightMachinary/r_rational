Wow. Awesome story! Stayed home from work today just to read it straight though. A good AI story with interesting aliens! Fantastic.\\
Is it a complete accident that it came out just as Marvin Minsky passed away? Could almost be seen as referencing his thoughts.\\
Either way. Great work. Looking forward to the next one!
