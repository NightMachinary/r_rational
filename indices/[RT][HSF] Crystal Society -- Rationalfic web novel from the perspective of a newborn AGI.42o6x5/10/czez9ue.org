This can safely qualify as a Rationalist RST fiction, protag is perfect for analyzing human thinking patterns and social customs. I especially like the several trope deconstructions in regards to humor. The human characters are a bit trusting and easygoing, then again this universe has no Moody to yell CONSTANT VIGILANCE! so that can be forgiven.

Division of AI into several characters is a great way to keep the story in thinking mode, without boring the reader, especially since some of them embody the alien/hilarious AI types, absurd humor rising from their interaction and necessity to fulfill purpose are fantastic, the parts about banners/statues and child to knowledge ratio for example.

The fact that the author has written and entire book and posted it in one go is extremely commendable, this prevents the serial format problems of having to wait, story cliffhangers and reading like an addict. Also more books are coming so YAY!

Good job mister Max Harms (is this a pseudonym or does your name really mean maximum harming?)
