Of all the fiction books I read - and believe me, there were many - this is the most insightful one in addressing how people think and feel, and modeling how a true Artificial Intelligence might think and feel. Written by a long-time student of AI and human mental processes, this book draws on fields as disparate as psychology, cognitive neuroscience, behavioral economics, math, quantum mechanics, and many others to bring to life a truly authentic possible world.

From that description, you might think it's boring. Well, I staid up late into the night several days reading this book. Coming from someone who values his sleep a lot, this is saying something! It's a real page-turner, and captures your attention right from the start. Each chapter leaves you hungry for more, and the book delivers. As a best-selling author myself, I can attest that the book was crafted carefully, over time and with much love, to optimize the experience of the audience. I'm really looking forward to all the subsequent books in this series!
