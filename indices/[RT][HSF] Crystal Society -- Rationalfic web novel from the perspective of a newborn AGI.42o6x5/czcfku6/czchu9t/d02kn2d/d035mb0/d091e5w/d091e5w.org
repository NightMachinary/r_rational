Agreed. The only bit that does seem unrealistic to me is the fact they are willing to use the crystal of unknown, (but presumably alien) origins so casually. Any realistically paranoid government would have assumed it was a trap, so destroyed it or only examined it from the outside very carefully.

However you do seem to be keepin the origins and nature of it deliberately vague, so I trust you have something clever planned
