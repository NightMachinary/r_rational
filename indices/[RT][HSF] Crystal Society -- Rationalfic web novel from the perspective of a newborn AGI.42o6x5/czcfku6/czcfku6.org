Maybe I'm biased because I can see the project going wrong from the inside, but are the researchers /really stupid/ or is it just me? I mean, this isn't how you do responsible development, it's taking a project that you /know/ is broken and instead of stepping back and asking themselves "how did we write a broken AGI", they try to monkeypatch it again and again!
