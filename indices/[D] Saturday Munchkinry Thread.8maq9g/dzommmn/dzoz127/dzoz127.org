Well.

The first step is, obviously, to make myself smarter, more rational, more bias free and so on. They say that the way you think changes you. So, if I could control my own brain's neuroplasticity to code certain better rational algorithms and eliminate bugs i.e cognitive and emotional biases...

Heh. Here comes the most perfect AI (until now).

After that... I don't really know.

Break the World's Casinos, Stock Markets, and other such institutions where being smarter makes you richer and richer?

Go for politics, become the President of wherever you are? ( If you can upgrade your brain to hold enough reliable information about social manipulation, you can do it. Though it won't be that easy. ...but then again, isn't patience also a learnable skill? :-) )

Achieve World Do-OPTIMISATION?

Research AI alignment research, AI research, Mind Uploading via Digital or Biological means (Cloning brains is where I think extensive research will bear fruit before you grow old and die but it's a temporary stopgap measure of course. Digital is where the real deal is at. Or maybe Anti-ageing technology will have a breakthrough...?)

...after that who knows?

(This skill is the one that I hopefully could get, is what I often pray to the Universe for, of course.)
