First thing I do is establish several computers with obfuscated letters stored on them, in multiple distant locations. I explain to two or three close friends what I've found and how to re-create it after my death. From now on, I'll be looking for compatriots that I can trust with the information of the location of the computers. I won't tell anyone the word itself for now, and they are instructed to learn it one at a time after my demise.

Next, I examine how I became aware of the word. I look for others who have learned it independently of me, so that we can collaborate without all of our lives being in danger simultaneously. Best case is that I find allies, but if nothing else I can observe the aftermath of their deaths to gather more data about how the apparition behaves.

Depending on the word, I'd check archaeologists visiting certain sites; people who play word scrambling games; linguists and polyglots; historians; etc. I'd also make advertisements that suggest I know the word and I'd put them in places where the knowing might encounter them.

I'd delay to gather information.

Specifically, I want to know if the apparition can generate information while killing people. Does it choose 'instantly learn combination to electronic lock' over 'kick steel door in', for example? If known to teleport, that's bad because it circumvents many ways I could use the apparition to generate information--it would rather break physics than play within it.

Another thing I want to know: does the apparition destroy the written instance of the word? If not, I can sacrifice my life to instantly teach very many people the word by sending it to them via text. The apparition will kill me, but everyone who receives it will know and as long as they don't further write or say it they should be in the clear. I wouldn't do that unless I thought it was useful but it's good to have as an option.

The other thing is, someone can write the word and be killed--but then another person can take the written instance in an envelope and bring more people into the fold, deliberately, without knowing the word themselves. Does that count as 'transmitting' it? I might be able to avoid having the chain of deaths intersecting everyone: just have an unknowing courier do the transmitting of the word to those we want to bring in.

What if I give a person the first letter, and a compatriot gives him the second, etc? What if he has to guess the last letter himself?

Another thing: what counts as death and how does the apparition kill people? If it punches out their hearts and disappears, or chops off their heads, or causes them to burst into flame, it makes a big difference--I might plausibly come back from the first two.

I would not do more without more information, but my first line of thinking is something like this:

I could set up a situation where I'm reasonably well protected in a maze of weighted doors that are easy but time-consuming to open. Every door has a mechanism that makes it slow to be pulled. The goal is to keep the apparition moving toward me without breaking reality--walking through the maze will take time, but it doesn't require breaking physics to get through. Loudspeakers shout my intention to the apparition. I tell it I will end my own life and save it the trouble if it provides some service. I'd also give it the opportunity to explain its motivations so that we might find a compromise.

I could also threaten to use the fact I'm doomed anyway to tell the word to hundreds of other people all over the world, increasing the apparition's workload significantly but not immediately, unless it does the service.

If the apparition is shaped like a person but is otherwise just a force of nature, this method is useless. That's why more information is needed.
