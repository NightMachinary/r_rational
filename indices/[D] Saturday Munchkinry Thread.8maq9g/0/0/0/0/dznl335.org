What if a parrot says it?

If I kill myself while he's going after me, does he stop his rampage? If I get defibrillated back to life afterwards, am I in the clear?

If someone else says it while he's going after someone, does he switch targets?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad][OTP]] is information-theoretically secure. If I generate a random key of the word's length, bitwise XOR them, and then send the result, does he come after me? If I generate the result but only send the /key/, does he come after me?

If both are fine, then: What if I send them to different people? Else: What if I delete one before sending the other, rendering the other indistinguishable from a random value?

If a quantum computer is in a superposition of containing a representation of the word and not containing a representation of the word, does he collapse the superposition into one of those states by coming after the operator/programmer wherever it does? That would amusingly produce an anomaly whenever anyone sends a quantum computer into a superposition over all words of sufficient length.

If he appears /across/ all quantum states /without/ collapsing the superposition, this is a magic hack around the no cloning theorem and I don't even know how far up this pumps the power of quantum computers.

If he goes after that person which leaked information about his name to a loudspeaker according to a convient metric, there may be a quantum algorithm that finds anomalies which can trick him into targeting himself. Note that an elegant way around this would be that encodings of "Quantum algorithm that finds anomalies" happens to be the set of words that summon him.
