What counts as killing me? If he can easily access a lever that turns off my artifical heart, will he use it and puff away, allowing an associate to turn it back on?

What happens if multiple people say the word? Will he kill all of them before killing me?

What if a device has a loudspeaker say the word? Will he destroy it before coming after me? Can I have him run around in circles pulling power cords from speaker systems as people plug them back in when he goes after the others?

What happens if people use the word after I am dead?

Hide in an impenetrable vault which has a door whose gatekeeper lets him in if he enchants an item with the ability to, say, bring back the dead. What powers would he get first? Teleporting past the gate, charming the gatekeeper, enchanting the item, Death-Noting me, ending reality, replacing the code on the nearest computer with that bitstring which maximizes my death probability?
