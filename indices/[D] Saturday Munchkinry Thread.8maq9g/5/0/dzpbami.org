I would immediately run into a dilemma, is it fine to remove parts of my mind that I don't like? At what point does that end? Can I ensure that my future mind won't suddenly decide something that present me wouldn't? Maybe the present me is certainly wrong compared to any less biased future me. Perhaps I'll think that I've /removed all my biases/ and start acting really crazy.
