  "People don't text or use the internet while driving" is an obvious behavior to eliminate with probably zero downsides.

Be sure to leave exceptions for calling 911, though.

More broadly - there're a lot of changes you could make that would usually be positives, and probably be positives on net, but would have significant downsides in some situations. Fortunately, "it's normal to X" leaves the possibility of people making those exceptions on their own... but I'd still be cautious.
