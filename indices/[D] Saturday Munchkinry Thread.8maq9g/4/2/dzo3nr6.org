  Mundane methods of 'cheating' in a medieval world (eg invent firearms or the compound bow) fall apart when level 3s are able to swing swords at supersonic speeds.

Just a minute here. Sure, a level three swordsman can swing a sword at supersonic speeds, but surely a level three rifleman can leverage his improved physical stats as well (running faster, dodging better, aiming faster and carrying a much bigger weapon more easily)?

(Besides, even if a rifle only gets me up to level two quickly, it at least /gets/ me up to level two quickly).
