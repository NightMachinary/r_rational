How can you munchkin in the world of Danmachi (aka, How to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon)?

For those unfamiliar with the universe...

- There is the titular dungeon, which contains monsters and forms the basis of the economy. ~80% of the GDP revolves around adventurers killing monsters for magic stones/items/materials. The dungeon is sentient and replenishes monsters and materials automagically.
- Humans (and other species) have stats and levels. Each level (from level 0 to 7+) represents becoming roughly twice as strong in every stat (2x stronger, 2x faster, 2x more resilient, etc.). Monsters follow these rules as well.\\
- Gaining 'stats' smooths out the transition between levels. A fresh level 2 is maybe 1.3x a max-stat level 1, while a max-stat level 2 is a full 2x.\\
- Gaining levels can be done via killing monsters or (more slowly) training. It follows the usual RPG trend of monsters weaker than you are worth less XP while monsters more powerful than you are worth much more. Being in a group is safer but seemingly splits XP.\\
- Time to level so can take anywhere from 1.5 years to 5 years, with the record time being 1 year of obsessive killing (40+ hour weeks). The super special protagonist smashes the record at 6 weeks by exclusively soloing things stronger than them. Level distribution roughly follows the power law where 70%+ of the population with levels is level 1, 20% level 2, 5% level 3, ... to there being ~8 level 6s, and one level 7.\\
- Supermaterials exist in this universe. Mithril, Adamantium, magic resistant, etc.. Stronger materials or materials with more exotic effects require defeating monsters deeper in the dungeon.\\
- Magic exists, and adventurers can get it, but it is poorly defined. Similarly with potions, magic/enchanted items etc..
- Magi-tech exists and puts the world at near-earth tech level. Everything seems to run on the magic stones that adventurers gather from monsters. Eg streetlights are replaced by magical stones set to emit light at night, stoves and fridges are powered by fire/ice magic, elevators are powered by arrays of stones...
- The economy is exponential. A regular meal costs about ~150 coins, a cheap room is 3k a month, the cheapest sword is 3k, and expensive swords are 50,000,000 (and still won't last you forever). A healing potion is ~500 coins, while a double HP potion is 10k. A normal adventurer (lvl 1) earns about 30k a month, while skilled non-dungeon labor is 300k a month, minimum wage is about ~30/hr.

Traditional fanfic in this fandom tends to boil down to 'go into the dungeon and just kill things /better/ duh', but that's not actually a strategy. Everyone in universe is trying to do that. Mundane methods of 'cheating' in a medieval world (eg invent firearms or the compound bow) fall apart when level 3s are able to swing swords at supersonic speeds.

The clearest answer to me seems to be to find a way to 'punch up a weight class' so you're killing things that are easy for you, but register as a higher level. However, I'm not sure how you could actually do that.
