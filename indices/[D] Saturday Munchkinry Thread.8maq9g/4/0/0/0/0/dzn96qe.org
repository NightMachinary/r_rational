  Okay, so you can pay people to power level you. And make money by power leveling other people.

The exponential economy naturally impedes this. A 30 year mortagage for a level 1 is a level 3's spending money. Although, if that's enough to get you to level 2, maybe it's worth leveraging debt to do it.

But it does open up powerleveling for different reasons. The story has a typical light novel harem thing going on with the majority of the strongest characters being really attractive women (and most of the strongest guys also being super attractive). If we posit that powerleveling (or patronage) is the most reliable way to get to high levels, that means there's some really interesting social implications there. It's just a genre conceit that the main character's allies are all super attractive ladies, but if we take the book at face value totally seriously then it takes on new meaning.

And interestingly, the cannon main character benefits from this as well, getting his life saved and items/training/exp like crazy purely because he's a harem-MC level of attractive. I don't think it was intentional, but it's a strong theme running through the story I hadn't considered until now.
