  So we are to be completely and utterly evil? I can do that.

I mean you can make a pretty good utilitarian case for world domination if you can pull it off right. Since you can obviously prevent conflicts caused by governments, divert military spending into charity and change laws which cause undue suffering.

I would also argue you're probably doomed to fail with your plans to reduce the population /that/ drastically via nuclear weapons, since fears of nuclear winter are no longer considered likely and many areas would get away relatively unscathed from a nuclear war except for some slightly higher cancer rates. There's be worse effects from the political effects of a war than the actual direct nukes themselves.\\
However wiping out nearly nearly the entire population might be relatively straightforward if you just unleashed a genetically engineered plague with only 13k people getting a vaccine. Though even then since you want to control everybody you'd have to deal with all isolated groups of people who would escape the plague beforehand which would probably require you have already succeeded with massive control over world governments.
