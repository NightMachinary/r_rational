  So with this power how would you take control of the world?

So we are to be completely and utterly evil? I can do that.

Step 1: Get the nukes. Mind control the presidents of countries with nukes, get them to tour the facilities with nukes, with a series of cameras set up so you can get the live feed of all the people you need to mind control to launch all the nukes. (P.S. Can you mind control someone through a live feed of a live feed of a live feed? Otherwise this step is somewhat dangerous/difficult.)

Step 2: Launch the nukes just about everywhere except where you are, drastically reducing the world population. Now you can control 13000 people out of X million people, rather than 13000 people out of 7 billion.

Step 3: Continue reducing the world population until there are only 13000 people, and now you can mind control them all. You have now achieved total world domination, with no chance of rebellion whatsoever since no one has any free will but you.

But since a nuclear wasteland probably isn't that ideal to live in, you need Step 0: Mind control a bunch of scientists to research technologies for you. Preferably complete the immortality/anti-aging research before starting nuclear war, so your reign can last for millenia.
