13 000 people? That's enough to cover the major decision makers in quite a few governments at once. Sure, not the rank and file clerks, but the people that tell the rank and file clerks what to do.

The method is simple - I see a politician at some public event. I control him to (a) agree with my goals in practice, and (b) introduce me to the rest of the decision-makers. Of course, I start out by picking politicians who claim to agree with my goals in public, so it's harder to spot the change (and if they used to follow a different agenda in private, then that now becomes the false agenda).

Now, I'm not making any changes to how any of these governments are structured - except in some cases to cut down on administrative bloat (and thus on the number of people I need to control). After all, it doesn't much matter who is in power or how long they're there - if one person is out of power, I release control and take control of their successor instead.

Now I have control over the people who write the laws in several countries. Now I can get them to write whatever laws I want...
