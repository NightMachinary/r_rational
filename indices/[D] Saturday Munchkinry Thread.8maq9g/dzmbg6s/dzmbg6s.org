Here's one that generalizes to lots of mind control world domination scenarios. You have perfect mind control (though it can't make people do something they wouldn't be capable of through any amount of training, and you can't imbue knowledge) however you can only control 13,000 people at a time. In addition you can't simply control vastly more people by changing people's personalities permanently, because once you relinquish control of someone their mind reverts back to how it was prior to your control leaving them with vague memories of what they did under your control and no personality changes.\\
Your control can be exerted very quickly (if you already know what changes to make) on anyone you can see in person or through a live feed with less than a second of delay.

So with this power how would you take control of the world? and perhaps the more difficult question is, how would you make massive changes to the world particularly its governments very quickly while keeping people from rebelling against your rule? After all you only control a tiny portion of the population and if you are making obvious rapid changes (which in this scenario you are making as many as you can get away with) to how governments and NGO's are structured people will be tipped off.

Since there are important things in society other than formal power structures I also ask how you would change society as a whole as quickly as possible using this control? Since changing laws and controlling businesses can only accomplish so much.
