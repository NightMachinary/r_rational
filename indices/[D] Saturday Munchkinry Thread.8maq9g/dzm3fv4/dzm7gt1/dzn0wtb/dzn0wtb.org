The man won't do any intellectual labor, nor will he be circumspect in how he approaches the task of killing you. His methods will overwhelmingly tend towards the extremely violent, regardless of whether there's an easier way to do things.

If multiple people say the word, he will kill them in reverse order of when they said it, and he'll always start at the bottom of the "tree" of transmission, working his way up.

The man won't destroy a loudspeaker saying the word, nor paper that the word is written on, only the person who set the loudspeaker playing or who wrote the word. (This does open the possibility that post-death, someone will stumble upon the word by hearing it looped on a loudspeaker, or scrawled on paper.)

If people use the word after you're dead, you're in the clear, but if the person who transmitted the word to you is still alive, he'll go after them once he's killed the person who said it.

If faced with a gatekeeper, he'll kill the gatekeeper, then attempt to use brute force to get past the door, increasing in strength and ferocity as time passes until his fingernails gouge steel and his punches crumple titanium. If this goes on for too long (more than ten minutes), he'll develop some other power rather than continuing to ramp up in strength and tenacity.
