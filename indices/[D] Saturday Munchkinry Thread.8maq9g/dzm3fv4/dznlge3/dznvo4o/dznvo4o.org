I believe your interpretation is correct. Honestly, this feels like a phenomenon similar to the Atomic bomb. That is to say, the obvious sane response to discovery is to say "well /that's/ an interesting facet of reality", put it in your back pocket on the off chance that it will somehow be necessary, and then *never touch it again.* I say this because the loss of human life seems inevitable, and reversal of that loss is unlikely.
