You know a Word of Power.

When you say or write this word, a man will appear somewhere within a mile of you and do his best to track and kill you, along with everyone else in your general vicinity, especially if they stand in his way. He has a number of powers, notably incredible strength, durability, and speed. If shot, he will growl in pain and bleed, but show little in the way of other effects. You can stall him, but not stop him for long, and he will gain more powers the more difficult you make things. If you hide in an impenetrable vault (for example), he will gain the ability to teleport in whenever or wherever you aren't looking. He has no known weaknesses.

You can transmit this Word of Power without "saying" or "writing" it, so long as you're sufficiently circumspect in how you do it. The two keys appear to be obfuscation of the word, and delay of the full message; if you want someone else to know the Word, you would want to do something like using a cipher and sending only a single ciphered letter a day, with the full, ciphered word never spoken or appearing on paper.

As a catch, if you transmit this Word to someone else and /they/ say or write it, the man will go after you once he's done with them. This applies no matter how long the chain of transmission is.

What purposes can you use this power for? How do you get around its limitations?
