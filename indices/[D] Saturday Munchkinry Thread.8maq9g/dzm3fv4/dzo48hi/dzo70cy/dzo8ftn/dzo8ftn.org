Okay, so...basically, any use of the Word also leads to my own death. So, whatever I use it for, if I use it for anything, it needs to be more useful than the entire rest of my own life.

I guess, if I'm trapped in a very small space with other people, I can rescue the other people by saying my Word and letting the juggernaut smash a path out for the others - but it's not something I'd plan for, because I'd far rather plan not to end up locked in a small space with several other people in the first place.
