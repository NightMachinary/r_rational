  It's possible that you could make the juggernaut speak the word of power - e.g., make that the easiest way of progressing toward you - so that the juggernaut is destroyed/delayed by another juggernaut.

Doubtful. It's clear that the Juggernaut's methods for finding me are unsubtle, brute force. It'll smash through a door or teleport, not say the password no matter how clearly it's described (and it can't be written down, not without sending the Juggernaut after me early).

  You could capture some of the energy expended by the battling pair and use it to some good end
#+end_quote

If it's energy I'm after, there are plenty of ways to capture that /without/ killing myself in the process. I'd rather just have a few more solar panels built than commit complicated suicide.

Now, I'm not saying that there /aren't/ things that are worth such a large sacrifice (especially if, as you point out, I'm terminally ill at the time). I just don't see how the use of this Word helps me in any such respect.

I /could/ always leave encrypted instructions from which the Word could be deduced in my will, along with some plan to give those instructions to people who are already terminally ill. In this manner (after my death) the Word can be used in a way that minimises the damage it causes. But it still /does/ cause damage, and I'm still not seeing any possible advantage that could be worth it.
