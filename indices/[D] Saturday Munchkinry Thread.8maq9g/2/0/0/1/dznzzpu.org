I think someone with the power to attract unusually productive employees can succeed in any business, so it comes down to earnings per employee.

Startups are risky and are going to ask bankers for money at some point, so even if you say 'unusually productive cancer researchers' or 'unusually productive longevity researchers', bankers are going to get a piece of the action at minimal risk.
