Perhaps I am ignorant of the difficulties of running a business, but there are millions of businesses that are making profits off things other than pure investments. Whenever I hear about trying to get money in stories and munchkin scenarios, I hear either: Lottery, gambling or an economics focused plan (such as investing in the stock market). I feel like we're just not exploring the solution space in any great depth. YKK earns /billions/ off selling zippers to companies who use them in their products.\\
There is negligibly low probability humans have explored all possible products to make or services to offer, and a single well exploited monopoly has far more potential than trying in a field that already has fierce competition. All the low hanging fruit is probably taken and any really good idea we can think of is likely to have been tried, but it seems a bit unenthusiastic to fall back on money -> investments.
