  investment bankers are really, really fungible

Even if this were true, they are not your investment bankers. Your power is to attract unusually productive employees, investment bankers have some of the highest earnings per employee in existence.

In addition, it is not actually true. Highly productive investment bankers have a large number of high trust relationships with high net worth individuals, are highly informed about current global business trends, and have excellent bullshit filters. These qualities are extremely rare, the ability to attract such people to your employ is a license to print money.
