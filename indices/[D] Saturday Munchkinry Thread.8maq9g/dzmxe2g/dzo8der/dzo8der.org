A core goal here should be to establish a system that controls access to the dungeon. This allows you to charge tolls/taxes for access, but perhaps more importantly allows you to control who has the opportunity to gain access to XP (preferably your allies).

As a secondary goal, have your alchemists/sorcerers research a method to enable people to pay the tolls/taxes in XP (e.g., to a mystical XP bank controlled by you) - and make XP the new currency instead of gold. Loan XP at interest. Set dungeon access fees so that everyone begins in debt. Drain XP as punishment for counter-revolutionary activities.
