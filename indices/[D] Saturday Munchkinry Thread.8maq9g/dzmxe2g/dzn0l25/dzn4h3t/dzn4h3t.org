Very insightful. A lot of those run along the lines of what I was already thinking, but it highlights it much more directly than my own fuzzy notions.

For specific points, the dungeon itself prevents a lot of the really interesting traps and terraforming (it is alive, and will reform and reclaim fixtures like that). Combat participation is a requirement for XP split, and there's social norms against leaching from other groups (read: they'd probably kill you).

However, there's still a lot of room to explore around the edges of the XP system. If I'm going to show-don't-tell those sort of experiments, then that's enough material for a medium sized story right there. Thanks!

(As an aside, I hope I'm not on a watch list after googling "how to make large amounts of carbon monoxide")
