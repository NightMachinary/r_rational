For RPG worlds, the way of the munchkin is always analyze the XP system. What counts as a kill? Can you dig a bunch of spiked pit traps and get a constant flow of XP from monsters falling into them? If you lift up heavy blocks of stone with ropes and pulleys, then drop them on monsters to crush them, do you still get XP? If so, you can probably build a giant XP farm just by repeatedly pulling up the blocks of stone and then dropping them, all from safely outside the dungeon.

What counts as a party? If there's people in the area do they automatically count as party members? Can you just stalk some high level people to get XP from the monsters they kill? Or do you have to engage the monster in some way? Can you pay some high level adventurer to just lug your body around and move your sword arms or bow arms to kill monsters with skills superior to your own? Since they never directly engage a monster, only indirectly by "puppet"ing you around, would you get the full XP?

Search for methods of mass destruction. Can you genetically/magically engineer a lethal virus that infects only monsters, and have it spread throughout the dungeon like a pandemic and get absolute tons of XP from that? Can you dig a tunnel from the dungeon to the ocean, and thus flood it with water and get tons of XP from all the monsters that drown? Can you blow poison gas into the dungeon until the monsters inside die? Carbon monoxide is really easy to create in large quantities. Can you set fire to forest levels of the dungeon and so burn tons of monsters alive?
