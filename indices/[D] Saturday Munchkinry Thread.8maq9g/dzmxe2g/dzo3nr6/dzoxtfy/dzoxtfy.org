Well. There we have it.

1. Use effective and efficient weapons, traps and techniques like guns, grenades, landmines, getting level-tutoring plus giving level-tutoring to get the low hanging XP fruits.

2. As you become stronger, faster and have more dexterity, endurance, stamina and arguably become richer (to afford some low level minions, (read not-party-members, just some porters who carry your equipment for you) there will come a time where you could effectively haul larger anti-tank level weaponry and blockbusting grenades (dynamites) as easily as manhandling a sword at supersonic levels. As you level up, so should your XP Farming tactics and strategies. :)

...

Alternatively. Just invest in plastic surgery or some magical alternative thereof. That's the best way for making your life easier.
