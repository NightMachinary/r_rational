1: Try to find a magic cure for ageing. The core limit on levels is that people die from old age, or, I suppose, realize they have so much money stashed for their next gear upgrade that they can live for the rest of their life in luxury without ever setting foot in the dungeon again. And if magic does not let you live forever, what is it for, exactly?

2: Try to figure out what the /dungeon/ wants. Its intelligent, so it has goals. The answer to this question is obviously kind of... vital.

3: the economic setup is daft, and thus exploitable as all hell. Go into the dungeon in a group big enough to take things one level up safely - the things they drops are worth ten times as much, so being in a party should increase your income dramatically. If you can take things down two levels up by bringing more people... - Key here, tough, is not having casualties, because that is of course unacceptable.
