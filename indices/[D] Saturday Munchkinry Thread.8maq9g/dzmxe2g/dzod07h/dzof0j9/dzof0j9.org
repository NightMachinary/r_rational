I suppose I should have mentioned that a lot of the difficulty comes from the fact that the setting is already somewhat rational for a light novel, but the first post was already going overly long.

1. There's already a solution to immortality, but it's not widely used because there is a real and verifiable heaven.

2. A solid point and decent plan. The dungeon desires the eradication of gods and sentient races. Interestingly, some people still take it up on the offer for power and make up the major antagonists of the story, which closes it off for my purposes of fanfiction.

3. This is actually the standard. The vast majority of people go in groups, and the most effective teams join grand expeditions although stay within +/-1 level. Damage resistance and AOE attacks make this problematic though, eg. the boss of the level 2 area could probably kill arbitrarily many level 1s, but is an achievable (but dangerous) foe for a large group of level 2s.
