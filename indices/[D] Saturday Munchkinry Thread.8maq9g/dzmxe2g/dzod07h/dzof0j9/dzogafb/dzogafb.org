That case, you set up an organization called "the long haul".

Entry requirement: "Willing to sign up for immortality"

Org Goal: Containment and exploitation of the dungeon. In that order.

Official motto: "The eternal watch".

Unofficial Motto: "Dying is for quitters and fools" . Train a lot, research tactics and weapons a lot, fight the dungeon conservatively, pay very careful attention to troop morale and sanity. It helps here that you have a goal beyond profit - that is, making sure the dungeon never wins.

Give it a few centuries, and your assault teams ought to be invincible.
