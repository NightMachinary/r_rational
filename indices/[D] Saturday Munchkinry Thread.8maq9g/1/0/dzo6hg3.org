We could start by eliminating many of the obviously stupid and counterproductive things people do which have no positive attributes. "People don't text or use the internet while driving" is an obvious behavior to eliminate with probably zero downsides.

From there, I would start making incredibly minor changes one at a time and see what kinds of effects those have. "People are 1% more likely to seek independent confirmation of information not relating directly to their personal lives obtained from sources that aren't peer-reviewed scientific journals" seems fairly safe. If we ramp that up by even 10% without causing any major unforseen disasters, it probably shatters the hold of most propaganda efforts everywhere without doing things like shattering relationships through skepticism.

Unless something else glaringly obvious comes up, I would set the book down after that. I can't think of anything else which might be safe enough to change.
