I was reading some erotica the other day and there was this intriguing device that I would like people here to munchkin. It's called the Normality App and any rule you type into it becomes a rule that everyone follows. Sexual abuse is obvious and the stories around it pretty much end up with the main character living in a hyper-sexualized culture that revolves around some fetish or ideal body type. Assuming a moral individual gets the device instead, how can one use the app to improve society? What rules should be in place that best benefits humanity in a way that causes the development of a utopian society?

Limitations on the app:

- All rules are cultural, no rule can change any aspect of physics or biology. For example, 'Anyone over 6 feet get $5,000 a month' works, but 'Anyone over 6 feet can fly' or 'Anyone over 6 feet are extremely muscular' won't work.
- The rules aren't retroactive. Nothing in the past will change.
- No one will notice or realize that people are following new rules or no longer following certain rules.
- The rules aren't iron-clad. Most people will follow them, but just like murder is taboo, there exist people (serial-killers) who can and will break the rules. The rule are meant to be taboo to break, but extreme personalities or circumstances can lead to people breaking them.
- All rules are universal. The rules can't be directed at a specific individual. 'All redheads are to be treated with respect' works, but 'Samuel is god-king' doesn't work. The rules can be specified to be about a specific group of people, but it must be a group that most people know of. So any common ethnicity is permitted, but some obscure cult or religion that few people have heard of wouldn't be allowed.

Build a utopia!
