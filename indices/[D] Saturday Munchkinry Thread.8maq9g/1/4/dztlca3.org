One thing you could do is induce interest and commitment to democracy and democratic ideals. Obviously you would still have folks willing to break those taboos (politicians), but it would still go a long way.

Second thing I would do is attempt to halt religious violence by making folks unwilling to kill for their gods, and more accepting of religious freedom.

Third thing I would do is attempt to eliminate racial, gender, and sexuality related bias.

Think how far increased civic engagement, decreased sectarian violence, and belief in human rights would go to healing the damage to our world.
