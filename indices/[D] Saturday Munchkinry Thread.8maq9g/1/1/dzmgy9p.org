I'm nowhere near capable of using this without destroying humanity.

Interestingly, if you just write down the rules in use by your own culture, you've destroyed every other culture on Earth without affecting yourself appreciably. That's not something you should just do (for any reason) but consider: if you write down rules that aren't in use anywhere, you're destroying cultures everywhere for something untested.

The hard part about making humanity function better is that any rule you impose tends to generate benefits for the rule breakers--for example, if you make people more charitable then charity fraud becomes much more profitable.

I'd probably look into decreasing tribalism and making humanity more accepting of apparent differences. We spend a lot of effort fighting ourselves unnecessarily, and I don't expect the rule breakers in this case to benefit substantially.

On the other hand, maybe with more acceptance the human psyche becomes less motivated and technological progress grinds to a halt because all thinkers have the subtle motivation of 'pride in my identity and disdain for others', whether they know it or not. I don't think that would happen, but it could.

Or maybe the outliers that are still prone to tribalism gather with the help of the internet and start an uncontested campaign to become the rulers of the world. That seems more likely.

Anyway, I'd hesitate to use this because it's almost certain I'd end up breaking everything, and it's definitely certain I'd end up destroying many things people consider valuable.
