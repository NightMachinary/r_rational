Seems to me an interested story take is a Lelouch obsessed with the preservation of free will, without simply denying the use of his power. One distinct possibility is to geass people with their own wishes, and to then find the people with wishes that match your agenda.

Think about the ability for people to accomplish things they're both certain of and obsessed by. It's pretty astounding.
