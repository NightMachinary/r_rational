  At which point benevolent gods start nudging player character paladins and clerics to gather their buddies, and come hunting you. When you are finally killed, your soul is either gone forever, or in the hands of some loathsome thing that proceeds to torment you for the rest of time.

A rational lich does a better job of hiding its phylactery~

Frankly, lichdom(?) is a rational way to "opt out" of the arbitrary magical afterlives.

"I've never wanted to follow the rules of other people/beings. You're telling me the after-life I have to look forward to is a plane of /pure chaos/ ruled (if that's the word) by caste-based lizard people and Gith-something? Pass, I'd rather stay here. For as long as I can manage."
