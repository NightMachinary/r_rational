[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/reincarnate.htm][Reincarnate]] costs a level, though. (Or stat points if you are first level.) What you want instead is [[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4V1t8ztX5pQJ:www.ogreforge.com/phpBB3/srd/srd/spells/lastBreath.php+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us][Last Breath]]

The other problem is that Reincarnate puts you in a Young Adult body, which is good because it gets around the aging issue, but it's of a random race. You can get around this using Polymorph Any Object or Wish, though.
