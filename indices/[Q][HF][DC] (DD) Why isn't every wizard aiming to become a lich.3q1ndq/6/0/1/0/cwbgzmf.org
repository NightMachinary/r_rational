  But, if you knew that you would eventually become not-you, would you sacrifice the current rational you in order to eventually become an irrational lich-you?

Is that implicit, though? There isn't a stated mechanism as far as I know that /changes/ the alignment of the prospective lich. It was just assumed as a given from the beginning that only evil beings would attempt to do so.

But /rationally/ there's nothing /evil/ about necromancy, right?
