It's really a question of PC or NPC. If you are a PC, then you really really really don't want to have level adjustment. From this perspective, Necropolitan is the only playable Undead race/template. If you're an NPC, then who cares? Your nature is dictated by the whims of the setting designer or DM anyway.

Once you get into TO, it's irrelevant anyway, as there are better ways to protect against death. Like the Hide Life spell. Or if you want to really pull out all the stops, True Mind Switch into an Ice Assassin Aleax of yourself.
