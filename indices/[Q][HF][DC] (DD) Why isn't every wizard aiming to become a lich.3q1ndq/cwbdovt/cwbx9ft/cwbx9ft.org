Interestingly, the Necropolitan Ritual of Crucimigration is just about the only way to absolutely, positively, no doubt about it, kill someone permanently. I [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?306515-How-to-kill-someone-permanently][asked about this]] over on the GITP forums a while ago when I was writing 2YE; there were a bunch of suggestions, but RoC was one of the few that I believed would actually work and fit within my ruleset.
