In that case though, you have specific vs specific, so it's a tossup which way it'd be ruled. Strict RAW would suggest that RoC wins out, but I imagine most DMs would rule in favor of the gods. Necrotic Termination has the advantage of explicitly destroying the soul, so the DM is more likely to consider it as permadeath (though there's a good chance they'd rule that gods can bring it back anyway).
