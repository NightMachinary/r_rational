  There's nothing inherently evil about it, after all.

Uh. I feel like you don't know what a lich is? In both Pathfinder and D&D, the lich template says "any evil". In other words, becoming a lich literally changes your alignment (we can quibble about editions, since I know this is true in 3.5 but not 4.0 and have no idea whether they kept it for 5.0).

So unless the pursuit of knowledge is not just a defining character trait but /the only thing a wizard cares about/, they can't become a lich without sacrificing their other values.
