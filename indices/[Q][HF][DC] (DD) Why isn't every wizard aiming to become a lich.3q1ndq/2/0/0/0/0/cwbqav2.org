If you haven't already, I'd check out [[http://www.dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Tome_of_Necromancy_%283.5e_Sourcebook%29][The Tome of Necromancy]], a splatbook which deconstructs the ambiguities and moralities of necromancy.

  *The Morality of Necromancy: Black and Gray*

  The rules of D&D attempt to be all things to all people, and unfortunately that just isn't possible if you're trying to make a system of objective morality. By trying to cater to two very different play styles as regards to the moral quandaries of the use of negative energy, the game ends up catering to neither -- and this has been the cause of a great many arguments for which there actually are no possible resolutions. Ultimately therefore, it falls to every DM to determine whether in their game the powers of Necromancy are inherently evil, or merely extremely dangerous. That's a choice which must be made, and has far reaching implications throughout the game. That's an awful lot of work, and most DMs honestly just don't care enough to be bothered with it, and I understand. Fortunately, we have collated those changes for you right here:

  *-Moral Option 1: The Crawling Darkness*

  Many DMs will choose to have Negative Energy in general, and undead in particular, be inherently Evil. So much so that we can capitalize it: Evil. And say it again for emphasis: Evil. That means that when you cast a negative energy wave you are physically unleashing Evil onto the world. When you animate a corpse, you are creating a being whose singular purpose is to make moral choices which are objectionable on every level.

  That's a big commitment. It means that anyone using Inflict Wounds is an awful person, at least while they are doing it. The Plane of Negative Energy is in this model the source of all Evil, more so than the Abyss or Hell. It's Evil without an opinion, immorality in its purest most undiluted form.

  *-Moral Option 2: Playing with Fire*

  Many DMs will choose to have Negative Energy be a base physical property of the magical universe that the D&D characters live in -- like extremes of Cold or Fire it is inimical to life, and it is ultimately no more mysterious than that. An animate skeleton is more disgusting and frightening to the average man than is a stone golem, but it's actually a less despicable act in the grand scheme of things because a golem requires the enslavement of an elemental spirit and a skeleton has no spirit at all.

  The Plane of Negative Energy in this model is precisely the same as all the other elemental planes: a dangerous environment that an unprotected human has no business going to.

  *Implications*

  It's not actually enough to simply make a sweeping generalization about the morality of Negative Energy and leave it at that. Like a butterfly flapping its wings, such changes will eventually cause Godzilla to destroy Tokyo. Or something like that, I stopped math at Calculus.

  Some monsters have been written up with the (incorrect) assumption that either "The Crawling Darkness" or "Playing With Fire" was the general rule. Others have been written in such a fashion that is actually incompatible with any possible interpretation of morality in D&D.

If the prospective Lich lives in the world of The Crawling Darkness, then Lichdom is an implicitly evil state of being, and becoming a Lich transforms you into an immoral actor. If they live in the world of Playing With Fire, then presumably Lichdom is /not/ implicitly evil.

The Evil alignment requirement for the Lich template would suggest that Crawling Darkness is the flavor of canonical DnD, but other templates and bits of lore cast aspersion on the idea.
