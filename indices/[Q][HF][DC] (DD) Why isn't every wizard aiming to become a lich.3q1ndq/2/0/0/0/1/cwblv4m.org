I assumed you had to be morally aligned with evil- but not neccessarily malice. A dragon who believes all sentients are his, doesn't care about anything besides his possessions but wants to protect them, and will do anything to do so could be evil alignment with good results.

On the flip-side, some people interpret neutral as "Me and mine first, but i won't hurt you if i don't have to", good as "everyone should be treated well unless they're hurting others. you may not be my important person, but you're someone's." and evil as "I'll do anything possible to make me and mine as happy as possible, no matter how much it hurts others."
