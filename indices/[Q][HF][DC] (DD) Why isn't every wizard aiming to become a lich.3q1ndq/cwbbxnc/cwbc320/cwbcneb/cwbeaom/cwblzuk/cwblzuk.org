No, he isn't. The assumption is- reincarnation is a thing (at least with certain spells), afterlives are a thing (gods are verifiably real, if not omipotent, and if you believe that, believing in an afterlife is easier. besides, mortals can bring back the dead, why wouldn't gods be able to do it a minimum of equally well?)

Yes, each of those things put knowledge in danger. so does lichdom, and the most dangerous afterlives for /anything/ are the ones with gods of evil.

There's also the possibility that wizards aren't paperclipper AI- they never cared about knowledge for it's own sake, just for the power it offers. maybe you have a religious one, who wants to maximize the people going to the good afterlife, while maximizing his personal odds of going there. knowledge is still valuable, power is still useful, but it isn't going to get the wizard going out of his way to get more.
