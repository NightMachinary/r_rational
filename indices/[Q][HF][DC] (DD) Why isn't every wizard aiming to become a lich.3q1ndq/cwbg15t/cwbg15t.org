I had a 3.5ed D&D wizard character a little while back, and by the time I got up near epic levels I had reached a point where I had so many different magical options available that worrying about setting up any one specific means of immortality ahead of time was kind of pointless.

In fact, for most of the campaign that character was actually /planning/ to die as a means of accomplishing his goals. Near the end he suddenly discovered that his big plan had a flaw in it and hurriedly cobbled together a means of personal immortality as part of an impromptu plan B (it involved a mash-up of the druidic /reincarnate/ and the wizard /clone/ spells, and the primary purpose wasn't so much immortality as it was to play cosmic keep-away with his soul to ensure his enemies couldn't get ahold of it after he died or even figure out what had happened to it).

I imagine that in a world where he hadn't been beset by powerful enemies and had just quietly worked away at his research he would have eventually looked up from his books, realized "oh, I'm 80 years old. I should do something about that" and taken a few months to develop some kind of solution to that problem. Lichdom has some downsides so he might have wound up picking something else.
