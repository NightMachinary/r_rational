There are no actual rules for swarms to age, nor for worms that walk to age. Thus your DM will probably have to houserule in any aging effects they want to impose on you.

From a watsonian point of view:

Every time you discorporate into component parts you can reconstitute from even a single bug breeding back into a swarm eventaully. It seems difficult to show how you could meaningfully age and, say, lose STR or DEX or CON when every part of your consciousness is duplicated and distributed through a mass of insects, every single part of which is discardable and disposable - if you discard everything but bug N, breed back to a mass of bugs of size Z, then discard everything but bug M, and breed back to a mass of bugs of size Z again, everything you are presently constituted of is as young or younger than bug M, and therefore at most as old as the first time you discarded your mass of bugs. I think it'd be very difficult to reasonably in-universe portray them aging in any meaningful way.

From a doylist point of view:

Age and aging tables come up so rarely in P&P sessions that most people forget they are thing that exists, and most DMs are very reluctant to make up a lot of houserules to institute aging rules that won't matter basically ever. DMs will never bother to houserule some in for your swarm form to nerf becoming a Worm That Walks, because it is a meaningless nerf that takes time and effort to implement for no reward. Unless you are having as part of your campaign plot something like thousands of years passing without anything noticeable happening and they really want your character to die over that time period, it just won't come up as a thing anyone will care about or worry about - and if a DM is determined to kill a character, that character will die, aging or no aging. If the thousand-year pause is a thing that is actually happening and will be coming up... then see if you and another player can arrange to Reincarnate (Druid 4) each other every 60 years or so - you can gain +3 to all mental stats for becoming venerable repeatedly, and so over thousands of years spiral off to having wisdom, intelligence, and charisma scores in the low hundreds fairly easily. No sense in not getting anything for your immortal time...

--------------

This junk is all theoretical optimization, of course, rather than something I'd advise for a real game. In reality, D&D stops meaningfully working and making sense as a game around level 9 to level 13, and when you are well into the 10+ levels you are probably playing more with houserules and mind-caulk than anything in the published books. Worms that Walks, lich transformation from Dread Necromancer, and a lot of other immortality options are *extremely* theoretical because the game stopped making sense without extensive and far-reaching houserules on a huge number of major issues long before they can possibly come up, so how they actually function in a real game will highly depend on what the real game actually is.
