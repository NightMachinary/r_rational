Not bad. I'd add to their solution list the [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/monsters/wormThatWalks.htm][Worm That Walks]] template, a pretty good immortality solution in 3.5 - you basically become immortal by becoming a sentient hivemind comprised solely of bugs.

It initially looks like you'd have a chance of failure of becoming a worm that walks, but you just trade all your higher-level spells for a much huger number of spells of much lower level using Rary's Mnemonic Enhancer and drive the success percentage over 100% trivially pretty much any time you'd ever consider doing this (usually after you have level 17+ and therefore have already gotten level 9 spells). You have to be evil, and it's sort of gross, but you get pretty nice benefits.
