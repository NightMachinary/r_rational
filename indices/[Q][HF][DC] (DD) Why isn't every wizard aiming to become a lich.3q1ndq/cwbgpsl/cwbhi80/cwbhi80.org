"Unspeakably evil" doesn't actually mean anything, ultimately. As you've partially demonstrated. There is no such thing as an "unspeakable evil" because someone will be fine with speaking about it.

Baelnorns don't have to do any unspeakable acts, for instance. So the universe matters, perhaps. But it seems more like the inherent "evil" of necromancy adversely affected the concept of liches (not to mention that magical creatures generally [and in particular undead] exist to be adversaries).

edit: [[http://goo.gl/SCyxXl][this would be unspeakably evil depending on setting, but obviously we can speak about it anyway]]
