Well, given that the method to become a lich is supposedly 'unspeakably evil', then even if we don't agree that 'unspeakably evil' is a thing, it's still probably something pretty evil. Like brutally torturing and killing a lot of people and trapping their souls to torture them some more, or something in that vein. Maybe some wizards are not willing to do this even if the alternative is dying themselves.
