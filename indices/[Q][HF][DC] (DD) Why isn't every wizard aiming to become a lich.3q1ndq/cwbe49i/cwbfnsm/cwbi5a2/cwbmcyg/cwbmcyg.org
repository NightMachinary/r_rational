Not forever- well, they can, but there are [correction: maruts] who, supposedly, start seriously tracking you down after "an excessive number of reincarnations". (not to mention you have to keep the druids doing it.) of course, this is a downside for any immortality, if it's canon in the setting at all. if it's not, then it's not relevant.
