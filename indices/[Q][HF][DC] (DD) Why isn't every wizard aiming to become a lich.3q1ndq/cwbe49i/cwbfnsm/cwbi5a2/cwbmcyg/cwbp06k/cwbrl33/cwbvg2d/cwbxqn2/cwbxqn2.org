I was just under the impression that lichdom is harder to break than reincarnation, though i could be mistaken. I also thought that lichdom has no acomplices, but the reincanators will eventually be qualified as acomplices, as per the Inevitables' properties, and killed. Eventually, you'd be out of druids, and, knowing doing this is a death sentence, getting people to do it is far more expensive.
