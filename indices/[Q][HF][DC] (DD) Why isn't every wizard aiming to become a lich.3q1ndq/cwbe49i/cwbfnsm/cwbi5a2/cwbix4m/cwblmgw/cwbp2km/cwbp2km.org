In a realistic setting, you're not going to just drop dead of "old age" suddenly, so you can always see it coming and off yourself first. In a sillier RAW setting where you literally die on your birthday randomly once you're too old, you can again just keep track of birthdays and kill yourself once you're about to get too old.
