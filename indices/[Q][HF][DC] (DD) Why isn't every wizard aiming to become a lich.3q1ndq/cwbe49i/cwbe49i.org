My first thought is that the cost of becoming a lich is too great. Without knowing every way possible to become a lich, I can't justify that specifically.

Perhaps a great many wizards do, indeed, attempt to find a way to become a lich without having to pay whatever cost is involved. After several decades/centuries of research, some of them relent, and choose to pay the cost. Others do not.

As an example of the most likely cost? In a world of the supernatural, it is common that when you take the shape of something, it changes you. When you become a lich, you cease being a human, elf, hobbit, or whatever. Your behavior changes. Perhaps if you are extremely strong-willed, you can resist the changes for years, decades, or centuries, but eventually you fully become what you made yourself into. At which point benevolent gods start nudging player character paladins and clerics to gather their buddies, and come hunting you. When you are finally killed, your soul is either gone forever, or in the hands of some loathsome thing that proceeds to torment you for the rest of time.
