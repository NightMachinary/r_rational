I mean, if you're in the setting then you have strong evidence of the memory thing because of resurrection spells, and if you're not in that particular setting then the rules are different. Not knowing what the certainly existing afterlife is /like/ is still a reason to put off dying, but you'll have plenty of intelligent people who decide to bet on the good gods not being douchebags to their followers after death. Granted I only really played 3.5, so I'm not a Planescape expert.
