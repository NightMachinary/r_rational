I brought up /Planescape/ to counter the proposition "you already know you're going to exist, in some form or another, forever" since the "acquire (and keep) knowledge" goal doesn't work in that magical afterlife context.

Granted, at some point in the magical power scale towards becoming a lich one would probably manage to figure out precisely how the afterlife works.
