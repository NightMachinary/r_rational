Well, summoning Murgoth, The Demon Who Eats Any Planet On Whom His Name Is Spoken, would be one such evil ... if he existed. Thankfully, the real demon has a different name.

It's also possible that the ritual involves something so horrible that, in the process of describing it, you would accidentally imagine it and start screaming uncontrollably until you died of screaming uncontrollably. Unless you were Evil, in which case you'd just be mildly impressed.
