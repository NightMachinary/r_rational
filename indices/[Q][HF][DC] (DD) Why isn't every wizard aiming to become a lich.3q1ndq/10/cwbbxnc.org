Life extension is not necessarily a strong enough desire in all possible wizards. Many people who are nearing the end of their natural life express desires for a /lack/ of extension, for various reasons. While wizards might have a slightly higher percentage of life-extension seekers than the average population, there's no indication that it's actually common, particularly amongst the aged. And a much younger wizard might not want to give up their young, healthy, and capable human body for that of a lich.
