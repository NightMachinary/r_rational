Better ways that don't hamper your growth in power with huge LA: go through a brief crucifixion to become necropolitan (make sure to take all your full-body painkillers beforehand and bring some nice music), become a ghost, become a saint, get perpetually reincarnated and gain eternal youth in the bargain, get a psion to true mind switch you with immortal being of choice. And then there is steal life on yourself: easily reversible stat drain, for permanent increase of lifespan.

For protection from assaultive death: simulacra, device of contingent resurrection hidden like a phylactery with contingent teleport to that place placed on your body, soulbind your own soul into a gem and create copies of that gem before freeing yours through a dominated servant, use the mind-split trick to get multiple copies of yourself, get a psion to mind-swap you with a mindraped eternal blade's blade guide and become unkillable, mind-swap with a vestige that a dominated binder has summoned but not yet bound while it's standing in the runic circle, thus becoming an unkillable entity beyond space with time to think forever like Quirrell in that one story--and you can return by having the binder summon you again and cast mind-swap from a scroll. Once you tick 17, create a timeless demiplane and wirehead yourself with self-mindrape, thus gaining an infinity of time to own the universe your mind can conjure. The absolute best part is that mindrape does not restrict you to thoughts you already possess, so by strict reading there's no need to even arrange periodic info input, (if you care, which you do, you'll have to get a good Ã©lan or devil or something to write a very complex mindrape instruction with enough random seeds to last you a long while, though since high-level, non-technical language instructions contain a lot of complexity you can do pretty well just with those) which even though easy to do by specifying in the mindrape that you periodically cast Scholar's Touch on a book or dvd that a mind-raped servant brings to you, would inevitably create a weak link in your eternity (i.e. traceable transfer that could lead someone to your demiplane). However it's not a problem--it doesn't take much time, if you've set it up right, for your demiplane to spawn life that could create info (your demiplane can't contain rare elements, but you can sure as hell bring them in and magically multiply them, or fabricate them outright, with your own spells or those of mindraped servants) and it's growing all the time. So though there's a period of initial risk it will soon be self-sufficient and can recede into the astral mists.

There are lots of other ways and these are by no guarantee the best and there might be mistakes. I'll try and look it up in more detail. Just IIRC.
