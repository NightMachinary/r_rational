I am familiar with min/maxing, but the OP seemed to be asking about in-character motivations:

A PC doesn't have to worry about immortality, because the campaign will end soon enough. A rational wizard comparing lichdom to becoming a Necropolitan, however, will probably see LA as a major sacrifice, but well worth the increased expected lifespan. IP proofing on a larger scale, essentially.

Ice assassin is banned by most DMs that know of it, but I agree, there are much better ways, though most are obscure enough that lichdom might be reasonable in a core-only setting, say.
