In 4e there's an epic destiny called Archlich, who doesn't have to be evil. The idea is that achieving lichdom is very hard, and most any lich you meet is going to have taken shortcuts by making deals with demonic powers or somesuch, corrupting them in the process (beyond how evil you have to be to make such a deal in the first place). It is possible to reach it on your own though, just much harder. Since everyone has an immortal soul, if they have reason to consider themselves good people they have reason to thing they will get into a good afterlife after they die, so unless you have a very important reasons to stay and the talent to make it so, you generally let yourself pass on.

As per the nature of DnD games, with differing edition rules and DM interpretation, it's very hard to determine what is canon and what is not. This is simple my view of the DnD world, with different things cherry picked so that the world makes the most sense given certain observations. I know that most liches are evil and good wizards don't generally try for it, and this is how I make sense of that.
