So underlying this question is a kind of a variation of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox][The Fermi Paradox]], in essence, if there are a lot of people raising their level over time, and at least some of these people transition into a immortal state, then where are all these people?

Like the Fermi Paradox, there a lot of potential answers to this question, I'll propose a few.

- There is no paradox, one of the suppositions is un-true. Perhaps not everyone aims to increase their level, transitions to an immortal state, or there has not been enough time elapsed. In other words, the number of immortal beings present does match the circumstances that cause their creation.
- A preferred path to an immortal state removes the person from the equation. Immortal wizards seclude themselves in forgotten towers, remove themselves from the plane entirely, or transcend to some other state of existence.
- Some variety of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter][The Great Filter]] exists which prevents persons from transitioning to an immortal state. Gods/Dragons preventing potential competitors? The transition to immortality having a low success rate? Simply very difficult to get high enough level to transition?

As to the specific question at hand, "Why don't all wizards aim to be litches." I can think of three rather simple solutions.

- Becoming a litch is a major project which requires a major investment of resources over the period of several years, and the success rate of transition is not necessarily that great. In addition existence as a litch might come with several important drawbacks, such as being hunted by heros, potential loss of your soul, ect. In short, wizard may do a cost-benefit analysis and decided that the effort necessary to attempt becoming a litch is not worth the cost.
- There may be other routes to immortality with a more favorable cost-benefit analysis. For example a carefully crafted [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/wish.htm][Wish]] for immortality might be possible.
- Despite their generally high intelligence scores, all wizard might not in-fact act perfectly rationally at all times. Indeed in D&D 'intelligence,' the prime stat for a wizard, is generally associated with the mere accumulation of a large amount of knowledge. While wisdom is associated with the correct and efficient application of knowledge, which seems a better fit for rationality. So in short, while wizards as a class might be very smart, they are not necessarily very rational. This explains the existence of owlbears for example.
