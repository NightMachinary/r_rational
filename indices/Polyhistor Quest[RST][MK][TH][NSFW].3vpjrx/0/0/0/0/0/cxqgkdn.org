Two definitions of the word:

#+begin_quote

  - a course of action to which one has an excessive and irrational commitment.

  - a form of sexual desire in which gratification is linked to an abnormal degree to a particular object, item of clothing, part of the body, etc.
#+end_quote

So if I wrote a bunch of books that all had critiques of capitalism in them, you might say that I had a fetishistic urge to deal with that topic, meaning it in the first sense rather than the second sense (with the connotation that I'm doing this because I have a compulsion rather than because I'm doing my job as a writer).

I think [[/u/Transfuturist]] is thinking that the author is irrationally and/or excessively drawn to torture and rape as topics, rather than taking sexual gratification from writing about them (though I don't think I'd preclude that without having read any of Polyhistor). A writer brings torture and rape into the story because they want to; they control the circumstances that make it necessary to be dealt with.

Whether it's fetishitic is largely a matter of taste.

Edit: A widely agreed upon example would be the overly elaborate (and long) descriptions of food in Redwall, which I think could safely be described as fetishism (in the first sense).
