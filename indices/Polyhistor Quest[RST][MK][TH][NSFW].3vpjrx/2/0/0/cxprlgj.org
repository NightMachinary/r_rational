There is only one murder-school; all the other colleges are normal. People attend because outside this school information about magic is carefully hoarded, and because graduates are given unlimited funding for personal research as well as a million a year for living expenses.

The school itself exists because in this world, trauma, insanity, and immense magical power often go hand in hand. Kroll, the founder and funder of Polyhistor, is a scientist, and Polyhistor is his personal experiment in using sadism and cruelty to motivate people to accomplish great things (Kroll is not a nice man). Other reasons become obvious as you read the text.
