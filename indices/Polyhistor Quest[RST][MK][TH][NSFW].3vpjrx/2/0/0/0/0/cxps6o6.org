Let's say 100 people attend Polyhistor.

At the end of their fourth year, 30 people are left alive to graduate. Of those 30 people, the top 10 all receive unlimited funding and go on to do whatever they want with their lives. The other twenty are "employed" by the Hydromancy division whether they like it or not, and by employed I mean they are broken and enslaved to Kroll, a fate worse than death.
