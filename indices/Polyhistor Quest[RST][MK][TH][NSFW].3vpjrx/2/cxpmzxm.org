is the reason such a system exists explained? doesn't make too much sense to me. I mean sure there have been cultures where that was accepted a long time ago (though i doubt it was quite that high of a death rate), but humanity generally averts such ideas. and magic doesn't really make it go away. there should be some pretty good reason for a world to exist where it is expected that 90% of the kids going to school are going to die..
