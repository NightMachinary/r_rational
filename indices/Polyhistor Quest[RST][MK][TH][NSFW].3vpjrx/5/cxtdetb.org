Reading quests is always just so bothersome. 1st is the awkward broken up nature of the story, one part has Time 1, Time 3, Time 5 the next has Time 2, 4, and 6. Just really awkward.

The second biggest thing is the author includes information in non-story posts with which the readers vote. Missing this information detracts from the story and the experience.

At this point I've read up to the first time skip and I just don't understand why they haven't gone back and sorted it all. It's not exactly like he's just started and so catching up would be easy.

There's also all the not time specific stuff that I have no idea when I should read.

Plus there are way too many typos for my liking.
