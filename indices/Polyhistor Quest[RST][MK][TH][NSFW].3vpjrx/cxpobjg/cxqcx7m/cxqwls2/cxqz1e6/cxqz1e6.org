I haven't read the story yet but presumably this is a choice made by students in order to increase their chances of success. If there's only 10% left then everyone gets funding.

In that case you have a self selecting population of people willing to murder to get ahead, if there was no rape or torture or other psychopathic tendencies I would be more surprised then.

Enders Game for example has the whole watching thing to select out too sadistic people.

Either way Battle Royale doesn't fit because it's everyones first time. Hunger Games I would expect sadistic behaviour from careers and in those type of games where it is a short period you have less time for indulgence. If careers aren't monsters outside then I am surprised.
