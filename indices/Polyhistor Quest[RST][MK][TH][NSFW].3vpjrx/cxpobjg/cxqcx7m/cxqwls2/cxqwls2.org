The torture and rape were what I was referring to, first of all, and second of all, the kind of bloodsport that these stories (The Long Walk, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games, and now this) are about differs greatly from warfare. In these settings, the bloodsport isn't even necessary, as it is imposed by a unified authority instead of as a reaction to a genuine militaristic threat.
