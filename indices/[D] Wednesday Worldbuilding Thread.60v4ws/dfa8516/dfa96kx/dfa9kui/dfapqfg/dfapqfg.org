I didn't say anything about stopping with your main competition.

ETA: like, I apologize for not taking your scenario in the spirit it was intended, but if the options are (as they appear to be) either hit the button and risk UFAI, or do everything possible to stop everyone working on an AGI project that isn't /really really hardcore committed/ to solving the control problem first, it seems like you should do your best to accomplish the second one.
