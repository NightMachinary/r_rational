Cool so the AI decides the easiest way to do that is to wipe out humanity and spread out as a paperclipper to try to maximize the chances of it killing any more GAI then offing itself at some point in the future (maybe just after it kills humanity).\\
Trying to use a GAI in a narrow capacity to stop competition has all the same problems as using genie style AI's generally and getting instructions as vague as yours to work will probably require solving the control problem which we haven't.
