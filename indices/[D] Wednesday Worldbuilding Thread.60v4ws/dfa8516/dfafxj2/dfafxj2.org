To draw some analogies, this is like genetic engineering applied to bioweapon development, or nanotechnology applied to self-replicating nanobot development. In all three cases, you have researchers developing something which can easily grow out of control and cause an extinction event unless proper safety protocols are built into it. Due to the Fermi paradox, we have to assume that there is very significant risk of developed civilizations generally becoming self-destructive as a result of technological development, and these all seem like plausible possibilities for accidental technological extinction.

Fortunately, at present, all of these likely require Manhattan Project levels of investment and hundreds of top specialists in multiple disciplines to collaborate on the project. However, with every decade, the difficulty of pulling off projects like these will likely decline, eventually reaching almost no difficulty. Thus, we are going to have to prepare for such projects to be completed and to overcome the accidental or intentional catastrophes that result from them.

Fortunately, achieving societal responses like this is fairly simple. Once most people are fully convinced that a threat is real, imminent, and catastrophic, it's pretty easy to provoke immediate action to resolve the problem. In this case, your best option is probably a simulated controlled release of your AI.

Since this is a general AI, any direct access it has to outside networks will probably throw all semblance of control out the window. Which is why you make it a simulated release. In other words, your GAI is going to stay securely locked up in an airgapped network. Set up some computers on the private network, give it plenty of general information along with access to Metasploit, Nmap, and OpenVAS. There should be target computers which are fully updated, should have no known exploitable software installed, and should be behind a firewall from the computer with the GAI. Log all network traffic so you can see what happens. If the GAI manages to break out of its one computer and onto another, analyze what it did to exploit the previously unknown vulnerability. You should now have an exploit that can be used to access other computers on a widespread scale, allowing you to install propaganda of your choice.

For example, you could have a popup that appears every hour and repeats something along the lines of (without the acronyms): "You are the victim of an exploit developed by a GAI. If (government for the computer's region) fails to pass a law regulating GAI by (specify date), then your drivers and BIOS settings will be altered so as to render your computer permanently inoperable in order to protect it against the possibility of actual takeover by a GAI. Contact your government officials ASAP. Please click "Oh shit" to continue."

If you don't get such an exploit before the other groups release their AI, then GAI is unlikely to be immediately catastrophic due to existing computer security measures. There's still concern about eventual extinction-level danger, but it would likely take a while. If you do get such an exploit before the other groups release their GAI, you should have little difficulty using your propaganda to persuade governments to mandate rigorous GAI safety testing prior to release. This should buy you at least a decade, and quite possibly much more, and will likely also lead to somewhat more robust computer security, at least in part from the exploit reports released during GAI testing.

Unfortunately, such methods do not seem nearly as feasible for promoting nanotechnology and genetic engineering safety standards. Let's hope that GAI comes first so we can be inoculated first by a potential technological catastrophe which is comparatively easier to manage.
