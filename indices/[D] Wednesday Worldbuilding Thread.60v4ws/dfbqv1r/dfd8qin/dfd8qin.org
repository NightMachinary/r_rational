Just a little thing I thought of, but nations who want to attack or hinder their enemies might have squads of infiltrators who are selected for intensity of emotion. Recruit people with borderline personality disorder, for example, and then have them make their way towards enemy towns and cities, attracting massive amounts of Grimm, and once the Grimm start attacking and perpetuating a feedback cycle with the town's emotions, the squad runs away and maybe takes some Xanax, so the Grimm don't follow them.

Easy, and almost complete plausible deniability.
