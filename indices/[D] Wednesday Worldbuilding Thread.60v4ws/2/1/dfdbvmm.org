It's my interpretation that Grimm aren't attracted to negative emotions in general, but tension and strife within a community. When people distrust and fight one another, the Grimm sense vulnerability and more attack the worse it is. This means that the plan to lure Grimm with specific people wouldn't work, since they wouldn't cross the threshold to draw large numbers, and armies wouldn't be any more vulnerable so long as they were well disciplined.

The Grimm have probably caused a kind of natural selection of social groups since those that can't stand together and fight for common goals would be overrun. As a result, the communities that have survived tend to be more tribalist. Conflicts over religion and resources are even harder to resolve when bias towards people near you is a valuable survival mechanism. Grimm still make warfare more difficult, but not any more so than everything else about running a society.

If you need details about how tribal conflicts work socially and psychologically, I recommend /The Righteous Mind/ by Jonathan Haidt. It's the only sociology book I would've read if it hadn't been required of my GE class.
