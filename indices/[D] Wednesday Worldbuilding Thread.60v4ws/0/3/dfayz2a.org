Try to get access to nuclear weapons, then blow them up in upper atmosphere, frying everything electronic on the planet?

That's literally my best plan. If you create an AGI, you will most likely cause an omnicide (no matter how clever you think you are trapping it in a box). If you don't create an AGI, the others will, and almost certainly cause an omnicide. Therefore, you must stop the AGI creation.

The plan above does that in the only surefire way, and at a cost of merely resetting all progress made by humanity in the last thousands of years.

No, I have very little idea on how to go about getting access to the nukes. Still a better bet than doing anything with the AGIs.
