Stage the release of a GAI which goes on to destroy a carefully calculated number of human lives or to act as a threat for a short period of time to firmly demonstrate to the world the dangers of GAI without the control or values problem solved. This way, when your GAI eventually shuts down, everyone will have first hand experience with a UFAI to ensure they understand the dangers.

Of course this assumes that you are an amoral sociopath who is willing to build a superhuman intelligence which will proceed to destroy human lives before making the superhuman intelligence commit suicide and is narcissistic enough to believe that this plan won't go wrong in some fatal way.
