Murdering the other researchers isn't likely to work because as I said even if you stop your main competitor a bunch of other people will probably make UFAI shortly afterwards. I purposely specified that stopping someone else from getting GAI would probably be impossible without a GAI of your own.\\
The point of this scenario is to try to figure out the best solution to scenarios where you don't have value/control problems solved but you are forced to figure out how to proceed anyway because someone else will get there soon and you can be quite assured that will end badly since they have both no solution to value/control and no sense of this being a real issue.
