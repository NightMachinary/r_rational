You are in control of a group very close to developing GAI, you could actually make it now but you haven't solved the control or values problems.\\
Now there's another group who will launch their's at the end of the year, but based on their previous proposals for solutions to value/control problems you can be quite certain if they get their GAI first it will result in human extinction or maybe wireheading if we're "lucky". Also slightly afterwards a bunch of other groups worldwide would be set to launch (they aren't aware of when their competitors are launching you have insider knowledge) so stopping someone else from getting GAI is probably impossible without superintelligent assistance.

Now you have no hope of solving the value problem within the year (and don't know how many years it would take) you have before your competitor launches, but you still have the first mover advantage and a hell of a lot more sense (you have lot's of good AI risk experts) than your competitors who take only token gestures towards safety. Assume you don't have knowledge of how to solve control/value problems more advanced than what we currently have, there's been little progress on that front.

So with that in mind what's you best plan?
