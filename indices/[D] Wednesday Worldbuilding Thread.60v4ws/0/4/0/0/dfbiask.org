  we are basically incomprehensible eldritch horrors to chimps and the difference in absolute intelligence there isn't exactly /massive/.

A lot of this is due to time. We humans talk with each other, we build our conclusions upon the conclusions of others - we see far, in short, because we stand on the shoulders of giants.

In this case, the AI doesn't /have/ the time to develop its own entire technological base to awe us with.

Having said that, though, your other points /are/ very good ones. In response, all I can say is that yes, my plan is flawed, but I still think it's a whole lot better than letting the competitor make his AI first... which isn't exactly a high hurdle to clear.
