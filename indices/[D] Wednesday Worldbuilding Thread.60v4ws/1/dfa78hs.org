Working on my [[https://www.gitbook.com/book/kiba/ninja_scout/details][kung-fu battle wizard]] setting. I finally started adding monsters, but it's very slow going, because the monsters must be built for a very special and weird environment. None of the traditional monsters really work, because they're made for a much flatter, more 2D terrain. Creatures all need some sort of method of climbing and flying in this setting.

Another difficulty is defining the basic abilities and power that a trained soldier have, never mind for civilians type.
