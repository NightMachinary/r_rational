Hey everyone! I also put this in the Discord

Years and years ago I happened upon Orson Scott Card's Intergalactic Medicine Show, a scifi/fantasy literary e-zine that was full of great stories. My very first issue had my favorite story, and I've been sitting around for years occasionally lamenting how I couldn't talk with anyone about it.

Well, the IGMS facebook page just mentioned that they opened the entire library up for free, and what better way to let people know than sharing this little story with an idea that I thought [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would eat up: *Tediomancy!*
