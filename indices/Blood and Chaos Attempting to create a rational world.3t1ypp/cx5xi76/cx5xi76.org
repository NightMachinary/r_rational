Hey! I was one of those who followed the original link from here, and have been keeping up since.

Honestly you've been doing a pretty good job of keeping the plates spinning. I went into the fic knowing that it was largely a seat-of-the-pants writing project riffing on canon, so I'm not expecting a tightly-written plot-centric trip from A to B. Rambling and diversions are part of the charm.

A /lot/ is excused in terms of things not having majorly butterflied their way away from canon yet in that Jack's scope remains fairly small and the big players are all intact - particularly the Mayor.
