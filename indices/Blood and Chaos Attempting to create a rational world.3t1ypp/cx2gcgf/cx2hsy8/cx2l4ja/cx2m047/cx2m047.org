I suspect it's because they both like to pretend they're "normal" groups. Something like Harry Potter's statute of secrecy /must/ be at play in the world for the supernatural to remain hidden... for the most part anyway. Sunnydale Syndrome only on a larger scale. Though I suppose that the various players could all be running independent clean up operations on supernatural leaks. If they started causing major explosions the national governments would take exception via the torch and pitchfork methods.

Which I suppose brings up the far more generalized question of how do you rationalize History playing out the same ways when magic is a thing that people have access to?
