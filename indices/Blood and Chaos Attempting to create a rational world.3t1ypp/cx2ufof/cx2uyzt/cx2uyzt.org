Hey.

I'm actually building towards that. I think?

WR&H reaching out to Jack is one of the earlier things to catch Jack off guard.

I see The Mayor as the top/central figure in the metaphorical:

#+begin_quote
  I visualise it as a nigh-endless pile of horrors crawling over each other to reach to top and do something crazy. If you curbstomp the upper horrors to death, there's a new group ready to try and become king turd of shit mountain.
#+end_quote

If Jack... er... When Jack... does something to mess with the Mayor's ability to keep order? All hell breaks loose.

Which isn't to say that Mayor is all powerful, just very good at politicking in supernatural circles.

Edit... Which makes me wonder if Jack is going to have to reluctantly declare HIMSELF king of 'shit mountain' to restore order.

... which then makes me wonder what would have to happen to make Jack: A) Notice the war was going on B) Give a single flying fuck at all. C) Decide it was /his/ problem to solve
