Well, I guess "geo"-political more than magic. Magic doing bizarre and unexpected things for no reason is why its magic not science.

But, do my characters and factions appear to be doing things that make sense for them rather than being driven by an arbitrary plot?

If they are, does anyone have suggestions on expanding that outwards to encompass the Watcher's Council interacting with various governments and other international entities like Wolfram&Hart.

If they aren't, what gives that impression?
