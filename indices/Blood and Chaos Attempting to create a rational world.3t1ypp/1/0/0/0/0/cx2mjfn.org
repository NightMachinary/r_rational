You don't. You can't justify history turning out the same way with one air molecule being out of place, let alone magic existing. (only takes one microscopic difference in timing before entirely different people are being born.)

There is the: "You can't prove our real world hasn't been this fictional world all along" tactic that exists in worlds where the supernatural is secret. Some authors write magic into historical wars, claiming that was how they came to pass in the first place.

There is also the: "An infinite multiverse, finite possibilities" tactic to justify that the ridiculous coincidence of similarity might still happen /somewhere/. Though far more pseudo-buffyverses with a different history would exist.

But ultimately you have to rely on suspension of disbelief for this part.

Oh or did you mean within the context of your story? Jack is an SI after all so this is of particular concern to him. Yes I would use the second justification combined with the Gods explicitly choosing a universe he would know about for the sake of chaos.
