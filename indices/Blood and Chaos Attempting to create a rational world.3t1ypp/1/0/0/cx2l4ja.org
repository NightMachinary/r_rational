So. I'm no BTVS expert, so I can't be sure where the gaps in cannon that even need to be filled in lie. I only even watched the first three seasons. But I do have the wiki. I also believe you have said that you have watched both Buffy and Angel but didn't read any of the comics?

From my impression the Watchers do a lot more than just help the slayer. The Slayer is just their trump/wild card... that respawns.

They fight evil, they train new watchers in the watchers academy, and they send them after monsters. My educated guess would be that they are big into Intel (You know... Watching. Heh), exchanging Intel with governments, sending in their black ops team to get information in cases... And once they find something that needs to be dealt with. The watchers they send in? I'd expect them to fight dirty. Of course the Watchers /Council/ would direct all this.

As for Wolfram and Hart? Well uh, actually having never watched Angel I'm having trouble determining what their interaction with the Watchers council is supposed to be, and I just read like, ten episode summaries. Wolfram is listed as an enemy of the watchers council though so I guess the council is supposed to know about them. I guess generally you have to explain why the two organizations don't just blow up each other's HQs. There's probably a canon reason though.
