This is exactly what I'm warning you against doing. A Batman who only makes things worse is much harder to pull off gracefully than a Batman who, through great effort and personal sacrifice and with serious risk of failure, manages to cause a significant change in the world. The former is also somewhat out of keeping with Metropolitan Man, which accepts both Superman and Lex Luthor as they are.
