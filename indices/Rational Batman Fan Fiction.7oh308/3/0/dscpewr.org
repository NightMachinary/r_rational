  a world with lots of meta-human criminals which the police force can't handle
#+end_quote

After a couple generations, that world might cut back their police more and more as it becomes accepted that ordinary humans simply can't fight metas, and eventually most people take for granted that crime fighting is the job of masked superheroes.

Maybe Bruce Wayne has to dress up and pretend to be a metahuman to be taken seriously as a crime fighter. Or maybe he really believes he has powers. In the comics he's shown as having incredible willpower and endurance, brilliant intelligence and charisma, and he must only be sleeping 4 or 5 hours a night to keep up that schedule.

None of those things is necessarily supernatural by itself, but to have all of them in a single person who also seems to have uncanny luck and things like Not Being Shot By Muggers and being Born A Billionaire? If he were a D&D character his lowest stat would be a 16. It could all just be training and luck, but Bruce might believe, or want to believe, that his abilities are better explained by a low level of super strength and speed, or intelligence, or subconscious magic. They might be rare, but he's heard stories of low-power metahumans, with abilities like telekinesis up to one foot range and half a pound of weight. Surely his mental and physical abilities are more impressive than /that/, right? Right?
