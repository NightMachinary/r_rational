If this is a sequel to /The Metropolitan Man/, then I'd recommend writing from the perspective that the world is truly screwed. I view it this way: Superman was given to Earth to help guide civilization past the various pitfalls that are about to befall us. Such as a nuclear apocalypse or other Great Filter events. Since Lex Luthor decided that /Superman/ was the greatest potential extinction event... now we have to go it alone, without help.

So, my advice would be figure out what the Kyrptonians knew that mankind really needs to know but doesn't, and use that to help support an overall plot.
