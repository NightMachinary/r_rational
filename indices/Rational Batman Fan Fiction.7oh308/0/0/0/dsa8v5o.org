And that's very fine; in the art of storytelling, one often begins with the hero in their ordinary situations. Meanwhile, there should be other things going on behind the scenes with big reveals made in the final act. What I'm saying is that if this is a sequel to /The Metropolitan Man/, then it needs to link together. Not necessarily from the beginning, but by the end of the story, the audience needs to see the connection.
