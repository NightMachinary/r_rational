I like the deconstruction idea. Part of what made Metropolitan Man so fun was Lex and Clark each struggling to be rational, and questioning their own rationality. You could have a good story where Bruce tries to become Batman and has to confront the gap between his desire to have maximum positive impact and his desire to beat up criminals. Even if he decides in the end to stay Batman and keep beating up criminals, not because it's what Gotham needs but just because he enjoys it, that journey to self-awareness could be fun.
