I've got a suggestion or two.

First up, I recommend reading the book "Becoming Batman" [[https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Batman-Possibility-Paul-Zehr/dp/0801890632][Link]], loved that book, a nonfiction on just what it would take to become Batman in the real world.

Now- having read that- or at least thought about it- you have two choices in front of you I'd say.

Either make Batman more... power hungry than he is in the comics- that is, instead of putting villain's weapons and gears in a museum, he should have a team of engineers reverse engineering it and putting it to use, to give him a leg up- and having scientists study things like the Lazarus pits when Batman comes across those- as a priority since they literally bring you back from the dead- the potential as a medicine is amazing, if you can only get rid of the pesky part that makes everyone that takes a dip insane. Might be the most important discovery of the human race since fire.

And/or you could do a deconstruction. Have Bruce Wayne realize that becoming Batman is more than a life's work, and the cost of it- which is astronomical (and discussed in becoming batman, but there's also [[http://mashable.com/2012/07/30/how-much-would-it-cost-to-be-batman/#egXtsQV5vuqC][web articles about that]]), and that it would be better to start a security company or fund the police, or fund scientists studying meta humans and scifi weaponry from villains to better help regular cops do their jobs- better bang per buck.

I'd say have him just donate the same amounts to charities/start charities and such, but just that would make for a short oneshot I'd say, an interesting fic it does not make.
