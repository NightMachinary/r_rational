Yeah, but if you're being rational, you first have to understand the rules of the universe it is set in.

Namely... do actual superpowered enemies, or rich "super-villains" similar to Batman himself, actually exist in the world?

Because, if so, you'd realize that just "Donating money to the police" isn't going to cut it in such a world. Sure, they might have SWAT teams that specifically exist to fight against those types, but that's the sort of thing the supervillains themselves will study and plan against.

You can do a fairly successful deconstruction followed by /reconstruction/ of Batman. Batman doesn't beat up mooks because its /fun/ (although that could be an added bonus), he has /reasons/ for doing so.

I can think of two obvious reasons why he would do so.

The first is as a "weapons test". He can try out new techniques and gadgets on relatively "safe" opponents that aren't equipped as well or plan as well as he does. Thus he has a sort of controlled environment to practice. Sure, you /could/ try that new Batarang against a gel target, but you get much more reliable data using it against a living thug.

The second is for what I've unofficially called the "honeypot" scenario. By beating up bad guys, he effectively serves as a lure for worse guys. The threat of his mere presence will damper some of the lesser crime in the area, pushing up the "value" or cost of the fruits of that crime. Thus, more capable criminals will move into the area or rise up from it in Darwinian fashion. Supervillains (or even just aspiring supervillains) from other locations looking to make a name for themselves by defeating the legendary Batman will come from far and wide to challenge him in some way, turning Gotham into a giant "Villain Roach Motel". This is basically what Batman does in most of the media he's featured in, though it's rarely directly stated.
