Well, off of the top of my head, I can't think of any Rational Batman stories, but there was that one Rational Lex Luthor fanfic that I read a while back, and there's the ongoing fanfic of With This Ring, wherein a self-insert wakes up on the moon with an Orange Lantern ring and proceeds to try to use it as rationally as possible.
