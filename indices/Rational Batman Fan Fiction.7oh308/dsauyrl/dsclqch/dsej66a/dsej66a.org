I'm like a shitty riddler. I have to leave clues, but they can be as opaque as I want them to be.

Edit: Not to be self-centered or overly dramatic about myself or anything, I'm just joking.

Edit 2: An actual contribution could be that the strong suggestion is that it provides motivation to think of ideas when you're told that there are great ideas that you don't know that are confirmed reachable (because someone already thought of them). Like in that Yudkowsky short story. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/qt/class_project/]]

Edit 3: If you haven't read the short story before, read the ones that come first first.
