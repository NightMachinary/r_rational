Part of what makes Metropolitan Man so great is that Superman is a radical departure from reality, just by his nature. Wales then asked, “how can I proceed as rationally and realistically as possible from here?”

Id try to figure out how to do the same thing with Batman. Batman isn't fundamentally impossible, just highly impossible, so it's actually harder to proceed rationally from that premise.

One way forward might be to posit a world with lots of meta-human criminals which the police force can't handle. That might make vigilantism more reasonable.
