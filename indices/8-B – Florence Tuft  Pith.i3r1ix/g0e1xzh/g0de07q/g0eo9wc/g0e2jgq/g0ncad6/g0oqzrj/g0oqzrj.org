I don't know if it makes sense for them to wipe those memories considering Tuft mentions her joining abilities are fairly basic and I think the Shenti are known for being some of the best joiners in the world so they probably already have her joining vocations. Maybe it just takes a really long time to set up a joining vocation in a body or their skills with precision memory wipes are rudimentary enough (this too was mentioned) that they accidentally removed more than strictly necessary.
