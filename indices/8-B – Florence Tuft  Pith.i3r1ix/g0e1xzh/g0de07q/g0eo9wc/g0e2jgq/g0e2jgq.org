Great chapter (what do you call individual serial entries?), one thing that sounded a bit weird to me is that null venom only prevents external projection but for some reason Tuft couldn't use her joining vocations which I had assumed are internal projection. I remember a bit about it being hard to use joining in a body you're unfamiliar with, but Tuft was in the camp for a while, then again we haven't really gotten an explanation for what joining is yet so I'm sure there's an answer.
