Florence's body has been modified so that a pith cannot leave it. This makes any scenario where both piths share the same body seem impossible.

Both are dosed with Null Venom, which prevents external - but not internal - projection. Grace's vocation is unknown. It is probably crucial to their escape.

Given everything we've seen from Tunnel Vision, I'm guessing her vocation is an advanced form of body and expression reading that is a functional near-equivalent to telepathy.
