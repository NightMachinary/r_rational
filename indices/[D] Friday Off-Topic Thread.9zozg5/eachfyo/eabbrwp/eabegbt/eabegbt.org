Thanksgiving has come and gone. Did anyone do anything special?

We had Thanksgiving at my sister's house with my brother-in-law's family, about twelve people in all. It was pseudo-potluck, with everyone bringing a side and then mashed potatoes and turkey provided by the host. Before dinner we did games: Telestrations, Scattergories, Codenames, and Wits & Wagers. Overall a pretty good time, though my immediate family isn't always on that great of terms with each other (my parents divorced when I was 10, and their relationship is cordial at best).

It was my son's first proper Thanksgiving though, since last year he was one and a half, old enough to have a handful of words but not really old enough to express coherent thoughts. He had a lot of fun drawing turkeys and saying what he's thankful for. At one of the local parent groups someone was saying that family traditions are associated with positive outcomes, but I haven't been able to track down a source, and I'm curious whether they controlled for the obvious confounders like socioeconomic status (you'd hope so, but I don't place much faith in science without being able to read the paper and methodology myself).
