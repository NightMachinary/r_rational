If that's the one where a dragon almost instantly agrees to let itself get swallowed by the protagonist in the very first chapters, then I didn't like it either. The protag is too OP, the story too boring.

Maybe try /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_I%27m_a_Spider,_So_What%3F][Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?]]/ --- it is very similar in format, has both a manga and a book. I found it to be a much better story, even though eventually the spider becomes boringly OP too.
