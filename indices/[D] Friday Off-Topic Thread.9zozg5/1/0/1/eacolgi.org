Complaining about her (Spider) becoming OP doesn't seem take into account the fact that her future enemies are god like entities. She will stop having to use her brain to fight fodder, sure, but she will still have to use it when fighting enemies on her level.

Sure this kind of power scaling is not great, but criticizing it because it makes her fights against weak enemies boring is short sighted. As she becomes stronger her enemies become stronger, it's a story based on game elements, that's what's expected to happen.
