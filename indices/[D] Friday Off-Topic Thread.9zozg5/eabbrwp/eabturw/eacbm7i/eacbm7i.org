I'm on chapter 16 of the manga now and I'm liking it /much/ more than the slime one. Solo problem solving to discover and exploit the rules of a new and unfamiliar world, rather than being overwhelmingly OP for no clear reason and then getting thousands of powerful and consistently loyal followers, again for no clear reason.

I'm starting to see the possibility of the powers outstripping the problems though, such that being clever is no longer needed or is abstracted away as an inherent trait rather than something demonstrated in the thought process. We'll see.
