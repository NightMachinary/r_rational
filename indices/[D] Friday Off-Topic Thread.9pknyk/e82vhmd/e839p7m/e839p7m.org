Regarding designated survivor: We LOVED Season 1, but midway through Season 2 we started calling it "Terrible President Show" and hate-watching it.

The decline in quality was noticeable and major. It becomes so badly unrealistic in some things (IT, "that's now how the FBI works",etc) that even I, who normally puts a blind eye to stuff like this, got annoyed.

I'm hoping being bought by Netflix will make season 3 better.
