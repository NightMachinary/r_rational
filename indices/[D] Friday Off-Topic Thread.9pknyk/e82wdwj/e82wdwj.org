I really liked [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FJEtCvb2Kw][this video essay]] on "manufactured authenticity".

I've also been thinking a fair amount about a sequel series to [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][/Shadows of the Limelight/]], not in terms of actually making a plot or creating characters, but in terms of what I would want the work to be saying, which would then serve as the springboard for thinking about the kinds of characters and/or plot that would serve to say those things.

Media, especially modern, fully adaptive media, serves as not just entertainment, but as a way to fulfill social and emotional desires. That makes it more important that someone playing their role plays it both in and "out" of character. But because people know that, there are meta layers to the character/actor distinction, where the character has quality X, the actor maintains a persona with quality X, and then there are occasional glimpses at "the real actor" which are actually manufactured in order to seem real to people who deeply need to believe that they're not being fooled (because if they were being fooled, it would ruin it for them, and the assumption is that everyone is inauthentic).

And then this all ties in with why/how people become stalkers, super-fans, or obsessive about particular personalities, because the edifices of public personality that get constructed are so real that they're indistinguishable from actual reality, and actually, because they're /optimized/ for appearing real, they can appear /more/ real than things that are /actually/ real.
