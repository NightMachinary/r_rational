Fruit pickers tend to be tired in the evening but are in the same situation as you - looking for entertainment and company (when not too tired). Grabing a beer, playing a round of cards against humanity or watching a movie require a modest amount of social initiative but are usually simple.

My other go-to strategy when lonely during solo traveling has been making more calls than usual.
