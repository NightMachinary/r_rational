Yeah, Lindsay Ellis does the best video essays.

Otherwise, I don't know about movie celebrities, but I've often noticed the opposite effect with internet celebrities, where people say that they're just playing a character when making political points or doing a "angry game reviewer" kind of shtick; but when you look at the opinions they express in interviews and other semi-unprepared media, they maintain traits of their persona that make you think "oh, this is actually really the way she thinks".
