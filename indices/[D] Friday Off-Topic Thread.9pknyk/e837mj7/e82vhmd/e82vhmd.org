I binged "Dragon Prince" on netflix earlier this week due to the recommendation posted, and would like to pass on that recommendation. It's a well built story with interesting characters, that also happens to hit in the strike zone of topics I like to see covered by a fictional work. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but check it out on netflix if you have it.

On a related note, I notice that [[/r/rational]] is probably the best recommendation engine I have available to me. It's worked for movies, books, anime, and even webcomics. But notably, [[/r/rational]] hasn't been at all useful at recommending music. That's not really a surprise, as listening to music as a form of entertainment is far less "thinky" than anything else I do for fun. That being said, I was wondering if people here felt the opposite way-- that when [[/r/rational]] recommends music, that music is typically in line with your tastes.

Has anyone watched/is watching /Designated Survivor/ on netflix? I've been really enjoying the show (it makes me think of bald eagles and productive oilfields), but have had trouble believing the government would be as disunited as it is in the show after such an attack. Am I overestimating the US's capability to respond to crisis with a united front, or are the producers just making the governors (for example) more adverserial because it makes for better television?
