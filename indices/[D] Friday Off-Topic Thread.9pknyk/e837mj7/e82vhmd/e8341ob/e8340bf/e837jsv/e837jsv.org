Right now, at the very top of my ongoing list are:

- [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/][SMBC]]-- Gag a day; so consistently funny I've been reading it since middle school.\\
- [[http://www.prequeladventure.com/][Prequel]]-- Very loosely a Skyrim quest, featuring reader input and way too much effort on the part of the writer (he literally programs small games for some episodes.
- [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html][The Order of the Stick]]-- Self-aware DnD Fantasyish stick figure comic with a surprisingly deep plot.
- [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/][Strong Female Protagonist]] A flying brick superhero realizes that fighting crime isn't necessarily the most effective way to effect positive change.
- [[https://www.gocomics.com/endtown/2009/01/19][Endtown]]-- A gritty, biopunk, postapocalyptic sci-fi.
- [[https://www.poppy-opossum.com/comic/a-story/][Poppy]]-- I got nothing. It goes in ways you'd never expect. The fight scenes are extremely shonen, which is impressive for a webcomic featuring Funny Animals.
- [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch01/ch01_01.html][UNSOUNDED]]-- Fantasy epic with gorgeous art and fantastic worldbuilding that makes excellent use of the webpage medium.
- [[https://www.schlockmercenary.com/2000-06-12][Schlock Mercenary]]-- Long running sci-fi epic that makes a serious examination of both the technology and ethics of a far-advanced spacefaring society, and how to be a really effective mercenary. Also, it's hilarious.

Completed, I've really enjoyed:

- [[http://www.genocideman.com/][Genocide Man]]-- The art is meh, the story is a fantastically disturbing piece of sci-fi.
- [[https://www.nuklearpower.com/2001/03/02/episode-001-were-going-where/][8-bit theater]]-- Absolutely hilarous; every main character is a terrible person, and it features a brick joke that took the entire comic to pay off)
- [[https://www.baldwinpage.com/spacetrawler/2010/01/01/spacetrawler-4/][Spacetrawler]]-- Sci-fi. It's been forever since I read it, but I still vividly remember the hilarious facial expressions and not insignificant amount of feels.
- [[http://www.rice-boy.com/order/][Order of Tales]]/[[http://www.rice-boy.com/see/][Rice Boy]]--two different webcomics set in the same universe. Hard to describe, but feature excellent storytelling. [[http://www.rice-boy.com/vattu/][Vattu]], incomplete, is also in the same universe.

edit: so I binge-read Spacetrawlers in three hours after I tried to refresh myself on it. It is very, /very/ good sci-fi with likeable characters, comedy, drama, and tragedy in spades. I very highly recommend it. (Also it's technically ongoing because there's a continuation series, but it doesn't really hold up to the original.)
