Magic is done by a kind of programming language of reality. You are near a waterfall? You can invoke the specific coordinates of that falling water and enact the momentum on someone else. Or the hardness of a brick wall or the sharpness of a spear.

Its a high fantasy setting, and we follow a tiny young girl on her first adventure to make her father proud, only for it all to escalate to conspiracies and thaumaturgical weapons of mass destruction. Slow start and really rich (maybe too rich) visual style.
