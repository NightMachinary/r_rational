More on PREQUEL:

It's story borrowing some of the format from Homestuck (parts of narration and animation, reader interactivity, chapters punctuated by commands, mini-games every so often) to tell a completely different, and much more compelling story. Seriously, the format is hard to describe, go check it out and it'll be much clearer.

The story features a Khajit fleeing a life of shame, homelessness and possibly prostitution, and trying to have a fresh start on Cyrodill, a few weeks before the events of TES: Oblivion (hence the name). The protagonist is implied to maybe be the hero of Kvatch.

It's a really depressing story, especially at first. Katia has no enemy except herself, her alcoholism, lack of self-confidence, lack of a job or trade skills, etc. There are several moments in the story that go "Oh fuck, no no no no no don't do it OH FUCK SHE DID IT" that are incredibly depressing and probably make a lot of people quite the story. I think there's huge value in reading past those moments, and seeing how Katia picks herself up and tries to get back to building herself a life despite everything.

It's a really odd story that you don't see anywhere else. Katia isn't an adventuring superhero that infiltrates manors, kills monsters or decides the fate of countries. Her stakes are small, and so are her successes, and yet they feel incredibly rewarding. I still get goosebumps when I read the page where Katia throws that [THING] on the ground, pants, looks like she's about to cry, and sets it on fire with a scream of rage.
