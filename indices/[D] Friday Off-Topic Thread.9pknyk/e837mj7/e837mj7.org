I was reading about a vampire not having a reflection today and I thought of a cool way to munchkin this ability. Wear sunglasses with the top half of the lens facing your eyes covered in a mirror. Anytime you want to be able to see behind yourself, just look at the mirror-lens and you will be able to see behind you due to not having a reflection. You'll literally have eyes in the back of your head!

Just an interesting way to munchkin a vampire trait I wanted to share.
