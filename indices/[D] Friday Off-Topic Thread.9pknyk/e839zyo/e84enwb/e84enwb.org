get an audiobook or download some podcasts...

also always have a towel with you... no clue why... but some famous writer read it in a travel guide...

if you want a travel buddy, maybe look on meetup.com or couchsurfing.com for people and write them if they want to go to tourist traps

some people do that with dating sides/tinder but no clue if that works... all depends on how many people in that region use such websites

maybe go geocaching... should also be people and groups out there.... (maybe Pokemon go)
