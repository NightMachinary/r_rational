I'm goin' on another work trip next week! I'm going to be driving through an "outback" type area for a few days with my colleagues, doin' our work, and then I'll be staying in a tiny but touristy town for another 3 days. I'm looking forward to it so much; I've never been there before (it costs $~300 to fly to Indonesia, and about $500 to fly to this part of Australia). And I'll take a bunch of photos.

(NB: the place I'm going is not really "the outback" because it's far up north so it's got tropical weather, but it's got [[https://s1.at.atcdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/AT_2018JUN05_OnlineStory_OutbackBreaksWilpena3.jpg][long desolate expanses of red sand]], so...)

Anyone have advice for travelling solo? I'm going to be by myself for 3 days. I get really lonely so I have booked a bed in a 4 bedroom dorm at a youth hostel, but the hostel manager informed me that their guests tend to mostly be fruitpickers, so my plan of "finding a travel buddy" may have been too much.

Fortunately I've already made plans for two of the three days (Day 1: drive an hour and go on a scenic river cruise; Day 2: go to a wildlife rehabilitation centre in the afternoon), and am planning on just going into town and finding all the tourist traps on google and dealing with those.
