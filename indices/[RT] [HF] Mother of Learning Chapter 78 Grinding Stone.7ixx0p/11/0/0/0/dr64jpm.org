  For magic related stuff, they're a bigger boon than they are for Zorian.
#+end_quote

Doubtful. Mind magic doesn't use much mana, and explosives use none, so each copy of Zorian is almost as effective as the original in combat. Besides the extra non-combat utility.

  He would no longer need to divide his attention between attack and defense,
#+end_quote

Actually, he would have more copies of himself to defend...much more efficient to just put up a layered aegis around himself.

#+begin_quote
  he could spend longer shaping spells without the cost of leaving himself open,
#+end_quote

Possible benefit, yes (simulacra /are/ helpful), but it hasn't seemed to be much of an issue before now.

#+begin_quote
  Even if Zach has 4 simulacra in a fight, each has the mana of a normal mage, and all of Zach's skills.
#+end_quote

But is that so much better than a single Zach with multiple times the mana of a normal mage? In high-level combat, endurance is a big deal. Consider Zorian's training with Taiven and Alanic, both of whom tended to beat him by outlasting him. Consider QI, who just keeps throwing high-level spells and never seems to tire.

#+begin_quote
  For learning stuff, yes they're inferior to Zorian's, but then that's to be expected.
#+end_quote

May I refer you to the story title for how important that is?

For Zorian, simulacra are a game-changer; for Zach, they seem to me like more of an incremental improvement.
