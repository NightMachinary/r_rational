Only when he can't avoid it. The grey hunter, with its magic resistance making it functionally immune to mind magic, was a terrible match-up for him. Contrast with his duel against the flower, where he kept it largely pinned down by battering its mind. Or how he routinely puppets invaders and makes them stab their comrades. Mind magic is his go-to combat strategy whenever it works.

Yeah, Zach can definitely use and benefit from simulacra, but I still think his benefits are more modest in relation to his existing skills.
