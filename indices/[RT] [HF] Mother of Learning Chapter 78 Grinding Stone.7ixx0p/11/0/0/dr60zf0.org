For magic related stuff, they're a bigger boon than they are for Zorian. He would no longer need to divide his attention between attack and defense, he could spend longer shaping spells without the cost of leaving himself open, he can be in multiple places at once even if he would only be at partial capacity, etc. Even if Zach has 4 simulacra in a fight, each has the mana of a normal mage, and all of Zach's skills.

For learning stuff, yes they're inferior to Zorian's, but then that's to be expected.
