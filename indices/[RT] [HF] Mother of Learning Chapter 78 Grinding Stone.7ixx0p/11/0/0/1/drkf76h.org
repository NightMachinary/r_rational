Forgot to mention, I think Zach should go for simulacrum quality rather than quantity. Basically, he can upload himself into a giant battle robot.

Ooh, hang on.

How many golems does Zorian routinely make these days?

What if most of them, instead of being mere automatons, had copies of Zach's mind?

If Zorian can maintain six golacra, Zach can handle over 30. Team Zach wouldn't have mind magic, but might be able to use Zorian's soul intercommunication techniques for coordination. Arm them with standard loadout of bombs and potions and rifles, plus each one is capable of casting spells in a pinch (would drain his reserves if they all did, though).

Zach alone might have limited use for simulacra, but combining their talents...
