So what exactly did they do in this update, and consequently in those six months?

- Got someone to translate airship's schematics (as well as start learning the language used)- most likely able to steal the ship next update.
- Incrementally improve their pocket dimension skills, allowing for containers with additional effects
- Zorian learned the psychic Mind Blank, making him again as sneaky (if not sneakier) than a normal mage.
- Secured cooperation with Silverlake, giving her means of keeping info between restarts.
- Various smaller improvements, mentioned after the last break (kinda notable are imminent Zach's simulacra- massive boost to combat, if not much else).
