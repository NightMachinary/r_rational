You're forgetting that Zorian can maintain six golacra, not three, and two of them were working on golacrum body refinements.

It would be awesome IMO if they devised a golem body that simulacra could freely possess and leave, with standard animation in their absence. So, you send in an army of 50 golems, with 6 simulacra amongst them as commanders, and whenever a simulacrum gets severely damaged, he jumps to another golem body and keeps going.
