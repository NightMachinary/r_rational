I am something like 95% confident Z&Z can kick her butt in combat if need be, and 85% confident Zorian is paranoid enough not to fall for various subterfuge methods of attack (e.g. poison in food-he probably uses his own snacks). There really is no effective way for her to force them to do anything with a stick. Furthermore, she just admitted that Zorian can instakill her with any heavy mind attack because of the dead man switch. She can't really do anything.
