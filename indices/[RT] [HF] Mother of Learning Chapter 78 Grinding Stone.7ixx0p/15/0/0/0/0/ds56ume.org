It would be interesting if every loop took something in the nano- or microsecond range in the real world (and indeed, we have no evidence each loop takes any time, or at least any subjectively experienceable time, in the real world---the gate seems to only be limited in how many loops it can run by the mystical power available from the planar alignment, not the passage of real-world time). Then if Zorian and Zack make it out via the keys, Red Robe would literally still be in the room with the gate when they do.
