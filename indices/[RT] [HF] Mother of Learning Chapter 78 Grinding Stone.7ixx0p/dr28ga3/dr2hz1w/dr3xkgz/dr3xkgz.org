He erroneously thought he knew that somebody managed to find out enough about the loop to enter a whole bunch of spiders into it. Given that assumption, it's not unreasonable to think that that person is 1) well connected 2) a good mage 3) knows about the loop menchanics. At that point it's simply too dangerous to sit in the loop, where you can be mindraped/soulkilled/erased when that person exits the loop first. Not an unreasonable reaction on his part IMO.
