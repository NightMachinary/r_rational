Their problem is a categorical difference between the two continents that they need to get to. The first they were able to island hop, doing basically what you asked for here. Now they need to get across an ocean that can't be sailed across in a month.

Also I believe that at this point they are using Bakura gates to get to Koth so there isn't any optimizing that further?
