How far could a simulacrum-golem travel on foot in a month? And how much attention would it attract from the wildlife? If they could establish a teleport chain from a Xlotic Bakora gate into the interior, that would presumably only take a day or two at most to traverse (and a simulacrum could do that and then gate them in).

Regular simulacra need to sleep, but it's not clear whether that applies to golacra.
