Boats are slow and don't like to travel to Blantyrre. The entire continent is wild and dangerous, as is the journey itself, and there are no friendly ports unless you have an existing contract with some of the lizardmen states. It would take quite a while for Z&Z to convince a ship owner to take them there. Then a more time to organize an expedition and actually travel there. Even if they can reach Blantyrre before the restart runs out, it would leave them with very little time to find a local Bakora gate or do anything actually productive.

They don't think they can fit all of that in a single restart.
