Yes, they intend to use Bakora Gates as a way to reach their destination in future restart, but by dedicating a restart to the attempt and reaching the closest gate in one fell swoop.

Also, keep in mind that the reason Zorian is so fixated on the airship is because he needs it to reach Blantyrre, which cannot be reached through teleportation jumping, not because it would be impossible to reach the Xlotic interior without it. Using the airship to reach Ziggurat of the Sun just a side benefit.
