Just read the chapter and was reading through the comments. But saw this and had to reply, while silverlake is defiently the person go deconstruct a divine artifact to see how it works, she probably doesn't start fights with people who can cause her to many issues. With the safety net of the restart I can see silverlake robbing rivals and friends for research materials or notes and such just to get am edge. This makes her research capabilities skyrocket compared to digging around blindly for a few years.
