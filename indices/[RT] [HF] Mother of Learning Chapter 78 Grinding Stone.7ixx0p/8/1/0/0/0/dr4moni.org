There's damn near always a crisis. To the point where I'm genuinely uncertain as to what you're talking about specifically. Net Neutrality? The President? The overall resurgence of populism and anti-globalism? All of the above and more?

Before those issues you could've used the excuse of the election. Before that I don't know because I generally try to avoid US politics, but there's /always/ a lot of passion and /always/ a pet issue that seems like the end of the world at the moment.

There's subreddits for this sort of thing for a reason. They pretty much all suck, which just furthers my point.

It's like Christian Rock. [[https://i.redd.it/5iqvu91yz0ly.jpg][You're not making Christianity better, you're just making Rock And Roll worse.]]
