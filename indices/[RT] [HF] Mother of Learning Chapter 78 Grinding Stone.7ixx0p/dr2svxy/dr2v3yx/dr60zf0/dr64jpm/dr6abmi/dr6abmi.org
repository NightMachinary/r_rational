  Doubtful. Mind magic doesn't use much mana, and explosives use none, so each copy of Zorian is almost as effective as the original in combat. Besides the extra non-combat utility.

No, Zorian does not get much utility from simulacra in combat, because he doesn't have enough mana to have even 2 of them casting combat spells at once. His mind magic gets a huge boost, yes, as it uses barely any mana. But for combat, he's using a lot of mana, and he can't afford to split it on multiple tasks. In the two fights I can think of, against the Grey Hunter and in the assault on the Ibasan base, he chastised the simulacra both times for using his mana. In the Grey Hunter fight, it didn't participate at all after the Ambush failed, and in the assault it was only in combat to help Taiven.

Zach has enough mana that he could have multiple simulacra in combat without severely hampering himself, although he obviously couldn't be as wasteful as he normally is.

  Actually, he would have more copies of himself to defend...much more efficient to just put up a layered aegis around himself.

I was thinking that they would stand next to each other, because they would need to communicate and they can't use telepathy like Zorian. One to attack, the other to focus on defending against opposing fire.

Not gonna say it's the greatest strategy, but I don't think it's terrible.

  But is that so much better than a single Zach with multiple times the mana of a normal mage? In high-level combat, endurance is a big deal. Consider Zorian's training with Taiven and Alanic, both of whom tended to beat him by outlasting him. Consider QI, who just keeps throwing high-level spells and never seems to tire.

He's rarely in combat against opponents he has to outlast. QI, yes, but he's the exception. In mass battles, two mages with Zach's skill but half his mana each are more useful than one with twice the mana because the two can be in two places at once, and Zach's skill is more useful than throwing more Mana at an opponent. Even against QI, twice as many Zach-level combat spells would mean QI is spending Mana more quickly and likely less efficiently to defend, while his offensive spells won't be any more effective. Zach loses Mana quicker, but QI spends a greater proportion defending himself rather than attacking.

Usually, he's much more limited by his ability to cast spells quickly, so that he can overcome enemy shields, than he is by waiting for his opponents to run out of mana. The endurance contest doesn't totally apply when you're as good as Zach is.
