  But is that so much better than a single Zach with multiple times the mana of a normal mage? In high-level combat, endurance is a big deal. Consider Zorian's training with Taiven and Alanic, both of whom tended to beat him by outlasting him. Consider QI, who just keeps throwing high-level spells and never seems to tire.

I disagree. In combat, the idea of tempo is incredibly important. That a single person can only accomplish so much in one beat can be baldly abused by four opponents working simultaneously, possibly ending a fight that much quicker.

For some fights, I agree that endurance would be more important, but other fights might benefit from opening moves that consists of four types of spells rather than one, possibly allowing the fight to end much more quickly, thus mitigating the increased endurance cost.

Also, another factor to keep in mind is that simulacra are disposable, allowing them to be much more aggressive and take more risks. If delivering a decisive blow would normally kill Zach, a simulacrum could sacrifice itself and end the fight much more quickly.
