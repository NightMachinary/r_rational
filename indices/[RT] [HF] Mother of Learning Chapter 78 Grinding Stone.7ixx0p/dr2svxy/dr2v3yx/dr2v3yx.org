You know, I don't think that simulacra will be such a massive boost for Zach. They will help, of course, and he can maintain more of them than Zorian can. But they don't really help with his big advantage, namely large mana reserves. I suppose they would allow him to trade endurance for a massive opening salvo, but without mind magic they aren't the force multiplier that they are for Zorian, nor do they have the same capacity for research (since they have to transfer results the old-fashioned way).
