- Artifact research-potentially arbitrarily great returns, up to and including making their own, or just using the ones they already have for any of the million problems they have. Plus, easier to discover key features maybe.
- Leveling soul sight skill-potentially super important in fighting QI, red robe, figuring out how to get out of the loop, figuring out the key functions, etc
- Simulacrum 1:likely further magic gun research in preparation for QI takedown
- Simulacrum 2:likely further simulacrum golem research in preparation for lichification post loop. See Soul Sight
- Simulacrum 3:likely further senses/mind editing research, potentially super great
- Simulacrum 4(?):research into cranium rats/hydra, in preparation for turning all simulacrums into one awesome SWARMMIND
- Experts et al: Spell and golem refinement, new crypt breaking spells, finding the key location in Blantyre, etc, etc, etc
- Invasion: Probably incrimental memorisation of QI defense/offense arsenal by sending Alanic and others after him. Z&Z don't have to be personally present to test things.
- Gate research by experts-always nice.

Really, I think they are moving along nicely. They have three major meta problems: * Find the keys * Escape the loop * Defeat invasion afterwards First involves finding the keys (task best left to experts), getting to the keys (airship-a slow process), and then getting the keys (hard to estimate what skills will be needed, but presumably combat+defence, which they already have in abundance, plus fortifying holes in their defence-mostly soul sight for soul defence at this point). Furthermore, they need a way to break into the royal treasury, and a way to safely kill QI.

Second involves god knows what, but some things seem likely to help. Soul-related skills are likely to be useful, since time loop deals with soul transfer. Same with mind magic skills. Dimensional skills are likely to be useful, since time loop is dimensional in nature.

Third involves mundane logistical optimisation (Alanic) and defeating QI. My personal best bet is a really long-ranged magic railgun with a dimensionaly-folded bullet with one of those soul-tearing spell formulas Kael did once.

Finally, artifacts are wildcards, so they are useful any time you don't know what the problem might be, and studying them is useful.
