1 month late but yeah the Aranea were lol. Red Robe thought there were a bunch of time travelers because of the Aranea. He's suddenly faced with a mysterious group of enemies who he suspected came into the loop the same way he did and so could have had knowledge such as how to escape the loop. He had to leave as soon as possible so he would be the first one out and not get trapped in the simulation and erased. He figured he would leave first to avoid the risk of losing everything instead of staying and gaining the experience of a few more years of loops only for someone else to leave the loop first.
