Yeah red robe leaving the loop early really feels like a dumbass move to me. Like, even if Zorian and Zach have "disrupted all his plans" he should be able to figure out they won't be leaving the loop any time soon, and spending additional /years/ becoming an even better mage before leaving is not a replicable opportunity.

Something's fishy there somewhere.
