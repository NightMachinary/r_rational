To add on to what others are saying, Red Robe knew he was against mind-magic user(s) since his encounter with Zorian in the Aranean den. He even took a mental blow from Zorian. Mind magic fuckery can basically turn you into a vegetable or change you forever so it's reasonable to want to gtfo as soon as possible to avoid that. Plus he thought they wouldn't be able to leave after he did.
