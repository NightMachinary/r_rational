Red Robe doesn't have the benefit of seeing everything from our point of view. Think about it from his perspective. As far as he knows, he's up against a veritable army of time loopers, who can easily add more and more people to the loop as time goes on. This means there is at least one person out there with knowledge of some of the functions /of/ the time loop. It wouldn't be a stretch, as Red Robe, to assume that this unknown person is capable of finding out how to leave the loop himself, stranding Red Robe in a dimension headed for destruction with no way out. He simply left first so they wouldn't have the chance.

Even if this weren't the case, this mysterious group could likely track him down eventually by figuring out his identity were he to just vanish at the beginning of the restart (they would have to deduce who was "missing" first of course)... I'm sure there are divination magic users who are capable of tracking down even accomplished archmages, and Red Robe may not be the most powerful individual.

Red Robe was losing ground before he left the loop. He may have actually fixed most of his problems by ejecting the Aranea, but he had no way of knowing that the same thing wouldn't happen again, with more intelligent and troublesome adversaries. Leaving the loop was the best method given the information he was working with.
