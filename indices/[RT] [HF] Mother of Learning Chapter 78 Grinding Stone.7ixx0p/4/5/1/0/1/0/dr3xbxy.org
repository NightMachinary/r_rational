To become a lich I thought you had to invest a /lot/ of time and energy into your chosen phylactery since you were young, though? So you would basically only be able to become one once you were already old and decrepit. It's not something you can just do once you feel like it. Unless I'm thinking of a totally different story here and this isn't how it works in Mother of Learning at all, which is something I just realized I might be doing.
