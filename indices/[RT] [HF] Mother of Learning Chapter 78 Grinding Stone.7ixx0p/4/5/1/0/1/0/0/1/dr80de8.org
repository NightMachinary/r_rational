IIUC, one half of the process is the ability to create a magical brain, attached to your soul, but animating a separate body, ie a simulacrum; the other half is the ability to transfer your soul's primary anchoring out of your original body and into your prepared phylactery, thus leaving the artificial mind and body as the only one.

You can add extra features, mostly around what happens when the artificial body is destroyed and the soul has to jump back to the phylactery, but that's the gist of it.
