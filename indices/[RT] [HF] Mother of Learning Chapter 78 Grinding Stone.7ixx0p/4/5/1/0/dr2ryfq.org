They only went up against each other at all because red robe was fucking around with the invasion and stuff. All you have to do if you're red robe is run off somewhere remote and train until you're running low on restarts. There's no reason to worry about that shit if you just vanish, and that makes "they can't follow me" a terrible reason to waste /years/ of age-less training time.
