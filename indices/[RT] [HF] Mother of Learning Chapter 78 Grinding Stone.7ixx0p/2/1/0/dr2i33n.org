the last number I remember was ~46, but that was a little while ago. I think they're somewhere in the high twenties or low 30s right now. It's going to be a bit close considering they have to not only steal all of them, but also take them to the box, figure out how to use them AND figure out whether they can both leave at the same time (and if not, who should leave first).
