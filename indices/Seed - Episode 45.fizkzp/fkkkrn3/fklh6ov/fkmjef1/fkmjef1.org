I will take a slow, steady update schedule over irregular, faster updates any day.

This updates just about every week, which is great. I'd rather that than something like, say, Homestuck, which averaged more content per day than pretty much anything else on the Internet, but went through several extended hiatuses (hiatii?) where the fandom was never really certain that it'd ever be finished (even though it eventually, finally, was). I never get that feeling with Seed, having an update every week, and three queued up and waiting.
