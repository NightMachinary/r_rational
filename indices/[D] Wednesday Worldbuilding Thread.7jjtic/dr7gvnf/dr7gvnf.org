This is a question that probably goes into this thread. It is regarding the ethics of a hypothetical universe. Please tell me if this should not go into this thread. Let's say a universe has a form of vampires. These vampires must kill one person a month to survive. Does that mean that it is always ethical to kill them? If they do not kill people but instead keep a number of people in a permanent trance like state where they need to be looked after how does this change things. If you have a boy snatcher how kills one person every 80 years how does that change things. If someone kills slowly enough does it affect things. After all if you can gain 120 years of life from killing someone who has 60 years left to live then this is a net positive even assuming you are a neutral person who kills a neutral positive. If you are in a fantasy world with races that have to kill to survive, what ethical standing do you give them. What if they eat only criminals. What about the second scenario where it merely puts someone in a perpetual trance. Is that any better, should people be allowed to volunteer. What about a race that has to kill someone to breed, for instance one which must lay eggs in a living sentient host. What morality applies to races who are not necessary evil but must be monsters.
