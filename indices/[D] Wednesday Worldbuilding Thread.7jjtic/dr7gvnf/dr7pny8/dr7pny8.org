My partner once joked that cats, as obligate carnivores, are "moral abominations" because their very existence requires the death of other animals on a regular basis. He states that from a moral point of view it's better for housecats to go extinct (through either universal sterilisation so they're all dead within 20 years, or if you want to be quick about it, mandatory humane euthenasia).

I'd view races in this fantasy world who had to live in the way vampires do similarly, in that it's unethical for them to live. Something like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_Human_Extinction_Movement][voluntary human extinction movement]] for vampires or body snatchers might be a good idea, otherwise keeping the human population huge and the vampire population small and the vampires eating humans who are either condemned to capital punishment (itself unethical IMO), or eating terminally ill humans / suicidal humans / humans who are over some very advanced age would be the most ethical ways to handle it.

Realistically though a vampire eating one human a month is basically the same as a human with the standard American diet in terms of "lesser" animals they're killing (depending on the intelligence/status/etc of humans vs vampires), but unlike humans vampires don't seem to have the option to go vegetarian (they can't even have "just a sip" of a human and keep her alive otherwise?).

Another ethical concern is the potential loss of "vampire culture" - if I was the czar of this world I'd require vampires, if they would eventually die of old age, to go for voluntary extinction and feed them the candidates I outlined before. I would also require them to "adopt" human babies and raise them in vampire culture and we'd end up with a "caste" of vamp-humans who would continue vampire books, poetry, and whatever other cultural stuff they have going for them. But that's because I value having a variety of cultures. If vampires don't die of old age then I'd have them killed in 50 years but require them to raise children in the same way before that. But both of these would require buy-in from the vampires so who knows =/

In the end, "is it always ethical to kill them" is a very hard question to answer because it entirely depends on the ethical system. I know in Catholic beliefs it is not moral to kill one of your vampires as you need the law of double effect / people are an end in themselves rather than a means to an end - so you can't kill a vampire who is attacking another person because your intention is to kill the vampire. Or to put it another way, in the trolley problem you can switch the tracks but you can't push the fat man. In utilitarianism it's ethical to kill vampires. Kantian probably not - because what's stopping a Centaur killing you for all that horse meat you eat? Virtue ethics probably not - a virtuous person doesn't kill. Etc...
