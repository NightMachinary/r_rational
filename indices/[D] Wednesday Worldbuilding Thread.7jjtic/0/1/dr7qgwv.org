Month-to-month vampires seem comparable to people wearing enemy uniforms during a war. Killing them isn't always ethical. There are narrow exceptions where they're not a threat. But you'd start from a presumption that those exceptions don't apply, and the vampire is an active threat.

Past that, the vampires aren't an immediate threat to me. There are real-world humans who pollute in ways that slowly increase the chances of statistical death. We (hopefully) treat them like criminals and handle them through the justice system.

It might be worth splitting out morals ("how much do we like various outcomes?") and ethics ("what rules does society create to get good outcomes?"). Philosophers can make moral arguments about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem#Transplant][killing people to save lives]]. But, in practice, there are [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/uv/ends_dont_justify_means_among_humans/][good reasons]] to not trust individual people to make those decisions.
