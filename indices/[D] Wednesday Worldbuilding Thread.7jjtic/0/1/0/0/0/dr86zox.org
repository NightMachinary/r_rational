You've made some good points regarding the morality of werewolves. Thank you. It's actually really interesting to consider how these sort of magical creatures with racial abilities and requirements would affect law and morality. For example it seems reasonable to have a law against mind control and to not hold actions committed under such effects against a person but against the mind controller. But what about a succubus with a permanent lust aura akin Glory girl from Worm. Should she be locked up because she literally cannot turn it off. Should any time she has sex be considered rape. And how strong is it? Because if it's weak enough then a person probably should still be charged. After all, otherwise you could always walk from raping a succubus. And if succubus's need sex then should a underage one be permitted to have sex? So they should probably be considered exceptions to underage sex laws. And if the Government decides to create a welfare program to feed the starving then what should be done regarding such creatures. Some would be difficult to feed such as a abandoned emotivore. Should the government even try. Should I be allowed to discriminate on the basis of such racial ability? Can I hire succubus to be sex workers preferentially? If a race is stronger should they be allowed in professional sports? What if it's not magical but the race merely puts on muscle much faster than any human could? If a race is inherently more violent or smarter? Can I consider that? What if a race is always born psychopaths? And if a creature can turn a human and the human consents, should they be allowed? I can totally see someone agreeing to be turned because those races tend to get cool seeming powers then realizing that it's not enough to make up for the downsides. And it's not something that you can undo. I could easily see a person agreeing to become a werewolf or something because their lover is one and then breaking up. Wanting to be a vampire to be with their lover is literally the entire plot of twilight. All of these things would need to be considered before our kind could integrate in soci... I mean before you could write a story involving these creatures being a part of society
