  And it's not like there is room for ambiguity. They must directly kill one person per month, no loopholes or exceptions

A country might justify a vampire soldier. Texas executes about a person a month. And California has around 5000 people sentenced to life without parole. Alternately, Canada could have a custom where vampires feed on the terminally ill.

If I found myself in the Buffy-verse, I wouldn't assume that any of these exceptions applied to any given vampire. But, they could create a moral grey area if I knew that a specific vampire was making an effort.

  On a related note what do you think about werewolves. They go insane every month and try to kill people. Should they be held accountable for deaths in their transformed state.

In a world with Werewolves, accidental deaths are negligent homicides. You'd charge the Werewolf with involuntary manslaughter. This is similar to the charge we'd use if a railway conductor decided not to maintain the brakes on their train.

The common-law elements are:

1. Person was killed as a result of defendant's actions.
2. The defendant's actions were inherently dangerous, or done with disregard for others' safety.
3. Defendant knew, or should have known about the danger.

Interestingly, Remus Lupin wouldn't be guilty for the assault against Snape. Remus took reasonable precautions. We'd probably press charges against Sirius Black, who maliciously circumvented those precautions.

And I'm not sure you'd need much in the way of legal restrictions beyond this. People are allowed to own tigers and cannons. We just say that you're responsible for any damages that result. Being a werewolf seems similar.
