Solution to #5: encase the key in a large enough block of ice that you have to wait 3 days (or whatever) for it to melt. (okay, smart wolf could probably scratch it to bits....)

Actually can someone post the "you're a werewolf. You can predict your transformations, but when you transform you only want to cause mayhem and you are smart enough to operate key pads, try and destroy cages, etc. How do you... not do that" on the munchkinry thread? I'd love to see people take it on.

FWIW I don't think cages are THAT expensive if it's a priority for you, and given the consequences it should be. Many people own cars, and I don't think a cage would cost much more than a decent second hand car (order of $5,000).

Forget a key lock: a timed electronic lock like a bank safe that will only open after 72 hours would probably solve the problem....
