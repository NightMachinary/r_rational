I can see a number of reasons. 1) Cages are expensive, especially silver ones and werewolves don't tend to be well off 2) Werewolves are often considered very strong, so it is possible they could either break or throw the cage. This would mean the cage would need to be reinforced, raising the cost 3) A silver cage would leave them with scarring, likely permanent. This is assuming they don't shy away from the silver which is likely. 4) If the key is not available then this requires that the werewolf confide in someone who's willing to bring them the key. 5) If the key is in the cage on the basis that the wolf can't use it, then the question becomes how smart is the wolf. They are normally considered violent, but that is not the same as stupid. It is reasonable that they might be able to recognise the key and make and attempt at using it. In fact if they are smart enough they might be able to repeatedly attack points on a iron cage to weaken it or override their hatred of silver to break such a cage. 6)This is not necessary true but I always thought it might be interesting to claim werewolves are the archetype of the predator and need to roam and hunt. In this case the werewolf would steadily grow sick.
