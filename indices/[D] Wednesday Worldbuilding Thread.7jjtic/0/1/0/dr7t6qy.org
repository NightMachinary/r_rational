In defence of the philosophers, in this situation, the vampires very existence means that they have killed and that they will kill. A murderer can repent but a vampire cannot. And it's not like there is room for ambiguity. They must directly kill one person per month, no loopholes or exceptions. And even if the justice system did get involved in this case, the only possible verdict is guilty as it is a fact that they are a vampire and that vampires must feed. Their species is ironclad evidence of their guilt. The only possible sentence is death as there is no way to leave them alive for imprisonment that does not lead to a death every month. They can feel guilty, and you have to admit in a lot of cases this is not very fair such as forcibly turned individuals but I cannot see any other options. On a related note what do you think about werewolves. They go insane every month and try to kill people. Should they be held accountable for deaths in their transformed state. One example is Remus Lupin from Harry Potter. They receive a lot of sympathy due to losing their job as defence against the dark arts due to being a werewolf, but look at it from another angle. Let's say your child goes to a school with a teacher with a dangerous disease. They suffer psychotic fits every month, as predictable as the moon in the sky literally, and have done for most of their life. It's not like they are blindsided. They could find a list of every single full moon for the rest of their life the month they are infected. They are no danger as long as they take the medicine and get away from people. Then one month they forget, almost kill a child. No matter the circumstances you would justifiably demand they be fired. Wizarding Britain's rules aren't sensible but letting them live free is madness. While they don't have to be killed if a werewolf forgets the protocol even once I can see good reason to assign a handler and if it happens more they probably should be locked up. Arguing for equality is all very well and good in our world but these people objectively need special rules.
