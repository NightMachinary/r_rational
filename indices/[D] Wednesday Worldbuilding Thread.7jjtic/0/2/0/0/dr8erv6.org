  I wish to clarify a point you appear to have misunderstood about the question. They must feed on humans.

No problem with that - from a Doylist viewpoint, i.e. from outside the narrative, this is a constraint that the monsters /must/ follow, and a known constraint.

But from a Watsonian point of view it's a little different. Sure, the vampires /do/ kill a human every month, and maybe the very learned wizard over there tells me that they have to or they will die - but I, as an ordinary person without significant education in the minutae of magic, I can't be certain of that, and I must consider my own uncertainty when contemplating ethical conundrums. After all, the wizard /also/ told me that the Sun is millions of times bigger than the Moon, which is clearly ludicrous, because then how can the Sun hide behind the Moon in an eclipse?

...I am kind of assuming that in-story characters do not, generally, have the benefit of a modern understanding of astronomy at the end there.
