I wish to clarify a point you appear to have misunderstood about the question. They must feed on humans. If you wish a scientific explanation you could claim it is due to them needing very fresh human blood. However it is more likely that there is a magical explanation. It is not particularly difficult to imagine a self consistent magical system that placed value on human blood. The fact of their existence is evidence of them feeding on human lives. I'm basically asking for a story I was thinking of writing where creatures that were once human such as this exist and the protagonist is a rationalist who uses their self reflection to not only defeat the monsters but to debate moral quandaries such as the ones presented above. It might be a while till I write though as I have no writing experience and I wish to consider the types of monsters carefully. So don't wait for it. I have a lot of ideas of horrific circumstances I can put the hero in such as forcing them to kill a little girl begging for mercy and exposing them to lots of mental influence when the reason they became a rationalist is because they wished to have their mind in their control
