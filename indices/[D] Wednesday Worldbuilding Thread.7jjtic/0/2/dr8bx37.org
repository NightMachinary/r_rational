  These vampires must kill one person a month to survive. Does that mean that it is always ethical to kill them?

Hmmm.

Well, it is very clearly /not/ ethical to allow them to just feed indiscriminately. And if they do feed, then I'd recommend that the ethical course of action would be for them to face the full legal penalties for murder. (If they take on a job as executioner and feed only on sentenced-to-death prisoners, then there might not be any legal penalty - though this leads to ugly questions about how ethical it is to ensure at least one person gets sentenced to death every month).

At the same time, though, I don't think it is necessarily ethical to go hunting them down and killing them, absent legal authority - on the grounds that, without proof of murders, you can't be sure that they aren't (say) subsisting by purchasing and killing cows (or monkeys, if they need primates specifically); and if you /do/ have proof, then this proof should be taken to the relevant legal authorities.

It doesn't really matter how long it is between murders, or whether or not the vampire can get more years of life than he takes; if he gains a hundred years by murdering someone who had one year left, he's still a murderer.
