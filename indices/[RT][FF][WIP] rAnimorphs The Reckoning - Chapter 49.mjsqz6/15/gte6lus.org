Having read the beta version the final version is a definite improvement. Nice to see V3's reaction to the hypercomputer fleshed out - I noticed in the beta he seemed pretty lax about it but couldn't put it into words/thought there was a reason for it. I'm glad someone else caught that. While I still have no idea where we're going, a good chunk more elaboration definitely helped the readability of the chapter.
