It's been discussed in the story a few times that the Players have taken pains to stop recursive self-improvement. For example, they did so by sabotaging the Andallites' culture. While reading this chapter, I had the fun complementary thought that perhaps both Crayak and Ellimist like to elevate their pieces to as high a level as they possibly can without quite triggering a singularity. Counterintuitive dynamics in optimization like that are always fun to come across.

I also like the related conceit that a path to godhood could be just a few moments away for many appropriately nudged sentients of ordinary intelligence, with the reason it doesn't happen being endless near-perfect plays and counterplays on the level of tiny molecular disturbances. That forced equilibrium would feel /fairer/ than reality's accidental one. For example, it feels unfair that it's so hard to do math when so much of math is just tautology. Knowing that a conspiracy of evil daemons prevents us from bootstrapping logical insights together like naively should be possible would actually be reassuring, in a way.
