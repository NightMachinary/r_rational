  Both the player and the adversary had watched as the Visser's investigations proceeded, his cautious forays into the structure of the hypercomputer stymied by its failsafes and firewalls (and his own desire to avoid notice). He was a bug in the code---a mite, a bacterium, a lowly prion drifting in the infinite hallways of the arbiter, unable to comprehend the majesty of what he could barely even perceive. They had left him alone, by mutual agreement---content to wait and see as the main game proceeded.

  But now---

  It was such a small thing. A slight weakening in the protections of an ancient, irrelevant archive, a tumbler set to turn at the lightest, slightest touch, opening the path to a single unencrypted file containing a mere four billion bits of information. The adversary was busy, juggling the ten trillion coincidences required for it to take advantage of the player's apparent blunder. The theft would not be noticed. It would not be recorded. The adversary might never even know it had occurred---not until the effects showed themselves within the game proper, and perhaps not even then. It was information the Visser was already bound to discover, after all, once the Z-space bridge had fulfilled its intended purpose.

Theory: The Chee cracked the hypercomputer's logs and went searching for anything it had recorded about the Howlers. They found that file, and while it hadn't been recorded, they used data forensics to prove that it had been opened in the last year. The Ellimist claimed victory on the grounds that Crayak broke Their mutual agreement to ignore V3's meddling with the hypercomputer, and the Arbiter agreed. The Ellimist no longer needed to hide Itself, so It stopped; and Its next act was to erase the Chee and the Visser before they became a threat.
