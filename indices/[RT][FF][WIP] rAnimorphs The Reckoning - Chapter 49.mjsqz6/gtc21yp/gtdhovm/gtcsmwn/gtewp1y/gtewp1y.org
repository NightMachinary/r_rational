My thoughts:

It seemed to me that one of the Players had been unexpectedly deascended... (anger => confusion => horror => expecting to have special powers => instantly going to the console to do damage control), except that doesn't /quite/ fit, because why would they be deascended rather than killed, so maybe that was the avatar being cut off from the E/C controls and being on a mission on his own.

The blue avatar seems to have deliberately finished his quest and straightened himself before being torn apart, which means he did something he anticipated to be killed for, and yet knew in advance he wouldn't be killed for /before/ he was done, since he expected to be killed shortly after finishing his task.

One possible explanation: Player 1 (Crayak(?)) sacrificed himself to stop the Chee.

Problem: Once one of the players wins, they instantly remake the universe in their image. So that was probably just the death of the avatar (or a deascended instance of one of the players, maybe - that would fit both the reaction and also the fact that the game hasn't ended yet).

I wonder who killed V3('s Yeerk bodies) and why.
