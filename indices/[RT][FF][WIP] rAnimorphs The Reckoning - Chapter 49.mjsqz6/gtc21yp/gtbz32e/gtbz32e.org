Well, that was quite the chapter. Looks like quantum viruses took out all the Chee, the Avatar, and all of the Visser. I think that this was an equivalent to the nukes being launched in the Cold War, and now everyone involved is dead.

And the ending promises to reveal WTF is going on with Rachel now. With the Chee, Visser, and most of the Howlers all dead we might even get a chance to breathe! Probably not though, I get the sense that we still haven't quite hit the true climax.
