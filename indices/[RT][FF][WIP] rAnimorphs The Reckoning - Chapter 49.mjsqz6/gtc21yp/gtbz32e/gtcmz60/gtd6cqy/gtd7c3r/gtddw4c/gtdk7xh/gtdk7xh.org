Hmm, fair.

/Two/ quantum virii, one to sever the connection and leave them vulnerable, and another to obliterate them? But that starts to get wobbly.

I'm not sure what mechanism would extract the Visser's yeerk and disentangle Rachel's head without affecting the rest of the biology, but would obliterate the Chee chassis.

Perhaps instead of the quantum virus being responsible for their disintegration, there's a second mechanism responsible for that? Tobias didn't see what happened, did the Avatar eject them/morph them away/annihilate them as a separate action from taking out the terrestrial Chee? Is there another plot going on; did the Visser manage to seize them during the chaos, or did the Ship do something?
