So, originally I had this plan to do a subtle cute thing where, at one point, one of the Marcos slipped a digit in his doubling and started memorizing the wrong number, and then there'd be a bunch of wrong numbers after that.

Then I decided not to do that plan.

Then I made mistakes myself. =P

I wanted to claim that it was on purpose, but there's no way Marco would've failed to notice the numbers becoming /odd./ Alas.

Hedwig became Marco Prime when the other four surviving Marcos on the excursion went Controller. At that point, they switched from "the Marco who was revived earliest" to "this guy."
