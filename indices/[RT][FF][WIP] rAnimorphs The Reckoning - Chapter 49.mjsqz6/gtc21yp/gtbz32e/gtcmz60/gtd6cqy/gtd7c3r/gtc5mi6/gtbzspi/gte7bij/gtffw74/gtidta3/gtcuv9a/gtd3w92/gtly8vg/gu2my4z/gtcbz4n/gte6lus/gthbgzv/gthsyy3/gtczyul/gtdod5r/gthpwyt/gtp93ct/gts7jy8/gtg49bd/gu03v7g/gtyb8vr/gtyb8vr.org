Huh have the chee been manipulating characters this whole time, with animorphs thinking it was the gods? In terms of actions they've taken, was it six steps to ascension?

1. At the school, get the visser and elfangor (who turned out to be rachel) to expose a chee to a Leeran, gaining full information from both sides, learning about morphing and the andalite at the bottom of the sea.

At this point, I think erek has the required info to:

1. beach that whale for tobias, don't think about how it'll eventually die, but now tobias can get the good ship. (The response to this seems to be a player having visser three kill tobias, hence the david intervention) So now the chee have six steps and full but out of date leeran info on the visser

New plan: 1. Manipulate telor lottery so a morpher comes to Brazil (luckily it is tobias) 2. Give tobias key to good ship 3. Manipulate ax into building z-space communicator 4. Call the howlers and tell them earth is interesting, don't think about the space mines 5. Be present at the council meeting 6. Ask nicely to be unbound

What i can't quite figure out is why then tobias had to keep grabbing bigger and bigger animals in the interlude, since if it was the chee they'd just drop another one on him I think?

I'm generally feeling low confidence about each of these theories, but I feel high confidence that at least one event the characters blame on E/K was actually chee manipulation.

Also, I think I'm getting closer to understanding why the chee were holding onto the morph cube and tobias earlier on, which is still a big puzzle for me
