I don't think any of the pieces (Visser, Chee, Animorphs, etc) are bound by the Arbiter's rules, just Ellimist and Crayak themselves. And as far as we can tell, those rules have more to do with how the players achieve their results vs what results are permissible. That being said, the Avatar acting oddly, openly interfering on the New Day's Dawn, and subsequently getting zapped /does/ kinda look like one of the Players overstepping somehow and then getting got by the Arbiter. But I'm still not sure if that's what happened or not.

Also morphing tech is based around nanomachines and shit and no one got zapped for that.
