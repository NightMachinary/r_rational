I think this was a series of plays and counterplays culminating in the loss of one of the players. Here's how I suspect it went down:

1. Chee get unleashed and slaughter Howlers.
2. Visser 3 hacks into the hypercomputer, kicks player1/ellimist/chaos/noise/harmony out of the hypercomputer and into the avatar, drops the hypercomputer out of hyperspace, and starts zapping chee.
3. In a fit of spite and/or desperation, Player 1 unleashes a quantum virus on Visser 3.
4. The arbiter destroys player 1.
