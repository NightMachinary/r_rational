Good chapter!

I kind of hope we're getting back to a point where the characters have actual agency soon, not "let's three hour discussing how we'll achieve our next predetermined move that we have no choice about" agency.

Also, with Player 1 being disintegrated (apparently?), we reach the end of my future knowledge from that mail Tk17Studios sent me years ago. So I'm /super/ curious what will happen next!
