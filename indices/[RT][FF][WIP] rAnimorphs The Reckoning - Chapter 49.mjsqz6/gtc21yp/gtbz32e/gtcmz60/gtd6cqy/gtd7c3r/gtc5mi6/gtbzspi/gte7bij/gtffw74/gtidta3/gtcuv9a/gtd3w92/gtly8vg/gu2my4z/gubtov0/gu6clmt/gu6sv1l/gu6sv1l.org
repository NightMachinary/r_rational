Amazing.

  Cant wait for the next chapter. I am going to go ahead and guess that Crayak was the winner, because I'm fairly confident he was the one that sent them on the mission to the arn planet, and he stated that it would be “much harder to win” if they didn't go. At this point in the story unless I'm missing something that seems like a slight of hand statement, as in the real meaning was “it would be much harder for ME to win.”<!

  They didn't really get much out of that trip beyond access to the yeerk fleet, unless I am forgetting something, and without that they probably would've just died on earth and Tobias would've just left, so the events that caused one player to win wouldn't have happened. But really I don't even know. Excited to see how this ends, but also sad! Been following this since 2015 so it'll be sad to see it go<!
