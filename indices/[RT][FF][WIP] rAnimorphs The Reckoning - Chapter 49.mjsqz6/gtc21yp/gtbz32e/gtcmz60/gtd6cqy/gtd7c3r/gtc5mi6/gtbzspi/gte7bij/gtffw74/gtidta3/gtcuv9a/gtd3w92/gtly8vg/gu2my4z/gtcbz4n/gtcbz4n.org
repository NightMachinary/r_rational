I am arguably confused more than the characters, because not only I am confused about the in-universe events, like they are, but also about the narrative purpose of.... I want to say "this chapter," but honestly, it's more like "the last five chapters." While most stories the to unveil their mysteries when close to the end, here the mysteries are being piled on in rapid succession. I don't quite see the point of that, but I genuinely believe in author's mastery to pull a satisfying resolution off. We'll see.

As of right now, there's just /too much/, rather than /too little/, to make any theories, imho. Any attempt will miss at least one important detail, but probably more.

Here's my attempt to list these important details, but, of course, it's probably inconclusive:

1. Marco mentioned that the Yeerks didn't see them in one of the first chapters because sometimes, things /simply/ go wrong. There was an opportunity to get it right, but you fucked it up. (I think, there's a narrative significance there, but I can't quite make it out.)

2. They've been funneled towards /something/---maybe Chee unlocked, maybe something else. How does that bode with the rest of events?

3. The Avatar appearing and taking over the Good Ship.

4. Supercomputer's output devices (?, according to the Visser---but I would trust him on this one) appearing around Earth, presumably from the Z-space.

5. The Chee were being deactivated by the Avatar, but presumably not quantum-virused---i.e., not erased.

6. Then after the Avatar pulls his hand away from the console, he, the Visser, and Chee all got erased from the existence, /somehow/ (presumably by the way of the quantum virus, but who the fuck knows).

7. Cassie brought Rachel, visibly in full health, who asked for a Leeran.

/How/ can one tie /all/ of this together is beyond me.

*Late edit*: One question that really gnaws me is what unites specifically the Avatar, Visser, and Chee, so it was specifically them (and probably only them) who disappeared? I have two options, but the answer is likely "neither, these are several separate events in play" or something even more complex.

The first option is Visser and Chee are pawns of the player(s), and as the Game was won by one of them, the Avatar disappeared and so did the pieces. The main contradiction to this hypothesis is that the Animorphs /really/ seem to be the pieces themselves, or at least massively important to the Game in other way, and so they should've been gone as well.

The second option that comes to mind is that the Visser desperately wanted access to the hypercomputer, and in this very chapter he was salivating at the sight of it. Off-screen, he probably put a ton of effort into trying to break into it as soon as it appeared from the Z-space, and Chee also probably reacted to it in some way once the output device started disabling them. What I'm getting at is that the Avatar, Visser, and Chee were linked to the hypercomputer at the moment when /something/ happened, which either freed Rachel or /was done/ by Rachel. It seems like a stretch, but I feel like the answer actually can be along those lines considering we had a lot of mentions of how the Visser wanted to access the hypercomputer.
