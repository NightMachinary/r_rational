(spoilers for Chili) in part what C_Densem said. I think it was around the abstraction room for me. I did not mind the Mahuika backstory, and the pun was pretty great. My issue is that the story started feeling prettty rushed leading into the street pickle, so it felt less like a careful deliberate setup for a pun and more like the author just giving up on the story.

The worrying (now gone) personal authors notes of a later chapter probably contributed to my view.

Oh right. This is not exactly my concern with The Reckoning, sorry. It is hard to put in words but basically the steps taken in Chili to bring the story to that final setting (tropes used and what not). I might have to come back to this for a more specific sort of analysis.
