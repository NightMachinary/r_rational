If the hypercomputer automatically killed the Chee because of a failsafe, it would probably directly intervene in the physical universe, and the Chee would drop dead for no obvious reason (or disappear for no obvious reason). The failsafe probably wouldn't have the form of the hypercomputer manifesting its 3D cross section physically in our universe and then physically shooting the Chee. (They disappeared afterwards, but I think that was after they were already dead.)
