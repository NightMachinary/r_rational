I /think/ it would be a nice idea to do an Interlude or an extra chapter with a character's internal monologue where they reason about what just happened and develop theories. Or maybe just one of the Players' inner monologue as they watch the game.

Not for /me/, I understand what's going on, /obviously/... but, you know, for /other people/...

If I was on the ship, I'd be trying to mind-upload as many people from Earth as I could, send half of the ships out of the system, and tried to contact the E/C duo with the other half.

Great story. The main characters will need a lot of therapy after all this, but that's the price for saving the universe (if they win).
