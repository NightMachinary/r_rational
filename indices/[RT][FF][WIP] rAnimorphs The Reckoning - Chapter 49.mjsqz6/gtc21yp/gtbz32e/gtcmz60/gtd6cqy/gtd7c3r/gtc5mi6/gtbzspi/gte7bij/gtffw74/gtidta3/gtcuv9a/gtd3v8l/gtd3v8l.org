  I'm really hoping that Rachel was being a god-puppet or something
#+end_quote

My impression is that it's the other way around.

Rachel went abruptly unconscious when the morph cube --- a link to the gods' supercomputer in z-space --- was destroyed. Theory: the mind controlling her body was not actually in her body at the time (explaining her cognitive difficulties to that point), and destroying the cube severed that connection.

So if her consciousness wasn't in her body, where was it? Probably at the other end of the link represented by the cube, so, the supercomputer itself.

Up until the cube was destroyed, most of her attention appears to have been on the degraded, laggy connection with her body. But when that connection is severed, maybe she starts to take a look around. Suddenly, there aren't just two players with root access to play with the fundamentals of reality, there are *three*. And while two of them have very oblique and ineffable motives and conditions for victory, one is wholly on board with team Animorph and team humanity, and doesn't care about the rules the other two have laid down for their little game.

That's my theory about the events of the past chapter. Rachel isn't a god-puppet, she's ascended to godhood herself.
