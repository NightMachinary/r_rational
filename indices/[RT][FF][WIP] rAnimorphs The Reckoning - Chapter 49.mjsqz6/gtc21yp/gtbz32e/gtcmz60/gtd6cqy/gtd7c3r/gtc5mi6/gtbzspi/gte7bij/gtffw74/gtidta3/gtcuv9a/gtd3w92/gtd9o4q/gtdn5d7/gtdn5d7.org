We've been thinking that this is the endgame for the entire universe, but it doesn't necessarily have to be. The Pemalites flashback made me realize that perhaps this sort of dynamic has occurred many times throughout the history of the universe, with both players moving to a slightly altered gameboard after each round of planetary armageddon. Perhaps we won't see any end to the conflict between the Ellimist and Crayak. The shadow demon assassination might have only been a symbolic representation that the current phase of play is closed.
