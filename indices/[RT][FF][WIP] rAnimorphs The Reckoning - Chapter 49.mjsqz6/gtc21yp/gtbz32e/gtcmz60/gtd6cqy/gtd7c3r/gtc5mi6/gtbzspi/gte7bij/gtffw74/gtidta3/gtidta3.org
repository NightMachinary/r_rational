Observation: One of the rules that the Avatar explicitly mentioned is that when a player makes a move, the other player gets a free move with the same cost. This is shown in the form of teleporting the Animorphs Vs revealing the Asteroid to Vissor III.

Hypothesis: We just saw such an exchange. One player used a highly costly move to remove the Chee, allowing the other to remove the Vissor. This might even have been the point of setting up the unboxxing of the Chee, so as to remove the two most powerful pieces.

Now, as for the Gainaxy bit with the Avatar's apparent destruction, the appearance of the hypercomputer, and Rachel's sudden awakening ... I can only piggyback off everyone else's wild speculation.

All I have to go on is the meta knowledge from canon, that Crayak made a show of tempting Rachel to his side in book 48 (I think? The ordering got weird right when I missed the V II encounter.). That book felt like disappointing fanservice and filler, tbh, "hey, there are these popular loose ends with Crayak and David. Let's do something with them real quick, since we're about to start the endgame." In fairness to Applegate, I can see this as being a necessary test Rachel must pass before she can fulfill her mission in the final book, from some weird Ellimist's-eye view, and V III turning into a sentient puddle of Jello was ... memorable,.

That's sort of been in the backof my head whenever something draws attention to Rachel's coming across as a glitch in the [time?] Matrix. Canonically, Crayak made a hamfisted attempt to turn her, and when he failed, she made a huge impact, seemingly in the Ellimist's favor. If that same dynamic is at play here, it's going to be far more complex, and I have no idea where it's going or how the hints we've been given tie into it.

(Also, the Vissor's avatars on the Andalite homeworld kinda reminded me of the Drode. Probably just because they sounded more deinonichusy than Hork Bajiry, and in context, I was primed to think about E/C-related things.)

You know, the only Gainax anime I've ever actually finished is FLCL[1], so maybe I shouldn't throw around the word "Gainax" as an adjective... but somehow, it seems appropriate as a description for this chapter, in particular.

[1] WTF voiceover pronounces "FLCL" as "Fooly Cooly" who put that in there? The same person who changed how it pronounces "Pokemon"? Why couldn't they fix the pronunciation of "potion" (/paʃən/? Why is it /paʃən/?)?
