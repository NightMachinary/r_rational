Theory: The Chee advanced to the point where they could interact directly with the game's output devices, i.e. the machines that actually do the meddling for the gods. The Avatar was enraged, manifested physically on Good Ship's deck (because of course it was there, invisible, watching the main event), and tried to destroy the Chee with its godpowers. The Chee had already figured out how to disable that particular function, so the Avatar tried to shut them down manually. Then the Chee disabled the hypercomputer's cloaking system, and that triggered a failsafe that killed any potential AGI in the system (or universe?).
