I see, so the Marco we follow in Ch 37 onwards (2^{27} /Hedwig/Prime) is not the same one as Beruk/the clone maker/the highest power of 2/the master copy. Whatever happened to /him/? Kinda lost track on Arn; did he die randomly or become Visser 1/4? I know the answer is supposed to be â€˜it doesn't matter, they're all Marco', but still...

And since we're here why was Marco in a blouse and skirt when Jake wakes up? He says he woke up 5 days ago, during which he was presumably out making copies of himself; he hasn't changed clothes since then?
