  no way Marco would've failed to notice the numbers becoming odd
#+end_quote

originally I didn't notice they were 2^{n} -1 and my comment said 'Marco may be a ruthless tactical genius, but he probably isn't getting into AP math'. Then I noticed the pattern and wondered if there was a reason for it.

On that note, it /would/ have been pretty cool to see one of the Animorphs make basic math mistakes. It really humanizes the characters. It says something when I read a story with shapeshifting aliens and the most unrealistic part is when I say to myself 'why is everyone here from high schoolers to the POTUS this good at thinking and how do I go to this planet'?

I really love the parts that remind us that the Animorphs are just +random+ kids, such as the crude jokes between Marco and Jake. This would have been one such example, although the boy who decided to use powers of 2 probably would have known they weren't supposed to be odd.
