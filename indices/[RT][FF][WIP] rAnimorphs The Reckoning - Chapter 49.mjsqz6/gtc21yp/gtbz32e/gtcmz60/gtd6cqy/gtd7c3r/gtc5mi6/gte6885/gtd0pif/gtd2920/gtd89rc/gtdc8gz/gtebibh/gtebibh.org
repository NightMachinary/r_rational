Yeah, I think the weirdness of the ending for Chili worked because it was consistent with the tone. With regards to Animorphs, I feel like we to see the final chapters before making a conclusion. From what I've seen, it's starting to get to the point where each chapter breaks my immersion further with how far off the rails we've gotten and how little agency the pov characters actually have. It feels like throughout most of the book it was just the main characters getting dicked around by V3, god and, while it makes sense that they were never able to truly get any sense of agency, it does feel a little bad that even in the final hour we still have things happen around us rather than because of us. As the other people said though, i have faith that the last chapters will be satisfying, it just feels like the hoops that they have to jump through to be satisfying gets more and more difficult with each successive chapter.
