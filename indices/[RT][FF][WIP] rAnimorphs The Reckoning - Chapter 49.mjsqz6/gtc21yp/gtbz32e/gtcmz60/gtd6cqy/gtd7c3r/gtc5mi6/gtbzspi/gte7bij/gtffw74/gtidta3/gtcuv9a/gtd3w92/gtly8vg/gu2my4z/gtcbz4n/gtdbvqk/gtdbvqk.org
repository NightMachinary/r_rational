One thing to keep in mind is there are likely two different opposing plans at work, with the opposing plans designed to hide pieces and mislead the super intelligence behind the opposite plan. So what two sets of pieces are most separate/hidden from each other? I think Rachel not being modeled by the Chee and whatever is going on with her represents one plan and the hidden message to the Visser to allow the Chee to get unchained and all the pressure along that line represent another.

Also no Quantum virus is needed, direct access to the Z-space computer allows jacking things into Z-space (like what happened to Cassie). Also the Quantum virus erases particular molecular sequences, not entirely macro-scale beings. So you could probably find unique molecular sequences common to the upgraded Visser 3, and even the Chee, but this would be erasing critical molecular components, not erasing them entirely.

Edit: doing a reread, the Chee deactivated, then disappeared. So two mechanisms at work? Quantum virus for the initial deactivation, z-space yoinking for an extra precaution? It seems like overkill, but perhaps if you are the Ellimist/Crayak you don't take chances with strong AI? Or maybe they both independently had mechanisms in place to take out the Chee?
