The Avatar claimed that the controlling Player could not use it to lie, but that hardly means anything.

The Chee did get contained before they got to Mars which implies Player 2 saw this coming. OTOH, either one player just suffered a huge defeat (checkmate even?), or the computer itself had to act.

IRL this would be an obvious P2 victory. But combined with vague hints with Rachel being Unexpected, and the genre-fact that Rachel reappearing means she's not just there to say "yup, the P2 victory was overdetermined since before we were born, but as a side effect of recent events I've returned and we can feel depressed together for a few minutes", there's a distinct possibility this isn't playing out like P2 foresaw.

  Did V3 go into the hypercomputer somehow? He went somewhere.

If it isn't going according to plan, or if P2's cheaty actions are letting him lie, or if there never was a barrier to lying- then V3 may have gone to the place that chalk figures go when erased.
