Thorough, I assume?

Oh yes, but the players have to pay a price for intervention.\\
V3 knows this from capturing the Animorphs.\\
So if V3 is dead, he must have made taking his life extremely costly for one of the players. So I'd say this will give a strong advantage to one side now.

Also if V3 is dead, this will make player 2's reputation suffer, since the Andalite, that was captured with the Avatar message for him, should be free now.

Maybe both players agreed that V3 went too far, and it was a free action.
