I think the Visser and the Chee were killed because they /intentionally/ broke one of the "Rules" in the game between Crayak and the Ellimist. The rule is roughly that there are certain weapons and techniques that are forbidden, and one of these is the nanofactory. The Visser is implicated because of knowingly releasing the Chee. If you want to play Singularity while still following the "rules" I think you have to do so within certain boundaries that don't change the universe too much for other agents, lest you break a norm that protects more powerful agents from doing it to you.

If the Animorphs had intentionally decided to use the quantum virus to defeat the Howlers, they would've met the same fate. They were saved from making that decision by the Ellimist's move of bringing Cassie in to sway their choice.

I also think, based off the events of this chapter, that Crayak [Order Unity Silence][Player 1] is currently more aligned with Visser 1 and Chee, while the Ellimist [Chaos Harmony Noise][Player 2] is currently more aligned with the Yeerks, and Animorphs and the Howlers. However I think that the /locked/ Chee would have been compatible with the Player 2 goal. The unlocking makes them change to the other side.

I speculate that Player 2 likes chaotic elements that keep the story going, while Player 1 wants things to sort of settle down. Yeerks, Humans, Andelites, and Howlers as a species all value experience, life and playing games with multiple players. The Chee and Visser 1 do not really care about that. But this probably isn't the whole story because you'd think forbidding certain types of singularities makes it so that Player 1 is at a big disadvantage. It could be that player 2 is simply stronger and only keeps player 1 around to keep the game going.
