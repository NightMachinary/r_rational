Okay, gotta assume we're at last call for guessing what's going on with Rachel, so now that the Chee have all been erased from existance it's time to layout how Chee!Rachel works even better than ever.

First, some Chee facts (mixed with Chee assertions that Erek made to Rachel):

Chee have selectively perfect memories. They remember everything, unless they choose to forget.

Chee can read and write memories of Yeerks.

Chee can perform surgery without tripping any of their anti-violence blocks.

Chee are prohibited from giving weapons to humans when they know they're going to be used for violence.

Chee are cheeting cheeters that cheet.

So, when Erek, Rachel, V3, and the kid V3 was controlling were all in a hypersight moment the Chee got a full copy of their brainstate (like with Quat and V3).

After that moment, the Chee had a problem. They know where the blue box is, and they know that Rachel is going to go for it, and they're prohibited from giving something to a human who they know is going to commit violence.

Erek (and another Chee) meet up with Rachel when she goes to get the blue box and explain the situation to her. There are ways around it, but Erek leads her to a solution that Rachel at peak self-loathing because of the Chapman kerfuffle can't help but accept.

So Erek preps Rachel for surgery. The Chee that came with him has been stripped down to something capable of controling a human and is running a copy of Rachel.exe. Erek inserts the other Chee into Rachel, making sure that it will blend with her when she morphs, just like Elfangor's earplugs.

Chee!Rachel starts simulating the Rachel brain state which puppets Rachel's body, and goes on about her business with the blue box.

"No violence here Mr. Censor," says Erex, whistling innocently. "Just letting a Chee walk away with this dangerous weapon, no problem." He then wipes his memory of what he just did, to avoid losing the plausible deniability that let him do it in the first place.

"No violence here Mr. Censor," says the Chee in Rachel's head, whistling innocently. "Just simulating this human and definitely not paying any attention to what she's doing."

Once Tom brings Rachel back, the new iteration has issues because of the Chee still running the show. Chee memories are backed up to the cloud, so Rachel seeing memories of her previous self are because of that. The seizures trigger at the exact moment control switches from the hypercomputer simulation to the body and the memories from the time morphed are written to the brain. They might be being caused by the interaction between the leftover Yeerk tissue and the Chee, or because the Chee's memories of the previous Rachel are causing problems.

Once all of the Chee get poofed, actual Rachel is back in control and is good to go.

--------------

Some problems with this theory (please add to this, if someone can kill this theory I get to stop thinking about it):

#+begin_quote
  Why did Rachel have future memories that one time?
#+end_quote

Cashing in my "the Players did it" token on this one. Both times Jake got ressurected, he had a Player related vision. Maybe that was Rachel's, given to her by one of the Players to prevent Marco from killing Cassie.

#+begin_quote
  But the Chee said that Erek was the only Chee that teleported away from the Yeerk pool. Wouldn't Rachel count for that?
#+end_quote

The ellipses in that segment are doing some work there. We know it's not a perfect sequence since some of the Chee are already dead. So something like:

[No. Has three-four-five-six?]

[Don't worry about it. Has three-four-five-seven?]

Seems plausible.

#+begin_quote
  Okay but why can't the Chee acknowledge to themselves that Rachel is being driven by a Chee. Why is she the female instead of just another Chee?
#+end_quote

Erring on the side of not triggering anti-violence protocols. They don't need to know that what's going on with Rachel, and if they ever do the Chee that is piloting her can let the rest know. They can just flag her as something weird but not to be thought deeply about and move on.

#+begin_quote
  What's up with Rachel in the mind meld with everyone?
#+end_quote

V3 has never been in a mindmeld with a Chee that has had time to prepare countermeasures for it. The Chee can just grey rock it until the mindmeld ends.

#+begin_quote
  Why did Rachel react to the Visser destroying the cube?
#+end_quote

...good question actually, I have no idea.

There are too many holes and too much handwaving here for me to think this is right, but I don't have a better guess.
