I have long hoped that there might be a third intelligence, initially thinking that perhaps the avatar had an agenda of his own, but I don't know whether there's enough support for this in the text given the remaining length of the story. We do have that description of something severing part of itself while in transit that Jake had in a morph vision. I hadn't noticed this as support for a third intelligence until now, but if we buy that Crayak and Ellimist have both been around forever, then that can't be their origin story, and presumably it should end up relevant somehow.
