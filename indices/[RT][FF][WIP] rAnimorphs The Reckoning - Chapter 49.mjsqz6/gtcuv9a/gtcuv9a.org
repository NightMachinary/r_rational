...what?

What even happened there?

My initial understanding of the Visser vanishing was that he managed to upload himself into the hypercomputer now that it is revealed, though I guess that doesn't really work at all well with the Visser's hosts being freed. No way he would just vanish like that.

Did he actually get quantum virused out of existence? That...wow. I'm really hoping that Rachel was being a god-puppet or something and knows everything about everything because how else will this ever get explained

It does make sense though that a god had a preparation to quantum virus the Chee! They probably have those for all the AIs that exist, you really don't want someone new coming up to threaten you after all.
