I reread all the interludes.

Rachel is strongly implied to be unintended. This does not seem to make her invisible to the Players- her morph-gate gets moved away from the meteor. If she's invisible to the Chee, it may imply the Chee were tuned to the original Animorphs (and Ax/Garrett, who were presumably Intended) but not Rachel.

A Player altered at least one Howler ship to ensure the Americas were not the first to be hit.

The Unity player gave V3 access to the Howler file. It had decided this was the end-game. Perhaps was to make V3 act differently, and/or get his network set up, so he would get the message & feel confident with the Chee being loosed?

I suspect someone acted to give Garrett the Feeling he should not hand the Cube to the Chee. This could be P2 ensuring the Chee couldn't hack the hypercomputer, or him setting up details of the un-binding of the Chee. Or doing something related to Rachel.

I'm putting more weight on the Ellimist having just lost a lot, acting against the Rules in a last ditch, and getting destroyed by the Arbiter. Less likely, the Ellimist saw it all coming & played along, a 3rd entity is futzing with stuff, or [other stuff I haven't thought of].
