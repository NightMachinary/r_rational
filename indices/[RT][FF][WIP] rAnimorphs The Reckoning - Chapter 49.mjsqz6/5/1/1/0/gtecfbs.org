Part of my concern likely stems from nostalgia for the earlier chapters and how the scope of things has become huge in later chapters. That is not a criticism, though. But like others have commented here, there is a whole lot of mysteries now to hopefully be resolved.

If these were to be resolved through for example it was all a dream or everything after X was a simulation/all in your head or everything is undone/made irrelevant by time travel/alternate reality travel or 4th wall stuff, I might find it to be a bit cheap. I understand bits and pieces of what has happened since the first chapter to probably be planted memories or not quite as it at first seemed, but if everything was to turn into that ehh.

Overall the comparison might be a moreof a je ne sais quoi. I think what I was saying is that so far my impression is things have been connected pretty nicely (with a roughish pace/style change around Madagascar). I look forward to see how the last few chapters are tied into this (no pressure or anything), and regardless of what happens next I have enjoyed the story so far.

But yes hopefuly some of this made my concerns less vague.
