  what unites specifically the Avatar, Visser, and Chee, so it was specifically them (and probably only them) who disappeared?

The Avatar, Visser, and the Chee are all incredibly intelligent.

My guess is that there were a series of failsafes to prevent any third superintelligence from ascending to a point where it could threaten the Players. One of them was triggered by the Chee going FOOM, and instantly destroyed all intelligences above a certain (extremely high) threshold, except the Arbiter itself.
