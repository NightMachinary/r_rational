Theory: This was the rational version of how the fight with the Howlers ended in canon, when Jake morphed a Howler, and his memory of kissing Cassie polluted their shared memory with Love, and Crayak destroyed the seven Howlers the kids were fighting to stop them from infecting the whole race.

The r!version is that the Chee figured out a memetic virus that would stop the Howlers. Either they taught a Howler ways of experiencing pure joy without hurting anyone, effectively turning the Howlers into another echo of the Pemalite race, or they found the Howler equivalent of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i6QIuNS8j8][chicken hypnosis]], or simply the memory of being on the other side of a massacre would be enough to stop their crusade throughout the rest of the Universe. Crayak had to destroy to the Chee to prevent this, and the Ellimist got to name Its price.
