I agree with you about "hits different," but also my headcanon is that the Howlers were taken by surprise and expecting things to be on easy mode, and that in fact new arriving Howlers would come in much better prepared and with bigger guns. Sort of like how it's easy to get wasted in your first encounter with the level boss, but also you can gear up and try again and the big boss is actually much less invulnerable than it seemed at first glance.
