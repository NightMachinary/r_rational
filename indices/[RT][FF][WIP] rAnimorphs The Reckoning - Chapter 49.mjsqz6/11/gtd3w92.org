My best guess at what just happened: The major crux decision of the series is whether or not to give the Chee sentience. They were given sentience, and subsequently killed the howlers which were (presumably) Crayaks “army,” and his army now knows what defeat looks like. Even if the Howlers aren't all wiped out, they have now encountered an enemy that essentially killed them for sport. This will at best cause them to be more cautious/less likely to roll up on other planets dicks out, and at worst terrified of death, which would make them useless as shock troops (in canon this was accomplished through kissing, if i recall correctly). I would call this a major loss for Crayak and win for Ellimist.
