I definitely agree that there's a difference, however V3 just mentioned this in a previous chapter:

  “There was another instance,” the man interrupted. “More---blatant. One I suspect you know nothing about. I was able to take you in Wyoming because I was forewarned. The boy betrayed you---David, the one you took under your wing. He was afraid you were condemning him to die---wanted to bargain for protection---reached out to me in Vietnam. And when I dug through your memories, afterward, I found a discrepancy. You morph-checked him, Marco, using Alloran's backdoor---looked inside his mind. You could not possibly have missed his dysfunction. He was a textbook psychopath. Abused, damaged. Utterly without loyalty or principle. Yet you demorphed believing him to be the perfect recruit---went so far as to describe him as a miniature version of your fearless leader.”

  There was a tight, wild silence---

  “How do you know that your memories aren't being tampered with?”

  “I don't. Would you find it reassuring, if they were?”

  “You could be lying,” Jake pointed out. “Easier to lie than to edit a memory.”

  “I have ways of demonstrating my honesty. *But the larger point stands---we are being interfered with. All of us.* The cube, the bridge, your little field trip. I see no reason why your mother should be assumed immune. *And the interventions are growing less and less subtle*---now, at this critical moment, they've brought dear Cassie Withers back from the dead in spectacularly dramatic fashion. Why?”

Seems to be quite different than what V3 thinks - and considering that the earlier interventions were subtle, I'd argue that a simple 'forget to scan for life forms' is totally within the subtle category.

I mean, at the end of the day you're the author and I understand that you want the reader to know that nah, E/C really don't stick their fingers into pies as much as we think. But I think that throughout the many chapters it seems to be otherwise, and to just take Marco's word for it feels...well, kinda irrational! Maybe it'd be good to have a more direct E/C confirmation of this at the end/epilogue? Like Rachel asking the Ellimist if she mattered in canon. Maybe V3 (wherever he is right now) gets to see that for himself soon.
