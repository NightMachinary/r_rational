Theory: The Chee weren't just forbidden from violence, they also had to stop /anyone/ from committing violence if they could. Erek also said they were forbidden from self-improvement. Maybe they weren't just forbidden from trying to ascend to godhood themselves, they were compelled to /stop anyone else/ from ascending as well. They were able to give Tobias the key when they did because for the first time ever, they thought somebody was within 6 steps of ascending to AGI superpower status. But since the ship didn't have any weapons and there were so many possibilities (if they really stretched those steps by massively overanalyzing each one), they didn't predict that giving the key to Tobias would lead to violence.

Also, "the Chee that put it in your hands died..." was that counted among the dead Chee?
