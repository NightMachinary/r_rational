In an author post on Reddit brainstorming ideas for the exact mechanism of Quantum viruses, it was worked out that they only affect complex molecules (for instance a particular subsequence of DNA), scaling them down to simple molecules or scaling up to entire life forms doesn't work.

Edit: it wasn't an author post, but a post summarizing quotes about quantum viruses in story. Still my summary is overall correct.
