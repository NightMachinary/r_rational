  Looks like quantum viruses took out all the Chee, the Avatar, and all of the Visser.

I'm not sure about any of these. There's another thread here about the Chee. For the avatar, similarly, I wouldn't expect his whole body to go, just something it relies on so it can't keep functioning; and if it did go entirely, I wouldn't expect the ropes of shadow.

The Visser? Could be, especially if the shards are still there just inert, I'm not sure if we'd know. But the shards getting removed entirely seems more likely than the Chee getting removed entirely, at any rate. Buut, I think if the shards get removed entirely, the Visser's controlling body probably wouldn't get quantumed, whereas a surgical strike disabling the shards could also disable the controlling body?
