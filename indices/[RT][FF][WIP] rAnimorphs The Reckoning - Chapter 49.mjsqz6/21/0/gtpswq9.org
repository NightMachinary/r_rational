It was my way of trying to drive that home, yeah.

There's a difference between manipulation and ... overt coercion, though? Like, the latter stuff is just "yeah, okay, that's ... that's more mass than in a hundred Earths combined and ... yep, that's overwhelming force, all right."

But that's different from "there's some puppetmastery behind /every/ twitching string."
