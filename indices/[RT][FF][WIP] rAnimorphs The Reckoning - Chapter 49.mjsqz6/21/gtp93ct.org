One thing's been bugging at me, now that I think about it. In this chapter, Marco realizes that sometimes, it ain't the gods, you just fuck up like that Picard quote. And yet, this is contrasted by a literal Z-space computer forming a (partial?) shell around freakin' planet Earth.

Pause here for a minute to imagine Attenborough narrating the spectable.

[[/u/tk17studios]] is this intentional? I know you've mentioned a few times in other comments that E/C doesn't interfere as much as people think they do, and I wondered if Marco's revelation in this chapter was your way of trying to drive that point home for the readers. But I think in that situation if I were thinking as Marco did and then saw E/C flex this hard I'd probably reverse myself out of that revelation very quickly. What support does 'people just fuck up yo' continue to have in the face of E/C's power?
