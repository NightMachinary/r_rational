Quantum viruses work by constructing z-space matter that pulls in complementary matter and converting it into more z-space matter. Too small a molecule and the z-space complement doesn't have enough attractive force to pull it into z-space. To large/complex a molecule and synthesizing the z-space complement becomes computationally difficult to design and implement.
