Here's my guess as to what happened: a quantum virus was activated that targeted communication systems that use a particular interface with the hypercomputer.

- Visser's yeerk-lite get shriveled because he uses that interface to be a big ol intergalactic hive mind

- the Avatar gets busted (but crucially, not the ellimist or crayack) as they use the same interface to control the shared host.

- Rachel gets freed because her problem was being entangled with the interface as opposed to actually integrating with it

- the Chee get chumped because (one can only conclude) they use such an interface to communicate with one another at vast distances

Now the one thing this doesn't explain is why the Avatar entirely got shredded; my only flailing knee jerk is "fail safes so mere mortals can't inspect the divine avatar at a bad time". We don't know yet if the Chee have similarly been shredded or if they've just been deactivated; depending on how much of their processing power came from the gestalt network, it may or may not have been enough to reduce them to chunks of very fancy metal.
