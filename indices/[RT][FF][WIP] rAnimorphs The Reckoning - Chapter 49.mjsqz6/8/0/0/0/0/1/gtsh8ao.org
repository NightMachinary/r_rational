Hold on let me pick my jaw off the floor-

My wildest dream would be to write a interlude chapter for this fic. There are some spaces in between the current chapters which I'd love to see into; particularly the conversation between Marco and a Marclone-donor. I'd probably hold off until I know what sort of shape the Earth is in after all this, so I probably wouldn't be able to start until after the official ending^{unless} ^{beta} ^{access?}

FWIW my irl name is already in one of the earlier chapters in a very small cameo-sized appearance so we can just pretend that one was for me.
