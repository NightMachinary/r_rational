Btw since I was thinking about the Marclones, a couple of points:

I get the impression that they work off powers of 2 as their version control system, as seen in Ch 15, featuring Marcos 2^{14} and 2^{15,} and Ch 37, featuring Marcos 2^{27,} 2^{35,} 2^{41,} among others, and Ch 44. However:

Why is Hedwig/2^{27} Marco Prime? I would have thought Prime would have the highest ID number, which keeps increasing, unless I'm severely misunderstanding the system.

In Ch 44, the Marcos have odd numbers of the form 2^{n} -1 instead, such as 2^{40} -1 and 2^{45} -1. Any reason why (especially since there's a 2^{41} and a 2^{40} -1)?

+In episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is a magic xylophone, or something? Ha ha, boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.+
