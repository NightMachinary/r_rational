This is in the chapter next week, very clearly spelled out, but spoiler tagging just for people who want to wait and see it there. In the broadest possible strokes, what happened here at the end of this chapter was:

(Seriously, don't be mad at me if you read the following; I spoiler tagged it and it's the primary focus of next week's chapter; I do not think it in any way reduces the value of that chapter or I wouldn't put it here but still, read at your own risk; I just get the sense that some people will prefer to more carefully focus their theorizing over the next week; it's a kindness to rule out wrong threads.)
