  Slavery is also an option. If you have low birthrates it's always nice to have a fast breeding workforce for manual labor. (And as human history has shown, you don't even need racial differences for a society to develop a caste system or institutionalized slavery.)

I hadn't thought of this, but it would still throw a wrench into many traditional fantasy settings where the different races live as their own separate civilizations.

  Or how about this; humanity as an analogy for global warming and human/elf relations as asymmetric warfare. The elves always knew that humans bred fast enough that they would one day outnumber the elves so greatly that it would be a serious problem for all of elf-kind, but any extermination program against the humans would be costly in terms of precious elf lives, and none of the elf kingdoms wanted to bite that bullet by themselves. Talks for a human extermination treaty continually fell apart due to mistrust and selfishness (remember that you can't spell selfish without elfish). Now the elves are in a position where human extermination is basically impossible, so they stay in their heavily fortified redoubts and count on the fact that humans can't effectively break elfish defenses.

That sounds like one of my exceptions, which is that elves would be able to decisively defeat any invaders.

The problem as I see it is that Human civilizations, and possibly fantasy civilizations of other races could have a wide range of variability in their military prowess. There were groups like Ghengis Khan and the Mongols, Alexander the Great and the Macedonians, Napoleon and the French, the Roman Republic, the Mughals, etc that were all hitting way above their weight class. They all conquered their neighbors and slaughtered entire cities and peoples sometimes. They were conquering other humans that they could enslave and interbreed with. Humans could potentially enslave elves, but in most setting humans and elves can't interbreed. If they did what humans normally did, they would slaughter all of the adult males (possibly all the adults, or all the males depending on the particulars of Elven breeding problems, and the conquering human culture). You would then be left with a bunch of female elves and maybe a few young male elves that aren't really capable of rekindling a civilization.

And for each region that Elves and humans share it only takes one great human conqueror to kill off the elves.

*edit - I'm new to posting in this subreddit, but that challenge sounds fun, I've got a few ideas around semi-extinct elves running around in a human world.
