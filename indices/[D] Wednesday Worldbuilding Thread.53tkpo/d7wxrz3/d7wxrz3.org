Playing on the whole falling in a new world thing, how do you handle not getting sick? Okay, let's say you fall into a standard fantasy world of some kind with dragons, elves, humans, orcs, you name it. I'm a first-world person, and I've fallen into their world with hiking gear since I was on a backpacking trip.

If I go to somewhere like Africa or India and run around without vaccines, I could easily catch some form of crippling disease. In India at least, afaik, it's due to their poor sanitation. My thought was to compare this new world with Native Americans of yore. It is said that the Europeans spread disease in part because they didn't have proper sanitation or keep things nearly as clean as they needed to, and that in comparison Native Americans actually had good sanitation habits, which kept them free of a lot of bacteria and sicknesses which accompanied that.

Would it then be safe to suggest that this fantasy world, while not nearly as technologically advanced, still practice somewhat decent sanitation habits? Perhaps they don't pasteurize their milk, and the food like meat isn't FDA-approved, but that's still survivable, isn't it? Anything else that I might be missing as far as disease, etc goes?
