Thanks, you just gave me a couple of good ideas to my story. I think a magical "wipe out all bacterium" is a little contrived (right word?) in that it gives my world an easy out. For my story, I want what's keeping most people from constant plagues to be a kind of Native-American their lifestyle is actually conducive to healthiness. Perhaps we could do as you mentioned and have a pantheon of Gods or ancient texts, where each group of people have their own cleaning ritual any given worshipper must do every so often which is analogous to our standard cleaning habits.
