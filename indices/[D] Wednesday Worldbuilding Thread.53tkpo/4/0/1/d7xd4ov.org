The obvious choice for Love would be Slaneesh cultists, but since they're avoiding those ... nonsexual love counts, right? I know WW got one because she "loves everyone equally".

Maybe someone in the Imperial religion could power it with their love for the Emperor?

There's precedent for Imperial miracles like that, too. I think the Sisters of Battle are the best at that?

  Fear might be drawn to the Imperium since they're all "ends justify the means" at their best times.

It /might/, but I'd lean toward the Eldar. Maybe the Dark Eldar. (Every Eldar faction is in some way based around the fact that their afterlife consists of being raped and devoured by Slaneesh. Dark Eldar dedicate their lives to torturing, killing, and generally terrorizing people in order to temporarily appease it.)
