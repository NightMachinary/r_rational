The Tau might be a good choice for Compassion since the comics were always a little unclear about how the Indigo Tribe's actions were supposed to be compassionate. They did some pretty disturbing stuff at times and were always secretive about why, apparently trying to do good but never fully cooperating with or trusting others. Not that the Tau would make more sense, but it would be consistent with canon.
