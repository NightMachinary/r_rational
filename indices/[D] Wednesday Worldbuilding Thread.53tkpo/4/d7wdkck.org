Two (unrelated) questions:

1. Assuming that the DC Emotional Entities suddenly showed up in WH40K (having previously been fucking off on the other side of the visible universe) and each created and dispatched a ring and battery (ring includes instructional data on some aspects of ring programming, along with the ability to forge new rings through colossal amounts of effort), and given that the Entities are not friendly with Chaos: Who would each entity pick as their First Lantern? Ignore Hope, as Blue is going to be an OC (possibly SI).

2. Which settings can you think of that have parallel worlds as a technological or magical mechanism? Which of these would be interesting to smack upside the metaphorical head with a genre-savvy zerg swarm?
