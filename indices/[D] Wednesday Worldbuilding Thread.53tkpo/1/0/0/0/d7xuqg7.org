Sure, that works. Divine "magic" like eating chicken soup and quarantine conditions would minimise disease spread, mosquito and gnat preventions, from nets to rat extermination to anti-pest magic could make all disease a rare occurrence, animal cleanliness would reduce crossover, and handwashing with soap is downright miraculous.

Those are just the easily-created though. If the guidebooks are actually created at a higher knowledge level, bleach sanitation, pasteurisation, and even basic antibiotics can be available.
