So, my understanding from CPG Grey's Americapox episode; [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEYh5WACqEk]], is that most of the bad diseases come about when you have nonhuman diseases spread to humans on a large scale, usually in city slaughterhouses. Native Americans avoided plague because they had no domestic animals. A more decentralised or lower tech world could avoid a large portion of this. All kinds of "normal" nasties can still kill you, for example, malaria, but this world probably predates smallpox, typically a cow disease, that spread to humans.

Second, it's more than possible to have good sanitation habits, like quarantine and rest time, perhaps as a God-given set of ideas, such as some of Leviticus and Pasque from Weber's Safehold series.

Third, how high magic is your setting? A low magic world can cure minor wounds and preemptively stop epidemics, or possibly cast repellus mosquitoes. A medium magic world could have enough magic to grant herd immunity, a magic "vaccine" spell of resist disease +2. A high magic world could use detect cause of illness, then cast Mass Destroy Bacteria, and solve the problem outright.
