I have only superficial familiarity with 40K, but I'll try my best. Rage would probably go to an Ork due to their bloodlust. Avarice would seek out the Tryanids because to their hunger. Fear might be drawn to the Imperium since they're all "ends justify the means" at their best times. I honestly have no idea who'd end up with the rest, since the people in this universe aren't exactly known for Courage, Love, or Compassion.
