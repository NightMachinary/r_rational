  Humans have wiped out other groups of humans throughout history, especially on a regional basis.

If one species exists in only a small region, and humans are spread across a large region, then yes, I could see that tiny settlement being wiped out. But that's obviously a case of the Others being at a severe disadvantage relative to humans.

  So we have an example of stone age level tools wiping out a stone age level population of another species.

No, we have an example of a stone-age level intelligent species going extinct for unknown reasons.

#+begin_quote
  We have multiple examples of medieval level technology wiping out peoples during conquest. We have examples of more technologically advanced civilizations wiping out less advanced civilizations (the Americas). And we have modern examples in China, Russia, and Germany of governments that are fully capable of killing off large portions of their own population.

And yet, despite multiple attempts, no-one has ever managed to wipe out another race. As you note, the closest they came is the Americas, and that was with help from disease to kill 90% of the population. They have, at best, managed to genocide /most/ of a particular ethnic group in a small are.

Humans, empirically, aren't united enough to wipe out other races. Your assertion that multiple humanlike races cannot coexist is empirically disproven by the /actual existence/ of multiple human races, none of which have been wiped out.
