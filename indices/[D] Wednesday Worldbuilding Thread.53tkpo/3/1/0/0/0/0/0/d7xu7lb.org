  If one species exists in only a small region, and humans are spread across a large region, then yes, I could see that tiny settlement being wiped out. But that's obviously a case of the Others being at a severe disadvantage relative to humans.

Its like believing in micro-evolution but not macro-evolution. If it can happen at a small scale, then it can happen repeatedly at a small scale until it becomes a large scale.

  No, we have an example of a stone-age level intelligent species going extinct for unknown reasons.
#+end_quote

What we do know implies that humans are more likely than not to be at blame. If we saw this in the fossil record for any other two species we wouldn't hesitate to assign blame to the invading species. Two similar species with similar ecological niches. Soon after they start sharing the same habitat one of these species becomes extinct, with only traces of its DNA left in the other species.

  And yet, despite multiple attempts, no-one has ever managed to wipe out another race. As you note, the closest they came is the Americas, and that was with help from disease to kill 90% of the population. They have, at best, managed to genocide most of a particular ethnic group in a small are.

That is just flat out not true. Different races of humans have been wiped out, to the same degree that the Neandrathals have been wiped out. Scatterings of their DNA survive in their neighbors or their conquerors, but no other trace of them remains. There were hundreds of pre-Columbian tribes that were wiped out. Sometimes all we have left from them is a river or geographic landmark named after the tribe.

There is a long history of intentional Genocide between Humans [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocides_in_history]]

If your measure of success is that 100% of the people were killed, then yeah nothing meets that metric. That isn't my metric though. I think a Human genocide comparable metric for a species that could not interbreed with humans would be that a human population has been destroyed so badly that they can never again recover as their own unique population. And that has been the case with nearly everything termed a 'genocide'.

#+begin_quote
  Humans, empirically, aren't united enough to wipe out other races. Your assertion that multiple humanlike races cannot coexist is empirically disproven by the actual existence of multiple human races, none of which have been wiped out.
#+end_quote

Humans don't have to be united. That other race just has to be a competitive drain on limited resources that are worth fighting over. No one claims that the Neandrathal era humans were united as a single force against Neandrathals.

Current humans are incredibly genetically similar compared to other animal species. [[http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/genetics/human-skin-color-variation/modern-human-diversity-genetics]] So rather than disproving my point, the human races you see today are so similar that they barely warrant being called different races. And you still mostly never see situations like in Tolkein fantasy, where there are widely different races sharing the same region. I'll call them mixed regional neighborhoods:

Human - elf - hobbit - human - dwarf - elf - hobbit - human

If they were more like traditional human racial regions it would look like this:

Human - Human - Human - Hobbit - Hobbit - Elf - Elf - Dwarf - Dwarf

And history would often go through periods of war where those different races would start expanding into other areas, usually if one race tended to go through an era of extra military ability. So it might end up looking like:

Human - Human - Human - Hobbit - Hobbit - Elf - Elf - Dwarf - Dwarf

Human - Human - Human - Human - Elf - Elf - Elf - Elf - Dwarf

Human - Human - Human - Human - Human - Human - Elf - Elf - Elf

Human - Human - Human - Human - Human - Human - Human
