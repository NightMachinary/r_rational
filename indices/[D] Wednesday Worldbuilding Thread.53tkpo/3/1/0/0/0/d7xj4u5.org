  The extinction of the Neanderthals has been blamed on interbreeding, disease, environmental factors ... there's absolutely no evidence we beat them in some kind of millenia-long total war.

It wasn't a long stretched out 'total war' situation. But its our only evidence of humans living alongside another intelligent species. And the end result is that the Neandrathals are gone. Maybe there was some non-human cause to Neandrathal extinction, but the interbreeding is evidence that Neandrathals and humans shared an environment at one point. At a minimum, humans at least caused pressure on Neandrathal habitats in a time of crisis for their species. At most they possibly hunted and killed Neandrathal tribes to eliminate one of their main competitors in the environment.

Its an n=1 data situation, but it still suggests that a shared environment lead to the extinction of one species. And the only thing to facilitate this extinction was stone age tools, starvation, shared environment, and competition for resources.

  I didn't say we would never have any conflict with them. I said we wouldn't succeed in wiping out a species that is equivalent to us. Humans conflict with each other all the time.

And Humans have wiped out other groups of humans throughout history, especially on a regional basis. And there are large variations in human population's ability to wage war. So even if a competing intelligent race is equivalent to us, it only takes one generation of violent conquerors to heavily specialize in warfare and permanently tip the balance in favor of one species. Ghengis Khan, Roman republic, Alexander the Great, Napolean, the Mughals, etc are all examples of a generation or two that was heavily specialized in warfare and leveraged it to conquer massive areas of land and create mountains of dead bodies in their wake.

  Not unless the individual wars are already very close to wiping them out, which implies a very skewed weapon effectiveness/population ratio unlike anything that's existed in our history.

So we have an example of stone age level tools wiping out a stone age level population of another species. We have multiple examples of medieval level technology wiping out peoples during conquest. We have examples of more technologically advanced civilizations wiping out less advanced civilizations (the Americas). And we have modern examples in China, Russia, and Germany of governments that are fully capable of killing off large portions of their own population.

So my question is, when have humans not had the ability to wipe out another human-like species? Unless that species could beat us even when we have a super-generation of conquerors, or they have a non-shared environment where we would not be competing with them for resources.
