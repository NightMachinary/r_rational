  Have they? Where are the Neanderthals?
#+end_quote

1. They interbred with humans
2. We don't /know/ what happened to them.

The extinction of the Neanderthals has been blamed on interbreeding, disease, environmental factors ... there's absolutely no evidence we beat them in some kind of millenia-long total war.

#+begin_quote
  Humans have been fighting each other for millenia over everything imaginable. Why wouldn't they also fight with an alien race?
#+end_quote

I didn't say we would never have any conflict with them. I said we wouldn't succeed in /wiping out/ a species that is /equivalent to us/. Humans conflict with each other all the time.

#+begin_quote
  And if wars between the two races were constant, it only takes a few major victories to tip the balance in favor of one species.
#+end_quote

Not unless the individual wars are already very close to wiping them out, which implies a /very/ skewed weapon effectiveness/population ratio unlike anything that's existed in our history.
