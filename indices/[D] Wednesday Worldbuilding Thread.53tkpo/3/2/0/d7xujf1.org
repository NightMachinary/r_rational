Humans have never been very good at integration. The Jewish people seem to be an exception that proves the rule. They managed to survive as a people and religion, despite pogroms and many other attempts to eradicate them. I'd guess that there many other cases of people attempting something like the Jewish people, but ultimately failing and being forgotten by history. If those are your best odds for survival I wouldn't be placing any favorable bets on your species.
