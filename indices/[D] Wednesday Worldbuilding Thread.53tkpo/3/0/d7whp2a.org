Slavery is also an option. If you have low birthrates it's always nice to have a fast breeding workforce for manual labor. (And as human history has shown, you don't even need racial differences for a society to develop a caste system /or/ institutionalized slavery.)

Edit: Or how about this; humanity as an analogy for global warming and human/elf relations as asymmetric warfare. The elves always knew that humans bred fast enough that they would one day outnumber the elves so greatly that it would be a serious problem for all of elf-kind, but any extermination program against the humans would be costly in terms of precious elf lives, and none of the elf kingdoms wanted to bite that bullet by themselves. Talks for a human extermination treaty continually fell apart due to mistrust and selfishness (remember that you can't spell selfish without elfish).

Now the elves are in a position where human extermination is basically impossible, so they stay in their heavily fortified redoubts and count on the fact that humans can't effectively break elfish defenses.

It would also allow for a fantasy adaptation of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiverfull][Quiverfull]] movement, though that depends somewhat on what the reason for low elfish reproduction rates is.

Edit: Also, "Elves" are now the challenge for the contest that starts in two weeks.
