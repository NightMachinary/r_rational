  Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
#+end_quote

Any setting where humans live alongside another intelligent race for any great length of time (over 1000 years). I think some faction of humans would eventually get riled up, or just in a mood to conqueror stuff and after a few episodes of this they would end up exterminating that other race. In order for that species to survive it would need one of two things:

1. Living areas that are not easily accessible by humans. Mermaids, Dwarves that live without light under giant mountains, etc.
2. Massive power advantage over humans so that any wars that are fought would be won decisively by the other species.

And if reason 2 is why they have not been killed off that species also needs to be significantly different than humans in their temperament, because then they would just wipe out humans.
