I like this theory, especially the explanation of the truthfulness and sociopathy. It's a world of oaths and agreements, and they have to be much more internally consistent. If who they were and what they valued was as fluid as it can be for humans, their compulsion to truthfulness would be either meaningless or impossible to fulfill.
