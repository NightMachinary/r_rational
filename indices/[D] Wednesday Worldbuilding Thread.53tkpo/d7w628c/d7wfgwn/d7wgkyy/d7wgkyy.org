I watched the show and enjoyed some of it, but it wasn't my kind of thing. I thought the most interesting part of the story was the idea that magic was real, but had fallen out of fashion and been lost to history until someone rediscovered it and tried to modernize the practice. I just find that premise to be really cool and think it'd make great fodder for rational fiction.
