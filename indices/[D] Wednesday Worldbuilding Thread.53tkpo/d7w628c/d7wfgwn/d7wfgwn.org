Some parts of this remind me a little of Stross' recent book The Nightmare Stacks, part of his Laundry Files series. The series is best read in order of publication, and it's not really 'rational' most of the time, but it's a lot of fun nonetheless.

My favourite overall depiction of the fey is the man with the thistle-down hair from Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. If you like this sort of thing and haven't tried that book, you really ought to; as well as the book itself being good, both the BBC miniseries adaptation and audiobook reading are well done.
