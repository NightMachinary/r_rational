I see where you're coming from. If it helps, I'm a couple dozen chapters into Pact and so far it's still pretty straightforward in plot, rather than expanding into an ever wider range of conflicts and scope. That said, it does start with the main character trying to escape and survive horrible situations, so YMMV :)

Also, while you may not have an opportunity to play Changeling, you might really enjoy reading about the worldbuilding. Let me know if you want a copy of the PDF!
