Sorry this was so long, I have the tendency to rant about things I liked at first but stopped liking before I finished.

I've heard of the game, but haven't had any reason to play World of Darkness even if I find it interesting. I haven't read Pact since I'm ambivalent towards Worm, I loved it before Leviathan showed up and by the time the Slaughterhouse 9 were defeated I didn't care anymore. Wildbow is a good writer, but I don't know if his stories are the kind I want to read.

I feel like Worm was designed as a subversion of the superhero genre, which is fine but not really what I wanted to read. As great as the characters were, the story became so much more about just surviving than achieving anything that I got tired of waiting for drama or development.

The worldbuilding was also starting to strain credibility. Details were included solely because they're common in superhero settings and Wildbow wanted to give a darker take on them, but the world ended up being so different from other setting that I couldn't believe they would exist here.

I know it all gets explained with eldrich gods and conspiracies, but that's another case of something I don't want to read. I wanted to see Taylor face her problems and solve them so she could live be happier and have done good, not get trapped in horrible situations and try to survive.

I like psychological horror, unraveling conspiracies, and munchkinism, but the story didn't set itself up like that at the beginning. When it started I thought I was in for the next Daredevil, one of my favorite shows ever, but it drifted so far from being a superhero story that I stopped caring.

If there's some Worm fanfiction out there that was closer to the style of the pre-Leviathan part of the story, I'd be happy to check it out if it's well written. Otherwise, I hesitate to read more by Wildbow and intend to read Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain when I get the chance.
