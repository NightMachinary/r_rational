It's possible I'd still like Pact since it's a different genre, I did love the Night Angel books after all (you were right about first one being the best and the third the weakest), so I'll check it out at some point. I do enjoy the psychological horror of being trapped in a bad situation and having to survive, though I prefer it when it's impersonal like in lovecraftian stories.

In the meantime I'm four and a half chapters into Shadows of the Limelight and being similarly disappointed that it's more about subverting a genre than rationalizing it, though this time I'm not nearly as attached to the characters so it'll be easier to move on. Should I check out Glimwarden instead? I know nothing about it besides the RWBY-esque world of monsters.
