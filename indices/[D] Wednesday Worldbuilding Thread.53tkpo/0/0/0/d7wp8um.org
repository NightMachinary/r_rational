I almost upvoted because of that comic, even if I take offense to the idea that all religions are built on lies, but I think the theory in The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt about how "believers" evolve is more accurate. He puts forward evidence that religious ideologies granted us major evolutionary advantages that allowed us to form more successful social groups.

One thing I realized while writing this is that the fey would probably have trouble developing science. Because they trust each other so much, they have no need for objective verification. They may not even understand the concept of objectivity if they perceive the universe as solipsistic.

I think empiricism ultimately descended from the idea of uncovering the "divine truth" of reality that was hidden from man, but later became more humanist. These fairies would only be concerned about self-interest, so they wouldn't care about finding the truth except to benefit themselves.

We humans study science and develop technology out of a loyalty to our social group, even if we seek to advance with it. The only loyalty a fairy has is what they've agreed to trade, so they would hoard knowledge rather than spread it. Or they might treat human knowledge as a gift to them and try to repay their debt to us, which could lay the groundwork for a more modern story.
