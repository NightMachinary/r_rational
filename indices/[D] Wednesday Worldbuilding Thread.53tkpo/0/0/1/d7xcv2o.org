  An inhibition towards lying also means an inhibition towards things that sound like lies to the listener. This has knock-on effects. If something unlikely happens, a fey who tries to tell others about it will likely be accused of lying. Which leads to a sort of species-wide confirmation bias: even if individual fey can learn new things and accept the evidence of their senses, new memes will have more trouble spreading.

A society without lies would also find outlandish claims /much more credible/, though, given they would be risking enormous repercussions if they were found out - and of course very rare. (Assuming it's even possible for them to lie on a neurological level.)

EDIT: ah, read the comic. Yeah, that simply doesn't make sense - they're not killing people for lying, they're killing /anyone they disagree with/.
