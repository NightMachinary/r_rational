I've seen this idea before, in /The Accidental Space Spy/. Relevant exposition starts [[http://spacespy.thecomicseries.com/comics/154][here]]. It's not particularly well-written, but it approaches the problem from a different angle to you so it may be worth reading.

An inhibition towards lying also means an inhibition towards things that sound like lies to the listener. This has knock-on effects. If something unlikely happens, a fey who tries to tell others about it will likely be accused of lying. Which leads to a sort of species-wide confirmation bias: even if individual fey can learn new things and accept the evidence of their senses, new memes will have more trouble spreading.

Of course, a fey who's known to usually tell the truth is more likely to be believed in the future. "Trust", to them, still exists and still forms bonds between individuals, but it's of the form "this person has always told the truth in the past, so I will believe the things they say in the future".
