Recently I've taken interest in the idea of The Fair Folk, so I've decided to share my way of rationalizing the behavior associated with the original folklore. I will be assuming fairies are subject to the same pressures of natural selection as humans, despite their significant differences in environment and biology. One thing I've noticed about the traditional version of The Fair Folk is how their behavior seems to correspond with human mental illness.

Their lack of empathy and impulsiveness is characteristic of psychopathy, bizarre quirks like counting grains of salt are similar to OCD, and their narcissism speaks for itself. The presumable reason why humans instinctively consider these unhealthy behavior is because our social contract is built around maintaining a standard of behavior to ensure the survival of the group. So I started thinking about what the fairy social contract is like to encourage such behavior, and here's what I've got.

The natural obstacle to sociopaths forming a society is the lack of trust for one another. Rather than solving the prisoner's dilemma with empathy like humans did, the fey instead developed an inhibition towards lying. Whereas the basic foundation of human social relations is our unwillingness to kill each other, the fundamental principle of civilized fairies is that every word they speak is literally true. The only reason they form social groups at all is because of individual self interest, so they treat all relationships as agreements to exchange services.

A major consequence of this is that they are fear and loath the way humans deceive or break previously held obligations. Just as a violation of the human social contract demands retaliation for the sake of survival, so does a violation of the fairies'. Since fairies did not evolve empathy for other individuals, this is much easier for them than us. This may also explain the motive behind changelings, since we can be trusted to care for children that they would prefer taken off their hands in the meantime. As for the human child they swapped out....

Rationalizing other fey behavior is more difficult and are more dependent upon the setting. There are theories that OCD evolved as a way of preventing the spread of disease, so that could apply to them given the strange environment they evolved in. If their magic came from scarce items or repetitive rituals, then that would explain their phillia-like tendencies towards certain activities or items/people they come across. Narcissism could be a consequence of their immortality, where the biological imperative places survival over reproduction. Even their banes against iron or entering someone's house uninvited could be phobias.

The sort of world where such instincts are essential to survival would have to be very chaotic. Granted, the best way to survive in someplace like Wonderland or Night Vale would be to examine every dust speck for danger, take whatever you can possibly store safely, adopt every superstition that previously appeared to be true, take control of everything that will yield to you while avoiding what won't, and trust people no more than absolutely necessary to your own survival.
