Assuming our superconductor is reasonably priced, where "reasonable" is defined as making each example economic...

- Hugely different distribution of energy generation, as we'd have lossless transmission networks
- Far more efficient electric motors
- Mag-lev /everything/ - trains, hoverboards, cars, warehouse pallets...

Basically everything would run on electricity, and there are a bunch of really neat magnetic magic tricks you can pull with superconductors.
