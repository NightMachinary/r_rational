Because I'm the kind of nerd who read Mass Effect's codex, I know that cooling systems would be incredibly useful for space travel. Heat is one of the single biggest engineering limitations for spacecraft since there's no air to carry it away. Warships in ME are designed to hit fast and hard specifically because leaving the combat systems on will cook the crew over time.

As for the neutronium question, I think it's because the material is so ridiculously dense that there are significant engineering problems to building anything out of it. You'd have to handle it almost exclusively with element zero, which is scarce. It's not that neutronium can't be harvested, it's that it's not cost effective to do so until you have something to sell it for.
