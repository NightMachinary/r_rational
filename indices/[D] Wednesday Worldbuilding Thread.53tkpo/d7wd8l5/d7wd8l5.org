Disregarding computing all together, what do you think the world would look like if there was very cheap access to Type-I superconductors? The world I'm creating has some hyper efficient cooling technology. Assume that the world was constructed with the use of superconductors in mind.

(completely unrelated edit: is anyone else /really/ annoyed by the misuse of element zero in Mass Effect. I mean, they cover all of the basics, but in 3000 years of FTL travel no Asari has ever had the curiosity to mine neutronium? They create black holes, and manipulate gravity, and then do /literally nothing/ with this technology.)
