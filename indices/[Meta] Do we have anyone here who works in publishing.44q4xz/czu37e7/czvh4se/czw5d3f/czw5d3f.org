My experience at this point is all on Amazon; I'm just branching out onto other platforms as a test. I've been told that the other platforms (B&N, Smashwords, Oyster, etc) aren't worth bothering with because the audience isn't big enough. Despite that, I want to give it a shot in order to see for myself.

Here is my advice; it's not terribly well organized because I'm looking to get to work ASAP and would rather not do a bunch of editing, but hopefully it's helpful:

There are two ways to make money on Amazon. First is selling the book, obviously. The second is the [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1002872331][Kindle Unlimited]] program, which is effectively a lending library. It costs $10/month and allows you to read as much as you want -- you check out a book, read it, put it back, check out another one, etc. You can have up to 10 books out at a time.

The way authors make money on KU is this:

1. People sign up for a Kindle Unlimited membership.\\
2. When an author publishes something, she can choose to put it in the KU program.
3. A KU member checks out your book and reads it.
4. For every page they read, you get paid half a penny.
5. *Amazon thinks that there are roughly 175 words to a Kindle page.* (This is the only place in their entire system were they are nice to authors, so be grateful.) That means that 5k words is about 28 pages.

Here's the fallout of that:

1. Short form work is worthless. That 15k novella is worth $0.42. Don't bother.
2. Long form is good. A 110k-word novel like [[http://www.amazon.com/The-Two-Year-Emperor-Deor-ebook/dp/B011DQOT74][The Two Year Emperor]] (/shameless_plug) is considered to be 628 pages, so if someone borrows it and reads the whole thing I would get paid $3.14, which is a mathematically pleasing accident. (2YE is not currently in KU, though.)\\
3. /People often don't finish reading something, so don't expect to make that figure./

The downside to being in KU is that Amazon requires exclusivity for KU books, so you can't publish them anywhere else. That includes giving them away on your website, although you /are/ allowed to give away 10% as a teaser. They have scrapers that look for things, so chances are good that they'll eventually find you if you give the book away for free.

Depending on what you're publishing, you'll make 40-60% of your income from KU, so you need to be in it unless you're going wide and publishing with the other shops.

Backmatter is incredibly important. At the end of each book you want to have a section saying "hey, I hope you enjoyed this, here are links to my other things."

I have read but cannot confirm that Amazon tracks number of searches and bumps your ranking if there are a lot of them. Whether or not that's true, it's probably better if your backmatter links are searches instead of direct links. So, instead of:

1. Direct link (do NOT use this form): [[http://www.amazon.com/The-Two-Year-Emperor-Deor-ebook/dp/B011DQOT74]]
2. Search link (DO use this form): [[http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=the+two+year+emperor+storrs&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Athe+two+year+emperor+storrs]]

Amazon's interface bites, so you won't have information that you really want. The solution to this is [[https://www.getbookreport.com/][Book Report]]. If you're publishing on Amazon, you can't afford not to have it, period. It's free unless you're making >$1,000 / month, and Liam (the author) is very responsive, so there's no reason not to. (I'm not affiliated with BR in any way except as a delighted user.)

Covers are critical. You can get them made on [[https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_in=category&source=guest-hp&locale=en&query=ebook+cover&category=3&sub_category=51&page=1&layout=auto][Fiverr]] or you can use a professional. I was going to provide a link to the professional that I've used in the past -- she does /amazing/ work and is very inexpensive -- but her domain name has expired. If I can track her down I'll edit it in.

Keywords are critical. You are given 400 characters divided into up to 7 groups by commas. They all need to be used. Don't use spaces around the commas. Phrases will (I'm pretty sure) be indexed by both the phrase and its component words. Try to think of words that you would use if you were searching for the book. *Do not use names of real people.*

Blurbs are critical. They need to be short, and they need to pull the reader in quickly.

The first ~200 words is important. If someone likes the blurb they'll click on the "Look Inside". They will then be allowed to read the first 10% of the story. They aren't going to read 10%, they're going to read a few paragraphs and then either buy it or not. Those first few paragraphs need to be gripping.

Your first sentence is critical. People these days have the attention span of ADHD goldfish; if your first sentence doesn't grip them they aren't even going to read the few paragraphs mentioned above.

Have a Patreon but don't expect to make money from it.

Broadcast. You're not going to get a lot of sales unless people know you exist. Post on FB, Reddit, etc.

Okay, I'm done for now. Hopefully this is helpful.
