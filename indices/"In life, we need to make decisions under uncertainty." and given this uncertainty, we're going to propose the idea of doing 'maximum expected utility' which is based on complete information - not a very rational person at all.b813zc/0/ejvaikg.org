This isn't a debate-a-rationalist forum, it's a place for a specific genre of fiction.

(As a side note, your argument comes across more as baiting than it does anything insightful; if you're aiming to convince, aim for longer-form, fleshed out arguments that explain your thinking. Even if this was the place for it, you've given very little to discuss.)
