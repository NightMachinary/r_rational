There's a problem with your solution:\\
How many observers can become a Cube at once? Even if it's only one observer, the chain reaction of "get looked on-become Cube-get looked on" still continues, this time leaving an empty void instead of Cube mass.

An additional qualifier for observing entity (like "must also be a sentient, living being") would solve this problem.
