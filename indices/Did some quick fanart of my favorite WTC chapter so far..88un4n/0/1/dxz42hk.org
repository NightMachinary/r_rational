The Look-a-like Cube is the stuff of nightmares. I did not understand it at first, and I thought it /stopped/ being a cube once someone else becomes the cube. This way you don't risk greygooing your planet, you just have and existential game of "you're it" going on.

I'll probably use this in some world, mmh. Thank you for the idea.
