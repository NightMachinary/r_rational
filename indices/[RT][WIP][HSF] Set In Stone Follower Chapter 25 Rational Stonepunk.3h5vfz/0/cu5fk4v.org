At this point, it seems like Allen has played his cards and is along for the ride. He's almost certainly revealed everything he'll tell about Albert's deal and the attack afterwards. Any moves he makes towards his attacker will almost certainly put Allen in a worse position.

I'm not entirely sure why we had such a long conversation with Doctor Sven. Probably Captain Marko or Stateman Urda will figure out a way to weaponize Allen's position.
