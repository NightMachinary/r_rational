I don't have any issue with it, and it definitely makes sense, but the last few chapters have seemed to me to lack a sense of progress. Part of that is that not much time has passed, and part of that is that Allen hasn't really had a chance to get his bearings and his situation isn't really changing, just /intensifying/. This isn't necessarily a problem though, and I'm still really enjoying each new chapter!
