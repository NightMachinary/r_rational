I was trying to use the conversation with Doctor Sven to show growth under stress. In that conversation, there was no real winner or loser, but Allen did make Doctor Sven realize he was assuming too much. Unfortunately, in Doctor Sven's eyes, that realization was of dubious value, and Allen made those points accompanied by physical displays of anger which seemed to support the doctor's overall assessment of the situation.

No spoilers, but Allen's not done yet!
