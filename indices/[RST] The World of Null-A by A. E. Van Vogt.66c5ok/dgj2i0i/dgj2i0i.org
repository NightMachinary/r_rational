That cover blurb always seemed a bit odd to me: "fine for addicts of science fiction". It seems like it's saying, "okay, if you *really* like reading SF, I guess this book is fine, whatever". Googling the phrase, apparently I'm not the only person who thought this, and the 1948 review it was taken from was rather lukewarm, so I'm not sure how this ended up on the cover.

I read the book a couple years ago and didn't dislike it but I found it rather confusing. I felt like the universe wasn't really established: at first it seemed like humanity was in the early stages of colonizing the solar system, but then there's an entire galactic civilization (of humans, I think?) and none of the characters seemed surprised by this so something didn't quite add up and I don't think this was ever addressed.

The Null-A concept seemed critical for understanding the book, but I recall it being almost entirely unexplained. I Googled it, but I'm not sure what people in the 40's were supposed to do.

I also found it tiresome that the hero kept getting captured by the same villains and they kept letting him go. I think this happened 3-5 times in total, mostly associated with the hero infiltrating the same facility over and over.
