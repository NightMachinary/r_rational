I read it basically by mistake when I was about 13 (more than 25 years ago...).

That series (World, Pawns, Three) was my entry into "adult" SF, but let's face it, at the time it was a mindfuck of epic proportions. I followed with and much preferred Van Vogt's other works, especially Slan and Empire of the Atom, etc.

Then I discovered Asimov and it kind of recalibrated my whole perception of the entirety of Van Vogt's corpus.
