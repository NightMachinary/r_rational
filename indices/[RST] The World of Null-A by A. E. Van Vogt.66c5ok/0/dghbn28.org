Has anyone read this? I won't lie - I am massively biased against fiction books > 50 years old, I find "classics" are either so thoroughly ingrained in culture the actual content is pass√©, or that modern re-tellings of the story are superior. The only notable exception I've found is Lovecraft, and even then, at least 50% of his works are garbage (a fact he acknowledged even in his day).

Scifi works date the fastest of all - writing about the future is risky, as advancements may either transform Scifi into historical fiction or make the plot seem silly. I would read /Null-A/ if a few others could vouch for it, but right now it seems like a risky use of my time.
