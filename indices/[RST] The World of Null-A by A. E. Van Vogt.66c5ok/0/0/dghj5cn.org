  I am massively biased against fiction books > 50 years old, I find "classics" are either so thoroughly ingrained in culture the actual content is passé, or that modern re-tellings of the story are superior.

Please feel free to point me toward the /superior/ retellings of /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257][The Three Musketeers]]/, /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/86][A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]/, /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/521][Robinson Crusoe]]/, /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/82][Ivanhoe]]/, etc., that you've found. Also, I find it very hard to believe that /any/ of those works could be considered "passé".
