  Do modern readers enjoy /The Jungle/ or /Uncle Tom's Cabin/?

I haven't read /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/203][Uncle Tom's Cabin]]/, but /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/140][The Jungle]]/ is among my favorite books--I've read it at least three times, IIRC. I also found /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7522][King Coal]]/ (same author, different subject) to be quite interesting.
