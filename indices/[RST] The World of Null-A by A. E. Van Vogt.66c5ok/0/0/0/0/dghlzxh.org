Also, the nice part about older books is you don't have to read the ten thousand bad books. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to even find them. The ones that are still around are still around for a reason.

Reading stories is nice, but the time you spend with a book like Gulliver's Travels or Evalina is like time you're spending with a person 40% smarter than you at their absolute peak. They're also entertaining, but that's almost beside the point.
