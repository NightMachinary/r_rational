Oh I've read /A Connecticut Yankee/, and it's quite good. I'm certain you can enumerate hundreds of older fictions which remain timeless, but for each of those there are 10000 books which did not stand the test of time. Do modern readers enjoy /The Jungle/, /Moby Dick/, or /Uncle Tom's Cabin/? They changed the world sure, but they aren't /good stories/ anymore.
