As a quick rebuttal, I would say that #3 is flawed. It would be like saying that people who enjoy reading books can be easily satisfied by only reading books produced decades ago, so there is no need to write any more books. Art and literature are fields that need a constant influx of creativity and novel ideas to keep up with societal changes as our culture continually changes and grow.

Furthermore, it's also making the unwarranted assumption that artists are machines who produce art with no enjoyment or desire satisfied by the process of creation. Even if consumers would be fine only with currently existing art, the producers would be a group of people who need to make more art to fulfill their needs according to #2, invalidating #4.
