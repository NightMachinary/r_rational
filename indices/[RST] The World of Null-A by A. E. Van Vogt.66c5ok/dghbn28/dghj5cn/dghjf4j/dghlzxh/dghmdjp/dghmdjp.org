  1. Society ought to discourage economically inefficient activities.

  2. If some good /a/ can be created to fill a need, and there is an existing & available good /b/ that fills that need equally well, then it is economically inefficient to use /a/ and not /b/.

  3. Consumers of new art would be equally satisfied by existing art.

  4. By 2 & 3: it is economically inefficient to produce new art.

  âˆ´ By 1 & 4: Society ought to discourage new art.

  In short: old stuff is as good as the new, and it's cheaper; so making new stuff is wasteful.
