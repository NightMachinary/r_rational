I'm actually aware of Gwern's article and it is a large part of my basis of the opposite opinion. I think newer works tend to be higher quality, more well-formed versions of past works. Very little is truly original (if anything is), and that means all artists are either re-mixing older content in new ways or expressions or improving them [or worsening them, but bad books don't generally sell much]). Sure, there are countless past works which are /very good/, but it seems plausible that you could make an even better work, and so we should let that happen.

As a result, newer works tend to supercede older ones, making older works less likely to be worthwhile.
