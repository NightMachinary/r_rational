Yes, I've read Alan Moore's Marvelman (that was still the title in Warrior magazine, which is where I first encountered it.) The title (and lettering on the original stories) was changed to Miracleman for the Eclipse/Pacific reprints and continuation, because they didn't want a legal fight over the name. It ended up in copyright limbo at least twice, for decades.

If it seems like something else? The influence almost certainly goes the other way. It certainly influenced my work - but my interest in it ended with Moore's last issue.

Trivia: Doc Future's first nightmare (not the one in the prologue, the first one chronologically) in Fall of Doc Future was inspired (if that's the right word for pure unadulterated nightmare fuel) by the two-page spread at end of the original Miracleman #15, and Journeyman was based on a character whose abilities were inspired by Aza Chorn. In Maker's Ark chapter 9, Journeyman refers to being afraid he was going to have to "go full warpsmith". That is also a reference to Miracleman #15.
