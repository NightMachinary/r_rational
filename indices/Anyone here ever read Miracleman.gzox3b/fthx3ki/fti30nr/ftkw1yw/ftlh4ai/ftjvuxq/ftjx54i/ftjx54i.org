I've always found the Marvelman/Miracleman name thing thematically interesting. I personally go with Miracleman, partly because it's more familar to me personally, partly because, well, I just like it.

But I do think there's something to be said of the word "Miracle" in regards to motif. A "marvel" generally refers to a feat that's great, but within the abilities of humans. The Hoover Dam is an "engineering marvel."

A miracle, though, that's something /beyond/ humanity.
