The first book in the Children of Time series, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25499718-children-of-time][Children of Time]] is pretty good for this, with a particularly interesting alien biology and culture.

The second book in the series, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40376072-children-of-ruin][Children of Ruin]] blows it out of the park though with both alien biology, culture /and/ psychology. I was both satisfied and fascinated when I fully understood the degree and the complete details of their uniqueness.

Fair warning though, these books take place on planets with earth-analogue lifeforms. Whilst you won't be impressed by their apparent forms, you'll certainly be impressed by the thought and care that that went into their differentiating physiology.

Also, in-case you're spoiler averse, the summary/blurb of the second book spoils the ending of the first book.
