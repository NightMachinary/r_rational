[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war][A Hero's War]] is about a second Isekai hero that accidentally gets summoned into the world. Instead of leveling up and going off to fulfill the Prophecy that'll save the world, he spends ages trying to set up blast furnaces or reinvent canning. It's a magitech world so for example it turns out that it's cheaper and easier to pasteurize food with Death Magic fields than heating things up.

I should caution that I'm not a huge fan, but I think that's because I can't enjoy the genre. IMO it compares very favorably to Delinquency Record for example.
