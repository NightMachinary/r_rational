After reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-delinquency-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.788149/][Delinquency Record]], [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TX1SJKF][The Dragon's Banker]], [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O2NDJ2M][Orconomics]] and Max Gladstone's [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUG3DLM/][Craft Sequence]], I've got a hankering for rational(ish) books about economics and business in fictional settings. Anyone have recommendations along those lines?
