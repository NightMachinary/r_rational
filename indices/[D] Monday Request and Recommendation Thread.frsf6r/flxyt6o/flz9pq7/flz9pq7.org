[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/reader][Polyhister Academy]] has a strong premise, essentially a magical school with relatively unlimited resources, but only a small percentage of students are allowed to graduate alive after four years. Three+ overlapping magic systems, plus technoscience, and each student has their own specialties. NSFW stuff might put one off.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/even-further-beyond-complete.45951/][Even Further Beyond]] also has an interesting premise. A chosen one, selected by prophecy, is soon to be born. Legends say that the chosen one will need to overcome a powerful foe, their dark mirror. The protagonist of the quest isn't the chosen one, but the dark mirror, and must figure out how to deal with the chosen one.
