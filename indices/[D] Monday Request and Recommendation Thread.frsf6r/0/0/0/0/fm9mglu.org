I checked out "Mirror Mirror", and I agree with you on how blatantly bad the science is. However, I kept reading to the end because it's actually one of the better HP/Avengers crossovers I've seen. I like that the author highlighted the unique strengths and skillsets of the MC universe characters enough for them to actually give Harry a run for his money. It was refreshing in comparison to the typical OP!Harry steamroll plotline.
