  I haven't seen or read Seikirei and haven't decided if that's going to stop me yet

That's kinda what I meant - I'm not super familiar with either fandom, and the story on its own did a poor job of getting me to care about any of the characters (unlike, say, Kaleidoscope). I think it'd be a better story for someone who brings in some of those emotional attachments.

  Interestingly the "Death Code" in cells is a real thing, though I'm pretty sure they misunderstood how it works.

Well yeah that's why I said the "superhero science" is so very wrong - it's kinda like someone trying to make super-science out of half-remembered dreams of high school biology.
