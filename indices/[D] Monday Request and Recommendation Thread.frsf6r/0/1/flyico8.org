Depends what you are into my friend! One i have really enjoyed recently is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]], which is a HP fanfic but also... not really? It's not really rational, or rational adjacent, but it is a very good read. Its premise is about an american girl in the HP universe taking place about 2012 or so and the world building of what constitutes the american magical community is awesome. Very much popcorn reading, but very enjoyable. Sadly, I feel like its a dead fic, but! Not to worry too much because the person writing it didn't do it chapter by chapter but by books with 4 written right now (each about 170 tho words, and each doing the classic harry potter thing of a book per year). Cant recommend enough, thoroughly enjoyed them, and I have more fanfic recs if you are interested
