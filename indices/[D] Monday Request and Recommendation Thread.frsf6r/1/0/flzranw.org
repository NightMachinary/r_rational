- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/][My Hero School Adventure is All Wrong, as Expected]]: MHA / OreGairu crossover in which the main character has the ability to copy 1/108th of other people's abilities.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27872/confessions-of-the-magpie-wizard][Confessions of the Magpie Wizard]]: the main character has a special ability that allows him to copy any spell he's seen for about a day. However, it doesn't really come up much. He does have to analyze other people's powers to win in conflicts though.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30216/headpats][Headpats]]: slice-of-life Worm crackfic. Taylor's power is now "touch parahuman, generate literal little sister version of them (with their power)". Headpats ensue.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29145/creep][Creep]]: kinda like Super Minion actually, except the main character is just a normal dude who has super biology powers.
