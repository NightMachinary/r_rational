There are two quests that are explicitly rat!quests.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death]]: Naruto quest in which the player character starts out as a missing nin, and things go sideways from there.

[[https://chaossnek.com/Story][Legacy of the Goddess]]: A soon-to-resume quest that is a crossover between The Legend of Zelda and [[https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere][something else]](Do not click unless you wish for the spoilers). It's relatively early in the quest, and it will be ran on Reddit when it resumes.

Both quests are exceptionally well written and I do not wish to spoil either more than that.
