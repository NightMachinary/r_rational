*BEASTARS* is an anime adaptation that is /holy shit/ amazing. Top tier characters, CG animation, directing, everything. Raw exploration of themes about nature vs nurture, racism, and deviance. Haru is Best Character. Watch this show.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/heir-of-the-bruce-battletech-dynasty-quest.334983/][*Bruce Quest*]] is a rather cool Spacebattles quest of the Battletech franchise where you play as Rhiannon The Bruce, Duchess of the planet of Somerset, who has recently inherited the title after the death of her parents when they fight off rogue Ronin from the Draconis Combine. I binged this entire thing over the course of like four days, it gets a lot of quest fundamentals very right. The competence porn I get from watching Rhiannon (and much of the cast) is a big factor, on top of the satisfying progression of Rhi rocketing up the skill ladders of politicking and administration and soldiering and piloting. It doesn't quite reach my highest echelon, and there a few aspects that dim my enjoyment a bit, but it is still quite solid and an easy recommendation.
