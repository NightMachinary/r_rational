Yeah I've tried to read Creep twice and dropped it both times, there are a lot of issues with it that bother me. The MC is far too "edgy", he's the only one that knows/acknowledges how fake and evil the world is and he loves to tell that to heroes. No one acts like a real human being. There's also something wrong with the writing in general to me, I think the pacing and scene transitions are off putting to me.
