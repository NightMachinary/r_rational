Looking for recommendations on stories in which the protagonist improves by analyze or absorb enemy abilities. Known stories include:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion/][Super Minion]]: which I love and would love to read more like it.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22115/i-dont-want-to-be-the-hive-queen/][I don't want to be a hive queen]]: meh execution but the idea is cool and I would love to read more stories with a protag hive queen
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/manager-worm.280060/][Manager]]: wormfic, not enough character for me.
- [[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/][Heretical Edge]]: Lot of good character but the entire ability stealing thing isn't really in focus
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13933635/][From Muddy Waters]]: MHA, interesting characterization but the focus isn't quite where I'd like it.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20568/tree-of-aeons-an-isekai-story][Tree of Aeon]]: kind of good exploration but not enough character.
