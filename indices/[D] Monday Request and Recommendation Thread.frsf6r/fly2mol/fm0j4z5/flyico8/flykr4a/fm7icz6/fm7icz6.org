I wouldn't call AQ "popcorn reading", for me that denotes a story where the author writes what they find funny in the moment. AQ was written more like a traditional book, the author wrote the entire story before publishing it chapter by chapter. That means stuff like foreshadowing, pacing, character development are handled /much/ more competently than in basically any other fanfics.
