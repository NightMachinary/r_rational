I've read a few of these because, you know, /world events/, and here's my thoughts, vaguely in recommendation order:

- Seventh Horcrux: a really great time. Very quotable, even. It's a comedy crackfic of the highest caliber - it gives both itself and its source material exactly as much respect as they deserve, which is sometimes quite a lot (and is sometimes not any at all)
- Sanitize: honestly this doesn't even need to be a Naruto fanfic. It's just so good. Would probably be at the top of the list if it was complete.
- Kaleidoscope: also great, but very edgy in the way you'd expect the internal life of a child soldier to be. Loses some of that edge in parts 2 and 3, but only some; this is the sort of story that gets so dark it brightens back up again.
- Imago of Rust and Crimson: I have to admit I'm not very familiar with the White Wolf settings so I have no idea what's going on with that side of things, but if this was listed as a Worm / Silent Hill crossover I would have 100% believed it. Great so far but I haven't finished yet.
- Postnuptial Disagreements: well written and it's interesting to put a monogamist into the battle harem genre, but I don't feel like the story itself does enough to make me care for the characters. I ended up dropping it at exactly the midpoint; if you're more in to the source materials you might like it more.
- Mirror Mirror: I just couldn't understand this "Master of Death"!Harry. Also, the superhero science was just so very wrong. Gave up after a couple of chapters.
