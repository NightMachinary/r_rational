Having read all of these except Postnuptial Disagreements (I haven't seen or read Seikirei and haven't decided if that's going to stop me yet, I agree with all of your points. Especially Mirror Mirror, though I would also note fairly common pluralisation grammar issues. Interestingly the "Death Code" in cells /is/ a real thing, though I'm pretty sure they misunderstood how it works.
