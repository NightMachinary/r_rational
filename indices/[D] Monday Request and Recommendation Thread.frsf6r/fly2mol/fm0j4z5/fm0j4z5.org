*Top Picks - Standalone*:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] (*Harry Potter*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Long*}: Voldemort is reborn as Harry Potter, and this time he can finally satisfy his hearts desire, becoming a Hogwarts Professor. One of, if not the best comedy fanfic I've ever read.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][Birds of a Feather]] (*Harry Potter*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Very Very Long*}: In the late 1930s an orphaned Voldemort and a young Hermoine Granger meet for the first time, and the course of wizarding history is radically changed. A great what-if, exploring what would happen if one of the greatest magical talents met one of the greatest magical minds. Each character is very believable and their intelligence is realistically depicted imo. (Note while there is a slow burn romance it does not overshadow the plot, and is handled tastefully. It's only really relevant and after the two have known each other for much longer)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]] (*Harry Potter*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Long*}: What happens when a someone exceedingly familiar with HP and Evil Overlord tropes, ends up reborn as a voice in a young Tom Riddle's head? A great vehicle for exploring just how much further Tom could have gone with a guiding hand and some timely foreknowledge.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12539731/1/Kaleidoscope][Kaleidoscope]] (*Naruto*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Long*}: An SI ends up reborn as an Uchiha. One of the best explorations of how easily one might be twisted by being raised as a magical child soldier with the foreknowledge of just how badly things are likely to go for you. Dark but not grimdark. Note: This fic is composed of three volumes. While I loved all three, I'm only recommend the first here.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize][Sanitize]] (*Naruto*) [*IN PROGRESS*] {*Medium*}: A medical student is reborn into the Warring Clans Era as a civilian and their innovations are capable of revolutionsing the Ninja Medical World. This is a smaller scale fic than my other recommendations but I think the message is powerful and the subject matter handled beautifully.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][Fargo]] (*Puella Magi Madoka Magica*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Very Long*}: An American magical girl gets involved in what seems to be a Kyuubey plot. One of my favorite Madoka fics for the the way it explores the lives and neuroses of magical girls. I'm a big fan of the world it paints, it's complex carefully designed plot and it's loveable unlikeable characters. Also has a sequel I highly recommend.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To The Stars]] (*Puella Magi Madoka Magica*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Very Very Long*}: A phenomenal exploration of the possible sociocultural development of magical girls and their impact on culture and tech the world at large in the far future. I would recommend this one for the sheer scale of the worldbuilding alone. I need to point out however, that this is a serial with a capital S. It takes full advantage of the freedoms of longform fiction and does not mind taking it's time to establish world and character. It has multiple plotlines running simultaneously and gives each detailed focus.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-othersiders-worm-au-altpower-undersiders.362090/][The Othersiders]] (*Worm*) [*COMPLETE/ABANDONED*] {*Long*}: Taylor and the (AU) Undersiders have different power sets and their tactics have a much heavier emphasis on misdirection. One thing I really enjoyed about Worm was it's focus on image and leveraging expectations. This fic is all about using facades intelligently.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7197056/1/Three-Families][Three Families]] (*Avatar*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Very Very Long*}: Three Families have a vested interest in the avatar, we follow their stories. Two of the families are cannon, one is OC and really helps illustrate the care the author has put into expanding the Avatar universe. The writing is great, the plot is great, I heavily recommend.

​

*Top Picks - Crossovers:*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10820443/1/An-Imago-of-Rust-and-Crimson][An Imago of Rust and Crimson]] (*Worm x World of Darkness*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Very Long*}: My favorite worm fic by far. Taylor triggers with a particularly spooky ability that comes with some psychological baggage, no stations of canon here. A great AU that effectively merges the grimdark traditional rpg setting World of Darkness and the Worm universe.
- [[https://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover%29][Maybe I'm a Lion]] (*Tsukihime x Prototype*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Very Very Long*}: One of my favorite fics. What happens when grimdark magic meets a superpowered bioweapon? A long and slow crossover with excellent integration, great writing and wonderful hype buildup. A basic understanding about both settings is highly recommended.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8642442/1/Variant-Strain][Variant Strain]] (*Spiderman x Prototype*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Very Long*}: Another interesting prototype cross. Our friendly neighbourhood spiderman gets a totally new origin story courtesy of our favorite bioweapon. Yet another masterful mix of two worlds. Old foes in new forms and some delicious worldbuilding. The writing, plotting and pacing of this are all excellent and it's even completed!
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1099236/chapters/2211681][In the Shadow of Gods]] (*Mass Effect x Halo*) [*INCOMPLETE*] {*Medium*}: Master Chief meets Shepherd. First contact done well. Short but worth it alone for the interactions.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904733/1/Man-off-the-Moon][Man off the Moon]] (*Mass Effect x Fate/Stay*) [*IN PROGRESS*] {*Very Very Long*}: Shirou ends up in the Mass Effect universe and goes through Space Boot Camp™ with a young Shepherd. A great look into how our favorite Magus would fare in a world of biotics and futuristic tech. A *V*ery *L*ong *R*ead with suprisingly consistent quality.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements][Postnuptial Disagreements]] (*Sekirei x Fate/Stay*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Medium*}: A stuffy magus finds himself in an anime style harem battle royale "death" game. No harem here though. The real focus is on how a magus, brought up on stories of a much more ruthless battle royale death game, handles this one. Standard tropes are played with in fun ways thanks to the natural predisposition of our sheltered haughty magi protagonist. A standard crossover with excellent characterisation and praiseworthy writing.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8275548/1/Mirror-Mirror][Mirror Mirror]] (*Avengers x Harry Potter*) [*COMPLETE*] {*Medium*}: Shield wants the magic man. A great look into how a (semi-)professional superhero outfit with varying skillsets would match up against a standard "Master of Death"!Harry. Has a tight focus on the first contact interactions between Shield members themselves and with a skilled Harry Potter.
