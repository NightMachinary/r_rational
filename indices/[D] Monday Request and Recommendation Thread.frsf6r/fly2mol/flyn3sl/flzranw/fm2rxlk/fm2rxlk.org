  My Hero School Adventure is All Wrong, as Expected: MHA / OreGairu crossover in which the main character has the ability to copy 1/108th of other people's abilities.

  If you were to ask me whether I liked dogs, I would probably have to say that I didn't. I wouldn't particularly say that I disliked them, either; they were just a category of animal that I had never held any special affection for. Before you say that dogs are amazing because they provide unlimited amounts of love and affection, I acknowledge that this is the case. However, since I already have a little sister, owning a dog would be superfluous.
