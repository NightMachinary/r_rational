recently I got sent a serial called [[https://www.scribblehub.com/series/101817/an-ordinary-novel-but-every--words-the-audience-kills-the-least-interesting-character/][/An ordinary novel but every 10,000 words the audience kills the least interesting character/]] (also available [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31185/an-ordinary-novel-but-every-10000-words-the-audience][on Royal Road]]), which is basically exactly what it says on the tin. It's a bit early to conclusively say whether or not it's good, but it updates with a 1,000 word chapter every day and I think that given its interactive nature it would benefit from more readers; I've certainly found it engaging, funny, and well-produced so far. It's not rational fiction by design, but it's got its moments (such as the characters deducing the nature of the in-story counter), and for people who liked /Game By God/ this might scratch that same itch somewhat
