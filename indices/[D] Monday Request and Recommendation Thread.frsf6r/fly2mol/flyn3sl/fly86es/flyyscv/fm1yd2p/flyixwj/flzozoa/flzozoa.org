Thanks to the Coronavirus, there's a bunch on books on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/frp5dw/its_time_62_authors_144_books_all_at_099099_with/][sale]] right now from March 30th to 31st until 12 am April 1st! Hurry, all of them are for only a dollar each!

Below are books that I recognize here from previous recommendations:

Most important/recognizable to people who are part of the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community are the books by [[https://andrewkrowe.wordpress.com/2020/03/30/sales-free-books-and-status-updates/][Andrew Rowe]]. [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NKBSZGF][Six Sacred Swords]] are only a dollar, [[https://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Broken-Mirrors-Book-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/][Forging Divinity]] is free, and he's writing a quest, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/spider-climb-a-jrpg-style-dungeon-crawl-in-the-arcane-ascension-weapons-and-wielders-universe.63681/][Spider Climb]], which is setting in the Arcane Ascensions universe which is like having another book to read for free. He writes some good dungeon delving/adventuring/magic school shenanigans.

Sarah Lin with [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W9J75R3?tag=][Street Cultivation]] with a novel financial-like take on cultivation, and [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PHMHLLP?ref_=series_rw_dp_labf][New Game Minus]] (books 2 and 3 only are on sale) where an NPC mage becomes a PC warrior.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PHNQGRX?ref_=series_rw_dp_labf][The Dao of Magic]] (book 1 and 2) by Andrew Louws where an exiled cultivator is sent to a magical world devoid of qi and needs to rebuild his power from the bottom again.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PHPLHX5?ref_=series_rw_dp_labf][Mage Errant]] (book 2 and 3) by John Bierce about a small group of student-mages who no one can train are taken in by a mysterious teacher who thinks he can solve their problems.

Also, Bryce O'Conner's books, [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074C9LJT4?searchxofy=true&ref_=dbs_s_aps_series_rwt][Wings of War]], are also on sale, but due to reddit reasons, he isn't allowed to include his own books in the post as the original poster of the sale.

There's plenty more great books by authors that haven't been posted to here before and deserve to be read!

PS If the Coronavirus puts you in the mood for some books about being quarantined or about disease, John Bierce has a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/fjmp4z/in_which_i_offer_quarantine_reading_suggestions/][list]] of excellent books that I would second my recommendations for. Just note that unlike the above, this isn't a set of books on sale, just recommendations.
