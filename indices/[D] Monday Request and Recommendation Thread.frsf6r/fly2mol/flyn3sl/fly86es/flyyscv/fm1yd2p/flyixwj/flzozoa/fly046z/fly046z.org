Recent additions to my in-progress manga collection (not rational) :

- [[https://mangadex.org/title/10049/mozuya-san-gyakujousuru][Mozuya-san goes on a rampage]] A little girl suffers from Joseph Tsundere's bipolar personality disorder. Comedic/Psychological/Dark/SoL. Absolutely gut bustingly hilarious. You will get a LOT of suspicious looks if you try to read this in public though.
- [[https://mangadex.org/title/31792/mieruko-chan][Meizuko-chan]] Meizuko sees horrific spirits; tries to ignore them. Comedy/Drama/Horror/Slice of Life. I was kind of iffy on this one to begin with, but the fantastic art kept me going.
- [[https://mangadex.org/title/17019/kakushigoto][Kakushigoto]] Single father tries to hide his employment as a manga artist from his young daugher (on account of writing a rather infamous manga based around dirty jokes.) Comedy/SoL.

I've been less invested in my usual action/adventure/fantasy/sci-fi manga recently and more into SoL. Either current events have made me long for simpler times, or I'm finally growing up. (Or I'm just burnt out on generic isekais, which doesn't leave me much to read in my traditional genre wheelhouse these days.)
