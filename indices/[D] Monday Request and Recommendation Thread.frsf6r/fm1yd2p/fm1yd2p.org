Looking for something light and at least moderately rational. Mother Of Learning, Wake Of The Ravager, or Unsong would work, but I've read those.

"Light" means funny, easy to read, low stakes. Normally I prefer the protagonist to be dragged through hell, but Ward is about to hit its final arc so I've got enough of that, and also there's a global pandemic.
