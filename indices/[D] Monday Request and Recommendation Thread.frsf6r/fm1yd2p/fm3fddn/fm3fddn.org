Here are some recs ordered in decreasing amounts of levity.

[[https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Hyouka][Hyouka]], a LN about the establishment and operation of a detective mystery club set in a high school setting. This is a pretty rational read with some very low stakes and some fun mysteries.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863641/1/The-Optimised-Wish-Project][The Optimised Wish Project]], a fanfic that does an excellent job of building a rational vision of it's fiction (Dragon Ball). It balances the traditional levity of a Dragon Ball episode with the pursuit of rationalist ideals well.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28307/the-zombie-knight-saga][The Zombie Knight Saga]], my second favorite serial, is about a guy who ends up allied with a grim reaper. I thought the banter between characters was pretty funny. Fair warning though, themes of depression and suicide are explored but I feel like they're handled in a positive way. I think the author did a great job with the setting and abilities. The story is at least rational-adjacent.

[[https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/dungeon-defense-toc/][Dungeon Defense]], my favorite LN, is about a guy who ends up transported to his favorite game on hardcore mode, I really like MC's voice and his strategies and deductions are often rational. The setting is revealed to be suprisingly deep as the volumes unfold. Note: Almost every character's backstory involves a real raw deal but the plot treats them well. Stakes do escalate to a potential total war scenario but the focus is almost always on characters trying to outwit each other. Discontinued after 5 volumes.
