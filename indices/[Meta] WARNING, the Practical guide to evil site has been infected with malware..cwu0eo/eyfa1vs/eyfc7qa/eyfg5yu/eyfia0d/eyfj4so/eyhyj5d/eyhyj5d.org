Anecdotally: it didn't pierce my filter bubble, because I mostly read US news, and it looks like the story didn't hit the English-speaking press until after I had already checked the news for the day.

Speaking more generally: If you link to the news, you both help pierce other people's filter bubbles, provide a resource where people can go to learn more, and you refresh your own knowledge of the news.

Anyways, here's a detail-full news article, for people who have yet to read about it: [[https://thehackernews.com/2019/08/retadup-botnet-malware.html]]

I don't think this malicious .doc file is related to the RETADUP network, because: 1. VirusTotal [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cwu0eo/meta_warning_the_practical_guide_to_evil_site_has/eyfc7qa/][initially reported]] that no antivirus detected the .doc file as malicious, which would not be the case for a known virus 2. The server hosting the .doc is located in .ru netspace, not in France or the USA, which is the case with RETADUP's known command-and-control infrastructure.

But those are weak assertions.
