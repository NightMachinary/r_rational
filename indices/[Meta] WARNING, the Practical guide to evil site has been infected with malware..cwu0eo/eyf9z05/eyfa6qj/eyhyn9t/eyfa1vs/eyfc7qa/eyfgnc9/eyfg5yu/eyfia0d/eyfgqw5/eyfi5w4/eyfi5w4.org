I care less about attribution and more about:

1. taking down the malware server
2. securing affected accounts
3. restoring compromised sites

It doesn't look like any of the attacks from today's WordFence compromise list [[https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/08/malicious-wordpress-redirect-campaign-attacking-several-plugins/]] so I'm guessing someone guessed EE's password.

Always use unique per-site passwords, and enable 2FA when possible.
