I don't know if this is a well known piece of malware, but googling the phrase "tragic news about the site operator" gives links to [[http://www.beststoryinevertold.com/][this website]] which seems to have been infected by the same thing - same link, same text, same warnings apply. Nothing else turns up with that exact phrase, and I'm not familiar enough with Wordpress history in order to know if something similar has happened to other blogs in the past.
