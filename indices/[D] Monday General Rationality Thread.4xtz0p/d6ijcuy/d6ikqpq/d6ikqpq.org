I just call that living \ functioning on autopilot (if I'm understanding you correctly, of course). When your brain thinks it has seen the same situation often enough to not waste additional energy on analysing it. In simplest (and more acceptable, IMO) cases this can be about things like walking down a familiar street, cleaning the house, etc. But it can also spread onto things like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8][learning new material]] or supposedly putting your beliefs and opinions to test in a debate with another person. “Supposedly” because you're not really testing anything, if you're debating on autopilot --- you're just engaged in the debate for the sake of engagement itself (maybe it makes you feel nice and clever).

Strangely enough, this state is not the same as what Alan Watts (Zen?) advises as “living in the present” (correct me for a better term if you know one), because even though in both cases you're maintaining a non-verbal state of mind, in one case you're still deliberately keeping your mind actively investigating your surroundings while in another your present just gets lost from your life in the [[http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Fast_Travel_%28Skyrim%29][“fast travel mode”.]]
