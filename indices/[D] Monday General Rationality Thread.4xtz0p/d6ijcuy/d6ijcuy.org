I've noticed something interesting about human awareness. Or my awareness, at least.

It might be hard to explain, so bear with me.

Did you ever noticed that you could live without actually having complex thoughts, only by... /reacting/, for lack of a better word? I'm not talking about routinely performed actions, such as to walking to work or changing your clothes. I'm talking about all actions and events.

In this thoughtless state, if anything at all happens, you don't /think/ about what you should do, don't formulate the situation as a problem in order to analyze and solve it; instead, a list of possible courses of actions flashes through your mind, and then you /feel/ which one you like the most, and go with that. This list consist of various cached thoughts, instinctive reactions and socially expected behaviour.

It dulls situational awareness, creative problem-solving and empathy-related abilities. As example, if you argue in this state with someone, you don't truly think about the opponent's arguments, don't contemplate his/her state of mind in order to tailor your counterarguments; you just answer with what first comes to mind. Or if you need to solve a mathematical problem, you look at it, try to solve by systematically using algorithms you've used in the past on similar-looking problems; if all fail, you stare at the problem blankly, and then go seek help. You don't experiment with it, don't try to understand it.

Now that I wrote it, it sounds similiar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29#Components][The Flow]] in a few ways: concentration on the present, check; merging of action and awareness, check; loss of reflective self-consciousness, check. Only instead of increasing performance, it decreases it, and instead of giving sense of control, it takes it away.

And I have a suspicion that many people live their lives almost perpetually stuck in that state.

Did that made sense? Have you ever experinced it/heard about it? Does it have a name?
