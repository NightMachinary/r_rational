How long do you think it will take for machine learning algorithms to take over the regular diagnosis that physicians do? Obviously it's in its infancy currently, but the core of diagnosis is matching up a bunch of symptoms (inputs) with diagnosis (outputs). The problem is the sheer volume of possible inputs and outputs. But, given the exponential nature of computing advancements, could this outcome be closer than you'd think it to be?
