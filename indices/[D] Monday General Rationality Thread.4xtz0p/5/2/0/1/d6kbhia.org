That's what people always say, except for the experts. A Google Brain dude on an AMA recently broke it down:

- If by "AI" you mean scifi AI, the answer is never.

- If instead you mean "any task with a differentiable/sub-differentiable loss function to act as a supervision signal in a continuous space of function approximators", which applies to tasks like object recognition and machine translation and so forth, the answer is, "Yesterday".

How long before I can phrase the designs for something fucking dangerous? Ehhhh, I can already imagine them now, but give it 8-10 years to have all the major conceptual issues worked out.
