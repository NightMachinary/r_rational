I read something by DataPacRat (I believe) where he showed off a table that claimed, following current trends, we'd see computer chips reaching about the computational density as the human brain in 2042, with similar numbers for hard drives. I figured that made as good of a "best case" scenario as any, so I tacked on another 17 years to my estimate to account for optimism bias and because 2060 is a nice round number. And we'd be getting GAI around that timeframe one way or another, because if all else failed we'd be simulating the human brain.
