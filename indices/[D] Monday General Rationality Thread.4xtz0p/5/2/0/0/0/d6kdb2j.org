  if all else failed we'd be simulating the human brain.

If it were that simple we'd be doing it already.

From [[http://hplusmagazine.com/2009/04/07/brain-chip/][this article]], a computer that simulates the human brain would need 3.2 petabytes of memory. To run in real-time, it would need a speed of 38 petaflops. Now, that's from h-plus magazine, which is notoriously optimistic, but even so.

The current world's fastest computer has a speed of 93 petaflops. And petabyte-sized datasets are practically routine in Big Data circles - Google's largest data centres push into the exabytes.

Yet the most complex brain we've simulated is a nematode worm's. Clearly, raw computer power isn't the only factor.
