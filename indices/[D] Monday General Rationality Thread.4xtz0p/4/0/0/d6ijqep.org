I only rarely get hiccoughs. Whenever it came up in conversation, I used to mention that I had a trick to curing it that worked ~50% of the time and had never failed to work within 3 attempts.

That trick was to hold my breath and do some sort of calculations to distract myself. Usually I'd just enumerate the members of an arithmetic or geometric progression (e.g. 7, 14, 21, 28, ...; or 4, 16, 64, 256, ...), but really any task that requires actual thought would work.

In one of these conversations, a friend told me that I was overcomplicating it. What mattered was that you take a deep breath, and then take a further small breath (the latter should be uncomfortable, since your lungs are already mostly full).

I've only had one opportunity to test it since then, and it worked perfectly. I was actually somewhat surprised. Obviously, the sample size is poor even for an anecdote, but I'd still recommend trying that specific variant of the "hold your breath" cure, at least once.
