In [[http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Hi-no-Tori/Vol-002?id=196537][one of the books in Osamu Tezuka's /Phoenix/ manga]], he posits a future in which humanity has declined to the point where there are five cities left on Earth, each with about a million citizens.

Each is managed by a "supercomputer" (which seems to be a hollywood version of an FAI, I think) which acts as an executive, has final say in any new laws proposed, decides the fate and life choices of each citizen, etc. Needless to say, this is not remotely rational.

However, the biggest problem is that when the protagonist and his girlfriend are escaping from one city (Yamato) to another (Lengud), the Yamato AI contacts the Lengud AI. The Yamato AI demands that they be extradited from Lengud, but the Lengud AI disagrees.

The two AI then agree to nuclear war, and annihilate each other (the other three cities also explode, but this is never explained, and probably only happens to advance the plot).

There are many, many irrational things in this work, but I wanted to concentrate on this specific thing. Why would or wouldn't this happen?

Edit: "from" Lengud, not "to" Lengud.
