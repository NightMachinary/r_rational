As I mentioned on Friday, I've been using Chrome extension Crackbook [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crackbook/nbgjmohekjolcgemlolblankocjlgalf?hl=en][(link)]] [[http://github.com/gintas/crackbook][(source)]] which provides a splash page to websites of your choosing.

I've applied it to Facebook, Reddit, Sufficient Velocity, SpaceBattles, and The Old Reader. Overall, I've found that the trivial inconvenience involved in visiting my favorite time-wasting websites has been a good help. Spending a few seconds on the splash screen has caused me to think "should I really be checking facebook right now?" and close the tab. Although I'd prefer being forced to press a button, this does a good job of keeping me more on task. It was especially helpful in the morning when I traditionally have trouble getting into my working flow.

I also like that if I really want to, I can still unwind and take a break; now, though, it's always a deliberate action. Also, since it's just a timer, I don't have to disable it to take a break. This extension remains enabled the whole time, so it's unlikely I'll turn it off then forget to turn it on. I recommend it.
