  Now that I wrote it, it sounds similiar to The Flow in a few ways: concentration on the present, check; merging of action and awareness, check; loss of reflective self-consciousness, check. Only instead of increasing performance, it decreases it, and instead of giving sense of control, it takes it away.

I think they are the same state of mind, just applied in very different ways... playing sports or an playing instrument, or doing martial art all involve applying skills that have been worked into muscle reflex and rote memory. Thus entering into a reactionary state can be beneficial and useful because it lets you react faster, without thoughts or hesitation slowing you down...

I don't have any particular evidence for this, but for my own anecdote... I played piano from 3rd grade to my Freshman year of high school, and for recitals, or the Christmas music that I played yearly, I would have the song down well enough to automatically play it. I did Karate throughout high school... overall, doing a Kata, I might think about specific portions that I need to get right, but overall I would be in a automatic state... for sparring, at least as I got better, I would react automatically, and only occasionally think to practice or plan a specific technique/move/thing I needed to work on.
