Nope, as OutOfNiceUsernames pointed out above, it's two quite different albeit similarly-looking things: autopilot (what I was talking about) and mindfulness (what you're talking about).

In fact, autopilot is an opposite of mindfulness, of sorts. Mindfulness is about self-control and absence of regrets, while living on autopilot assures that you /will/ feel miserable/break to pieces if it seems like you're supposed to, and it won't even occur to you to do anything about that.
