My gaming group managed to take down one of the "big bosses" in our campaign. Well, we managed to take down a little demon creature that was well beyond our level, and the DM told us afterwords it was basically like "Kicking down the big bosses door and killing them, at level 3".

So the boss is a little flying demon-like caster. It summoned minions, and those were what we were supposed to deal with. Or we were supposed to run away, I'm unclear.

Instead, we /grabbed/ the flying guy, while our cleric cast luck on the one holding it. In pathfinder, grappling is based on CMB, which is entirely class-defined. Being small and agile makes you harder to grab the first time, but doesn't give you any advantages when someone's actually got you in their grip. So we did that for a while, tying it up.

Then we used the coup de gras rules, which says something like "You get an automatic critical hit, if attack doesn't kill opponent, opponent, opponent must make fortitude roll of higher then damage or die instantly".

All in all, a pretty good execution of tactics. Just grab the tiny flying caster, hold it down, and kill it.
