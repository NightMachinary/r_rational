There's the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/valentinesromance][Romance in Rational Fiction]] threads. If it's rational fiction to do with sex, then it probably was recommended there at least once.

If you are wondering why there isn't a thread for 2020, I don't think we did one this year. I think everyone forgot about it....
