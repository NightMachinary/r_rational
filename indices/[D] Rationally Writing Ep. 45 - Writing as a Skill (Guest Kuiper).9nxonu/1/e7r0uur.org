I've been having a great time play-by-post role playing in Discord to keep my writing skills fresh while I haven't had much time for actual fiction writing (damn you, grad school *shakes fist at heavens*). I don't suppose you would be interested in starting a RW Discord for people to RP in? If you want, I can set it up and do the modding.
