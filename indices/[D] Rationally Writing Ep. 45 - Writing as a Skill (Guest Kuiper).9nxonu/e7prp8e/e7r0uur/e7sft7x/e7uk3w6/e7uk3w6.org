This subreddit [[https://discord.gg/5sutD3W][has a Discord]], which has #looking_for_group, where you /might/ be able to find some people to play with. I'm the admin there, so can help set up a channel or whatever you'd want.

I [[https://discord.gg/PMeRkNF][also have my own Discord]], and would be fine setting up a channel for you there if you want to find players or play a game.

(You'd probably have more luck with the first option, given that server population is 3-4 times as high.)
