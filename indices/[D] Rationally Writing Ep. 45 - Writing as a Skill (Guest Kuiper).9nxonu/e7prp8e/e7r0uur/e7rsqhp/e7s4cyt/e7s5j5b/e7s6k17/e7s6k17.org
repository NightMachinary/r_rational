That idea certainly makes sense, and I think it can be useful for people who are trying to change their writing. Actually, I think it might be useful for /not/ changing your writing in strategic ways.

To explain that point a bit more, I think that when people are engaging in critique, including self-critique, there tends to be a lot of focus on, "Here's the parts that could be better," and less focus on, "Here are the parts that I think are good." If you're just looking for things to change to improve as a writer, this sort of makes sense, but the real risk here is that you might throw out the baby with the bathwater -- you could fix a bunch of mistakes, but in the process lose a lot of the attributes of your writing that were actually good.

I think this happens most commonly with things that are difficult to articulate or describe. "Voice" is a common one. I've seen some novice writers that have a very distinctive voice that is just plain fun to read. Then, after embarking on a journey of self-improvement, they come across as someone who's trying to sound impressive, while losing some of the earnestness that made their writing so appealing in the first place. I think the "rhythm" and "flow" that you describe could also be an example of this. They're things that are undeniably part of what makes certain kinds of writing enjoyable, but they're difficult to put your finger on, and there's a real risk that someone, in the conscious cultivation of other skills, could lose the things about their writing that are "naturally" good.

I think there's value to finding things in your writing that are in need of improvement, but I think there's a dangerous tendency to overlook the practice of looking at the parts of your writing that are already effective and trying to figure out how to preserve those things and produce them more reliably. Considering the (mental) conditions that allowed you to produce a piece of good writing could certainly be a part of that, and there's a good chance that trying to capture that feeling of flow "in the moment" could get you closer to that point than trying to dissect a piece of writing after the fact and trying to reverse engineer it. Is that closer to what you had in mind?
