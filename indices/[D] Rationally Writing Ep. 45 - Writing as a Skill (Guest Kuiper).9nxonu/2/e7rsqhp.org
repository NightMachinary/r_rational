This is the first one I've listened to in a while, and I really liked it! I was really into the discussion about the "Artist"-"Scholar" thing.

I think the most important part of learning and practicing something like this is to first just notice what is happening, and that you should be able to do the same with writing. Rather than letting the artist go for an hour or two and then sitting the scholar down later to analyze what happened, you could set aside some practice time to sit them down together at the same time. I'm imagining something like mindful writing, I guess, where you look at what you're writing as you write it out, starting by noticing really obvious and distracting things first and then with practice you start to really notice the rhythm of your words, and how your mind arrives at that rhythm.

Full disclosure: I've never done this, so I don't know how it would actually look like in practice.
