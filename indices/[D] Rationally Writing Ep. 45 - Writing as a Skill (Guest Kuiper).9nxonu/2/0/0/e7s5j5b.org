You're right, in that committing something to "muscle memory" through repetition is the probably best way to learn how to do something, especially hard to pin down things.

I think my comment got a bit lost as it went from my head to the page, and I didn't communicate what I wanted to. Thanks for taking the time to write such an involved response regardless!

I was imagining something like bringing your attention to something that you do unconsciously, like the rhythm and flow of the words on the page, to see if you can understand what you're doing. This, of course, wouldn't apply if you're trying to learn something that you still need to think about doing. Am I making sense?
