What Cracked used to excel at is introducing high level commentary and concepts to the masses in an approachable, extremely funny, down-to-earth style. XKCD and WaitButWhy may not be as funny, but they still sort of do this, and mostly avoid the culture war to boot.

This is almost definitely the most circlejerky thing I've said on reddit, but I think that the leaders of the grey tribe LW diaspora- where you are now- is what you're looking for, especially given people like Scott Alexander and Gwern.
