This weekend, I removed Cracked.com from my bookmarks. That may not sound like a big deal, but it's because I finally realized that the hilarious jokes and insightful commentary that I grew up on from that website are not coming back. I have kept following Cracked for months now without bothering to read a single article and have enjoyed fewer and fewer over the past few years. The only thing I'm still following is their podcast, and even then I still skip episodes.

I know a lot of people like to hate on Cracked for changing from humorous to serious, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2ufws5/what_i_saw_on_the_crackedcom_writer_boards_during/][and some of it is justified]], but I really liked a lot of the serious articles. Sure, not all of them were good, but the ones that were still taught me things I wouldn't have learned anywhere else and gave me a different perspective on events while still managing to make me laugh.

Reading that website brought as much joy to my life as Jon Stewart did, and some of those articles changed the way I see the world. It wasn't just a comedy site for me, it was a source of existential hope in myself and the world. David Wong, John Cheese, Robert Evans, and more comedians on the Internet changed my life just by being a part of it at a time when I needed them and now all that is over.

Instead of whining about how things end, though, I want to find something new. If I can't find what I'm looking for with Cracked, I'll get it somewhere else. Where can I find someplace that doesn't just entertain me, but encourage me to be a better person? Where is someplace else where I can see an intelligent commentary that convinces me to have faith in myself and humanity when I'm tempted to be cynical? Is there still such a place?
