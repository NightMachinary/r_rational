That's not at all what I'm saying. I'm saying that "good" is a function of states, defined conditional on some person, and while the "goodness function" can thus evaluate states the person never observes (or cannot observe in principle), you can't "marginalize out" the person.

People can be valuable to themselves or to others, but not to nobody at all. There is no coherent view from nowhere.
