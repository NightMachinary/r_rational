I'm confused about what you mean by "marginalize out."

Anyways, there is no goodness function that is not implemented in some mind, true. But there is no contradiction in having a goodness function that prefers states that entail the nonexistence of the minds that implement it. That might make the goodness function self-defeating practically, though not formally. If there is a way for the goodness function to be transmitted on to new minds, then it is not even practically self-defeating.
