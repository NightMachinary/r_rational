I've never been one to push universal immortality, personally. There needs to be turnover for there to be innovation. Look at companies, it's much harder for them to reinvent themselves than it is for them to slowly die off and be replaced by more innovative ones. It's often better for consumers, too.

And it's probably ever harder for people, who can't exactly have internal workforce turnover unlike a company.
