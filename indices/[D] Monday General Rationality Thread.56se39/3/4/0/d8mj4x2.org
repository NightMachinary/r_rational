"Still, exchanging an existent person for a potential person is never a morally justifiable trade- regardless of whether that new person will live a better life."

I think, on the other hand, that this statement is based on intuition and does not always hold up. The argument is meant to give intuition for a possible case where it does not hold up.

"Otherwise, you could reduce the immorality of murder by having a child"

There is a difference between reducing net total badness and reducing the immorality of a particular act. Having a child certainly does make the total outcome better, though murder is just as bad as it always was, and there is still no excuse to do it.

"...any time you prevented a person from being born, you'd be culpable for the mass murder of all of their potential descendants."

I am not assuming that all potential persons have moral value which is denied them by preventing their existence - rather, there is some value in simply instantiating a new person, who will have new experiences, regardless of who that person is.
