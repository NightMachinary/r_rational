  ...there is some value in simply instantiating a new person...

I don't disagree, but I think that when such a decision to replace one person with a new one is made, the new person can only be rationally valued as a means to some other end- which has to be weighed against the inherent value of the living person.

An extant person has an inherent right to exist, while a potential person doesn't.
