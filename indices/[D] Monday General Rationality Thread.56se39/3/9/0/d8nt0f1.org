In the context of the sentence, the discontinuity is between a former person's consciousness, and the consciousness of the new person created from the resources of the former person. This only superficially resembles reincarnation. There is of course no "I" transmitted between the two persons, so really that choice of comparison is arbitrary; we might as well compare the discontinuity between the consciousness of two existing persons, such as you and me.
