You cannot argue using negative utility of partial memory erasure if your proposed alternative is death, which (as you state yourself) is equivalent to total memory erasure. Example:

- Alternative 1: Person A lives for 2 prtm without memory erasure (me), then lives for 1 prtm with 1 prtm of me, then lives for 1 prtm with 1 prtm of me.
- Alternative 2: Person A lives for 2 prtm without me, then dies (2 prtm of me). It is replaced by person B, living 2 prtm without me.

In both cases 2 prtm of me have happened.

I would even argue that the selective memory erasure to accommodate new experiences has significantly higher utility than the total memory erasure on death (with both being, of course, negative). Would rather lose the memories of the first half of your life, or have a 50% chance of dying on the spot? For me, at least, this is not a difficult decision.
