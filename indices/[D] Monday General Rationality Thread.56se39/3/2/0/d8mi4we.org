First of all, total prtm is not the same as utility. Utility is a function over sequences of prtm. If it is perfectly linear, then there is no difference between slow memory erasure vs immediate total replacement with a new person - in which case the argument about novelty breaks the tie in favor of creating a new person. If it is convex, then the original argument succeeds, and it is better to create a new person. If, however, the utility function is concave, then your argument works and slow memory erasure is preferable.

But there is an even deeper philosophical issue here - over a long period of time, isn't selective memory erasure equivalent to slow death? After all, if a person is a bundle of memories and thoughts, then drift over long periods of time means that eventually you will become an entirely new person - see intuition pump 3. A possible corollary is that immortality as commonly desired is impossible - you either stagnate or become someone else, inevitably. In this sense, mere continuation of physical life is a separate, easier problem than that of "true immortality."
