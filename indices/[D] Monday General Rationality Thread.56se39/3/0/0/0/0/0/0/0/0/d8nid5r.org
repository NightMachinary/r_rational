  If they'd rather die even without any kind of moral argument against living forever, then morality doesn't really seem relevant here.

Correct, that particular statement is not a moral appeal. The original argument is a moral argument to the extent that its premises are based off of moral principles (e.g., "change, dynamism, and generational turnover are things that should be preserved"), and will be persuasive to the extent that actual people accept those principles. I think the argument in my original post can be somewhat strengthened to address the criticisms in the responses, though I will not pursue that now. I also think that many real people would find it persuasive - I was inspired to write the post by a conversation with a friend who said that she "did not see why [she] ought to continue existing forever at the cost of depriving the world of younger generations."

  Well, if we're assuming that the progress completely stopped and I'm stuck in my current fleshbag with no ways to expand even my memory capacity
#+end_quote

This gets to the real problem with my original argument and the responses to it, namely, the assumption that our intuitions about what counts as a "person" or what counts as "death" will continue to hold into the distant future. Many possibilities are missed - we could use technology to break down the distinctions between separate "persons," for example. Personal identity would cease to be a meaningful category, and so would "death."

For that matter, I see no reason to think that the being you become after, say, 500 million years of existing and expanding your memory capacity is the "same person" that you are today. Maybe you could enforce an arbitrary periodic sisyphean return to your "core memories," whatever those are, but otherwise your entire personality seems likely to be replaced over that time, if you wish to maintain novelty of experience. There is, of course, no singular "I" floating inside your skull; that is an illusion. What you value is mere continuity of consciousness; "immortality" as such is absurd because there is no "I" to be immortal in the first place.
