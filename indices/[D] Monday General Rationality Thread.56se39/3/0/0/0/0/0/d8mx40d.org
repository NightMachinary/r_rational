Well, naturally there could exist agents that might view suicide as a preferable thing to do. That doesn't imply any kind of moral argument against immortality, as far as I can see.

I mean, even right now there are people on earth who feel as if their life is a waste and everybody would be better off if they didn't consume society's resources. We treat such thoughts as a symptom of an illness and try to encourage them to stay alive, even though, in absolute terms, some of them may well be a drain on our collective resources and letting them die could allow us to divert resources towards increasing birth rates. This is a pretty direct reflection of your scenario.

I tend to view morality as a set of principles that would incentivise the kind of behaviour that would lead to a world in which I would like to live the most. And implementing a set of principles which incentivises living agents to kill themselves, when, all else being equal, they'd rather not do it? No, I think I'd rather not.

  You might be easier to convince after a few thousand years. "Remember how exciting everything was when you were young? Why not give that gift to someone else?"

That's less related, but I just don't buy it. This whole "immortality sucks" theme just isn't believable at all. Even assuming that I somehow managed to stay alive for millennia without starting to tinker with my own mind and body in one way or another, there is always going to be something new to do, something new to invent and get good at. The reasons why I might consider suicide thousands of years down the line look much like the reasons I may consider it tomorrow. The reasons worth ignoring, that is.
