  At some point in any person's life, more good would be brought into the universe by creating a completely new person than the evil (if it's an evil at all at that point) of the original person ceasing to exist.

Does the whole argument hinge on assigning moral value to non-existent agents? I prefer to think of creating new agents only in terms of the impact on already existing ones, and incentivising agents to suicide so that someone else may "get their turn" seems pretty evil to me.
