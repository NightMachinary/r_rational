A lot of people here seem to believe that total immortality (at least until the heat death of the universe) is obviously a moral good, all other things being equal. Well...

[Puts on Devil's Advocate hat]

Here is a counterargument that I haven't seen discussed before.

*A moral argument against immortality*

1. There are a limited number of available resources in the universe, and hence using resources to sustain one particular person prevents other potential persons from existing.

2. At some point in any person's life, more good would be brought into the universe by creating a completely new person than the evil (if it's an evil at all at that point) of the original person ceasing to exist.

3. Therefore, every person has a moral obligation to die at some point in the future, freeing up resources to make new people.

Premise 1 should be uncontroversial - even if the universe is infinite, the amount of matter and free energy we could ever hope to encounter is bounded and finite due to the expansion of the universe and the lightspeed limit.

Premise 2 will be the most controversial, I think, and I will discuss it more below.

The inference from 1 & 2 to conclusion 3 could also be attacked, as it presupposes some sort of utilitarianism for weighing the net good of actions without reference to means. But I suspect that similar inferences could be formulated in terms more acceptable to deontologists or virtue ethicists. In my discussion I will mostly assume that the inference from 1 & 2 to 3 is defensible.

*Answering objections to Premise 2*

One could simply assert that premise 2 is false, on the grounds that there is no difference in the amount of good between one unit of person-time (call it 1 prtm for short) for a long existing person and for a new person. But it seems plausible to me that goodness is path-dependent, so that the utility of 1 prtm depends on the totality of a person's prior experiences and memories. People are finite, so their memories are finite, and at some point they will not be able to form new memories without replacing old ones. This could create a point of diminishing returns on new experiences, especially if memory erasure counts as a negative utility. There would also be diminishing returns if mere novelty has any weight at all in our utility function - over time people will have fewer and fewer completely novel experiences (to them).

It could be objected that memories do not need to be erased: a person's memory capacity could be expanded over time so that forgetting is unnecessary. But this objection fails, because a larger memory uses more resources, so the opportunity cost of not creating new people grows right along with the expanded memory and cancels out the positive effects.

It could be objected that a utility function should have no dependence on prior memories. Then you would have to accept that a person with extremely limited memory formation ability, such as someone with anterograde amnesia, has no difference in quality of life than a person who can form memories normally.

You could object that memory erasure is not bad or that novelty should not be a factor in the utility function. Both of these objections are implausible. If the erasure of all memories is like death, which is assumed to be bad, then it seems reasonable to consider the erasure of one memory as a partial death which is just a little bit bad. And novelty, of course, is the spice of life.

*Is mere discontinuity really all that bad?*

Assuming that there is no aging, so that full quality of life is present right up until the end, death becomes a mere discontinuity in experience, like going under anesthesia and waking up as a completely different person.

We must also consider that the badness of a death depends not only on the badness of a particular person's discontinuation, but on the effects of this on other people. But in the same vein as before, it could be argued that at some point it is more good to find new friends than to eternally interact with the same people over and over (hell is other people!). Furthermore, strong contrast of emotions could be necessary for overall well-being, and leaving an old tired friend for new ones would certainly create such a contrast.

*Intuition pumps*

Pump #1: The above problem is highly related to the problem of how many people should ever exist. Supposing the universe has the resources to support 10^{100} prtm through the entire future, there is the question of whether we should divide this into 10^{98} different people with 10^{2} prtm each, or 10^{50} people with 10^{50} prtm each, or 10^{20} people with 10^{80} prtm each, etc. It is not clear that the bias toward a much higher per-person power is morally optimal.

Pump #2: As entropy increases, the same amount of matter will be able to sustain fewer and fewer people. Thus, some people will inevitably have to die so that others can continue existing.

Pump #3: Suppose that there is strong disutility to discontinuities, so that there should be no death as normally conceived. Instead, to create new people, existing people enter an accelerated program of mental change, so that over a period of time they rapidly become a fundamentally different person, without loss of the continuity of consciousness. Does this make the above arguments more acceptable?
