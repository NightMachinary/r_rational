True, I'm not a cryonicist for similar reasons, but that has a lot to do with the uncertainty of its effectiveness.

Physics prohibits doing /anything/ for an infinite time, due to entropy of the universe. But as long as we're not yet at that point and could still theoretically construct Dyson spheres that harvest more energy in a year than our entire civilization has used throughout its history so far, we shouldn't put arbitrary limits on what science can accomplish when imagining a world where science has already accomplished immortality.
