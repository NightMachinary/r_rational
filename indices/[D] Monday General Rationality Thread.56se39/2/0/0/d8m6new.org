I follow XKCD and have read all of it, but a lot of it goes over my head and even when it doesn't it can still be difficult to relate to. It's still great, I just don't find it very "down to Earth". I go to it for weird intellectualism that pulls me out of my headspace, not for commentary on people and the world. LessWrong is in the same boat, though I visit it far less because, as an outsider, I find it less palatable. The closest thing I've found to what I'm looking for so far is vlogbrothers, which I've been a casual fan of for years.
