If there's an AI subversion technology, then it should come in levels. Anyone who has (say) Level Ten Subversion can out-subvert anyone with Level One Subversion, but the guy with Level 10 Subversion has put so many points into Subversion that he's got basically no chance of making his own AI first; he's put all his eggs in one basket, and he /has/ to subvert in order to win.
