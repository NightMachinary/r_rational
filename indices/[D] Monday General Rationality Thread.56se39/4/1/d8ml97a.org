[[http://www.dcscience.net/2015/12/11/placebo-effects-are-weak-regression-to-the-mean-is-the-main-reason-ineffective-treatments-appear-to-work/][This article]] ([[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/18/links-1215-winter-wond-url-and/][Found via SSC]]), brings up another reason.

It attributes much of the purported power of placebos to regression to the mean, as opposed to any effect that the placebos actually have on the person. Including the effect of regression to the mean in "placebo effects" is fine if you're comparing them to a drug (which has the same placebo effects and the same regression to the mean), but is bad when comparing placebos to simply waiting.
