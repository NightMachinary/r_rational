In your case it sounds like you just have less-connected, isolated parts of your neural network that you can access...

I wouldn't call them spirits, but there's no reason why I wouldn't believe that there might be entities you and you alone communicate with, separate from your usual self. Regardless of the fact that they're not available when you don't believe they're spirits, they are probably not spirits.

Nothing unscientific about it to me. However, if your access to them /requires/ your belief that they are spirits, I don't particularly mind. Especially if you benefit from them being around. Just like how I don't mind that my cousin's husband believes that his feelings reconfigure the water inside his clients' bodies to effect healing.
