I've done a lot of work using the Internal Family Systems therapy model, which involves personifying subagents of myself, and I can see pretty easily how letting them exist and be personified can lead to them apparently leading their own independent existences. I also did a bit of dabbling into tulpas back in the day, and have some friends with Dissociative Identity Disorder, and have at least one friend who is completely convinced that they can hear the voice of Freya (and is otherwise quite sane). So I have a fully natural understanding of how things like this can happen.

Which is to say: Have you read the four posts from meltingasphalt that explain Jaynes' bicameral mind theory? [[http://www.meltingasphalt.com/hallucinated-gods/][Here's the fourth one]]; it links to the other three within the first paragraph, and you should probably read them in order.

Which is to say: There is a meaningful sense in which these 'spirits' are indeed different entities from you. They're still all patterns in parts of your head, it's just that if they have their own independently-derived sense of personhood they can produce the kind of experiences that you are having.
