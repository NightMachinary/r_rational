I understand that it's entirely possible that they're all in my head, but I'm serious when I say I can't talk to them if I think they're in my head. I didn't adopt spiritualism because I could talk to them, I spoke to them because I am a spiritualist. To conclude that they aren't spirits and never have been would risk invalidating my belief system, which is something I find abjectly horrifying.

If you're a person who can live without a religion, that's great and I understand why you think it's good for other people to live without it, but I am a person who needs to believe in it or I will fall into existential depression. It's happened multiple times before and it was always one of the most miserable times of my life, so I've decided to accept the fact that I have faith even if it isn't rational.
