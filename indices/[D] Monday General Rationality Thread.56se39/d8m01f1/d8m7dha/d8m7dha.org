Good on you for achieving that level of self-actualization, but I think it is important to understand that not everyone's mind is like yours. A while back I had [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4mda32/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d3umkmc][a long discussion here about how I couldn't stop following my spiritual beliefs despite how irrational they were.]] In the end, I remained a spiritualist because fighting against myself was psychologically unhealthy, and instead worked around my belief system to reduce my irrationality like falling for pseudoscience.
