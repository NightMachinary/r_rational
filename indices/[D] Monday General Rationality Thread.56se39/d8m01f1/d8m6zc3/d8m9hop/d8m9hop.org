My argument really is not that the universe doesn't feel or that souls definitely don't exist. Rather, it's that I, personally, can come to an understanding without needing to invoke anything supernatural.

My relative was wondering how I could find meaning and connect with the world by dissecting everything and trying to understand them, whereas it's precisely in doing that that I can achieve meaningful connection with the world.
