As [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/55o2ah/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d8cethq][previously mentioned]], I'm designing an AGI risk board game, and will continue to document my progress here.

1) Definitely going for the competitive format. The current plan is that each player will choose or be randomly distributed what kind of research team they are. Each will have different benefits and win conditions: For example, the Military researchers will start with much more funding, but its end game will only result in either Everyone Loses or You Win. This acts as a disincentive for people to team up with them, opposed to the Humanist researchers, whose end game results can be either Everyone Loses or Everyone Wins.

2) Players are going to have a set amount of actions represented by tokens available to them each turn, which they can divide up among Funding, Research and Development. To get more Action tokens, they would hire new scientists and researchers through a bidding system. Cards representing new staff will appear at the beginning of every round, and each player will have to bid on trying to secure the ones they want. Each researcher will have special abilities and benefits and synergies.

3) The Risk of testing or activating your AGI won't be a dice roll anymore, and instead will be something akin to Blackjack, where you use the cards for the machine you've developed, which will have a % of Risk reduction associated with them, to try and lower the Risk to 0. I'm not quite sure yet how to best structure this part to have there be 3 outcomes: Success, Failure, and Partial Success, which grants you some benefits but doesn't win you the game. My current idea is that overshooting the mark is Failure, and stopping early is Partial Success, whereas hitting the mark exactly is Success, but I have to do some playtesting to figure out exactly how it would work.

I'm not quite sure how complex I want the game to be yet, in terms of additional activities like seeking research grants and sabotaging one-another's research. Going to try and nail down the core aspects of the gameplay before I start working in extra features like that.
