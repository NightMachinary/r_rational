Maybe when you construct the AI, you get a deck of cards with positive benefits in it, but also some Risk cards. Every time you draw from it, you have a chance of it doing something unintended, and some of those can be really bad. To represent it going evil, maybe one of them just says "take out all the good cards in this deck, place the Rogue AGI pieces on the board, and draw from this deck once at the end of every full round."

Yeah, sabotage by criminal factions would be their main strength. I still want to leave the option available to the others though, maybe through less destructive means.
