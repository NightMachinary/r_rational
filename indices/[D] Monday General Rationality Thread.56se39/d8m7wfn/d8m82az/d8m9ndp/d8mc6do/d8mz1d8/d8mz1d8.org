For me, drinking water while I have a headache (likely caused by dehydration) cures it on the order of minutes. It certainly works faster than seems plausible, as if my body is pre-empting the effect of the cure.

That said, I don't actually know how long it should take, or even whether the dehydration headache is a somatic or psychosomatic effect.
