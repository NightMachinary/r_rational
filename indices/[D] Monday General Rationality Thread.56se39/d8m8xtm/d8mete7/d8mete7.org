Isn't this argument only applicable to a universe in which we don't inhabit yet, though? I appreciate it as an argument against a population growth path that reaches toward infinity on a finite resource environment, but since we're so far from that situation, I don't think it really applies to people wanting everyone to live forever today.

If we ever get to the point where it's a serious problem that has to be addressed, there are a number of things just off the top of my head that might help solve this problem. Like why not just cycle people through longer and longer hibernation to allow new births to occur without straining resources?

+1 for the devil's advocacy though, it's definitely a point worth addressing.
