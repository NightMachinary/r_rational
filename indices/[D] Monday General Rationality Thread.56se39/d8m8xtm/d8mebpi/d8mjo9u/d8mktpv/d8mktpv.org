  It is not much different from jumping in front of a trolley to save someone else

It is different. In case of the trolley you're actually saving an existing person. You'd have to work quite hard to convince me to sacrifice myself for the sake of a counterfactual person.

I don't see much of anything wrong with agents voluntarily freeing up some or all of their resources for the sake of new minds, should they wish to do so, but that's simply a matter of not being prohibited from doing so. You can think of this in terms of preference utilitarianism if you like: if no agent wants to sacrifice themselves for the sake of creating new minds, then can forcing/incentivising them to do so really be called morally good?

In general, I'm not a big fan of "but think of all the new minds that could exist, surely that would give a net positive utility" with all the inherent repugnant conclusions and utility monsters and so on.

Also, if you ask me, then I'd rather not exist in the first place, if the price was that some unimaginably ancient and rich mind had to shut itself down just so that I could come into being.
