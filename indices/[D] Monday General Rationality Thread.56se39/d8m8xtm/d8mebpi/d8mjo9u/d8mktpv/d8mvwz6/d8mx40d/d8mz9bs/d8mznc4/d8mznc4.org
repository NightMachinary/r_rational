  So for the record, the number of people who will ever exist does not matter to you after a certain point; that is, you would be OK if after a certain point no more new persons were ever produced?
#+end_quote

Yes.

  Who says they'd rather not? Maybe after a certain amount of time living, people just lose their fear of death, and even welcome it.
#+end_quote

If they'd rather die even without any kind of moral argument against living forever, then morality doesn't really seem relevant here.

  This is an empirical question, but I suspect that it is eventually possible to saturate all experiences that are perceived as both worthwhile and meaningfully distinct, for reasons related to the memory upper bound.
#+end_quote

Well, if we're assuming that the progress completely stopped and I'm stuck in my current fleshbag with no ways to expand even my memory capacity, then I may wish to be memory wiped or killed at some point, sure. Why you would concentrate your attention on such an unlikely future is puzzling for me though.
