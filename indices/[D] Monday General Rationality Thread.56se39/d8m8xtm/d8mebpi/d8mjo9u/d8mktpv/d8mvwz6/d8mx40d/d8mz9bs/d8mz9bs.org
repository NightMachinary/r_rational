  I tend to view morality as a set of principles that would incentivise the kind of behaviour that would lead to a world in which I would like to live the most.

So for the record, the number of people who will ever exist does not matter to you after a certain point; that is, you would be OK if after a certain point no more new persons were ever produced?

  when, all else being equal, they'd rather not do it
#+end_quote

Who says they'd rather not? Maybe after a certain amount of time living, people just lose their fear of death, and even welcome it.

  I mean, even right now there are people on earth who feel as if their life is a waste and everybody would be better off if they didn't consume society's resources

I strongly emphasize that in real life I do not advocate suicide, and my arguments, to the extent that I take them seriously, are meant to take effect after a long and fulfilling lifespan.

  there is always going to be something new to do, something new to invent and get good at

This is an empirical question, but I suspect that it is eventually possible to saturate all experiences that are perceived as both /worthwhile/ and /meaningfully distinct/, for reasons related to the memory upper bound. After you learn /n/ instruments, for example, learning 1 more is no longer a meaningfully distinct experience. Even the act of seeking out the most dissimilar possible tasks to occupy your time is sort of a meta-task, and after a while you may find it no longer worthwhile to seek out the (n+1)st meaningfully distinct task one level down... I'm too tired to finish this line of thought, good night.
