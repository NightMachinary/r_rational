I think there may be a confusion in that argument between the value of potential ends and the value of potential means to ends.

If something is a means to an end, it makes sense to promote it even if it doesn't yet exist- it has value even when it's just a possibility. I don't think the same can be said of things that are valued as ends unto themselves- like people.

Compare the morality of killing a child with that of convincing a couple not to have a child. Although the end result of both is the non-existence of a child, only one of the two is inherently wrong, since it would make no sense to promote the interests of a potential child for that child's own sake.

Of course, that's complicated by the fact that human life isn't only an end unto itself, but also a means for promoting other ends. For example, if everyone in the world decided not to have children, that would be a problem, since we value humanity as a unit, and individual humans are, in addition to being ends unto themselves, also necessary means for the existence of that unit.

Still, exchanging an existent person for a potential person is never a morally justifiable trade- regardless of whether that new person will live a better life. Although that new person will have just as much right to live as the previous person, when it comes to ends as opposed to means to ends, I don't think "will have value" is ever a rational reason to act.

Otherwise, you could reduce the immorality of murder by having a child, and any time you prevented a person from being born, you'd be culpable for the mass murder of all of their potential descendants.
