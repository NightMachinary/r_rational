  Assuming that there is no aging, so that full quality of life is present right up until the end, death becomes a mere discontinuity in experience, like going under anesthesia and waking up as a completely different person.

How can death be a discontinuity in experience if it's the end of experience? This point presupposes reincarnation, in my understanding, as it's the only case where one may wake up after death.
