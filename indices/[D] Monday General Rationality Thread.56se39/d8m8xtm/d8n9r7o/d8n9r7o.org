Your argument, in short, is that memory erasure is bad and should therefore be avoided; and that it makes sense to allow one person to die so that another might step in in his place.

But death erases (or at least makes inaccessible to the living) /all/ memories. If memory erasure is bad, then death is surely worse? And one should not accept a greater evil in the place of a lesser.

On these grounds, I believe your point (2) fails.
