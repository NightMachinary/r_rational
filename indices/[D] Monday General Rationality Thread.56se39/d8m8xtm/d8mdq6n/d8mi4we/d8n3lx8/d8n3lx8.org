And why do you think that the function is convex?

There are two advantages to selective memory erasure over death:

1. It allows to retain the memories with the highest utility. Not all memories have the same value; replacing the low-value memories causes the average value to go up over time, whereas a new person would have the same average memory value as the old one did previously.

2. Aggregate data does not take up more space, it only becomes more precise. Many skills are not about learning new information, but rather consist of precisely tuning existing heuristics. For example, playing an instrument certainly belongs into this category and is considered by many people to be valuable.
