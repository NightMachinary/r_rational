In a discussion with a relative who's a practitioner of alternative medicine, I came to an interesting conclusion. I was trying to get him to explain the mechanism by which he claimed his variety of alternative medicine (Reiki) works, and he said that sometimes it's important not to understand, that it gets you more.

But I then realized that for me, knowledge and understanding are how I connect with the world. Instead of simply trying to be at peace with traffic jams, I understand how they form from waves, and I can actively counteract that, and now I actually enjoy getting stuck in traffic.

Viewing a person's mind as a /natural/ neural network explains a lot of why people behave the way they do, and it really makes the idea of a soul completely unnecessary in my mind. When faced with an unfamiliar situation, people and artificial neural networks alike behave unpredictably. Emotions are like different nodes of a layer deep inside of the neural network that makes each of us who are are. A person's personality is firmly rooted in physical brain structures.

Other people may have it easier finding meaning in the world through spirituality, but for me, a deep enough understanding of the physical mechanisms of the world gives me all the meaning I need.

And it is through understanding the world that I can effect changes upon myself and my surroundings, whether that be fixing something, writing a program, or learning how to control my emotions better.
