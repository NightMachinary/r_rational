Okay wow that's a lot of new terms for me...

Is it based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle][this]] and [[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/%7Ekarl/The%20free-energy%20principle%20A%20unified%20brain%20theory.pdf][this]]?

From what I can tell that's a higher-level model, that doesn't explain the physical mechanism of the mind, than my neural-network model, which might well be the low-level implementation of the free-energy principle...
