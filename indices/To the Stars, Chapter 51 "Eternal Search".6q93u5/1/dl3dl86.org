I want to note that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5sraso/to_the_stars_chapter_49_transition_state/ddhmv3j/][two chapters ago]] I questioned: (1) the rationality of /To The Stars/ and (2) whether it was worth reading at this late stage.

I can now come back and say yes it is rationalist and yes it is worth it. /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/ is also good fun (and available on Amazon Anime Strike).
