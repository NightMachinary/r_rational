I watched /Puella Magi/ before I read /To The Stars/. The Anime was quite good (I only had watched one previous Anime, /Death Note/). I will recommend that anyone who watches /Puella Magi/ watch at least 4 episodes before writing it off, the early episodes are ... well ... set to defy the stereotypes and standard tropes. If you don't like the plot after episode four though, at least you only wasted 2 hours.

/To The Stars/ is an incredible piece of fiction - It has possibly the most dense infodump to plot ratio of anything I've read, while maintaining a heavy interest in the material. I'm quite glad to have found and read it.
