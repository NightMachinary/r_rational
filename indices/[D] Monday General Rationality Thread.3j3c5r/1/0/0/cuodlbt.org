There are a few potential problems with this kind of game using unaltered Pathfinder (the version of Dungeons & Dragons I'm playing) rules.

Firstly Animate Dead is an [Evil] Spell which means that casting it is an evil act, what that means precisely is unclear however I think that any GM worth their salt would pressure you to change your goal of a utopia as your soul was blackened by foul necromantic energies.

Secondly there are very few people who could afford a Death's Head Talisman at normal price, I suspect that renting is the best method for purely acquiring money. It also seems like you would want to have most of the Talismans attached to trustworthy assistants who are paid for their services rather than selling or renting the Talismans to reduce the probability of people using the undead for violent crime.

Thirdly getting people to accept mindless undead labour would be almost certainly the biggest hurdle seeing as there are bound to be numerous unimaginative necromancers in the past who only used them as troops.

Fourthly there is little reason to use zombies over skeletons in almost any case, zombies are slightly stronger but much slower and odious than skeletons and when it comes to unusual undead such as flaming skeletons or fast zombies I would love to know what some uses might be for them be, obviously since flaming skeletons are IMMUNE to fire damage then tortoises could be used as crucibles with better heat resistance than anything in use with modern tech.
