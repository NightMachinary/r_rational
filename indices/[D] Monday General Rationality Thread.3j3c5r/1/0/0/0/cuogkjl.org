Yeah, most of that is addressed in the story. By the end, Piorus has become The Dread Necromancer Piorus in a lot of ways. Has he been corrupted by the dark magic used to make these items, or is he pushed into tough choices by circumstance? It's hard to say. He'd certainly tell you that everything that he has done, he has done for the good of his people. Deposing the king, seizing power, putting down the rebellion, imprisoning the archmage, allying with the bloodthirsty orcs, raising a massive army of undead horrors-- all these acts are in service of a higher cause, don't you see? The darker he stains his hands with evil, the more GOOD he must be, because only someone truly good would be willing to commit such foul acts to create utopia. Those southern nations, they're just too short-sighted to see it! The fools! He will crush them and show them the might of his utopia, his verdant land of industry created by the undead. They call Piorus evil, but truly, it is /they/ who are evil, for opposing him, for invading, for daring to challenge his dream.

He'll show them.

He'll show them all.
