That's probably not how I'd implement it.

I'd take [[http://annotatorjs.org/][annotatorjs]] and create a custom backend. Then, I'd create a simple greasemonky script or plugin that runs annotator on every page.

It's not a stand alone web site, so you can't put ads in or monetize it as easily, but it could be pretty cool. I'd be willing to put 10 to 20 dollars a month towards it, and some code.

In an ideal world you'd be able to subscribe to annotations by groups. So subscribe to the lesswrong, [[/r/skeptic]], and [[/r/rational]] groups. If your part of those groups, your comments will so up in those groups.
