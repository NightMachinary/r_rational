I do some programming, but would hesitate to label myself a software dev.

My favorite programming language is Python. I like it's ease of use, it's wide variety of easily used libraries, and the formatting rules. It's really nice and easy to use and work with for many different tasks. My background is in C, C++, BASIC, MATLAB, and Python. C and C++ are really good at low-level stuff and at creating really fast code to do intensive things very quickly, but are harder to write most things in. BASIC is really not good compared to more modern languages and I don't advocate it's use for anything new but sometimes you gotta deal with legacy code. MATLAB is really really good if you are able to take advantage of specialized built in functionality for e.g. matrix manipulation or other numerical processing tasks, but it's indexing that starts at 1 instead of 0 is bloody irritating.

I don't really have much exposure to any particular culture of programming.

Currently I am a grad student.

I am only a part-time programmer, learning to program from necessity. I don't have any particularly interesting part time projects, sadly.
