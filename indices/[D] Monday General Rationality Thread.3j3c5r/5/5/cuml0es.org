What's the task? Python for numerical tasks and scripting, C for systems and embedded work (which is what I do professionally), Haskell for fucking around with theoretical constructs, Coq for proving theorems, Java if absolutely necessary, Scala for general managed programming with nice things.

  What programming culture do you follow? Old school unix hacker, Enterprise Java, Mongo/node?

What're those second two like? The people at work follow a Linux kernel hacker style, so I've been picking it up.
