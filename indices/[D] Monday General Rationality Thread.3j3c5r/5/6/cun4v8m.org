  What's your favorite language? Why?
#+end_quote

My favorite language is Idris in ten years. I'd like it to be faster, more robust, etc. but it just isn't. One day it could be an upgrade from GHC Haskell.

The language I'm working most with is Terra-Lua. Terra is Lua-style LLVM code, with Lua as a Turing-complete preprocessor. Dynamically reconfigurable systems programming with a high-level scripting and configuration language built-in.

  What programming culture do you follow? Old school unix hacker, Enterprise Java, Mongo/node?

[[http://static.chronal.net/hmh/manifesto.html][I'm aligning myself with the Handmade Manifesto.]] I find it ridiculous how slow some software can be these days, and I want to learn to program hardware-friendly. Casey Muratori and his acquaintances are utter pragmatists, and I admire their philosophy.

  What technology/paradigm/design-pattern are you excited about?
#+end_quote

Handmade Dev, as a repository for Handmade-aligned projects. Terra. Idris. I'm looking for efficient implementations of entity-component systems that can organize their source in a modular way, with function-level overwrites and "superloads" as per ToME, as well as the ability to reload these modules as the application is running.

  Any cool personal projects?

I'm working on implementing the last sentence in the above answer using Terra-Lua. I want to use this to implement the leaked Nethack "3.5.0" in an entity-component style, and then move on to a visually-enhanced simulational text adventure inspired by The Thing with high-quality generated exposition. I also have a sci-fi book I'm plotting that's heavily influenced by my experiences on antidepressants, and now off them, which gets in the way of my software projects.
