Python is easily my favourite (try =import this=), though I'm not much past read-only in any others. Lua, MATLAB, and Python2 all offend my aesthetic sensibility somehow though, so...

I decided to take a course after reading /The Art of Unix Programming/ (and many other books in that category), so maybe the Unix tradition? I mostly found that through the Free culture movement, so who knows.

Most of my (paid) time is spent doing scientific work, so a lot of it is 'get this working so we have data again', with a side of 'it would be good if it didn't stop working again'. Personal, I've been working on a couple of projects for [[/r/dwarffortress]] - building a mod system into the community game launchers, maintaining the biggest community bundle, and contributing cleanup and documentation to the memory editor.
