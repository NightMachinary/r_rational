I figure there's a lot of software devs here, so I'd like to talk about personal projects and your preferred tools.

* What's your favorite language? Why?

* What programming culture do you follow? Old school unix hacker, Enterprise Java, Mongo/node?

* What's your day job?

* What technology/paradigm/design-pattern are you excited about?

* Any cool personal projects?
