#+begin_quote

  - What's your favorite language? Why?
#+end_quote

Haskell. Very expressive language, it's nice to represent domain knowledge elegantly(personal opinion) in formal notations.

#+begin_quote

  - What programming culture do you follow? Old school unix hacker, Enterprise Java, Mongo/node?
#+end_quote

A combination of all three. Started coding by scripting ActionScript 2.0 in Flash, converted to the great unix way later, then jumped on the node hipster train, and have to deal with StandardFizzBuzzSolutionaStrategyFactoryImpl in work.

#+begin_quote

  - What's your day job?
#+end_quote

Work in a company making ad-tech webapp, mostly data visualization with javascript occasionally a bit java, also some R and python on data science side of things.

#+begin_quote

  - What technology/paradigm/design-pattern are you excited about?
#+end_quote

Lambda Architecture / Concept of Data Lake. My company is starting to hit that scale. Interesting and surprising to me, that functional concept (immutable data, pure functions) could apply to big data problems as well.

  - Any cool personal projects?]
#+end_quote

Working on some ;) Older work: Pervasive GRE on Chrome Webstore, simple extension highly GRE words on webpages - a weekend's work and only passable code quality turns out to be something useful for a few thousand people.
