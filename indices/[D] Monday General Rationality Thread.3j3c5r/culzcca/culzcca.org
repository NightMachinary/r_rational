Hello everyone, I posted this idea yesterday as a generic post, but [[https://www.reddit.com/user/ulyssessword][u/ulyssessword]] suggested to post it in Monday thread, which I do now.

I have an idea for an application and I thought maybe you'd find it interesting and provide some critique for me. This post seems to be quite different from what is usually posted here, but I found some similar posts here previously so I hope I am not quite off the mark (correct me if I'm wrong).

It happens to me quite often that I have a feeling of certain incompletion when I read forums, posts and articles on internet, usually because I don't quite agree with the posts, since they are biased and the information they present misinterpeted. So I thought that maybe it'd be a good idea to have some sort of a website where you can post dubious article (with corresponding context) and dismantle it together with the others peers by means of polite rational discussion. Moreover, when the article will be analyzed, it will be useful for other learners: for example it may be possible to implement the mode where one can turn off the indications of the fallacies and practice in finding them themselves.

I visualized my idea with a [[http://picsurge.com/g/R3YSa7][photoshop mockup]] (just a quick-and-dirty draft for myself). I think I'd be interested to take part in a project like this, but I haven't found one in internet. So I guess I'd be able to implement it, but I want to hear some thoughts from people who are more experienced with rational thinking and maybe debates. So does this even make sense and is worth to implement, and if yes, what are the important aspects to take into account / pitfalls to expect / features not to be left out.

Thank you!
