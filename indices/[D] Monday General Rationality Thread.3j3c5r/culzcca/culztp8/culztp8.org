My personal feeling is that any website dedicated to taking apart someone else's words piece by piece is going to quickly turn toxic unless you have a really great community or really tight moderation, probably both. That's just my general experience with line-by-line responses on internet forums, which is what this seems (to me) to resemble.

It's that "polite" part of "polite rational discussion" that's going to be the sticking point, assuming that you can get people there to discuss in the first place. You're going to have to try /really/ hard to make sure that your website isn't just people posting articles and then doing the intellectual/academic equivalent of "look how much this guy sucks". You're also going to have to work hard to make sure that people aren't pushing whatever their particular agenda is, whether that's through cherry-picking weak articles or not using the principle of charity.

But that's just me thinking about how the internet normally works; it might be that if you can get the right community together you can avoid the traditional pitfalls of personal and ideological clashes.
