On this same topic... I don't think you could do a rationalist Rick And Morty; it just wouldn't be the same thing. But I am curious how rationalists would use various tools from Rick And Morty, or how they would respond to various threats from Rick And Morty.

- A Meeseeks Box? (S1E05, Meeseeks And Destroy)
- Interdimensional television? (S1E08, Rixty Minutes)
- A game of Roy? (S2E02, Mortynight Run)
- Cygerians? (S1E04, M Night Shaymaliens)
- Council Of Yous? (S1E10, Close Rickcounters Of The Rick Kind)
- Fart? (S2E02, Mortynight Run)
- Parasites? (S2E04, Total Rickall)
