I am in the process of munchkinning my way into control of my D&D game. I managed to break an AI cyborg and change it's laws after 2 hours of 1 on 1 with the GM. The cyborg is roughly the same level character as mine. In the same game I play actually one of the bodyguards of the guy that looks like the Wizard that all the other PCs expect. My next plan involves using the [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead][Animate Dead]] spell combined with a near mass production of these [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/talisman-death-s-head][Talismans]] to produce a large workforce for the country I am playing in and thus start a necromantic industrial revolution.
