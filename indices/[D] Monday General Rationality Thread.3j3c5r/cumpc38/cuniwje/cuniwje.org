An interesting campaign would be you and your fellow PCs attempting to create a paradise and overcoming a series of enemies. First, you have to overcome your immediate foes and your interparty conflicts as you seize power in your nation. Perhaps you disagree on means, or objectives, or level of ambition. Maybe a young lad appears with an ancient sword claiming to be the last scion of an ancient line of kings once thought extinguished, or perhaps the nobles' council opposes your attempts to take the throne. Maybe the merchant's guild and the peasants together are agitating for a democratic rebellion against your rule, or the King himself refuses to die, step down, or be deposed.

Finally, you have control of the country and are united in your goal of creating a necromantically powered paradise. You still have trouble, though; now that you are starting to roll out your plan, you face resistance from within your country. Most citizens, even the less religious ones, aren't too pleased with the zombie/skeleton setup, even when you dress them in clothes that conceal their nature and even though control of the creatures is tied to the talismans you sell (in place of levying taxes-- popular and profitable!) to the general public.

Then, you start seeing crimes committed not with swords but with minions. A factory worker uses the skeletons under his command to attack an overseer that insults him. A man comes home and finds his wife in bed with another man and uses his zombies to kill her-- and eat the evidence. A thief is using skeletons to commit burglaries and although two of his skeletons have been caught, he himself has not. Manual laborers are being put out of work faster than you can make talismans-- especially since each talisman can replace a half-dozen laborers. Unemployed flood into the cities and although your social works program gives them enough to live on, they are restless and unfulfilled, and start causing problems and committing crimes. Your educational program doesn't catch on quite as well as you like.

Even worse, as the years pass and you grapple with the problems brought about by these huge societal changes, you are set upon on all sides by foes seeking to take advantage of your weakness and allies hoping to curry your favor. The banker who wants to help you with talisman distribution-- is he trying to ingratiate himself to you to ask for favors, or is he planning to use your tools against you? The nobles giving you advice, who tell you they are the only ones who REALLY understand how politics work here-- are they working against you in secret, or perhaps misleading you with their information? Gradually, you who are warriors become politicians as well, and it's a hard game to learn for a few of you. Oh, sure, Aliana was once a princess--- before her kingdom was sacked by orcs, that is--- but her training was cut short. Jarrod spent time in the halls of power as a courtier, but never as a ruler. Urf, of course, never had a head for these things, and although you, Piorus, are learning quickly, politics will always be a foreign language to a scholar. You become fluent, but still...

The protests themselves do not alarm you. You knew the church of St. Cuthbert was planning something. Rather, the sheer mobilization of citizens catches you off-guard. All these unemployed discontents driven by religious zealots and directed by political enemies are causing you problems. You put down the protests, hard, before they turn into a revolution like the last set did (you remember well how you deposed the King, after all), and things are quiet for a bit. Imprisoning the archpriest was a difficult choice, the best of bad options. Though his every need is seen to and he is granted fine quarters in the castle tower, his followers are angered by his absence. The news of his hunger strike leaking out don't help things either. Eventually, you replace his servants with undead so that he stops passing messages to the outside world, but when news of THAT gets out, things get even worse.

You're not surprised, somehow, when your spies report about the growing danger to the South. The neighboring kingdom of Avaria declares a Great Crusade against “The Dread Necromancer Piorus” and calls for an invasion of “the occupied Holy Land of Ropilia” that you have worked so hard to improve. As three great Southern nations come together for the first time in four hundred years to fight a common enemy, you realize you have a war on your hands and no way to fight it. Your emissaries are killed, your ambassadors slaughtered in their embassies. No nation wants to be known as the one willing to negotiate with The Dread Necromancer Piorus, not when The Great Crusade is such a noble cause, with such a high chance of success.

A meeting is called, and the Four come together to think things over. Aliana is wearing her studded leather again, and Jarrod is fingering his silver holy symbol nervously. Urf looks as comfortable as he always has in these situations. You speak to your old friends about the situation, and explain how bad things have gotten. Jarrod doesn't have much to offer. The order of Boccob was never a large and powerful one, and even if they were, it would be madness to go against a Crusade called by St. Cuthbert. His knowledge and his person are yours to command, as always, and he has a number of bright ideas for weaponising the existing undead-control talismans. With proper networking, a group of men together might control a Legion. Aliana's powerbase began to fade long ago, but the knights who still swear loyalty to her stand by her to this day. There will be loyalist factions in the Rennish forces, knowing they go against their rightful Queen, but it will be difficult to use them.

Urf, though, can help. In the past few years he has been traveling and the relations between Ropilia and the Chiefs of the Plains are better than ever. Chief Grok is spoiling for war and the Council of Chiefs signed an alliance with Ropilia years ago. Although normally these things are not worth the paper they're written on, they would not pass up an opportunity to fight against the soft men of the South.

Soon, a new Horde is gathering, and combined with your endless Legions of undead, you think you just may have a chance against the warmongering Southerners. You may be able to save paradise.

As spring breaks and the ice melts, the Southern armies come rushing over the low mountain passes and through the valleys, and war has begun.

Autumn, 1305

Jan eyes the festering zombie a moment and surges forward, slicing it limb from limb with her holy sword.

“They just keep on coming, don't they?” she remarks.

Suki responds with a grunt as she caves in the chest cavity of a skeleton. So many of them, and so few Crusaders left to fight against them. How will they make it? “We're getting close to the castle, now. If we're lucky, they're still keeping archpriest Haor alive as a hostage. If not...”

“Either way, we have to find and kill Piorus. The rat has escaped us twice, now, but there is nowhere left for him to run. We have scattered the orcs and these meager creatures are all that remain of his profane undead legions. Too many have died for us to fail now, too many have given their lives for this noble cause. We will not give up. Not for hostages, not for the endless undead, and not for anything.”

Just being in Jan's presence is enough to give Suki courage, somehow. The holy warrior of St. Cuthbert is a solid rock in the wretched ocean of war, a beacon of hope in these dark times. She knows she can count on her to pull through, no matter what.

As they approaches the ruined gates of the castle, they know their cause is just. They don't even need to think about it, given the horrors they've witnessed and fought against from the Orcs and Undead controlled by that madman.

The Dread Necromancer Piorus must be stopped, for the good of humankind.
