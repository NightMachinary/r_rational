I came across an interesting video a while ago that seemed like the perfect, visceral example of the alien nature of artificial intelligence. Basically, this guy programmed a general NES AI that worked /solely through looking at recorded input and values in the RAM/. This is kind of a crappy way to build an AI if what you want is for it to win games like Super Mario Bros, but it's really interesting to me because of how completely dissociated it is with the human understanding of how those games are played. (This is the AI that paused Tetris because that was the only way to not lose the game.)

Anyway, I thought that was interesting in the seeming insight it gives into non-human thinking, in a way that other AI solvers do not.
