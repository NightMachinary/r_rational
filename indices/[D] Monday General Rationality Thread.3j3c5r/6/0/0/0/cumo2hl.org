  What do I need to add to their methodology to make them realize that a pharmacy will never teach the victim how to feel good about themselves by default?

Is that what depression feels like to you? Not feeling good about yourself? For me, depression was about being unable to take more than fleeting happiness from life. I remember going to parties and just sitting there not feeling anything at all. Sex was the furthest thing from my mind, which isn't uncommon with clinical depression. When I attempted suicide, it wasn't because of /low self worth/ and it wasn't because I needed to be thinking happy thoughts, it was because every happy feeling turned to ash and all that was left was apathy and pain.

I mean ... some percent of people experience side effects. Depression is over-diagnosed; SSRIs are over-prescribed. Outlook, diet, exercise, and environment are large parts of mental health. Some fraction of the effect of SSRIs comes from the placebo effect. I don't dispute those things. But without medication I would never have gotten to the point of not constantly thinking of killing myself, so it sort of leaves me befuddled when people just talk about medication like it's the most bullshit thing in the world. I talked with a lot of people with major depression during my time in the mental hospital and my experience of major depression didn't seem to be that unique.
