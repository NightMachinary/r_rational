A lot of people have psychiatric treatment or meds forced on them as a kid when they don't want it, don't really need it, and are mostly just trouble for the people around them rather than /mentally ill/.

(Said the voice of first-hand experience.)

That said, I've had a depression that felt like: "being unable to take more than fleeting happiness from life ... every happy feeling turned to ash and all that was left was apathy and pain." Except that I had /anxiety/ instead of apathy.

You goddamn bet I went to a psychiatrist and took the fucking pills. /And/ I changed lifestyle /and/ changed the direction of some major life choices.

And it's still never going to get 100% better, though in part that's because most people insist on living their lives and organizing their societies as if it's all /supposed/ to suck, as if "Such is life in glorious Arstotzka" was supposed to be taken unironically.
