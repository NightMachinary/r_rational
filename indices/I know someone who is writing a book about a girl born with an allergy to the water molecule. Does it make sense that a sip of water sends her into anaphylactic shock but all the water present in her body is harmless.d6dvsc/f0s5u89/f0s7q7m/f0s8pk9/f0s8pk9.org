I remember you spamming this everywhere before. You posted in [[/r/rational][r/rational]], [[/r/writing][r/writing]] I think, and a few others. In some posts you claimed to be that girl, in some you claimed to be writing a book, in some you just asked if it was “realistic” and if people would believe it's true when presented with a news article

You used a different username but it was the same posting pattern. What's your obsession with water allergies?
