I googled that condition and supposedly it involves an allergic response to water on the /skin./ There are a couple hypotheses about what could cause it, one being "it's actually a reaction to a trace contaminant" and another being "the water reacts with something on the skin to produce the allergen." I'm not seeing anything about drinking water or having a saline IV causing the reaction.
