First off, no it doesn't make sense. But hey, maybe she's not so crazy. Let's look at the description for her diagnosis:

[[https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10901/aquagenic-urticaria][Aquagenic urticaria]] is a rare condition in which urticaria (hives) develop rapidly after the skin comes in contact with water, regardless of its temperature. It most commonly affects women and symptoms often start around the onset of puberty. Some patients report itching too. It is a form of [[http://www.pcds.org.uk/clinical-guidance/urticaria-physical-urticaria][physical urticaria]]. The exact underlying cause of aquagenic urticaria is currently unknown.  Due to the rarity of the condition, there is very limited data regarding the effectiveness of individual treatments; however, various medications and therapies have been used with variable success.

And it seems like her claims in the article match the description of aquagenic uritcaria. So, that does check out. The story about her drinking a sip of water and going into anaphylactic shock seems a bit suspect, since aquaenic uritcaria seems like a skin disorder. But, I'm no doctor.
