The woman in the article claims to have aquagenic urticaria, which seems like it's a real itchy skin condition caused by external contact with water, but /not/ a true allergy: [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquagenic_urticaria]]

So it's a very rare disease that exists, but it only affects the skin, and you just get hives, you don't go into anaphylactic shock. Obviously the stuff about drinking water and almost dying is nonsense, the article on that junky click bait site is garbled or exaggerated too (“technically she's allergic to HERSELF”, the claim she needs to eat dry food).

To be honest, it's so easy to check what the condition actually is that I don't believe your story about knowing this woman, or how she's writing a fictional book, or that she's roleplaying in the interview.

It seems like there really is a woman with this name and alleged condition: [[https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/thieves-shatter-allergy-girls-life-1317690.html]]

Maybe she actually has aquagenic urticaria and is exaggerating the symptoms for attention. Maybe she doesn't have it at all, and it's a Munchausens type situation. Or maybe the newer articles are made up based on older reports about her, and you're involved in it and are posting here to try to make some point about critical thinking or something.

EDIT:

Another slightly less junky article, but still in the local press so probably little fact checking: [[https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/water-allergy-girl-reaches-21st-58672.amp]]

Repeats the bogus “anaphylactic shock” claim.

Here's a very dodgy seeming AMA she supposedly did: [[https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/8wzxnm/i_am_heidi_falconer_a_woman_with_a_severe_allergy/]]
