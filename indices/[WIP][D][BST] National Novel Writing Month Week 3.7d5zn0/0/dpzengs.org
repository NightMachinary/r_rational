Oh hey, it's november again, totally missed it. Good thing I'm already writing.

I'm actually doing a sequel to Scar's Samsara. Yeah, I know, I said I wouldn't, but then I started writing something just for fun and here we are. Already 55 pages in. The main challenge is to hold everyone's attention despite the fact that it features mainly characters from the Lion Guard, which uh, I don't expect most people to have watched.

I'll also be working to see if I can start updating NTBS again. It's tricky though, keeping two entirely seperate stories in my head, and shifting mood and tone like that as I write. Still, I'll try to get back to doing weekly updates starting tomorow.

(I'm also having to work until after midnight several times a week, which isn't making things any easier.)
