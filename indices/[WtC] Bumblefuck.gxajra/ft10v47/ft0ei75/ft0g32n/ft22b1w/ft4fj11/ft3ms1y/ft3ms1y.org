I think you might be overcomplicating things a touch. Is it silly that Joon's hometown, an insignificant spot in the middle of nowhere, is literally named "derogatory slang for an insignificant spot in the middle of nowhere"? Yes. But it's hardly unique in that regard; it's also intensely stupid, for example, for people to willingly join, fight in, and die for a gang that calls itself "the Fuchsia Coterie." The only thing unusual or potentially suspicious about Bumblefuck is that the silliness is on Earth, not in Aerb. Potentially the DM did hack his memory, but if so I really suspect it was a petty joke, like [[/u/SlantedSlash][u/SlantedSlash]] suggested, not some sort of deep clue.

I assumed it was the author's way of very quickly giving us an idea of the nature of the town in a tongue-in-cheek way, and playing it perfectly straight for laughs.
