It's not just that it's a silly name, it's that it sounds like all the other color-gang names were taken and they had to sit down with a thesaurus to find anything that would stand out. "You've got your Red Company, Black Army, Green Division ... Purple Crew, Silver Squad, White Host ... what, even "Vermillion Assembly" is taken? I guess we're stuck being the ... Fuchsia Coterie. Ugh." In short, it's a stupid thing that would never happen being played completely straight, so a lot like Bumblefuck, Kansas.
