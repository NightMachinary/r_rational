  The origin of Dildo's name is uncertain. As early as 1711, it was being used for a tiny offshore island there, but the island's connection with any kind of sex toy is uncertain at best. At the time, “dildo” was a word used for any cylindrical object, from nautical pins to test tubes. It was also a type of tree and a nonsense syllable used in song refrains, so the island's name could have referred to any of these.
