Yes, it's foreshadowing that of course this iteration of Joon has always been a simulent (or a brain in a jar) living in sim-space. (Arthur being able to be isekai'd despite being reduced to pasta, alongside a 500 year time misalignment, is another obvious flag.)

There's open speculation on the relationship between the Administrator and Joon - the obvious being that the Admin is Arthur spending time with a simulated version of his dead highschool friend.

If there's any greater purpose for this beyond the DM's personal interest, well, solving [[http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLB7AzTwc6VFZrBsO2ucBMg/videos][value alignment in AI]] is impossible as far as we know, aside from the rather imperfect route of human brain emulation. A lot of focus is put on morality and violence - it reminds me of an old game called A Mind Forever Voyaging.
