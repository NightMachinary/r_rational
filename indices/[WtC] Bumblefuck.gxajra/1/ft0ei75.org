Juniper never, not even once as far as I know (and I've done partial rereads with a theory similar to yours in mind), refers to his town by any other derogatory nicknames, so I am suspicious as well.

Given the Aerb counterparts of Junipers friends and the Schlossvolk and other DM contrivances, it is well within the DM's power to simulate a isolated rural town just to get the ideal protagonist player character.
