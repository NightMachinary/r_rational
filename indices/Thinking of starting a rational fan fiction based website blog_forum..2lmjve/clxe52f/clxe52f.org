UPDATE: I am currently working on archiving some stories and making the website a little more functional. I've still got to add in a comment/rating/review system however. So far i've got the first 5 chapters of The Metropolitan Man archived (thank you AlexanderWales) and The first 2 Chapters of Decagon (thank you theyellowwombat) . I unfortunately haven't had much free time and probably won't have much more in the coming week, however I still want to add at least something everyday. Thanks again for you support guys! Please feel free to check things out at Rationalfiction.com to see how things are going.
