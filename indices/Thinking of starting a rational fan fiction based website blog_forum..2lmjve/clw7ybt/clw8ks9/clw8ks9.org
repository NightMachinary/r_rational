Sure, you can use anything I've posted to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4976703/alexanderwales][my fanfic page.]] Though fanfic.net doesn't allow copy+paste, so you'd have to use an intermediary scraper, or dev tools to turn that off. And then there are the formatting concerns, like italics, bold, line breaks, etc. But so long as I don't have to do anything much with it, go ahead.
