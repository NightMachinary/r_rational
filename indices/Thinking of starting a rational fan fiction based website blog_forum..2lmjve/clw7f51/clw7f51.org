Do you think a separate site has advantages over using the existing solutions?

And if you the answer is yes, the question remains whether you could re-use existing code. The excellent [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984][archive of our own]] (which also supports [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/aliens_and_time_machines_prompts][contests]]) have their code [[https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive][on github]] where you could fork it. (You could say forking other projects is a rationalist tradition as lesswrong is a fork of reddit ;-)
