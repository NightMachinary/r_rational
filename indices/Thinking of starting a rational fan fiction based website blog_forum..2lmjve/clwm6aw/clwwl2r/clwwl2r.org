I'll keep all of this in mind while developing rationalfiction.com I'm building the website alone so it make take a while(unless people want to help :D) however I will guarantee at least a little work everyday. I will try to improve on what ffn lacks and i will never use copy+paste disablers. If you want to help out feel free to make an account on my site and submit stories. Any stories submitted i while later convert into an archive containing all the chapters.
