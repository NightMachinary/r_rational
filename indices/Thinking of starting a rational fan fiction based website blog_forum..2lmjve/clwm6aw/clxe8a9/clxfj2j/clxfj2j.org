You're welcome. Other good features might include:

- A 'fave' and 'follow' ability (this is something that FFN does have, and is good)
- The ability for readers to up- and down-vote a story for quality. Faves kinda covers this, but not really.
- An ability for readers to add a link to a "similar story" and up- and down-vote those links. If you saw a 'similar story' link with -5 votes you could assume that it was someone trolling for views and wasn't actually that similar. Link with votes below -1 or so should probably be hidden.

What platform are you writing it in? Wordpress, you said?
