You're welcome to repost The Two Year Emperor.

Also, there are several things that I dislike about FFN and would love to see in a new site -- if I could find them all, I would move off of FFN.

- Threaded reviews / comments / whatever you call them. I want to be able to reply to my reviewers
- The ability to review a chapter more than once, for when I re-read.
- Daily views & visitors stats
- A posting process that requires fewer actions than the very clunky one on FFN.
- No f'ing link-eater or copy/paste disabler. Jesus H. Christ on a cracker, those things are just bloody annoying and they throw out the baby with the small amount of bathwater.
