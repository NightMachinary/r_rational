That'd be interesting. I admit I was toying with the idea of a Rational OPM fic before and thought, is Saitama immune to mind control? I think that could be one way to turn him into a threat that has to be neutralized before he destroys the entire world and would introduce the moral complications of stopping him without killing him.

Heck you could write it with Genos as protagonist trying to find a way to neutralize his master without killing him and competing against the other heroes that want to stop him at any cost. There's a point where the cost of killing him may be lower than the benefit of not doing so and that can lead to some great gray morality drama.

Then there's the fact that a villain with Saitama as thrall must be extremely smart and would be very dangerous. If he can take over Saitama, he could as well take over other heroes. Maybe it works on all but cyborns and espers though that may be too much for Genos and Tatsumaki to face.

That could also explore the morality of the Hero Association and how unregulated they seem to take in any crack like Puri Puri Prisoner (he's a guy that admits and relishes on the idea of raping other males) or unstable people like Tatsumaki/Metal Knight that could go rogue just based on power level. What level of control do they really have over the heroes and if one of them decides to go villain, do they really got any way to stop them?
