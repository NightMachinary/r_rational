What about that scientist guy with the numerous clones and animal based cyborgs? It seems to me that he would be the most fitting candidate for a rational protagonist. I mean, he wanted to artificially evolve humanity and eventually discovered the secret to immortality and revitalized himself as well as created a ton of non hostile intelligent clones. Plus the weird cyborgs and animals given intelligence and abilities but y'know.

Dr Genus would work pretty well as a rational protagonist trying to make the world of giant monsters and superheroes more rational as well as saving the normal humans a la Significant Digits style.
