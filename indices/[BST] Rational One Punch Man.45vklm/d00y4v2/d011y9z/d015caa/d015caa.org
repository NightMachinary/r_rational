I think this is the perfect premise. OPM is basically an unstoppable bulldozer, with the only thing stopping him from becoming the ultimate supervillain is that he sees himself as the hero.

Your protagonist has just witnessed his Hourse of Evolution (?) get trashed and his experiments killed by OPM simply because he doesn't understand what the protagonist is trying to do.
