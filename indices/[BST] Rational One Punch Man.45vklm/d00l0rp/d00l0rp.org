How is Saitama not rational in the story?

In my opinion any change to Saitama from his current apathetic self would not be "stengthening" so much as just making a complete different character with non of his original essence. The series essentially explores one answer to the question of "what happens when you really reach the top", and the answer suggested in this case is effectively "Nihilism".
