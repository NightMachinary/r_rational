Stop being silly. Of course a past self would not become irrational, merely less rational. My future self is merely (and hopefully) more rational. "Better" simply means techniques which allow for more accurate reasoning without becoming too time consuming.

  Or more to the point, don't you think that using rationality to specify a specific set of techniques kind of misses the points and is a misuse of the term "rational"?

Which is why if better techniques come along, they become the new rational. That's how progress works.

I was not aware you wished to rules lawyer my loose definition to within an inch of its life. I thought we were trying to communicate about things in order to understand where the other stood and thereby figure out what the truth is, but as far as I can tell you just want to pick at things. Pick, pick, pick. Even at the things that would only be holes in my worldview if I were an idiot with the forethought of a hamster who didn't understand how sets of things worked. Frankly, it's giving me a headache.
