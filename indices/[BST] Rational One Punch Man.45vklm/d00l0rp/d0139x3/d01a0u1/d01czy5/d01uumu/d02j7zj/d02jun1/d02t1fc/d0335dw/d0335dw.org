  Missing is the reason that you think he continues to act as a hero

He does it because he enjoys doing it, it is not explored too much, but If i had to guess based on the first few chapters its about the same as a kid playing heroes.

  You can't just shout nihilism as the explanation for everything when that circular argument is equally applicable to him gardening or opening a shop or deciding to circumnavigate the globe on foot.
#+end_quote

I don't think circular is the correct way to describe it, but you are correct in saying that applied this way it could explain anything, which is the same as explaining nothing. The thing is it is actually completely reasonable for a nihilist to be a gardener or deciding to open a bakery. Being a nihilist doesn't actually mean you have to do X, its more of an outlook.

Which obviously means nihilism alone would not "explain" anything, but I never claimed it would. Nihilism fits as a model when you factor in the rest of his actions and general behavior.

I am essentially suggesting a different way to interpret his actions, you can either assume he is as dumb as a brick and is simply not doing anything to further his goals, or you can assume that he is generally working towards his goals, and what you see in the series actually is the outcome.

But to model this in a way which makes sense I think nihilism works best as the philosophical foundation.

  Also, what you're describing sounds closer to crippling depression than nihilism.
#+end_quote

Not exactly, though the two are regularly confused, because they sound kind of similar. But in reality nihilism does not actually imply any specific emotional state.
