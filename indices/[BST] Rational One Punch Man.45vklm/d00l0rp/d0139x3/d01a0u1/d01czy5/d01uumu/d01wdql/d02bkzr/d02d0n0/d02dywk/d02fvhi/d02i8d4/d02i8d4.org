[[#s][spoilers]] Its like if you see a bunch of ants losing a fight against a scorpion, and you just feel like 'saving' the ants so you step over and move\kill the scorpion. and then you get up and you see you stepped on like 20 times more ants then you 'saved' from the scorpion. Had you noticed the ants beforehand you probably would have avoided stepping on them, but its not like you -actually- care about the ants, you just went to save them because you haphazardly felt like it.

  If he's nihilist, then nihilism is irrational.

Thats a big topic as mentioned so I cannot really explain why it could be rational without us starting a huge discussion about nihilism which is out of scope.

  If that's not irrational you're going to have to explain to me what you think rationality is.

In this context I would probably define it as logical and effective application of the resources you have the achieve your goals\values.

The problem is that in this context nihilism is a lack of values. Which is kind of like division by zero in the context of rationality.

And then comes the difficult part which is "how could he not have values if he 'wants'\'says he wants' to do X?", and the answer to it is complicated, but basically boils down to the fact that even if he is nihilistic it doesn't mean he can't randomly 'feel like' doing something because similar to how understanding cognitive bias doesn't make your mind stop falling to it, agreeing with nihilism does not mean your mind would become empty and you stopped existing.

And this is already going into philosophical areas, where as I mentioned I would seriously suggest you read works by people who are more versed in it then me.
