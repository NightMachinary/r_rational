  Disagree. Saitama is a gag character. He's basically defined by his gags.
#+end_quote

Matter of opinion, which is based on things we are not going to fully discuss, but i think are related to the following points.

#+begin_quote
  Saitama's struggle with recognition is a major theme of the anime and some of his later actions are definitely pertinent to his life
#+end_quote

Basically all of the events which show him "seeking recognition" are played for laughs. And all of the rest of the series is showing him not actually trying to get recognition. He specifically says he isn't actually trying to get recognition in one part and has shown in plenty of cases not to really be bothered with it. Moreover he gave up on recognition in more than one case, and was willing to say other people did things when they were actually done by him.

I think assuming he did all of those things because he is practically retarded is being EXTEREMELY uncharitable in interpreting his actions. Don't assume that just because he is not doing what you would do in his situation it means he is stupid.

  That Saitama goes out of his way to find strong opponents is the main plot point of the most recent manga chapter. Trust me on this.
#+end_quote

I am not doubting you on this, because as mentioned I think even the Boros fight was showing a change of direction.

  yes I would optimize it. I wouldn't optimize everything, for sure; no point optimizing for easy battles. But I'd definitely use my power to keep my companions safe, or to prevent myself getting stressed about living comfortably

I should have probably been more specific in saying i was talking about a computer game. there are no other things that you actually care about, you just get a character which is so completely overpowered that there is no challenge. now imagine all games are like that. And no, suggesting you invent a new game is not an answer, its just a way to avoid it. but if you are not interested in understanding nihilism the thought experiment is pointless. if you are interested in "understanding" it just so you can "prove" it is wrong you will still probably find it very hard to comprehend it. and if you do want to understand it I am sure there are better texts on the subject than I could write, so I would suggest starting there.

#+begin_quote
  Your final paragraph suggests you missed certain important aspects of that last fight.
#+end_quote

you misunderstand, it is not that I was suggesting Saitama was weak, I meant that it was stretching a point by the author. Similarly to how having Saitama fight for like 20 chapters and look like he is having a hard time would still be stretching the point of the series, even if it was later explained that "he was actually not trying" would still be a problem. The dream was kind of an exception in the sense that I think it was meant to convey the emptiness and I could forgive it because it was short.

Though that is obviously opinion based, but i think the entire series until that point was very intentional in its anticlimactic nature.
