True.

Disagree. Saitama is a gag character. He's basically /defined/ by his gags.

  they are also insignificant in the grand scheme of things.
#+end_quote

Disagree again; Saitama's struggle with recognition is a major theme of the anime and some of his later actions are definitely pertinent to his life. They might be insignificant in the I-just-saved-the-world-again scheme of things, but the fact he's able to do that without being rational about it is more plot armor than anything. [[#s][If Boros]]

That Saitama goes out of his way to find strong opponents is the main plot point of the most recent manga chapter. Trust me on this.

With regards to your comments on nihilism; /yes/ I would optimize it. I wouldn't optimize everything, for sure; no point optimizing for easy battles. But I'd definitely use my power to keep my companions safe, or to prevent myself getting stressed about living comfortably. I'll admit that my understanding of nihilism isn't backed up by much study, though, so I'll take the comment about my views being straw men in stride.

Your final paragraph suggests you missed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3xlalo/spoilers_one_punch_man_episode_12_final_discussion/cy5mz4c][certain important aspects of that last fight]].
