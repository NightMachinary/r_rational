#+begin_quote
  He clearly wants to be famous and he's fantasized several times about having a fan club.
#+end_quote

Maybe I just don't remember, or I was interpreting differently from you, but I definitely don't remember him fantasizing about that.

So no, I can't really say i agree with the claim that he "clearly wants to be famous"..

#+begin_quote
  That's what I mean by unfalsifiable.
#+end_quote

which is why i said its kind of problematic to falsify a model.

but anyhow

#+begin_quote
  Rather than argue further, you need to give an example of what would convince you.
#+end_quote

Because of the nature of things its not exactly that any one item from the list would be enough, but a few of them could convince me.

- If he explicitly said he wants something, abstract not "i'd sure like to save those people right now", but instead "I want to be famous", "I want people to know i am strong"
- If it was shown that he was actively working towards achieving something. As in actually put time into it, not haphazardly do something when he felt like it.
- If he explicitly said he believes in some absolute moral
- If he explicitly said anything which implied another contradicting philosophy
- If he was shown to be sad because of people getting hurt
- If he was shown to be happy for saving people
