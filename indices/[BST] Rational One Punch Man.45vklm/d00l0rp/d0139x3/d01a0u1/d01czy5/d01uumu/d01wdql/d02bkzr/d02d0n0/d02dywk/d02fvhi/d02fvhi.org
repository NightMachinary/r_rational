#+begin_quote

If he's nihilist, then nihilism is irrational. He has things he wants, and we know this because he says as much as acts in accordance to it, but doesn't approach things in such a way as to satisfy those goals.

If that's not irrational you're going to have to explain to me what you think rationality is.
