  No, because he takes actions to correct it. In fact, he does so immediately.
#+end_quote

Two separate things. And in any case I think this significantly matches the "why am I treated differently" feeling than the "I want to be famous". And even then this is totally haphazard and shows no actual value.

This one is lacking context, isn't it from the part he is saying it wouldn't be strange if he had a fan club?

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 4, pages 14-17.

You do realize this is a dream? how is this "explicitly said"? Nevermind that you can't really take that with any degree of certainty, if i had to interpret that I think what that dream was more "wanting to want" rather then "wanting to have interesting battles".

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 11, pages 6-10. This one's obvious if you think about it.
#+end_quote

maybe i wasn't clear about my description of saitama, but I meant he came to that revaluation -after- he became strong. It was only after he achieved his desire to be strong that he realized that at the end of that road waited something different than what he expected.

  but perhaps chapter 14, page 13
#+end_quote

That's empathy rather than moral.

#+begin_quote
  chapter 34.5, page 21
#+end_quote

Don't see that chapter on MF..

#+begin_quote
  38, page 20
#+end_quote

Not really seeing moral there..

#+begin_quote
  chapter 42, pages 9-11
#+end_quote

Still no moral.

#+begin_quote
  chapter 48, page 10
#+end_quote

You notice how these things are totally half assed right? also this is way after boros, and as I mentioned I get the impression the series is much less consistent with what I mentioned from there on. At the very least I cannot claim what I mentioned applies because I haven't read those parts.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 5, page 3, perhaps? "It's what saved me when I had lost the will to live" doesn't sound like what a nihilist would say.
#+end_quote

that is referring to the first chapter after that job interview, so doesn't really apply.

And it should be mentioned that almost all of the rest of that page is actually all about how he doesn't really care about heroism too much and is just doing it for kicks, in the "its cool when heroes show up on tv, i'll be a hero!" kind of way. The next page sounds kind of like depression though, rather than nihilism.

#+begin_quote
  This one stumped me. I don't know if it's Saitama's style to be sad about flesh wounds.
#+end_quote

By hurt I meant dying...

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 33.5 [Extra], page 20.
#+end_quote

Don't see no page 20, And the rest of the chapter is mostly about saitama trying to have lunch and having a jumper bother him..
