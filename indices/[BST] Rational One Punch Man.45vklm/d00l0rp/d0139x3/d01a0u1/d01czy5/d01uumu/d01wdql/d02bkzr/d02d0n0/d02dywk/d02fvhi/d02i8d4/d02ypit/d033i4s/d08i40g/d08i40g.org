  Because I don't remember him doing anything other than basic empty to people in front of him, and generally liking the hero business in the same people think collecting stamps is neat. Which are all fairly involuntary reactions.

Why does a decision being involuntary mean it's not legitimate? I'd argue /most/ people's morals are largely emotional reflexes. Look at chapter 2, which has Saitama clearly /claims/ he's nihilistic but also clearly act against that claim. Back to the "wanting to be famous" thing, I might as well source my assertions. Here's one instance: [[http://i1.mangareader.net/onepunch-man/15/onepunch-man-3799287.jpg][1]], [[http://i7.mangareader.net/onepunch-man/15/onepunch-man-3799289.jpg][2]], [[http://i9.mangareader.net/onepunch-man/15/onepunch-man-3799291.jpg][3]].

But, I mean, he picked up a can on the street that missed the trash. If that's not moral outstandingness right there, I don't know what is. :P
