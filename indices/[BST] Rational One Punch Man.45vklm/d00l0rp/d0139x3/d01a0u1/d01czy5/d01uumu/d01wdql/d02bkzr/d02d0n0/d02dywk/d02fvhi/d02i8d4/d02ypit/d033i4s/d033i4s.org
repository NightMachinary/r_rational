  I don't believe that it's fair to say all of Saitama's actions are spur-of-the-moment
#+end_quote

Why? While it is obvious he has some tendencies he doesn't particularly make any plans, this is exactly what you were criticizing about him. beyond humoristic stuff like "wanting to go to the supermarket for the special sale" type of stuff he was never actually shown too much planning if at all.

  What you've hypothesized is basically unfalsifiable
#+end_quote

True, in the sense that I could claim about anyone that they are nihilistic, and anything other than actually hearing their thoughts will not actually be a definite proof of them not being nihilistic.

But nihilism is more of a model than a theory, similar to how psychology uses stuff like ego, id and superego to explain people's behavior.

  since you've basically said that any counterevidence just "randomly" occurs
#+end_quote

I didn't say that though, if he was shown to be planning and thinking how to save the world, or thinking how to make lots of money and then fail because he acted stupidly I would never suggest he was being nihilistic, and would completely agree he was being stupid. and if he was contradicting himself I would completely agree he was being irrational.

But he isn't. And you are suggesting that the explanation to all his actions is that he is stupid, while I think it was shown that he cares about the things about as much as how much you care about ants. In an abstract, would-be-nice kind of way.

  Saitama's emotional responses are strong enough for me to dismiss this.
#+end_quote

I may have missed something but I don't remember any strong emotional responses beyond mundane stuff and comedic sequences. He is shown not to care too much about morality, but instead just doing things because he feels like doing them.

He was impressed by mumen rider's actions and was 'on his side', but in reality this could just as well be the same kind of emotional response you would have to a fictional character. Not that he thinks its any more correct than anything else.

#+begin_quote
  It seems like a much more straightforward reading that Saitama is just being straight about his opinions, and the stuff he does and morals he upholds are genuine.
#+end_quote

Which opinions and morals are you referring to? Because I don't remember him doing anything other than basic empathy to people in front of him, and generally liking the hero business in the same people think collecting stamps is neat. Which are all fairly involuntary reactions.
