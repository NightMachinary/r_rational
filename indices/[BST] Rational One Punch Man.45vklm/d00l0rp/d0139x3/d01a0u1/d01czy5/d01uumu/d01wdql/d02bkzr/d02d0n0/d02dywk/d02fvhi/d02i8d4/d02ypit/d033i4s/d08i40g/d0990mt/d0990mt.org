  Why does a decision being involuntary mean it's not legitimate
#+end_quote

It is legitimate, i was responding to your suggesting that saitama spoke of some specific morals\opinions, and i mentioned i didn't see him ever say such a thing, only that he did whatever he felt like doing.

  which has Saitama clearly claim he's nihilistic but also clearly act against that claim
#+end_quote

I've already mentioned but there is no such thing as "act un-nihilisticly". you can be nihilistic and still rescue a family from a burning building. you can be nihilistic and give money for charity about as much as you can be nihilistic and murder a kid on the street.

  Back to the "wanting to be famous" thing
#+end_quote

Notice how he is not even saying he "wants" to be famous, he is just shocked at realizing that even though he did more then most other heroes no one knows him.

And I think this is one of those skits which are don't to be funny so are stretching it somewhat.

  But, I mean, he picked up a can on the street that missed the trash. If that's not moral outstandingness right there, I don't know what is. :P
#+end_quote

I am not saying he is not moral, just that it is not particularly important to him.
