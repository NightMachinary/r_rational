  I like the idea of OPM as a villain as well. If you take away the morality that made him a hero, becoming a villain is a much better way to give yourself a challenge than being a hero. If you show up, show your invincible strength by doing something horrifying, then give the entire world a year or so to come up with something to stop you, that'd be much more effective in drawing powerful foes to you than fighting whatever random villains happen to arise.

And you've basically described Koro-Sensei from Assassination Classroom, plus or minus some differing motivations.
