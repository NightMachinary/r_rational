You seem to be missing the point.

First of all some of the actions are obviously for laughs, they don't fully represent S, but they are also insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

Second you are suggesting fighting big bad monsters is an end goal of his, which I strongly disagree with. Its obvious from all of his fights that he is not -really- expecting anything out of them. Sometimes -during- the fight he might get a little excited, but then the fight ends and he just gets disappointed, which of course just makes him less and less excited every time.

And finally, you don't seem to really be giving a thought to his situation, and to nihilism. Try to really understand it before you claim if he is doing or not doing it. Because what you seem to be thinking about nihilism is closer to straw nihilism than to actual nihilism. All I could say to try and convey this to suggest you imagine you were playing a game where you had infinite life, infinite strength, infinite speed etc. would you actually be trying to optimize your way to finishing it?

Having said all of this, I kind of stopped reading the manga around the point the anime stopped, and even that last fight was kind of [[#s][stretching some of the points]]. which I think is mostly because most people don't see Saitama this way and are using it as wish fulfillment to imagining how they would love to be that guy that just comes to that guy who thought he was a big deal and "putting him in his place". And accordingly I think the manga did shift more and more to playing it straight.
