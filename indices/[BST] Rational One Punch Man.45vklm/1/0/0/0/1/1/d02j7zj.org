That's all very interesting, but none of it makes him rational. It makes him a nihilist. If he were a rationalist, he'd probably notice that his current strategy of doing exactly the same thing repeatedly isn't getting him what he wants. So he'd try a different strategy, and see if that worked instead. The first three obvious strategies that spring to mind are to find a power draining device like Zaraki Kenpachi uses, or to acquire incredibly wear training weights and wear them while fighting, or to master a form of energy blast that lets him shoot away lots of excess energy away into space before the fight.

Or maybe he'd realise that his life is unfulfilling and try to join a hero team in the hope of making friends. Or perhaps he'd turn his mind to one of the many ways that a super strength individual can make a hefty pay cheque (starts at ship breaking, moves on from there). Pick up another hobby, perhaps.

He has his thousand options, and he does not take them. I can't call him rational.
