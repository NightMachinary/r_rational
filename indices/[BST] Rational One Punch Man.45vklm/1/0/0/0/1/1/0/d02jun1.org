#+begin_quote
  That's all very interesting, but none of it makes him rational
#+end_quote

That doesn't -make- him rational. But it doesn't make him irrational either.

#+begin_quote
  It makes him a nihilist
#+end_quote

True, but being a nihilist is not contradicting to being rational, the two are fairly orthogonal.

#+begin_quote
  If he were a rationalist, he'd probably notice that his current strategy of doing exactly the same thing repeatedly isn't getting him what he wants.
#+end_quote

Notice how you said "wants", and I just mentioned that being a nihilist he wouldn't "want" anything? How could he optimize for that?

#+begin_quote
  The first three obvious strategies that spring to mind are to find a power draining device like Zaraki Kenpachi uses, or to acquire incredibly wear training weights and wear them while fighting, or to master a form of energy blast that lets him shoot away lots of excess energy away into space before the fight.
#+end_quote

This continues to assume he wants challange, or you are thinking the nihilism is dependent on him being all powerful, where that is not the case.

#+begin_quote
  Or maybe he'd realise that his life is unfulfilling and try to join a hero team in the hope of making friends.
#+end_quote

Why do you think that would be any more fulfilling than what he already has?

#+begin_quote
  He has his thousand options, and he does not take them. I can't call him rational.
#+end_quote

He has a thousand options, but he wouldn't consider any of them to be really much better then continuing to do what he is doing.
