Your point contradicts itself, unless I misunderstand. So far as I can tell, your logic runs:

He's a nihilist, therefore he doesn't care about anything.

???

Therefore he decides to go around punching monsters.

Missing is the reason that you think he continues to act as a hero. If he wants nothing, why would he go around punching criminals? Clearly there is /some/ reason for his actions. You can't just shout nihilism as the explanation for everything when that circular argument is equally applicable to him gardening or opening a shop or deciding to circumnavigate the globe on foot.

Also, what you're describing sounds closer to crippling depression than nihilism.

So, why do /you/ think he goes around punching monsters?
