How do you define "better" in this context? using "rationality"? If "better" techniques were found then that would mean that your past self was irrational according to your definition? what about your future self using those new techniques that you do not know about yet? does it also mean no one has ever been rational or do you have some kind of a backwards extrapolated definition of rationality till the dawn of man?

Or more to the point, don't you think that using rationality to specify a specific set of techniques kind of misses the points and is a misuse of the term "rational"?
