I was not, sorry if it came out that way.

we were and I apologize for assaulting you with those questions. moreover when rereading your original point on the hair I think you may have been mostly joking, in which case sorry for taking a joke too seriously and forcing you to protect it.

In the case it wasn't a joke though,I did some reading to see what would be a good starting point for discussion of the meaning of rationality and I found a [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/][post on LW]] which I think is relevant in the sense probably it would be more effective to avoid using "rationality" as a thing entirely for the purpose of that discussion, and use actual descriptions instead.

so I will start, I don't think a trying to get his heir to grow by eating seaweed, while not knowing the fact that sceintists disproved it is showing any wrong application of knowledge or logic in that particular context, but instead just showing ignorance of better available knowledge.

On a bigger scale depending on his circumstances and values it is possible he is displaying some bad practices for thinking in the sense that they could possibly be done differently to better achieve his goals, but that would be extremely dependent on those goals, values, availability of information, and costs of acquiring said information.

I think it is wrong use that specific context as a proof for the large scale because it doesn't give any of the needed values, goals costs etc. mentioned in the prev paragraph.

If I were to use a metaphor for this it would be like saying that someone doesn't know math, and as a proof showing him calculating X+Y and coming with a wrong answer, because he got the values of X and Y from someone else and those values were wrong. While there possibly were other ways the person could have found the values of X and Y, and maybe the reason he didn't do so is indeed because his abilities in math are not too good, the actual example at best suggests that as a possibility, it is not any kind of proof.
