I don't believe that it's fair to say all of Saitama's actions are spur-of-the-moment. What you've hypothesized is basically unfalsifiable, since you've basically said that any counterevidence just "randomly" occurs, but Saitama's emotional responses are strong enough for me to dismiss this.

It seems like a much more straightforward reading that Saitama is just being straight about his opinions, and the stuff he does and morals he upholds are genuine.
