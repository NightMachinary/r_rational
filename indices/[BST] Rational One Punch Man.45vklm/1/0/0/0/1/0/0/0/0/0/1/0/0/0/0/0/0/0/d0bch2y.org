#+begin_quote
  Notice how he is not even saying he "wants" to be famous, he is just shocked at realizing that even though he did more then most other heroes no one knows him.
#+end_quote

No, because he takes actions to correct it. In fact, he does so immediately.

#+begin_quote
  I definitely don't remember him fantasizing about that.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  If he explicitly said he wants something, abstract not "i'd sure like to save those people right now", but instead "I want to be famous", "I want people to know i am strong"
#+end_quote

Chapter 4, pages 14-17.

#+begin_quote
  If it was shown that he was actively working towards achieving something. As in actually put time into it, not haphazardly do something when he felt like it.
#+end_quote

Chapter 11, pages 6-10.

This one's obvious if you think about it.

#+begin_quote
  If he explicitly said he believes in some absolute moral
#+end_quote

Only the Sith deal in absolutes, but perhaps chapter 14, page 13? Basically a statement that some paths down life are wrong. You seem to like taking the most stretched meanings of things, though, so perhaps that's not literal enough.

Perhaps instead chapter 34.5, page 21. Talking about what it means to be a hero. Though he also does that in chapter 38, page 20 ("It's not about accomplishments. You are the hero everyone looks up to.") and it didn't sound like an absolute moral there. And then later, even more ambiguously, at chapter 42, pages 9-11.

Erm, what about chapter 48, page 10. "You know, asking old people for favors isn't the proper thing to do." Clearly Saitama has some traditionalist values.

#+begin_quote
  If he explicitly said anything which implied another contradicting philosophy
#+end_quote

Chapter 5, page 3, perhaps?

"It's what saved me when I had lost the will to live" doesn't sound like what a nihilist would say.

#+begin_quote
  If he was shown to be sad because of people getting hurt
#+end_quote

This one stumped me. I don't know if it's Saitama's style to be sad about flesh wounds.

#+begin_quote
  If he was shown to be happy for saving people
#+end_quote

Chapter 33.5 [Extra], page 20.

This one's hard since Saitama's generally so disinterested about monsters as a whole, and hardly considers saving someone from them a big deal any more, but I found one which doesn't involve monsters.

In fact, this chapter is quite a clear display of Saitama's moral system. Very agency based but not without valuing life and its people.
