Yeah I saw that, and would agree that it seems somewhat contradicting, but I said "most" for that reason. you can't really say that just because of that one sentence and the "cheer up" he said to him it completely overrides everything else that happened in that chapter.

  but if you can't run with that yourself I see no proof I can give you. If the writer isn't allowed to use dreams as metaphors for wants, I can't see how anything I give you isn't going to get dismissed out of hand.

I do run with those myself, but still most of the series is consistent with what I said.

But as I mentioned a while ago I can see why you wouldn't see it that way without actually understanding nihilism.
