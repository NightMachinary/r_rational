  Most scenes are gags, so that's no surprise

It might be that there are quite a bit of them, but not sure if its "most", in my opinion most of the series is actually used to set up the tension. Only to then be resolved anticlimactically, with the exception of the last fight which was slighly less anticlimactic.

  And for those that aren't consider the Sea King arc,. Consider the Meteor arc.

  I'm not really sure what you're talking about then. I'm not saying Saitama battles irrationally - after all there's no need for him to try, . I'm saying he lives irrationally.

I was trying to show what it feels like when there is no point to anything you do and you don't particularly care about what happens, but you are still playing.

  I'm not interested in nihilism in abstract, but I am somewhat invested in this conversation. If there's something I need to know about nihilism that directly relates to a point you've made (more-so than for naming things) I'll be willing to follow it up. But, AFAICT, so far you've not seemed to make any arguments through philosophical means.

I was not giving nihilistic arguments because the nihilsm I mentioned is an interpretation to Saitama's behavior. which, outside of trying to explain in abstract, is only really relevant when talking about specific examples.

But the problem is that if we start talking about an example, and you say "i think saitama was being a gag character there\irrational" and I respond by "thats one interpretation, but I think that is a reasonable way a nihilitst may behave" then you would either need to just accept the fact that there is an interpratation of the events which makes sense if saitama is being nihilistic because I said so, or we will basically need to start discussing nihilism, what it means and how it can come into play. which is obviously a discussion outside of the scope. And to be honest its not even as though I am some philosophy professor, so there's no guarantee I could properly explain it in the first place.

Which is why I suggested you tried to read on the topic from better sources.
