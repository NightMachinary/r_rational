Saitama could still be the hero as long as the main antagonist gains one vital advantage over him: Saitama is just one guy. He can oneshot everything, but doing so takes some miniscule amount of time. If Genos had not had a complementary skill set to Mosquito Girl, Saitama would have had trouble with the swarm (though not MG herself).

Now scale that up to the entire world. He can at best keep one city safe from a smart and strong villain that happens to control a swarm. I don't know, invite Skitter over and give her some relay bugs?
