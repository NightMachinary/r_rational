The idea reminds me a lot of Metropolitan Man, where a highly resourceful, intelligent character attempts to overcome a seemingly invincible adversary. I only know the premise of One Punch Man, i.e, Saitama is bored because nothing and nobody can pose a challenge to him, but I think the idea shows promise.

I like the idea of OPM as a villain as well. If you take away the morality that made him a hero, becoming a villain is a much better way to give yourself a challenge than being a hero. If you show up, show your invincible strength by doing something horrifying, then give the entire world a year or so to come up with something to stop you, that'd be much more effective in drawing powerful foes to you than fighting whatever random villains happen to arise.
