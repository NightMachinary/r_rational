Your second paragraph is exactly what I was thinking of when I thought about what a villainous Saitama's motivation would be, I was just pretty tired at the time.

We know that Mysterious Beings (monsters) are appearing more often and seem to be getting stronger over time. We also know they can form organizations and cooperate to fight strong heroes. I was thinking that perhaps after a while the monsters would potentially work with the Hero Association, with the Association abusing the apparent unexplained growth in strength among monsters.
