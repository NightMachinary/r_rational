I think you're missing a reason why OPM is interesting. Being able to one-shot adversaries is NOT an instant victory condition, not the way something like time-manipulation would be. In the OPM universe it's quite possible to kill everybody on the planet - you just have to do it before Saitama notices. Saitama wins because the antagonists are Big Bads who enjoy fighting, and/or lack imagination.

You could plant an explosive device on Genos, rig it to explode if you die, and tell Saitama about it. If you're an alien you can meteor-bomb Earth from afar. If you're a psychopath bent on killing everybody you can detonate dirty bombs all over.

So basically all you have to do to keep things interesting for a rational!Saitama is to make the villain smart.
