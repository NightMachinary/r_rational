Saitama's speed is ... inconsistent. He can perceive and react to speedsters, but he only ever acts "super-fast" in short bursts.

The question of how to be rational with arbitrary strength is more along the lines of Rational Superman, I think. It'd be a story of how Saitama tries to use his power to enact lasting social change, or something - that doesn't sound like a sustainable longform plot, although I might be surprised.

Villains who can act on a large /scale/, rather than having great personal power in melee, could plausibly act as a threat to Saitama - he has difficulty getting to fights in time. Not to spoil anything, but the final battle involved far more time taken up with Saitama's attempts to track the villain down than with battling him.

In short, I think a Saitama villain needs to be Lex Luthor.
