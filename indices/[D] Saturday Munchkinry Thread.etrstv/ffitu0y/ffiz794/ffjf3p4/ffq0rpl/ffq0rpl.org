Can I use math (specifically, statistics) to make probabilistic predictions about the future?

It'd likely help if I first take a brief course in Python and then rent some time on a supercomputer to handle the heavy calculations. But I can then make a fortune by exploiting rare mathematical trends on the stock market, or perhaps finding a mathematical exploit to the lottery.

My fortune will then allow me to purchase Batman-level gear, along with my own supercomputer. My (computer-enhanced) ability to predict the future will allow me to predict the likely targets of future supervillains, and set up ambushes for them (superglue to stick down speedsters, and so forth); I can make myself a name and go with the catchphrase "You villains are /so/ predictable." Of course, I only personally turn up when I have a 99+% chance of surviving the encounter; otherwise, I send a tip-off to the Hero Society. I don't need the credit for those guys - getting them off the street helps my hero career by helping me survive.

It'll work very well, because I'll be in a perfect place to catch villains who act predictably. And villains who act /un/predictably? Well, they're going to meet the Bear, sooner or later, whenever they least expect it.
