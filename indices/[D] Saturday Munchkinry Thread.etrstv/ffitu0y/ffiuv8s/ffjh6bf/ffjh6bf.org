Optimizing this a bit, book a room at a casino for a few days to minimize the travel time from your bed to the roulette table. Go to the floor and bet everything on a single number as soon as you wake up, resetting if you don't get it. Using a low chance, high payoff bet lets you burn through probability/payoff faster, so the extra time you spend in a coma each iteration is lower. The final timeline is you sleeping in for a few hours then walking down to the table and immediately making one bet for 35x your money. Repeat tomorrow, or today if naps let you reset. You might want to spend the evening drinking so people don't question your sleep schedule / lack of judgement.

(Betting straight up at roulette has the lowest odds of any casino game I know, but you could use up to around 1:100 odds if you can find one; assuming it takes you five minutes to get out of your room and down to the floor, that'll take about eight hours.)
