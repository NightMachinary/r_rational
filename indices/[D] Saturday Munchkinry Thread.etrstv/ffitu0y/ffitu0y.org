You have the power to retcon your own actions.

Specifically, there's a mental button in your mind that you can push whenever you are conscious and want to. Pushing this button rewinds time all the way back to the last time you woke up. Everyone except you will have their memories of everything that happened since you woke up erased.

But, from the time you woke up until the time you pressed the button, you are now stuck in a magical coma that you absolutely cannot wake up from, preventing you from using your memories of the future to do whatever you want in the past.

What can you do with this ability?
