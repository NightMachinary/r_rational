You have been selected to test an experimental space technology: a "Relativity Compensator". It will make your spaceship immune to the effects of time dilation: If you travel to Alpha Centauri from Sol at 80% the speed of light, it will take about five years to get there AND you will age about 5 years during the trip, instead of coming home to find your girlfriend 10 years older than you.

This seems like mostly an inconvenience that just makes subluminal space travel take longer for the traveler, but is there a way to munchkin it?
