Is it just "math", or does it extend to related fields?

Can you use your power to code super efficient bug-free programs? What if you encoded programs as mathematical formula to trigger your power? What if you encoded literally any problem you had as a math problem?

What about passwords and encryption? Encryption at its core is simply math, could you use your power to break it? Take over anyone's account and do whatever you want with it?
