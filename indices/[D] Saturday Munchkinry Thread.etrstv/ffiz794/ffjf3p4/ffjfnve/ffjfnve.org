I think that you'd have a straightforward time doing those things, but you'd need to still e.g. learn how to code before you could apply your mathiness to it. Like, it seems plausible to me that one could "encode programs as mathematical formula," but /not/ plausible that one could do this without first having any knowledge of programming.
