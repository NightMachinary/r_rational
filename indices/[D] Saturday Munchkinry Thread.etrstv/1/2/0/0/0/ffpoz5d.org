To me it's being able to look at a problem and figure out how to apply the mathematical knowledge I have to simplify it. A part of this is learning lots of techniques, another is having a strong intuition for what concepts to apply in a given scenario, another is having the ability to analyse the situation and create new techniques to solve the problem.
