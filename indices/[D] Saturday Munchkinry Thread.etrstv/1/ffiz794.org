In a world with speedsters, energy blasters, and a grizzly bear who shows up to maul evildoers in unexpected circumstances (and /only/ unexpected circumstances), you have the rather C-list power of "super good at math." Yes, you could prove the Riemann hypothesis in as much time as it takes you to write everything out, but you're no more interested in "solving" mathematics problems for a living than most people would like to spend a lifetime writing their name over and over again. You want /excitement/, and by Great Caesar's Ghost you're going to get it if it's the last thing you do.

How do you leverage your power in order to become a beloved superhero or feared supervillain whose name will be whispered in awe or horror for years to come?

(Either option is fine.)
