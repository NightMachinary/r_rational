Thanks for the feedback!

I'd like to point out that Minori's parents haven't actually figured out she's immortal in the sense that she doesn't age. They "know" she respawns on death, and while they're having a little trouble with the idea, it's not that big a change from normal-- very few people, comparatively speaking, die from abnormal causes. But the actual, no strings attached, eternal youth is so out of context they're not even really considering the idea.

Minori, on the other hand, being young, hasn't spent nearly as much time confronting her own mortality, and thinks when she says "I'm immortal," she's getting the whole story through.
