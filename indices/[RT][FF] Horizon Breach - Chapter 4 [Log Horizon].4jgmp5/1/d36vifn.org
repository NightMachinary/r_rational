guy-turned-girl.

Hm. I can understand Midori's folks trying to fit her life experiences since the Catastrophe into something familiar to them, but the concept of the pre-uni players going back to school seems...unlikely. Not only are Adventurer immortal now, with her healing abilities from her class alone she could help out at hospitals and such if she needs money for something. And that's not even taking into account whether the currency of ET could be used here in some way, among other things.
