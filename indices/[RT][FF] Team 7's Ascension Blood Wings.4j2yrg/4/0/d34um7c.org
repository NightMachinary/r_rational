The writing is good but my instinctive aversion to a more realistic (aka weaker) Naruto universe stops me from really enjoying it. It felt too AU to me.

It is hard to write a story with a consistent Naruto world that incorporates most canon feats-- you end up with (at minimum) the air supersonic reaction times for ninjas, ninja whose durability surpasses all known material's durability, and air getting set on fire by high-level ninja movement. Not to mention the absurd sizes for summoned beasts (amny times larger than tall trees), tailed beasts, Susanoo, etc.

Naruto canon is inconsistent, yes, but that wouldn't be so bad if it was just inconsistent where it needed to be for the sake of tropes like talking during battles. I could explain that away, or at least minimize it. Instead it's stuff like kunai made out of seemingly ordinary metal somehow harming ninja who can survive giant balls of fire, massive limbs of sand, being bashed into trees, etc.

Ninja durability is a mess. You can explain away offensive capabilities as ninja just not going full-out all the time, but it's hard to explain away ninja durability.
