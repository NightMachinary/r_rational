[[http://thepeninthestone.com/blog/how-to-build-a-serial-story-website-in-wordpress/]] has a few plugin reccommendations.

The two "big" topsites for WSF are [[http://topwebfiction.com/]] and [[http://webfictionguide.com/]]. The first is your classical "beg for votes to get visibility" topsite, while the latter is more focused on building a community of readers, getting visibility with reviews, and making a comprehensive searchable database of WSF's tagged by genre, theme, and setting.

There's a handful of smaller sites with light to medium curation that you'd have a chance with, your best bet would be to put together a submission form letter (and TBH, give the first book a thorough polishing to bring it up to the quality of book 2-4), and spend an afternoon hunting down as many places with open submission boxes.

[[http://theonlinenovel.wordpress.com/where-to-read-or-list-serials/]]

is a decent meta-repository.

The first five links are all good places to drop in on, and the rest in the second category are worth at least dropping in on.

As for the rest, they all require previously unpublished work and exclusivity, boo.
