I have a Wordpress-based blog installed at datapacrat.com, but I know essentially nothing about it beyond 'how to update the software' and 'how to post'. Are there any variants, plugins, or instructions for applying Wordpress for serial fiction?

Which web serial fiction topsites do you have in mind?
