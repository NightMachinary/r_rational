Don't engage in rituals you don't believe in, but you can make your own rituals (including atheist ones).

One way to approach custom rituals is as a way to be mindful about this or that - some friends do Victory Thursday, which is a simple one: You iterate your victories from the past week (you'll always have some, even if they're small ones) and then say: "I am victorious, and deserve icecream" (then you eat some icecream).

I would say "yes, it is a thing to be concerned about", but that the correct response is to change the ritual not to avoid any rituals. Non-theistic rituals should not result in theistic beliefs.
