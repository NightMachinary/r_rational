I don't remember where I read it, but I've read that if you consistently pretend to be a certain type of person for at least 6 months, you'll in a sense "become" that person. This is a problem for, not like /undercover/ cops, but /deep cover/ operatives, people who have to live their lives as criminals 24/7/365 for a year or three or more. There's a non-insignificant percentage of them who never complete their missions and disappear into their fabricated personas. So it's not an unreasonable concern, /pretending/ to be more religious could realistically lead in the long term to /legitimately/ being more religious.
