As an ex-Mormon with a God-shaped hole, who still misses rituals and such, I've occasionally entertained thoughts of engaging in rituals which I no longer believe have any bearing on reality, to see if just going through the motions is enough to fill that hole.

My worry is not that this won't work (the time invested will be well-spent even if this doesn't work) but that it will work too well, "fake it till you make it" will turn out to apply to more than things which I /endorse/, and by way of cognitive dissonance I'll fall back into theism somehow.

Does this seem like a reasonable thing to be concerned about? "Fake it till you make it" was definitely a tactic which I suggested during my time as a missionary, but then again the people I was suggesting it for were striving for that conversion experience.
