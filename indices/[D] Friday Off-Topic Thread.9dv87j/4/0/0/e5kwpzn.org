Heh. Name's a bit confusing - we have only one swing (a 360 "kiiking swing" - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMSXDhRIA4c]] although this years was about half that tall), aren't swingers (although there's a lot of poly/non-monagamy) and don't do swing dance :D

We're cored around an athletics rig, half of which are traveling rings - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXSd4cC-lFM]] (other half this year was usually straps, rope, and a static trapeze).
