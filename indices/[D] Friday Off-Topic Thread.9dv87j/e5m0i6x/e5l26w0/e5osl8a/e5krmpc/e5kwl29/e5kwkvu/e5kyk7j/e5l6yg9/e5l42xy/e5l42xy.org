That runs a significant risk of values-drift, though, no? I mean, you're basically trying to replace yourself with someone else and gambling that this new persona is as aligned with your own goals as you want them to be.

Not to mention, for this to actually work, you'd have to make a major life change or ten. Change your name, move across the country (or to another country), change your mannerisms, etc. The reason people 'become the mask' is because they have to /become/ that person, not just pretend to be them.
