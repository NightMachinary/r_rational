  Is the title 'Nightmare Escape' not sufficiently descriptive?

No. If I were just running through the list of newly-posted quest threads, I probably wouldn't think that you were talking about a literal nightmare (i.e. dream).

Maybe "Nightmare-World Exploration and Escape Quest." And don't forget that it's fine to keep this as a subtitle/parenthetical title. My own quest has the artsy hoighty-toighty title "Something New Under the Sun" but the parenthetical title "Rats Who Are Also Farmers Civ Quest", which tells potential readers the format (civ quest), who they're playing as (smart rats), and what they'll be doing (farming).

Of course, not everyone does that (as I mentioned above, some are as simple as "Heavy Metal Quest") but I trend toward including more information rather than less.
