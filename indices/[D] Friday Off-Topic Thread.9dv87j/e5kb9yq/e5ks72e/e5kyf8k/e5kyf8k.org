I'm confused. Is the title 'Nightmare Escape' not sufficiently descriptive? It's about exploring the rules in the dream-world and trying to find an escape from the dream.

Would a title like 'Exploring the Nightmare Quest' work better?

I'm not strongly attached to my current title, so if you think you have a better alternative, I'll probably go with your suggestion.

Thanks for the link.
