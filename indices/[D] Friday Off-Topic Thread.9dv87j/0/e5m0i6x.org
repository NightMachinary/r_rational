Going on one of those crash investigation trips I mentioned on here a few weeks ago!

Instead of two 12 hour days we're doing a 10 hour day and an 8 hour day, 80% of which will be in a car (but fortunately a large car?). As I suspected, we will basically be spending the full ~18 hours chatting, and also staying at the same hotel and eating dinner together. So yeah, that's gonna be a whole thing! :/

At least it's a 3 star hotel in a touristy town, which is more than we can expect in some other places we might end up! And our accommodation and meals are comped. Though the practicalities of eating vegan in random "truck stop" type places in the middle of nowhere remains to be assessed.

I'll try and see if I can take any photos while we're out there and post them here next week if people are interested.

It's a beautiful part of the country we'll be driving through, because coincidentally, beautiful tree-lined streets are also places where people tend to have fatal crashes.

Also I have a chemistry test the following day so I'm going to see if I can convince them to let me play white noise on my headphones on full blast and go through my flash cards... And excuse myself from dinner ASAP to do some worksheets.

Also, whoever suggested white noise to my "noisy office problems" thread last week, I decided to try using mynoise more dedicated-ly and had great results. Thanks!
