I already posted about this in the most recent Monday thread, but I didn't get much of a response so here's me reposting about the same topic today asking for advice.

I'm planning to start my first ever quest. Long story short, the quest is about having strange dreams where you explore a world of horror in a bombed city.

Type - Exploration/Mystery/Experimentation

Genre - Horror/Mystery/Journey

Here's my current [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHLywZ8JPwUhB5CrGHwBW2dZEzShti6KAYdWhOsDLCI/edit][draft]] of the first chapter for anyone interested.

But I have questions about running a quest that I hope people here can provide advice on:

- I want to do an exploration/mystery style quest. This means that I don't want offer any choices and every post will be write-ins only. Should I expect issues with this?
- I dislike quests where the character does things out-of-character depending on the vote. So I want to do a trait system where the character will have bonuses or maluses depending in how in-line the vote is with their (determined) personality. The trait system is inspired by [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-ball-after-the-end.30940/][Dragon Ball: After the End]]. Since it sounds like it might conflict with my desire to only allow write-ins, will this be a problem?
- A lot of quests have game mechanics, but I want the quest to be character-driven and to focus on the actions taken rather than stats. Will I run into issues without having stats?
- Anything else I should be aware of?

If anyone wants to give feedback on the chapter itself on how good it is at drawing in players for the quest, that would be nice too. Thanks!
