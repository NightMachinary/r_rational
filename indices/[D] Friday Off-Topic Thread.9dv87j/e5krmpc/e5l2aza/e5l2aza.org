  "fake it till you make it" will turn out to apply to more than things which I endorse, and by way of cognitive dissonance I'll fall back into theism somehow

I mean, that was basically Pascal's whole suggestion, right? "Even if you don't like mass, just go there until you just sort of start rolling with it". I don't think it's too outlandish. We're always influenced by our environment, especially in a social sense; "fitting in" is a strong impulse.
