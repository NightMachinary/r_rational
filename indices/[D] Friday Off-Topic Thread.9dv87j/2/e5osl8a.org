I'd like to get some art for my house that, when looking at it, will remind me that I want to be epistemically rigorous, honest, curious, etc. The values of [[/r/rational]] in general.

Ideally it wouldn't involve anyone's IP, other than the art itself, ie, no pictures of HJPEV, not even the Significant Digits one.

Something that would look good as an oil painting in someone pretentious's foyer. I just looked through [[/r/specart]] , [[/r/imaginaryfuturism]], and [[/r/ImaginaryCityscapes]], and didn't really find exactly what I wanted, but wasn't exhaustive, either.
