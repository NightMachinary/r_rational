Banks was definitely lacking in the feminism department.

  The Culture is interesting in some ways. It definitely features a much higher standard of living than our world. However, it is a system where humans are almost the pets of AIs with brains the size of planets (metaphorically speaking of course, the actual brains being in hyperspace, with measurements incomparable to planets in the strictest sense). Banks contrives to produce situations in which humans rather than Minds are required, but really, a Mind could probably create a meatsack drone whenever it really needed to.

Of course, a major, major plus-point of the Culture is that the humans are actually free to upgrade to Mind-level capacities at any time. That's not the /norm/ at the time when most of the novels take place, but it is, explicitly, a part of their history, and is mentioned as one of the Unusual Life Choices people sometimes make.

(Also, his Minds aren't actually /that/ intelligent, in terms of Winningness, but that's not Banks' fault: we've only started filling in the real meat of the "mind = probabilistic causality engine" theory very recently.)
