Uhhhh.... yes it is? I'm operating with rule-consequentialism here: incredibly powerful agents, capable of building up or tearing down whole civilizations, who care primarily about the freedom of other agents, should usually refrain from active interference in the lives of other agents. With respect to "the freedom of others" as a goal function, true inaction is morally privileged in the sense of usually being the right thing.
