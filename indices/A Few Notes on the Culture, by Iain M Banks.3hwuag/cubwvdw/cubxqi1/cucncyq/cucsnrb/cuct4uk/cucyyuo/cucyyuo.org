  They're fully capable of influencing society to subtly, gradually and painlessly shift values from current status quo to a more desirable state. My point is that we humans have an excuse of not being able to predict consequences of our meddling and so the stance "I do not interfere and let them decide themselves" makes sense. Minds don't have any excuse, for them inaction is not a morally privileged strategy.

You know, I think that /true/ inaction is still morally privileged. If true inaction means, "The same thing happens that would happen if I hadn't existed or been here", that is.
