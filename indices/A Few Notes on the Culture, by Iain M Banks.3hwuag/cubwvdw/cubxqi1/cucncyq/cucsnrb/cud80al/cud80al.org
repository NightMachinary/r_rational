  And that's precisely the right thing: gods are tyrannical by default, and the Culture's chief moral commitment is to freedom. It's the same reason the Culture doesn't take in immigrants: it would just be a disguised form of domination.

A moral justification which is - in my opinion - /wrong/. It's morally abhorrent to the point where I have difficulty talking about it rationally.

You do *not* get to deny /trillions/ - most of whom don't even know you exist - god-tech because you're concerned about cultural appropriation and the White Man's Burden.

  but on the other hand, being tyrants by default who're to blame for the fact that their human charges don't usually choose (in the era we're reading about -- they once did, and chose to change fashions with time) to radically upgrade themselves.

I think you're mistaken there, actually. Culture Humans were once a great deal more "transhumanist" - in the sense of bodily upgrades, neural nets, and so forth - but /immortality/ and becoming-a-Mind have always been Unusual Life Choices. I'd even go so far as to say Mind meddling - Marain, for example - is by far the most likely culprit, there. They control the media, they can literally talk every individual on the habitat out of it /in person/.

But ... I've always been uncomfortable with calling Minds "superintelligent". Sure, they can think quickly when they want to, and multitask inhumanly well, and a couple of other things - they technically fit the definition of "superintelligent", strictly better than human on an intellectual level. But most of the power differential between them and humans comes from /tech/, not intellect. They are not CelestAI, and they don't deserve to be held to the moral standards of such.
