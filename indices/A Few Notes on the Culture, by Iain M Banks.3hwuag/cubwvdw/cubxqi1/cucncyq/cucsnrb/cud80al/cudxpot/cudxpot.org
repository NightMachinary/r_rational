  You do not get to deny trillions - most of whom don't even know you exist - god-tech because you're concerned about cultural appropriation and the White Man's Burden.
#+end_quote

Now that we're bringing up comparisons between Culture Minds and LWian "superintelligences", how about: because you're concerned with completely tearing down someone's civilization and assimilating it into yours?

#+begin_quote
  Culture Humans were once a great deal more "transhumanist" - in the sense of bodily upgrades, neural nets, and so forth - but immortality and becoming-a-Mind have always been Unusual Life Choices.

Oh. Really? Hmm...

#+begin_quote
  I'd even go so far as to say Mind meddling - Marain, for example - is by far the most likely culprit, there.
#+end_quote

Well Marain is a bit of an /obvious/ meddling tool, yes.

  They control the media
#+end_quote

No silly, the Jews control the media ;-). (But actually, the Culture is explicitly mentioned to have quite a lot of cryptography and freedom-of-information measures in place.)

#+begin_quote
  they can literally talk every individual on the habitat out of it in person.
#+end_quote

How often have they actually done so?

#+begin_quote
  But most of the power differential between them and humans comes from tech, not intellect. They are not CelestAI, and they don't deserve to be held to the moral standards of such.
#+end_quote

Then why are you encouraging them to forcibly assimilate and uplift everyone, which is more-or-less the chief sin that CelestAI gets points off for? Are you saying the Culture Minds are smart enough to be manipulative on an Elders of Zion-level but not enough that their total domination of every smallest piece of the society they inhabit becomes a problem?
