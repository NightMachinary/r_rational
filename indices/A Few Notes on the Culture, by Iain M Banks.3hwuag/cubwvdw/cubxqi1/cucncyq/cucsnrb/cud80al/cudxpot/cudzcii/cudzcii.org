  Now that we're bringing up comparisons between Culture Minds and LWian "superintelligences", how about: because you're concerned with completely tearing down someone's civilization and assimilating it into yours?

Foreign cultures are not worth /more/ than the /**people/* in them*.

They are /definitely/ not worth it if the people /making them up/ would /choose/ to accept the technology you're keeping from them if they frakking *knew* about it.

  Then why are you encouraging them to forcibly assimilate and uplift everyone, which is more-or-less the chief sin that CelestAI gets points off for?

I just want them to give all the medieval worlds medical technology, honestly. There are a lot of things wrong with the Culture, but that is by far the highest expected utility intervention.

Within the Culture, they don't have to /force/ people, that's the whole point. Just start using their influence to better the people involved, rather than having them lead lives so empty that the main point of discussion in the Culture seems to be "were we better-off as baselines?" for about four centuries or so before they commit suicide.

Maybe allow Minds to be a bit more accountable, considering how decidedly not infallible or perfect they are. But the main thing is the Von Neumann probes providing the galaxy with the equivalent of mosquito nets and vaccines.

But yeah, I think it's made explicit in Excession that they avoid military interventions that would save countless lives from aggressors because the Culture doesn't like to /think/ of themselves as warlike. And that's a bad thing.
