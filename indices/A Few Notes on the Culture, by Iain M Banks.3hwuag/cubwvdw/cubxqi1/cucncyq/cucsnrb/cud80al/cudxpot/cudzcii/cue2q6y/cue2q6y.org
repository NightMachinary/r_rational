Ah, well ok, I can actually agree with that level of interventionism. "Hello, we're your friendly neighborhood galactically Active culture, and here's a DIY modernity kit!"

Only problems I can think of there are how to communicate the kit (package a low-level drone-mind for learning languages?), and the fact that a great deal of modernity is about social advancement rather than mere technology.

Also, I'd always taken the Culture's sense of ennui to just be bad writing on Banks' part. If your humans get so bored that they think they were better off maybe as baselines, someone has clearly suffered a failure of imagination: wouldn't, say, 150-year-old clever people, being the sum of vastly more knowledge, resources, and experience than a 30-something author, have /something/ to their life we'd find interesting to read about?

I mean, Corey Doctorow at least pretended that his immortal semi-upgraded characters in /Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom/ had actually done things like research X sciences and compose Y symphonies, and they appear to have passable imitations of real personal relationships and entanglements. Culturenikim were lacking in that department, more due to writing than world-building.
