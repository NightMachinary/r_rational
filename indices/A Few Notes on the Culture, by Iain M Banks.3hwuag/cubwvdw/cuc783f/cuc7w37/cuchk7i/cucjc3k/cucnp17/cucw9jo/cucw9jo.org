Gee, I dunno. A male author could view women as less worthwhile than men but acknowledge that women are necessary for reproduction, and in a sci-fi story he write about people who mercifully can be male most of the time and switch to female when they want a kid. A male author could fetishize women and wish he could be one for the purposes of sex but think women aren't as interesting as men. A male author could think of himself as not being sexist and come up with that body modification ability when exercising that belief but revert to the biases he's less conscious of when writing the stories in that constructed world.

If you hold up a sign that says "Men and women are equal!" that doesn't mean you have fixed the wage gap in your organization, or that you don't unconsciously use gender as a hiring criteria, or that you have taken steps to ensure that women in your discussions get a fair amount of time talking to each other. Even if you had, sexism is a problem that requires constant work to avoid. Even if we're being generous, we could conclude that Banks created that ability while putting forth unusual effort toward gender equality and his novels didn't reflect a similar amount of effort.

In short, the author did one thing early on as an almost throwaway aspect of his worldbuilding, and there's a chance that that was motivated by a desire for gender equality, but even if that were a guarantee, that doesn't guarantee that the rest of the work features gender equality, in world or otherwise.
