  And as you said, it wasn't important to the story.

No, I said it was one of the less significant elements of her suffering. It's important to the story, because while intagliation and everything that comes with it is obviously rather awful, sexual servitude isn't supposed to come into the bargain despite slavery. So Veppers' rape of Y'breq shows that he isn't merely being a bad dude in ways that are considered normal and unproblematic by the society in which he lives, but even by the standards of the society he is in, he is a bad dude. It also isn't the only way this is shown, what with the hells, his business ventures, murders, etc.

  Including rape is rubbing salt in the wounds of the twenty million potential readers who have been raped in the US alone. Rape is one of the leading causes of PTSD, too, so it's not just a slightly unpleasant memory that the text brings up.

I'm not sure I see how this is relevant. Are there resources for people who have been raped to avoid depictions of rape if they so feel like it? In any case, I don't see why Banks should have self-censored himself for this reasoning.

  Sexism as an aspect of the world in speculative fiction is much more depressing to me because it tends to indicate that the author cannot imagine a world without sexism, as if it were as inevitable as entropy.

I think you've rather hit the nail on the head there. In the more-primitive-than-the-Culture societies that Banks depicts, sexism is indeed a very common feature, along with all manner of other kinds of discrimination and violence and slavery and rape and whatever. I think that he does find sexism, along with the host of other nasty things that happen, to be something as rather close to inevitable when it comes to developing societies of beings that are comparable to humans. Even when sex instantiates in a different fashion, as per /Player of Games/ with the 3 sexes, sexism is rampant. The way he's set up the Universe of the culture makes it a somewhat plausible assertion though, since in general the various alien species are still basically just humans with at most a bunch of random not-too-significant differences.
