  Our orbital is being attacked. We actually want to defeat the attackers and as efficiently as possible. We send out small fighters. Do we include a human in them?

No, and the Culture don't either. Whenever humans are present on ships in a combat scenario it's always treated as an unfortunate event that has to be dealt with.
