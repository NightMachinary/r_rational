  I think it's better to look at the relationship between humanity and the Minds as more of a grandparent-grandchild thing.

Where the grandchildren are generally short-lived and will almost certainly never grow up to be anywhere near as competent as the grandparent.

  Sure, but I don't see the problem there. In other stories if everything a human could do can be done better by another human it still doesn't take away from the fact that the former chose to take action and put himself at risk.

It's a problem for the motivations of the people in the stories when they care about victory.

Our orbital is being attacked. We actually want to defeat the attackers and as efficiently as possible. We send out small fighters. Do we include a human in them? Having the human there as a passenger means the ship has to be much more complicated because humans are squishy, which means more resources per ship, which means we're less likely to win. Having the humans pilot the ship in place of an AI means the ship performs much worse in combat. So if I'm a human who cares about the outcome of the fight, it is my duty not to ask to pilot a fighter or board one as a passenger. (One of the books has a scenario much like this, if I recall correctly.)

The Culture has contacted an empire in which rank is determined by how well you play a complex board game. Contact says we want to send a representative and the best outcome is if we perform well but lose convincingly. Or if we win decisively. Or... We can send our best human boardgame player, give them full Contact training, teach them the game, and hope for the best. Or we can disguise a ridiculously smart AI as a human and send them instead, and it'll be child's play to them. If I were the human they wanted to send in, I would cry in despair if they hadn't thought of that option and cry more if they thought that sending me was a better option, all else being equal. (This is the entire plot of /Player of Games/, and throughout the book, the ship that the protagonist rode on was capable of soundly defeating him in the game.)

Only in cases where victory is absolutely assured, or nearly so, would you sensibly risk sending in a human. Or if you're dealing with bigots who can detect a Mind.

  The last three books all have female leads.

/Surface Detail/ features a female protagonist who grew up as a slave and was subjected to repeated rape. It's like, is there some disease going around that makes authors unable to fathom the idea that women can be hurt in ways other than rape? (Hyperbole, yes, but not by much.)
