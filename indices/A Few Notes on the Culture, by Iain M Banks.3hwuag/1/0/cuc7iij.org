  However, it is a system where humans are almost the pets of AIs with brains the size of planets

I think it's better to look at the relationship between humanity and the Minds as more of a grandparent-grandchild thing.

  Banks contrives to produce situations in which humans rather than Minds are required, but really, a Mind could probably create a meatsack drone whenever it really needed to.

Sure, but I don't see the problem there. In other stories if everything a human could do can be done better by another /human/ it still doesn't take away from the fact that the former chose to take action and put himself at risk.

  The first female character introduced is fridged in the first chapter, and other female characters tend not to last more than one scene. Meanwhile we've got the story of bunches of men.

The last three books all have female leads. It's also made pretty clear that the Culture views gender very differently than we do, since anyone can change their sex on a whim.
