Right, she's raped in the backstory and murdered in narration. Unusually, she's not murdered immediately after rape because her rapist is done with her; she's murdered after running away because keeping her to rape more often is more trouble than it's worth.

Including rape is rubbing salt in the wounds of the twenty million potential readers who have been raped in the US alone. Rape is one of the leading causes of PTSD, too, so it's not just a slightly unpleasant memory that the text brings up. And as you said, it wasn't important to the story. So it was egregious to use rape.

Rape is a rather gendered crime -- women are significantly more likely to be raped than men. In the media, this imbalance is vastly exaggerated. It's extremely rare for an author to portray a man being raped. So by default I take any depiction of rape with a woman as a victim as an indication of sexism.

Banks did, I think, have masculine characters being raped in /Player of Games/; however, that was with a much higher depravity level. It was designed to cause revulsion toward the entire culture. In /Surface Detail/ it feels like rape is more or less an expected aspect of slavery for women.

Sexism as an aspect of the world in speculative fiction is much more depressing to me because it tends to indicate that the author cannot imagine a world without sexism, as if it were as inevitable as entropy.
