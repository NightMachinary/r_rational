Sex in Banks' work is still not the same as sex in our world. To be sexist in the Culture is to discriminate against someone based on their choices, not on some involuntary assignment of status at birth. This is less akin to holding up a sign saying "men and women are equal" and is closer to actually making men and women equal. Sexism is still not a nice thing, but it could be compared to discrimination based on someone's clothing in our world. I would say that the context is fundamentally different, and that this is obviously very relevant to take into account.

  A male author could think of himself as not being sexist and come up with that body modification ability when exercising that belief but revert to the biases he's less conscious of when writing the stories in that constructed world.

I agree with this to some extent with regards to Banks' work, there are bits and pieces that could be seen in this light. I feel like he is generally conscious of them though, and tends to lampshade them.
