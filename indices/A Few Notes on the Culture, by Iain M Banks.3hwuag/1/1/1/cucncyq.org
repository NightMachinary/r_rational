  Of course, a major, major plus-point of the Culture is that the humans are actually free to upgrade to Mind-level capacities at any time. That's not the norm at the time when most of the novels take place, but it is, explicitly, a part of their history, and is mentioned as one of the Unusual Life Choices people sometimes make.

I've always found that argument suspicious. When you are a superintelligent agent, you are by default responsible for everything around you. When almost every single one of your pets "freely chooses" to stay effectively lobotomised for his whole life, when your civilisation continues to stagnate and allow the universe to continue to be the cruel and uncaring place it is by default, you don't get to make excuses about anything. Inaction does not absolve one of responsibility and Minds are among the most terrifying villains I've ever encountered. They have the gall to pretend being benevolent gods all the while being responsible for mindboggling amounts of suffering.
