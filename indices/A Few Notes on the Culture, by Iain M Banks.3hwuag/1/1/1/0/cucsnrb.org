Oh boy. Let's go ahead and have this argument.

  They have the gall to pretend being benevolent gods all the while being responsible for mindboggling amounts of suffering.

Excuse me, but no. The Minds /don't/ pretend to be gods at all, except when they feel a particular need to Badass Boast. And that's precisely the right thing: gods are tyrannical by default, and the Culture's chief moral commitment is to /freedom/. It's the same reason the Culture doesn't take in immigrants: it would just be a disguised form of domination.

You're basically criticizing them for being, on the one hand, insufficiently utilitarian to go out and impose utopia by force, but on the other hand, being tyrants by default who're to blame for the fact that their human charges don't usually choose (/in the era we're reading about/ -- they once /did/, and /chose/ to change fashions with time) to radically upgrade themselves.

You can't really have it both ways. For one thing, upgrading a human mind to superintelligence by force is going to be both traumatizing for the victim and very likely to result in a /pissed-off, traumatized, hissy superintelligent agent/.
