  Excuse me, but no. The Minds don't pretend to be gods at all, except when they feel a particular need to Badass Boast.

Fair enough, that was me being a bit of a drama queen.

They don't have to force anyone to do anything. They're fully capable of influencing society to subtly, gradually and painlessly shift values from current status quo to a more desirable state. My point is that we humans have an excuse of not being able to predict consequences of our meddling and so the stance "I do not interfere and let them decide themselves" makes sense. Minds don't have any excuse, for them inaction is not a morally privileged strategy. By choosing not to change anything they specify their preferred state of affairs.

A small fraction of agents holds all the power of post-singularity civilization in their hands and what they choose to do with it? They choose to make sure everyone else lives about half a millennia as a close enough to vanilla human and then irrevocably wipes themselves from the face of the universe, with a rare exception somehow escaping the indoctrination and ascending to gain some measure of power themselves.
