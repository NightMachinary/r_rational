Perhaps, but debating the virtues of agents who completely removed themselves from causal interaction with the rest of the universe is not the most productive of activities.

This does not apply to Minds anyway, since they are deeply influencing the society just by allowing everyone the knowledge of their own existence. There is no wiggle room here, either you are causally involved, or you are not. If you are, then you are responsible for results of your inaction as well as action. Minds do not live up to the responsibility of having their power.
