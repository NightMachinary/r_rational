The Culture is interesting in some ways. It definitely features a much higher standard of living than our world. However, it is a system where humans are almost the pets of AIs with brains the size of planets (metaphorically speaking of course, the actual brains being in hyperspace, with measurements incomparable to planets in the strictest sense). Banks contrives to produce situations in which humans rather than Minds are required, but really, a Mind could probably create a meatsack drone whenever it really needed to.

Furthermore, I can't recall any Culture novels about what happens in the Culture featuring only people from the Culture. It's all Contact missions to distant civilizations, or memories of civil wars that the Culture is responsible for but happen in other polities, or...

As an aside on Banks, I'm reading /Look to Windward/ right now. The first female character introduced is fridged in the first chapter, and other female characters tend not to last more than one scene. Meanwhile we've got the story of bunches of men. /Player of Games/ is big on rape as a sign of evil. This obviously doesn't mean that Banks was evil and you are evil to enjoy his writing, but these are problems that it is beneficial to be aware of.
