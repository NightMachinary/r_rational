  The galaxy (our galaxy) in the Culture stories is a place long lived-in, and scattered with a variety of life-forms...
#+end_quote

And yet ... the Fermi Paradox?

No, wait, I'm underestimating the scale here. This is actually a pretty empty universe, all things considered, isn't it?

#+begin_quote
  Essentially, the contention is that our currently dominant power systems cannot long survive in space; beyond a certain technological level a degree of anarchy is arguably inevitable and anyway preferable.

  To survive in space, ships/habitats must be self-sufficient, or very nearly so; the hold of the state (or the corporation) over them therefore becomes tenuous
#+end_quote

Yup, this sure is the first time in history that a majority of humans have been /self-sufficient/. And if there's anything history has taught us, it's that small, self-sufficient households and communities lead to democracy and enlightenment values.

#+begin_quote
  Even so, this is certainly the most vulnerable point in the time-line of the Culture's existence, the point at which it is easiest to argue for things turning out quite differently... but it is also assumed that - for the reasons given above - that point is bound to come round again, and while the forces of repression need to win every time, the progressive elements need only triumph once.
#+end_quote

I hate to admit it, but this is probably true, assuming "the hegemony" is not a Singleton of some kind. (Which also needs to win only once.)

But ... that's not going to lead to democracy and enlightenment values, right? That's the logic of nuclear proliferation, of the Deep Web and terrorist attacks. Although ... perhaps only at a Mind level?

Humans and Drones /are/ basically trapped in the semi-benevolent Singleton of the Minds, I suppose. It's the same way there's very little law /between/ nations, but plenty of law /within/ nations. I don't think that's quite what the essay is getting at, though.

#+begin_quote
  the mutuality of dependence involved in an environment which is inherently hostile would necessitate an internal social coherence which would contrast with the external casualness typifying the relations between such ships/habitats. Succinctly; socialism within, anarchy without.
#+end_quote

Or ... maybe it is? I never really got the impression that relationships within the Culture exhibited "an internal social coherence which would contrast with the external casualness typifying the relations between such ships/habitats". Seemed like they were /more/ casual with each other than with other ships, honestly.

#+begin_quote
  The Culture, of course, has gone beyond even that, to an economy so much a part of society it is hardly worthy of a separate definition, and which is limited only by imagination, philosophy (and manners), and the idea of minimally wasteful elegance; a kind of galactic ecological awareness allied to a desire to create beauty and goodness.
#+end_quote

I always loved the economics of the Culture, even if it seemed to slip at times from this ideal. Great stuff.

#+begin_quote
  Education in the Culture is something that never ends; it may be at its most intense in the first *tenth or so* of an individual's life-
#+end_quote

Don't Culture humans live 400 years or so?

#+begin_quote
  Part of their education, both initially and continually, comprises the understanding that beings less fortunate - though no less intellectually or morally worthy - than themselves have suffered and, elsewhere, are still suffering. For the Culture to continue without terminal decadence, the point needs to be made, regularly, that its easy hedonism is not some ground-state of nature, but something desirable, assiduously worked for in the past, not necessarily easily attained, and requiring appreciation and maintenance both in the present and the future.
#+end_quote

A fact which they respond to by partying slightly harder, and occasionally nudging the fate of worlds so they develop along the right path (i.e. that eventually leading to the Culture.)

Oh, no, sorry, that last part is "to let them feel vicariously useful." Of course.

#+begin_quote
  The same self-generative belief-system applies to the Culture's AIs. They are designed (by other AIs, for virtually all of the Culture's history) within very broad parameters, but those parameters do exist; Culture AIs are designed to want to live, to want to experience, to desire to understand, and to find existence and their own thought-processes in some way rewarding, even enjoyable.
#+end_quote

And ... /why/ are they Friendly, exactly? An answer to this is promised several times in this essay, but never actually provided.

There are actually a couple of lines in the books that seem to imply Culture AI is based on very abstracted human brain emulation, but interestingly there's no mention of that here. It comes across as if Banks believes morality is ... an emergent property of sociopathy.

#+begin_quote
  I think one has to ask why any AI civilisation - and probably any sophisticated culture at all - would want to spread itself everywhere in the galaxy (or the universe, for that matter). It would be perfectly possible to build a Von Neumann machine that would build copies of itself and eventually, unless stopped, turn the universe into nothing but those self-copies, but the question does arise; why? What is the point? To put it in what we might still regard as frivolous terms but which the Culture would have the wisdom to take perfectly seriously, where is the fun in that?

  Interest - the delight in experience, in understanding - comes from the unknown; understanding is a process as well as a state, denoting the shift from the unknown to the known, from the random to the ordered...
#+end_quote

Eh?

#+begin_quote
  This is not to say that the odd Von-Neumann-machine event doesn't crop up in the galaxy every now and again (probably by accident rather than design), but something so rampantly monomaniac is unlikely to last long pitched against beings possessed of a more rounded wit, and which really only want to alter the Von Neumann machine's software a bit and make friends...
#+end_quote

???

#+begin_quote
  Philosophy, again; death is regarded as part of life, and nothing, including the universe, lasts forever. It is seen as bad manners to try and pretend that death is somehow not natural; instead death is seen as giving shape to life.
#+end_quote

Unless you're a Mind, obviously. (Also, interesting in light of the later section that points out the Culture has "manners" instead of conventional laws.)

#+begin_quote
  The attraction of Orbitals is their matter efficiency.
#+end_quote

That is to say, based on "elegance" rather than actually being particularly /efficient/ in any meaningful sense. Matter is not in short supply.

I mean, it's not /unrealistic/ exactly, but it's an interesting little detail.

#+begin_quote
  The very worst crime (to use our terminology), of course, is murder (defined as irretrievable brain-death, or total personality loss in the case of an AI).
#+end_quote

Blatant lies, given the books, but whatever.

#+begin_quote
  Between each universe there is something called the Energy Grid (I said this was all fake); I have no idea what this is, but it's what the Culture starships run on.
#+end_quote

Heh.

#+begin_quote
  Now, in all the above, there are two untold stories implicit. One is the history of the Culture's formation, which was a lot less easy and more troubled than its later demeanour might lead one to expect, and the other is the story which answers the question; why were there all those so-similar humanoid species scattered around the galaxy in the first place?
#+end_quote

And now I'm sad again. :(
