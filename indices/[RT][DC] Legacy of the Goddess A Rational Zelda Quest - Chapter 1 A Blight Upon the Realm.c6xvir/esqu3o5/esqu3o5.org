Tbb I was kinda disappointed to find out what sv means. I kinda need an R!Zelda in my life now that I'm aware of the idea but judging by the first 90 chapters of that Naruto one, sv leads to extremely bland characters and a story that is entirely lacking in things like foreshadowing and story structure, because neither the authors nor the storyboard committee know what direction it's going to go in or even who'll be around at the next committee meeting to cast their votes.

I'll be following with some interest for at least a few chapters so I hope it turns out it's a matter of skills and not an emergent property of the system.
