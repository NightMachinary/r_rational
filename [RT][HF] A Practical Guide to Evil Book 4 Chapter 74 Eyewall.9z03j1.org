*** I'm waiting for Cat to just straight up cut people in half with her gates. Since chapter 67 we've seen a bunch of times that she can form a gate passing through the middle of objects, and that this ends poorly for the objects, and here we've just seen how quickly she can open gates... using the ol' [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalCut][portal cut]] seems like an obvious conclusion.

Unless Cat for some reason can open portals through solid stone but not through people, I guess (which might be the case, I don't know. Honestly my mind is still reeling from the reveal that Cat's portals could apparently cut things this entire time).

***** Right, I forgot that section because, honestly, I have gone back to Cat's overly comicated plan there since we skipped the actual climax of it all.

But it's worth noting that there's a lot of weirdness going on there. For one, the Spellblade wasn't actually cut in half by the gate, like everything else we've seen have a gate formed in the middle of it. (Which is actually the strategy I'm talking about / the new ability of Cat's I was surprised by).

Now, whether that's a rule about "no cutting living/undead people" or "no cutting the Spellblade in particular" is hard to say, because the Spellblade in general interacted with weirdly, and so did the locale where they fought him.

****** The reason the Spellblade wasn't cut in half was because he was an elf, and he decided he was ok. Elves can decide to ignore one Creational law at a time. We first saw that in the Book 2 Epilogue, when two elves simply decided that no one would be able to see them, and so they were completely invisible.

******* Definitely the most likely possiblity. The epilogue also mentioned that elves can only ignore one rule at a time, and Cat herself noted that the Spellblade only used one trick at a time.

But either way I guess we can move the upper bound on when Cat realised she could cut things / most off her enemies in half with a thought back to her unnesuccesful attempt in chapter 41 of this book. I'm not sure why she hasn't tried that move before or since. It seems like the sort of instakill that has very limited counters.

I'm assuming that opening one portal to instantly bisect an opponent is less vulnerable to this sort of counter than, say, opening five gates around them and letting the pressure of the water on the other side do the work like she did to the random Drow this chapter.

In this case, Cat was quite intent on cutting the Spellblade in half with a gate, and he was overriding the rule that says gateways do that when opened within people.

But /while/ he was doing /that/, he couldn't do the other OP rubbish.

******* Yeah, I think we can write that one up to Elvish bullshit like you/tavitararus said But now I want to know why Cat hasn't been using this tactic against all her opponents who /can't/ control the laws of physics.

Opening and closing portals that cut opponents in half, and doing so faster than superhuman Drow can react to, seems like the most efficient way kill anyone who doesn't have the kind of bullshit to counter this.

(And [[/u/ErraticErrata]] won't let Cat think of looting anything more significant than a language or two from Akua to compensate for the gaps in her education.)

Also, luck; if Cat had cluelessly flashed around portals that much, one of the Mighty with the Fry Lacusomancer secret would have used it.

Personally I think cutting people with a portal is lower hanging fruit than cutting a mountain into pieces and then dropping that on enemies (which is apparently something she can do without Masego/the Observatory now? She's never really talked about that power up except in reference to it being a thing, probably tied to her growing courts so I've got no idea on the limits).

But my real issue is that this is a tactic she's sort of tried before - see the Spellblade talk above. Apprently somewhere offscreen in the middle of fighting the courts/Akua/the Crusde/the Dead King's minions she realised that her portals could totally instakill most anybody, used it once, and then never thought about it ever again.

Yeah, this feels like an obvious thing to do. I've been waiting for a while for cat to realise that's there's an easy answer to all her complaints about Akua's superior knowledge and skills. It'd be nice for cat to have a vague understanding of magic, for one. Or negotiation, most certainly. Or about a dozen other things.

If Drow had the fry Lacusomancer secret, then she's going to run into issues anyway. For one hing she's holding gates open long enough to drain entire lakes, and for another her current tactics involve opening five portals /around/ a Drow rather than one portal /inside/ it.

********** The trap is: if you've inhaled the 95% of Akua that is high-level Praesi mage noble - even leaving out the 5% that thought Callow was nicely usable fuel - to what extent are you still Catherine Foundling, as opposed to Akua Sahelian's younger, more ninja self?

/I/ think this isn't much of a trap, but it could be argued either way.

*********** I guess, maybe. But Cat didn't mention any issues, downsides, or limitations to pulling Crepuscular out of Akua's mind.

Hell, her reasoning for doing so was that she didn't want to have to bother learning the language herself. This does not seem like the casual behaviour of someone skirting around a deadly trap.

  With the pivot came more. My mantle stirred. Queenship would be granted to me by the Tower, by Name and by right. But not like the rulers of the Old Kingdom, no.
