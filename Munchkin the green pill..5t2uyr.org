The green pill guy in the story is particularly bad about using pill powers. Now, the green pill isn't one that's super effective (I was all over the black pill myself) but surely there's a better way to use it...


** You could earn large amounts of money if you say you have super high-rez photographs/x-rays of long-extinct animals that you just happened to find in your dead grandpa's safe and you'd be willing to release for some compensation. Especially the human-primate missing link.

Edit: probably even easier money would be if you can regenerate; I'd bet there'd be a lot of people willing to pay you a lot of money to eat extinct animal bits.

edit:edit: you can also sell some animal byproducts that have some value, like rattlesnake poisons.

editx3: humans are animals! You can perfectly impersonate literally anyone. The implications are pretty clear. You'd be of great interest to militaries but as long as you manage to stay off their radar, it should be pretty easy to have a fantastic life. Depending on how the power works, you could also be able to temporarily simulate all kinds of diseases in yourself that others can use for medical research.

You could perform entropy shenanigans much like red does (for example creating a machine that can take advantage of spinning you up to several G's as a tick then turn into a blue whale - suddenly a lot more energy in the system.

Obviously lots of exploration could be done, the bottom of the ocean and places humans can't easily go.

We don't really know the extent of the power of the green pill so below is some speculation.

Dinosaur and other extinct species. Obviously interesting from a research perspective... Already mentioned but He also clearly violates physical laws so could provide energy in a variety of ways. Turning into a very large dinosaur for a sort of 'super strength' to increase the energy but only needing to eat what a human eats (as far as we know). Could also explore lots of other extinct species, depending on exactly how familiar with the species you need to be there could be all kinds of exotic creatures that are possible.

Not entirely certain if wounds taken in animal form carry over to human form and to what degree, knowing that would be useful (the only mention of wounds came from when the eagle had him by the leg in human form, it sounded a bit like he had taken more damage as a sparrow). If they do carry over, you can heal a lot faster in sloth form or even regenerate limbs in salamander form. If they don't, you can harvest materials more aggressively than mentioned earlier and perform all kinds of shenanigans.

If he is not limited to animals but any living creature: Having human intelligence as a bacteria would certainly be interesting from a scientific perspective and might yield useful information. Could you reproduce in bacterial form and split into several yous?

Could he turn into an aspen forest, which is technically a single organism? I just don't know the extent of his shapeshifting powers...

I'll try to think of some more but thats what I got for now.

** Assuming the most permissive version of this power, it is extremely powerful, rendering the red and yellow pills redundant, and even having a fraction of the abilities of the orange pill (or even just letting you copy any other people with powers).

As others have stated you can get free energy by turning into a heavier animal and then draining the created kinetic energy. However this is among the worst ways to get energy out of this power. Much more sensible would be to turn into a whale then have your head (well head area) chopped off then turn into something else before you could die. You could then extract all the caloric energy in that flesh (assuming it sticks around separated from your body when you change into something else, but I already said this was the most permissive interpretation).\\
However since this power would be most useful in preventing the heat death of the universe what you'd probably do is just feed the excess material into a black hole in order to get direct matter to energy conversion via black hole farming see: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ]], thus this power is vastly superior to the red pill for energy creation (though the best way to use the red pill would probably not be turning turbines but using the regen to create matter to feed to black holes)

If you can turn into /any/ animal (though I think it should be assumed you are limited to real animals that you know about), then by turning into specific humans you can read their mind, not only to gain any sensitive information they possess, but also potentially in order to learn skills faster, directly from their mind. [[/Some%20of%20you%20may%20remember%20something%20like%20this%20this%20from%20Animorphs:%20The%20Reckoning,%20which%20is%20where%20i'm%20getting%20this%20idea%20from][Animorphs the Reckoning spoiler]]. You /may/ also be able to copy their powers, or at least copy the powers of orange (though only the knowledge he had already used his power to acquire).\\
Plus you may be able to turn into highly intelligent people and use your versions of their mind for advice. If you can copy powers then you can also turn into yourself /turning into yourself, turning into yourself, etc/. Which basically means you might be able to leverage this into gaining access to an arbitrarily large number of simulations of yourself (plus a simulation of one other mind) in order to get mental work done faster.

There are many gods that appeared in the form of animal while still retaining their powers. These powers included turning into the original form of the god.

Zeus was into shapeshifting to animals to impregnate humans, Loki was a female horse once, and proteus could shapeshift into anything. The list is endless.

**** I was going for the most permissive /reasonable/ interpretation (though to be fair that quite subjective). I don't think fictional animals would be reasonably, because while extinct animals still /exist/ (see B theory of time) however whether or not nonexistent things can /really/ be said to have qualities like being an animal in the same sense as "actual" animals is questionable. I don't like those sorts of "interpretations" in CYOA's because it's not a matter of interpreting the CYOA but interpreting reality (as in you need to assume certain philosophical/scientific models are true in the real world for those exploits to work in the CYOA)

Also if those fictional animals have magic powers then whether or not those can be replicated (without which turning into that creature may instantly kill you) is questionable. While I considered the possibility that the pill /may/ let you copy the effects of the other pills by turning into their recipients, whether it can replicate effects that are not part whatever magic system this CYOA operates on is much more questionable.

Also "animal" may refer to the biological phylogenetic definition, in which case any creature that doesn't share a genetic common ancestor with earth animals would be automatically disqualified.

Still I think the most plausible exploit along these lines is to assume that a singularity will be created in the future (with all these pills it seems inevitable), and that people will create proper animals using genetic engineering that are basically benevolent biological superintelligences that have inbuilt biological nano machinery, and of course if they would ever be created then they exist and can be selected. Though if you don't know about them how you could go about selecting them seems questionable, but this can be solved by drawing up many of the details about the animal in the present. Sure you may not know very many details, but given this power doesn't require substantial knowledge of biology/genetics you presumably don't need very much info.

What does this mean? Is it impossible to understand for anyone or just humans? Wouldn't god himself suffer the same problems as yellow did if it's incomprehensible for anyone?

******* I guess you could make a story out of that, but I was assuming it was just incomprehensible to humans, or perhaps to anyone aside from God Himself. Given the sheer difference in magnitude between a human mind and His, something like this shouldn't be too surprising.

******** Thanks, got it.

I don't believe in any gods myself so I find it hard to put myself in the mindset of someone who does. I find religion and gods to be interesting topics, though.
