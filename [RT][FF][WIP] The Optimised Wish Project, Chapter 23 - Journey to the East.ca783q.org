** Having Goku take control of his inner giant monkey was satisfying, but not as satisfying as the heartfelt conversation he had with his undead grandpa.

Wow that's a weird sentence. In any case, I'm excited to see how this story progresses.

This one took me a while because next chapter was pretty long (and as usual, I want to finish at least one more chapter before posting the previous one). I'm really trying to think carefully about what comes next because the story is getting intricate and it's not easy to keep track of everything, do the proper amount of foreshadowing, and keep it all together while still having a semblance of thematic consistency. Writing this story really has made me come to grips with how hard that can be!

As an aside, today I've also put up a lesser story, a Harry Potter one-shot that's all but rational, as it's mostly just near-crackfic levels of fun nonsense, but if you're interested in reading it, here it is:

** Fun chapter all around. I think Goku still significantly undervalues beam attacks, but it makes sense because he hasn't discovered their niche yet, not really. It's kind of fun to see him spit in the face of conventional DB wisdom of “weak burst blasts have never accomplished anything / has that ever worked.” I liked how Goku has taken on the habit of metaphor correction; it can be done poorly, but I do like it a lot when done well.

Also, note: do you prefer reveiws here or on FanFiction.Net? I used to do it there regularly but I've been switching to here, not sure if you care since it's not a big deal to do one or the other on my end.

*** I like discussing here since FF.net doesn't offer that option outside of PMs. Of course I like getting reviews there too XD, but that's more of a matter of numbers and the visibility they bring, and right now the story is easily the first in the Dragon Ball section by any metric already, so it doesn't matter much.

** So, artificial moons are canon for Z, and Bulma figured out Blutz waves in GT, so what are the odds that Bulma can figure out how to do it again here?

At the very least, if Vegeta tries his 'Fake Moon' trick here, Goku'll have it a bit easier.

**** Speaking of, Grandpa Gohan implied he didn't meet any saiyans in Heaven. The most obvious non-earth candidates, Tarble and Broly, are still alive, but are people like Gine and Yamoshi ([[https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Yamoshi]]) not in heaven or did he just miss them?

Also, I liked the JttW reference with monkeys hatching from stone eggs.

***** Well, Heaven is big and there's trillions of sentients. Though I also have my own ideas about the origin of SSG, so don't rely too much on canon for that, I might deviate a lot there.

With JttW... really, I think the reference was Toriyama's own, but basically I realised only while writing this chapter.

** Beautiful chapter.

I remember thinking how should a more numbers focused dbz videogame be, and realising that big beam blasts would have it hard to be worth the charge time, vulnerability and lack of redirectioning. I'm glad to see it is acnowledge here, but I still don't see how you will justify beam struggles besides showing off. Maybe if you stun your oppoment for a second you can actually hit, but I don't see how anybody with super sonic speed, after seen their enemy begin to charge, wouldn't rush to give a kick in the head

*** Well, beam attacks are mass destruction weapons, so they have their own usefulness as a deterrent. That too is part of Gohan's idea here. If behind you is a city that you need to protect, you /have/ to take it head on. If we get to DBZ levels of power and behind you is your planet... you get the notion.

Other than that, yes, huge beam attacks seem pretty useless. But you know, we have small arms and we have artillery and we have ICBMs, and all have their uses. The problem in DBZ is that a lot of the time they're using ICBMs in what amounts to one-on-one pistol duels.

Though there's also another thing to note, which is that the normal human is very squishy - we can deal inordinate amounts of damage with weapons, and take almost none. By comparison superpowered Saiyans and the like can take /a lot/ more punishment, and regenerators like Cell and Majin Boo are even crazier, so obviously one needs to work WMDs into regular combat to even have a chance to kill them. In some cases in DBZ this tends to be acknowledged too - Vegeta's Final Flash only hits Cell because he provoked him into taking it head on, and of two beam clashes between Cell and Gohan, both are basically based on the premise that Cell's kamehameha would destroy the Earth if not stopped. We can also concede a bit more license in the speed these motions are portrayed - for example Goku's genkidama against Majin Boo might as well be so massive and so fast that he simply does not have the time to dodge it, though the scene looks pretty slow for the sake of our own inferior human eyes.

About numbers-focused DBZ games... have you ever played the old SNES "Legend of the Super Saiyan" game? It's an incredibly obscure RPG with a strange but fun card-based combat system and abysmal graphics, but the most enjoyable thing about it is how character stats are replaced by power levels that follow closely the way they work in the anime. In other words, they rise /exponentially/ with level, and with a big enough gap between two fighters, one is literally unable to harm the other entirely. It's one game where grinding rewards you ridiculously. It ends with the Namek saga, and while you can get Goku to go SSJ (by doing the obvious thing: have Krillin in your party, and let him die), you don't need to. A couple more levels and even little Gohan can kick Final Form Frieza's butt to hell and back (oh, also, the game includes a zenkai mechanic too, which raises your Saiyans' level if they heal back from 1 HP, so even more brokenness XD).

**** I remember trying it and not understanding the card system. Maybe I will give it a second chance this summer

***** Ah, the card system is a bit annoying because it relies on Japanese numerals up to 7, so you need to know those... but basically, the way I remember it is like this:

- the upper left corner Dragon Ball represents the offence. It's 1 to 7 dots (so that's easy...), plus Z which is basically a critical hit. The higher the offence, the higher the boost given to your attack.
- the lower right corner Dragon Ball is the defence. This one is in Japanese numerals. Some of the easiest kanji to remember, but still... /very/ easy up to 3 (as they're basically one, two, or three horizontal strokes), then they get a bit more confusing. Same as above, high defence = you take less damage.
- the figure in the centre represents the kind of attack. I never figured these much out except that if the square is blue instead of yellow, that's an energy attack.

All the stats apply as boosts to your character's base stats, so basically if you have a very strong character already and give them a Z attack card they'll obliterate almost anyone but the bosses, if you have a weak one then not even a Z defence may save them from being one-shotted. Ideally you want to save up those sweet, sweet blue background + Z attack cards as finishers to use in combination with your strongest characters, because those do /a lot/ of damage. The strategy is all in managing how and when you use those cards, balancing the need to attack and that to defend. It's a fun, if unusual, system, which IMHO well manages the randomness inherent in an RPG fighting system, as instead of being /entirely/ up to the RNG part of it is delegated to the cards and you can manage those, for example saving up your crits for when you need them.

******** Interesting unconventional design is not what big companies go after. Believe me, I would love to see what small indie companies would do with the licese. Number heavy games with deep character progression and customization, card games, resource management games (yeah, like trainer hordes of ki warriors). The possibilities are endless. Funny enough, today I tried griftlands, a rogelike rpg that mixes roleplaying with card games, fights and negotiation (yes, convincing people is represented through a card game). Just shows how creative indie developers can be

********* Well, I wasn't thinking specifically about a /Dragon Ball/ RPG. I just meant I'd have liked another RPG that fleshed out that sort of mechanic more. I know there are some RPG-card game hybrids ("Slay the Spire" has been on my wishlist for a while now) but I don't know of any that do something similar to what I described above.

(and if we're talking RPG-ish games using card mechanics... I loved the card-based dungeons of Hand of Fate)
