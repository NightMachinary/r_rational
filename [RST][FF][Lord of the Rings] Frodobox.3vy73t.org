**** Keep in mind that the scene in the movie with Elrond telling Isilidur to throw it in is an invention of the movies and it didn't happen that way in the books...

Also, what is the backstory to this alternate universe? Gollum I can imagine makes sense as he planned the optimal strategy for keeping the ring was to hide in the mountain. But I can't imagine how the rest of the Hobbit would have played out. Did Bilbo manipulate Smaug with the plan he formed with the ring? If the ring is as super corrupting as this version is, why did he ever take it off? How did Sauron lose in the first place... actually thinking about that question I wonder if Gandalf does have some move for destroying it and if Frodo isn't being outplayed.

****** I feel the same way. I was thinking about it one day: how it is possible to destroy the One Ring in this universe? My best solution was to recruit Saruman and genetically engineer dragons with a flame hot enough to melt the One:

#+begin_quote
  It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself.
#+end_quote

This passage isn't very encouraging per se, but it leaves the possibility of creating artificial superhot flame sources (maybe with dragon and some sort of industrial scale bellows).

Also, did I mention that Balrogs are Maiar, so Durin's Bane is a creature form the same tier as Sauron, Gandalf and Saruman? It looks plausible that Balrog could melt the One... or decide to keep it to itself, and then wreak a havoc on a Middle-Earth.

#+end_quote

Simple. Throw it into the Sun.

- The Sun is hotter than Mount Doom. If Mount Doom is hot enough to unmake the Ring, then so is the Sun.
- The Sun has a surface area about ten million times the surface area of the Earth, and any point on that surface will do. Sauron cannot /possibly/ have the troops to guard even a tiny fraction of a percent of it.
- Gandalf's magic can throw things around. This can be used as a reactionless thrust for steering the rocket.
- Ten minutes' conversation between Gandalf and a Ring-bearer should give Gandalf enough information to create a simple rocket, suitable for a single one-way trip to the Sun. (Gandalf already has fireworks).
- The rocket will, of course, need to carry a small crew, in case Sauron has some surprises prepared in orbit. Fortunately, since he would be expecting either an expedition to Mount Doom or the use of the Ring on the battlefield, he is unlikely to devote much resources to this remote possibility - especially since, as the rocket can launch from anywhere, it is hard to know where to intercept it.
- The crew will need to consist of, at the very minimum, Gandalf for steering purposes, a Ring-bearer, and a few others to keep an eye on each other and make sure that the Ring gets destroyed. If the crew is /extremely/ lucky, Gandalf may be able to find some way to turn the rocket around after the Ring is dropped into the Sun; however, it is almost inevitable that the crew will perish with the Ring. (I doubt this will stop the Fellowship from making the attempt).
- Once the rocket /has/ launched, it will be necessary to keep Sauron's Eye fixed firmly on the ground for as long as possible; a single glance skyward might easily result in the frantic construction of interception rockets all through Mordor. (Sauron will /not/ be expecting the craft not to turn around and come back, so he's likely to design any intercepters to try to catch the Fellowship only after they try to slow down - by the time he figures out that they're not planning on slowing down, it'll likely be too late to intercept them)

******** Unless "fast enough that it can't be intercepted" means /exactly/ fast enough so that you have to speed up for 100% of the trip, you should be able to speed up the rocket, toss the ring out, and slow down/change trajectory. The ring will continue on the trajectory of the rocket as of the time you thrw it out the window.

Also, depending on how magic works, you could conjure some U-235 or antimatter. Nuclear explosions are hotter than volcanoes.

********* While a force large enough to prevent the Ring being thrown into the Sun can't exist, a small contingent of orcs with perhaps a single Nazgul to provide steering /could/ wait in fairly close orbit around the Sun and intercept anything on a ballistic trajectory - assuming they have enough time to see it coming. So the Fellowship of the Ring will want to maintain the ability to see what's around and steer around it until they're close enough to the Sun to be sure that the Ring can't be intercepted.

At the same time, if Sauron ever catches wind of this plan, one or more orcish space programs could start up - they just need to accelerate /more/ than the Ring, catch up, and launch the Ring away from the Sun (another set of orcs can pick it up and return it to Sauron). Speeding up 100% of the time /dramatically/ reduces the odds of interception (at the same time, it increases the fuel requirements and thus reduces the initial acceleration of the rocket - some calculation would be necessary to find the optimal amount of fuel). Turning around requires carrying extra fuel without increasing the odds of destroying the Ring.

You would need to know about the properties of U-235 or antimatter. I don't see anywhere that the Ring provides extra knowledge about physics, it merely (and dramatically) increases intelligence, and I don't think Middle-Earths physicists have got that far yet.

But jokes aside, it doesn't happen eight minutes /later/, it happens something like fifty to a hundred /years/ later, and to do that they have to accept the industrialization that Sauron and Saruman represent. A space program is not exactly something a medieval society under attack by a growing evil can accomplish before being conquered.

[[/twiponder][]] That's not weird. That's geometrically impossible. Unless (a) the LOTR world was previously on some positively-curved but non-spherical geometry or (b) it ended up becoming a torus instead of a sphere.

Consider a triangle with vertices in far-distant places, like the Shire. Mordor and... um... Lothlorien. (Or any three far-distant places on the same continent which are not colinear). In changing from a flat to a spherical world, the three angles of that triangle /must/ change.

(Or, (c), the continent remains flat and just grows really big cliffs on all sides, but then the direction of perceived gravity on the outer edges will shift somewhat, rivers will start to flow towards the centre of the continent, and people will have to find paths down the cliffs in order to use ships at all).

** Okay, I can see what you were going for here - a cautionary tale of a boxed superintelligence escaping from said Box.

The thing is, I don't think you quite got it. To be fair, I'm not sure that it's /possible/ to quite get it.

I think - and this is purely my impression - that if you want to get what I think you were aiming for, then the impression you need to leave with your readers is not "the Council was tossing around the Idiot Ball" but rather "okay, I can see that they made the wrong decision from my privileged position outside the story, but I can understand /why/ they made it" (or, better yet, "okay, I can see that they made the wrong decision, but they didn't have any choice").

As it stands, I can see a lot of very simple ways by which the Council could have stopped the Ringbearer. First and simplest, is for Gandalf to stick with what he said - that he will not unparalyze Frodo until the Ring is removed (that is to say, to make Gandalf's precommitment binding). A second important point is raised by Elrond - "This idea depends solely on the word of the one who wears the Ring and one who wore it" - and /never answered/. Instead the word of one who /wears/ the ring makes promises - tempting promises, but the core objection, that their source is /one who wears the Ring/, is discarded and laid aside. One would think Elrond would spot that; one would think Gandalf would see that. That both of them promptly forget that point, /after/ it has been brought up, seems a clear indication that there's an Idiot Ball in the room.
