*** I'm not sure this is Black's doing. Killing most of the generals during the battle would neatly avoid any suspicion that could be thrown Cat's way but at the same time the legions are already losing. Without the generals to lead them I honestly can't see them winning this one.

If I was being cynical I would say this is Malicia's plan. Get rid of the Black & Cat power block and eliminate Akua at the same time. She would stand to gain the most if all three died in this engagement as it would mean she would be the only power in the Empire and she had a lot of plausible deniability if the plan doesn't pan out.

True. The kill could very well have come from Assassin. I've always suspected Assassin is her Spymaster and takes orders from Malicia and not Black. Remember that Assassin was in Procer when Black thought Assassin was supposed to be working on the Wandering Bard and nothing in the interludes thus far indicates that Black is actually close to Assassin.

Tinfoil theory: Cat will become the Black Queen and Malicia will marry Cat to seal the 2 kingdoms together, mirroring the Fae. It's already been setup by the fact that Cat notices Malicia is lesbian.

**** But she also decreases the power of the empire as a whole. Sure, she won't have any inner enemies, but when Procer comes knocking she is fresh out of Named, her armies are decimated and her best generals are dead. Those aren't particulary good odds, especially considering the Empires military leaders consider that war to be a challenge even with intact legions and Named.

***** That's cool and all, but having generals and armies only matters if that's the only way you can win.

Malicia has other plans at this point, using what she gets from Akua and combined with whatever she's been hiding, she may not /need/ armies anymore.

** Suspects for the murder:

Assassin, Certainly able, but the motive is muddy. Even if black is cleaning house, his actual team hasn't been shown to be on board with any supposed suicide pact for the sake of cat. Also, from what we've seen he generally kills with a bit more style.

Robber: He's a sneaky little bastard, and we haven't seen in him months, but the motive is even weirder. It would supposedly be at Cat's command, and she isn't certain enough of a win to risk offing commanders during the battle.

Akua's pet: The 15th cleared house, but Istrid's legions didn't. The motive is obvious

Cordelia's spys: Technically possible, but she made no assassination attempts outside her borders this far.

Malicia's spys: Malicia has eyes everywhere, and she has plans for the weapon, so some interventions by her can be expected. Still feels awfully confident to just assume you will win even if you start killing your own commanders

** Well this battle has turned into a complete shitshow. The only way I can imagine for the Legions to survive this would be for Catherine, Masego or Warlock to somehow seize control of either the wights or the gate. It shouldn't be /impossible/ given the importance of usurpation in sorcery, but I sure as hell can't see how they're going to manage it right now.

** Alright, time to test if this is truly rational fiction or not. If it is, we should be able to deduce who the murderer of Istrid Knightsbane was if we were paying close enough attention.

So who killed Mr. Body?

I think it was the Black Knight, with the Assassin, on the battlefield.

** When reading Masego's segment, I couldn't help but recall:

We hold all Earth to plunder---

All Time and Space as well---

Too wonder-stale to wonder

At each new miracle;

Till, in the mid-illusion

Of Godhead 'neath our hand,

Falls multiple confusion

On all we did or planned---

The mighty works we planned.

** We were missing someone to replace Scribe of the old Calamities - to be affiliated, shady, deadly and not technically a Calamity. It seems to me like Robber is taking that role and here he is, cleaning up the Legions loyal to the Calamities.

We know Scribe and Assassin have an odd relationship, Robber and Theif fit to have their own.

It also seems to me like Black is knowingly helping to achieve this by overextending his Sixth back in the start. Well played Black, as brutal as ever.

Also, Talbot, you misunderstand what the Empress is doing to your country. Annexation in truth because it comes with merger.

*** I don't think that was Robber. As the comments on the chapter discuss, Goblin steel weapons are standard for high-ranking members of the Legions. Cat herself wields goblin steel, iirc. So there's no reason to believe those last two paragraphs mean a goblin was responsible. It could easily be an assassin planted by Akua, or even by Cordelia to weaken the Legions in preparation of her crusade.

Technically there's also resurrected wights that wield goblin steel, but their blade wouldn't have been poisoned (Why poison your blade if you are gonna fight undead?)

So its someone from her side, and it happened during the fighting, or i imagine she would have felt it.
