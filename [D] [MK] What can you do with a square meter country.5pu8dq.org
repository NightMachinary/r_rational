** Data haven. Set up a server in your country. It is outside of the enclosing nation and therefore not subject to their laws. Host information that people from the enclosing nation don't want to have in a server their own country can legally get at.

Host services on your data haven that are not legal in the enclosing nation. Prostitution solicitation is the first one that springs to mind.

Open up an extranational (online-only) bank for people to hide their money in. Think Cayman Islands.

Incorporate companies under laws more generous than those of the enclosing nation.

*** Put your 1 square meter on an oceanic coast.

If you can, instead of making it an actual square meter, make it a 10 centimetres thick and 100 meters wide. Still 1 square meter.

Thanks to how the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_sea][law of the sea]] works, your coastline projects a set of national waters out into the ocean to a range of 12 miles at a minimum.

You also own all the natural resources on the seabed on that area, and your laws apply to that area. Other boats can cross it on the way through, but must obey your laws.

Choose an area near a transatlantic data cable, with good tidal / solar/ wind power options.

Now fill in some of that area to make an artificial island or two. Put your data center there.

While you're at it, build one of those fancy artificial lily pad style green islands.

There, I just hacked the system to up your land area by a factor of several thousand.

** *Short term:* Begin requesting embassies with all world governments. Embassies are granted land that are in effect, owned by their sponsor government, so this is a quick way to increase your land holdings. An embassy even on a measly 0.5 acre plot of land is ~2000 sq meters, so every successful embassy request represents approximately a > 2000% increase of your original land holdings.

*Medium Term:* Act as a asylum/defender of innocents/charity cause and receive non-profit donation status in other countries. Use your embassies as a way to shelter wrongly convicted/suspected foreigners from their host nation.

*Long Term*: Use charity proceeds and whatever funds can be acquired to create a lunar/mars/space colony. Earth is a long-term dead end, military conquest of land being non-viable due to WMD's and your lack of them. Space represents the only possible frontier to expand into.

** Assuming that the international community not only recognizes you but will continue to act as if you are a fully operational country and not just completely ignorable, you could use your international immunity as a diplomatic shield and declaration that other countries' laws did not apply to you, both for yourself and to any other legal entity you may choose to grant whatever rights to.

This means you can shelter internationally wanted persons (presumably in embassies rather than in a stand-on-each-others'-shoulders tower in your actual homeland). You could incorporate an unlimited number of companies and other legal and taxation structures. You could launder money, set up data havens, issue your own merch (stamps, flags, history books), have legal structures which allow external legal entities to funnel money and resources through you without trace (at least in theory).

You could send international observers and journalists to anywhere at any time. If you had the resources, you could interfere in wars, spy on other countries and people, technically /wage/ war. Claim islands in the middle of nowhere (and their surrounding waters) as your territory. Probably participate in the Olympics.

In the end, it's not about how much land you own, it's about how much power you wield, either overtly or covertly. Land is just a convenient placeholder to mark your legal jurisdiction as recognized by other national-scale entities.

You need to be more specific about what "get on their bad side" means. For reasonable definitions of "get on their bad side" it may mean that you basically don't have your own country after all (for instance, if not paying taxes to the country you are in counts as getting on their bad side).

** After a little more thought, here're some more ways to monetize being the king of your own country:

- Contract with some mint somewhere; establish your own fiat currency. I don't see how any investor would be interested, but you can at least sell coins to collectors.

- Contract with some printer; sell stamps to collectors. Maybe look into concluding some treaty so they can actually be used to mail letters.

- Establish a system of nobility, and sell titles. They don't even need to mean anything, but if you want, you can also establish a House of Lords that gets some input into what designs go on the stamps and coins.

- Also, since you have sovereign immunity, you don't need to pay any parking tickets ever.

It wouldn't be a consistent income, and it'd obviously depend on how you price the titles of nobility, but I think you could at least earn several thousand dollars a year doing this.
