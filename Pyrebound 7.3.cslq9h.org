â€‹

If you're new to Pyrebound, it's a fantasy serial (first installment is [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]]) about a young man struggling to make ends meet in a brutal world whose civilization has developed to endure a recurring four-day cycle of magical catastrophes. Much of the world is modeled on the ancient Near East, and it's quite a complex one.

If you're /not/ new to Pyrebound, thanks for following Ram so far, and for all the feedback, support, votes, etc. You guys are great.


** Well that went surprisingly well.

*** That reaction really says something about how poorly things usually go, doesn't it?

** This is not an important ask, but it would be nice to have links at the top to the previous/next chapters. You already have them at the bottom

*** I've noticed other stories have them; what is the use of such links? For when you're sifting through trying to find a particular chapter/update?

On a related note, should I tag particular posts with any specific type of information, e.g. characters appearing in it? At present I'm tagging everything with "novel" and crud like that.

Yeah. One basic use case is when you start reading a new chapter and you don't remember how the previous chapter ended.

**** I'm not sure about tags as I rarely use them, although I know some people have appreciated character tags in Wildbow's works. The use of the links I requested is as you stated: They are useful for navigating through the site. If you're binging, it's nice having them on the bottom as you can read and just have it handy to click through to the next chapter. However, if you're archive-diving or searching for where you left off after a break, it's nice to have them at the top.

***** Okay, done. Sorry, WP doesn't let me put them at the very top of the page. At least, not without buying a premium plan. Top of the post under the title's the best I can do.
