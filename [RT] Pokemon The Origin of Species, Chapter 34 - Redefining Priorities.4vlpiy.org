  "Is Kemuri your lead, or your trump?" Red asks as he watches Blue run through drills with the shiftry during one of their rest stops.

  "If I can sweep with him, I will," Blue says. "But I know they're going to throw some bulk at me, and I'll have to wear that down with Gon and Maturin first. Ion will be the trump; if I don't reveal an Electric Type right away they might think I don't have one. Thanks again for him, Leaf."
#+end_quote

When I'm reading this, I don't know what these Pokemon are. I don't doubt they were well introduced earlier in the story, but with all the time between chapters being released, and spending some chapters focused on different characters and locations, I just don't remember anything about these minor pokemon characters (Gon, Maturin, Ion, etc) - the key thing I'd like to know is what Pokemon they are.

One way to handle this is to make a point of /always/ doing what you did for Kemuri, mentioning that it is a Shiftry in very close proximity to where you first use it's name in this chapter (at least the first, more uses probably better). Having to work this in everywhere might get annoying for you.

Alternatively, you could just put the Pokemon in brackets after it..

#+end_quote

That might feel a little inelegant. I don't think so, it gets the job done and we know to ignore it for the general flow.

I did find [[http://www.daystareld.com/pokemon-team-roster/]] but TBH I only bothered searching for the purpose of writing this post (and having the pokemon names in the above example). Another option would be to provide this information more easily/prominently at the start of the chapter. I have a further suggestion for this option; tie in to your source material - the games. At the start of each chapter involving Red/Blue/Leaf, add something like this at the start:

#+begin_quote
  ** Loading Save State **

  Red:

  Charmander { Scratch, Tail Whip, Ember, Smokescreen }

  Spinarak { Poison Sting, Night Shade, Sticky Web, Bug Bite }

  Caterpie { Tackle, String Shot }

  Pichu { Thundershock, Quick Attack }

  Nidoran { Poison Sting, Horn Attack, Double Kick }

  Blue (Earth Badge):

  Squirtle "Maturin" { Water Gun, Bubblebeam, Rapid Spin, Withdraw }

  Pidgey "Zephyr" { Gust, Peck, Wing Attack, Quick Attack }

  Shroomish "Gon" { Absorb, Leech Seed, Poison Powder, Stun Spore, Headbutt }

  Shiftry "Kemuri" { Razor Leaf, Extrasensory, Feint Attack, Leaf Tornado }

  Shinx "Ion" { Spark, Bite, Charge, Tackle }

  Ekans { Poison Sting, Bite, Acid, Wrap }

  Rattata "Joey" { Tackle, Bite, Quick Attack, Tail Whip }

  Zubat { Wing Attack, Leech Life, Poison Sting, Supersonic }

  Leaf:

  Bulbasaur { Tackle, Leech Seed, Vine Whip, Razor Leaf, Sleep Powder }

  Rattata "Scamp" { Tackle, Bite, Quick Attack, Tail Whip }

  Pidgey "Crimson" { Gust, Peck, Wing Attack, Quick Attack }

  Ledyba { Comet Punch, Supersonic, Silver Wind }

  Beedrill { Poison Jab, Twinneedle, Fury Attack }

  Wigglytuff { Sing, Pound, Disable, Round }
#+end_quote

Maybe that brings the feel away from being a story too much? Or maybe throw in some stats like days "played" for the characters for the extra game feel :)

The other advantage doing something like this would have is that unlike [[http://www.daystareld.com/pokemon-team-roster/]] which is up to date, and potentially includes spoilers, this list at the start of the chapter would be specific to that point in time and spoiler free.

I added a reference to Ion being the shinx, since he's a pretty new pokemon, but am still working on the best way to add in Maturin and Gon's species in the current dialogue. I really like the "loading save data" idea, that's pretty clever :) Ultimately it still feels like too bulky an opening to each chapter though. I'll think it over!

*** Including something like "Kemuri, my Shiftry..," whenever a named pokemon appears for the first time would somewhat defeat the point of giving them names. The names are an intentional way of seperating them from the generic shiftry. If this was a story about literal pet dogs, cats, etc. I would imagine it would feel more natural to call them by character names, and more "important" in the readers mind to remember them.\\
I think that this problem might be helped a little if when names are introduced for the first time, there is a bit more of an explanations why those names were chosen, to solidify the sort of, metaphorical leap the name conveys between the generic shroomish and the specific Gon.

However, to completely contradict my whole point, I think it would actually be useful after story breaks like interludes to reintroduce the names of Pokemon, especially if they haven't been seen for awhile.

**** It would certainly be unnatural for the characters to do that in dialogue. Red/Blue/Leaf would know their pokemon by name.

But if you look at the shiftry example, it is not in dialogue. It reads quite nicely and adds information. This is what I meant by "Having to work this in", it will take time and effort to find fresh ways to fit it in naturally in so many places.

** It's too bad that Red's plan for getting Abra didn't work out right away, but I liked it a lot. It's been a while since we've seen him come up with something like this. His plans are consistently clever and also carry a sort of signature of taking advantage of pokemon's instincts in various ways: they're very /him/ and very Ratfic, imo. It also makes me happy to see the faith that Blue and Green have in him.

Generally, I am quite happy with the developments in this chapter. The slow update pace, the high level of detail and large world, and [[/u/DaystarEld]]'s commitment to reasonable-ish rates of success make for a story that is sometimes a bit slow. In this chapter though, Red has finally started to devote some time to developing his abilities, and I am looking forward to future progress in this area. We also saw a bit of a timeskip during their journey, which was carried off well, and I hope there will be more of this sort of thing in the future, if only to speed up the development of the characters a bit. The more I think about this story, the more potential I think it has, and I can't wait to see these three start to act on a larger scale. Some of Daystar's comments on the podcast have caused me to revise upwards my estimation of where Red's ambitions will take him, and given his repeated references to Legendaries in and out of the text, I'm sure we'll see great things there.

Absolutely. Now that the majority of the groundwork for the characters and world's establishment is done, I'm planning more plot focused chapters.

*** One question I have about Red's plan is how they will set up the whole trap. It will be in an area containing wild Pokémon that might interfere, so setting up the speakers and getting ready in the centre would both run the risk of battles. In order to avoid scaring the Abras off before they start the experiment, they'd have to either deal with any other encounters quietly and discreetly, or set up and wait for the Abras to return. Neither of these options seem particularly practical. Looking forward to seeing how Red deals with this, and the other difficulties that will doubtless beset the experiment!

** Hey everyone, welcome back! A couple quick notes: First, I hope those of you who've been listening to my podcast have been enjoying it, and I'm sorry if you've tried to download it without being able to. The current limit is 100 per episode, which apparently gets hit really quick after uploading each. Thanks to the continued support of my patrons, starting next week we'll likely go for the monthly paid account, which should allow for more downloads to be available!

Second, I hope everyone who's playing Pokemon GO's been having a blast with it. I haven't been able to play it as much as I'd like, and it's definitely not everything I wanted out of a pokemon AR game, but I've been enjoying playing it with friends here and there. What I do want to say is thanks to any readers who've been spreading the word about my story while you're out and about to fellow pokefans: after one of my readers admitted to doing so, I noticed that fanfiction's traffic graph is showing a steady upward tick ever since GO came out, beyond the usual, occasional spikes from it being linked somewhere on the web. until the average views to has nearly doubled from its usual mid-month resting point. It's humbling to know how much you guys enjoy the story, and I hope others have enjoyed it too.

Recent loss of the tracking aside, happy hunting to all! (Especially Team Instinct!)

** I think the psychic/sensitive/dark trichotomy is interesting. Perhaps each is on its own spectrum, rather than all lying on the same one.

Possible line of inquiry: is there any degree of variability with being dark? For example, are there some people that are /hard/ to read, but not impossible?

If so, it's possible that it reflects a separate skill in its own right, and perhaps one that could be trained like psychic ability if it had an organised group of practitioners. The story has set up the fact that they really don't organise, due to stigma and the fact that the psychics dominate the scientific and popular narratives.

If not, why? What do dark people have/lack that results in a complete inability to interact with psychics and sensitives? It must either be something they have/lack or do/don't, and that something could provide the key to unravelling psychic phenomena in general.

My hypothesis is that the "dark spectrum" could have its own gradations that haven't been adequately explored because of the society they live in. If the narrative is "psychic > sensitive > normal >> dark", then people who are merely "slightly dark" will mentally put themselves in the "normal" bucket.

In this hypothesis, "dark" would mean "aptitude with mental defences". The stereotypical dark person would be both skilled in this area and unable to modulate it (much like Red can't modulate his psychic powers, if indeed he is psychic and not sensitive as a separate category).

** I was recently rereading the whole fic, and I think I found a pretty big mistake in Red's paper on Spinaraks.

While looking for correllation with Night Shade attack strength, Red checked a multitude of parameters, such as weight, "other" and other. However, he didn't seem to make [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem][multiple comparisons correction]]. The more parameters you check for correllation, the bigger is the chance that you'll find your correllation simply by chance. The most common multiple comparison correction is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction][Bonferroni correction]], which is simply dividing statistical significance level by the number of comparisons you make. So, if Red tested, say, 10 parameters, he would have needed to squeack by not with 0.05, but with 0.005... which he promptly failed, since he got p-value of 0.048.

Ah, the chewing out Red got from Oak over his plan suggestion had me laughing a fair bit. He was so suspicious!

My, tech's cheap in the poke-verse if Leaf can nab a laptop with her available funds. Presuming she's just got ~150 pokedollar like Red, that is. The ups of functionally hitting the singularity, or something?

...Oh, crap, Leaf triggered a political issue. That's going to be a problem~

They carry around multiple little pocket sized balls that can transmute living beings into data and store them, among other things. I doubt a laptop would cost much.

** And another question; in this story you've established that psychic power is genetic. However, is it genetic in the way muscle building is in real life, or how intelligence is defined in real life? To elaborate, if you're born an ectomorph in today's world, you're never going to win the strongman competition, but you can still get pretty damn strong. Do psychic powers work like that, with people able to make definite, concrete gains, or is it more nebulous like intelligence, with some psychics simply not being able to do some advanced skills and no one really knows why?

*** Thanks for the questions, first person to ask this :) It's a sort of mix of both. There are three major factors to psychic powers:

1) Inborn ability. The way people in the world conceptualize it, you either have it or you don't. If you put a scale on it, 1-10, those in the 1-2 range would be sensitives, and humans don't generally go above 5-6, which is where psychic pokemon start. Alakazam would be a 10. Mewtwo isn't a known entity yet, so his abilities are off the scale.

This scale effects everything you do as a psychic. It's like a "general intelligence" score, your ability to comprehend new ideas, retain information, and think critically.

2) Your abilities. Telepathic Reading (reception),Telepathic Communication (projection), telekinesis, hypnosis, healing (pokemon only), teleportation (pokemon only), etc.

These aren't binary, so technically everyone might have access to all of them. But as far as humans can tell, there are some that no human has been able to accomplish, the ones labeled "pokemon only," and some people are so bad at some common ones that they effectively don't have the power. Which leads to:

3) Your training. People can improve their skills by instruction and practice, though there seem to be hard limits on individuals.

So combining all three, if we were to make a "beginner" character sheet of a psychic human, it might look like this:

Psychic (can't be improved by any known means)

Level: 4 / 10

Psychic Abilities (can be improved)

T. Reception: 1 / 4

T. Projection: 1 / 4

Telekinesis: 0 / 3

Hypnosis: 2 / 5

** I'm not sure if it has been asked already, but could you make .epub files available for Patrons? I can make it myself with ficsave, but it's a pain in the butt from mobile so I have to wait until I'm back to the PC to do it.

** It will be interesting to see if, as Red grows closer to his pokemon, he chooses one of them over a human at some point.

** Just a quick question now that Red is looking to catch a psychic Pokemon. Seeing as a psychic Pokemon attacks the mind, would a psi blast have the potential to knock out Red's mental blocks?

*** It would be very unlikely, like shooting someone at exactly the right place to destroy a tumor. And even if it does, the resulting trauma of having the "bandage ripped off" could be more harmful than helpful.
