** If I tell a Druid "you shouldn't have been able to do that" after they just did something, my statement is clearly false in the sense that the Druid's magic worked anyway. I wonder if this implies that the important thing is the Druid's confidence in their magic. A way to test this would be to feed a blinded Druid a plausible but incorrect explanation of why their magic shouldn't work and then see if they're rendered unable to cast the spell again in the future.

The fact that better understanding of the precise mechanics of something a druid is trying to do is sometimes detrimental to them trying to do it intuitively doesn't imply that worse understanding equals infinite power.

All the talk about memetics and what not seems to be overlooking the simplest answer which is that the locus is deliberately trying to throw attempts to analyse it so that any spell being cast for the express purpose of trying to understand how it works OR by someone who is naturally inquisitive OR somewhere where someone naturally inquisitive would have the opportunity to study it would fail because the locus doesn't want to be understood and would prefer to die rather than have its secrets revealed.

I agree.

Though my guess would be that the "detrimental understanding" thing is a feature of the magic itself, rather then something the locus is doing.

** A solution to the magic system being not "magical" is to have rules, but not have those rules all known to the player. So the players can have their set of spells, but because they don't know everything about the magic system they can't rule out lots of potential spells or circumstances without learning more. Because I've read it recently, a good example is The Gods are Bastards. The author has said that his magic system is basically completely mechanical. But because no one in the setting, aside from the deities, really knows how the magic works sufficiently well, there are regular occurrences of things that the characters think should be impossible.

You then have a system that still retains that hint of mystery and exploration, while not being completely arbitrary or plot driven.

Another option is, to paraphrase Douglas Adams:

****** I don't see why not. As long as the DM is willing to keep coming up with new kinds of anti-aristotelean magic, a munchkining player could just treat them as guns with limited charges, where you "fire the gun" by learning enough about the given magic system to exploit it toward your ends (and in-so-doing prove to the DM that you now know enough about that system that it will then be taken away from you.) After "firing" the Foo magic system and having it disappear from the world, you then throw away your now-useless Foo MU, and roll up a new Bar MU to exploit the new Bar system.

(I guess that also assumes that the DM will tolerate perfectly-healthy characters committing suicide for obviously-munchkining reasons. But it's kind of rational in-universe, insofar as these characters presumably spent their whole lives learning Foo and now, with Foo gone from the world, they suddenly have no other skills and no identity.)

Heck, with a DM who really /likes/ coming up with new magic systems, you could make this into a whole /thing/. A meta MU class who studies whatever the new magic system of the week is, then forgets all those rules to learn something else the next week---or, in other words, a *Fad Mage*. In that case, the DM doesn't even have to remove the magic from the game once it's found to be exploitable; one of the rules of Fad Magic can simply be that its practitioners are guaranteed to get bored once they've mastered something, and then forcefully blow away all the old knowledge to start over again with fresh excitement on something new. Every other (NPC) practitioner can keep on using the system.

** I assume the author knows that the author's current portrayal either makes druids:

a) dumb or dangerously ignorant (explains why most of them got wiped out)

c)

extremely overpowered

(No clear limits on complexity, even if the amount of energy were limited. You can trick druids into performing really complicated spells by sheer virtue of them not realizing that it's supposed to be complicated)

I could see Queen-Administrator-level shenanigans that are even worse than Skitter at her most powerful. And that is only the beginning. From my understanding, they could create sentient plagues etc. ^{Blacklight^{TM}}

d)

the most immoral/insane (and possibly the most advanced) magic users in the setting? Because not being able to know something won't actually stop truly determined researchers, it just forces them to be more ruthless and strategic. It just slows the research down by a little if you have to kill or memory wipe your researchers every so often.

See the SCP wiki for the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub][antimemetics division]] and its operation procedures. Take a look at [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five][SCP-055]] for what I would consider the hardest thing to research, but they're still researching it.

They ARE not very nice because they deal with extinction-event-level antimemes.

Everyone there is more or less insane, and I wouldn't be surprised if the only reason they still exist were that they have ensured their own existence through a causality paradox of some kind that prevents them from being wiped out or automatically erases information that would cause this.

If that's how this druid operates, Juniper should be running away from them /yesterday/. For all we know the reason why she's the only druid left is that she used the other ones and their loci for experiments. Or maybe loci are the druid equivalent of Marion's memory eater.

e) The most vulnerable magic users

Again, see antimemes.

Even quantum mechanics is exploitable (performing extremely complex calculations), and that's literally the universe itself conspiring against you, not a magic entity that can be tricked into revealing its secrets by accident.

Edit: Here's a scary thought:

Memory-wipe-guided research is an interesting idea, yes. Two druids would be enough for this: one who would develop the magic to erase memory and be kept from research, another who would be conducting research and repetitively have the memory of it erased by the first one.

*** A combination of a) and e) sounds like the right answer, though a bit uncharitable. The thing about c) is that we're given to believe not that a druid can do anything they haven't concluded they /can't/ do, but that the more you know about druid powers the less potent (in terms of power, complexity, what have you) they are. Unless we've been intentionally misled, all signs point to druids having concrete limits that merely constrict the more clearly you see them.

I say a) and e) because the druids died out because they were fixed to unmoving loci so once they were found they couldn't run or hide, and also because their nature as unordered and natural meant they pathologically rejected any of the actions that could preserve them. Being fixed in location makes them very vulnerable, hence e), and their unordered nature counts as stupidity or ignorance in an oblique way, hence a).
