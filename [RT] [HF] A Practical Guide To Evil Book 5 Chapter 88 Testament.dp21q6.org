** I may be missing something, but Cat now has:

Persian horse archers, Roman Imperial heavy armored legions, Medieval French heavy horse with magic resistance, and mage lines trained by the most skilled living mage bar none (whether Masego is the most powerful is up for debate, but with Warlock dead the text seems pretty confident that Masego and Akua are the most skilled/knowledgeable).

And that's just her conventional military!

She has the patronage of goddesses of theft and destruction, close relationships with the two foremost living heroes of the age, a close relationship with the longtime companion of the greatest mortal evil, and the worshipful service of an entire race of magic stealthkill boogeymen.

And a reputation as a breaker, that leads people to just not even bother to fight when it's JUST HER.

******** nobody ever claimed it was the best, although it probably is still the best, i mean the gnomes probably don't use conventional military, being able to magically nuke what you disagree with means you don't need much military to solve your offensive needs, especially if you know the people you target don't have a magical nuke of their own.

*** WOG says that Masego (before, you know) and the Witch both having valid claim to the title of 3rd best sorcerer on Calernia, behind the Dead King and the Forever King (the elven ruler). So not quite the best, but close.

***** We don't actually know for sure, as the WOG states they are only fourth place and the third place, right after the elven king, has never appeared in the series so far.

So we don't know if this third placed is mortal or not.

** Can someone remind me what the 'hats' for Nicae and Penthes are again?

*** Nicae seems to have a dichotomy in the highest office of power between a Basileus from its royal line and a Strategos (more prominent and independent than a normal general, since Nicae is stuck between Ashur strangling their trade in the Samite gulf and Helike being Helike). Considering the origins of both those titles, Nicae is basically a mostly irrelevant Constantinople to Helike's early imperial Rome.

Penthes is a trade city on the eastern branch of Wasaliti. Between the first Hierarch hailing from there and their rulers calling themselves Exarchs (literally the greek word for a province's governor under the Byzanthine empire), either their legitimacy is the one closest tied to the power structures of the League as a whole, or the Exarch is just a leftover title from the occupation of Malificent II that the nobles of the city now fight over. The city itself, however, seems to be removed from the others culturally: they ostensibly worship Gods Above, and Myrmidon was born there, but the Exarch was said to have chased her away; their language is obscure enough that between the heroes only Myrmidon and Rogue Sorcerer speak it. Overall, it seems that Anaxares was right to call Penthes "a knock-off Mercantis".
