** This is a really well-functioning site, and I'm happy to see it continue to be used. Keep up the good work!

Edit: If I might make a recommendation: Include a "Not interested" button on recommendations. There are certain things I don't want to read too much, but can't (fairly) rate to make my recommendations page a bit more sparse.

Many thanks. It'll really help me find stuff to read during the slow parts of my shift at work.

  Ruby on rails is a sexy beast, which can only be described through experience (it makes developing web apps much easier).
#+end_quote

I've used it. It definitely makes things easier if you're working in the expected conventions, although it gets a little hairy as soon as you want to step off the rails. Definite timesaver for many kinds of websites, though.

  The average rating is an average of all ratings for that work, while the bayesian average rating takes into account the number of ratings for that work, the number of ratings for the average work on the site, and the average rating for the average work on the site.

Could you point me to the math of how that works? The nerd in me just yelled, "HEY, STATS!"

**** I think he was referring to sorting by tags. "Exclude [tag]" or "Include [tag]." The way it currently is, you can't even search by tag, and you can't put together combinations of tags that suit your interest.

****** I found it, but I didn't notice it at first. It might be more noticeable if you put the filter directly under "All Works" or change the color or font size or something. A suggestion: when you change filter categories, the list doesn't go back to the first page as you would expect it to. If you were on the second page of the old filter categories then when you change the categories you end up on the second page of the new categories.

** One thing I would like is to see an Amazon-style breakdown of the ratings. (5-star x4, 3 star x5, 1 star x1, etc)

Something else: profiles of the users so that we can see what works they have rated and what ratings they gave them. This would function like a reputation / matching system, where you could identify people who had tastes similar to your own and follow them.

**** The other reason it would be useful is because it would make clear whether a mediocre rating is a consensus or if several people liked it and one person hated it.

Although that might be evened out by your Bayesian average -- I'm not clear on how that works.

If someone wants to add RationalReads to the Rational Fiction page, then it'll have to be someone other than me because I'm not a Troper.

One example would be [[http://rationalreads.com/#/works/71][Chanson De Geste]] which claims that I've rated it five stars, when in fact I've never even heard of it.
