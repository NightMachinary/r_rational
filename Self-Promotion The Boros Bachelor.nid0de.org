This rational fiction is based on a D&D adventure set in the Magic: The Gathering world Ravnica. Unlike most of its kind, we do create consistency and balance within the setting, and with what characters can realistically do!

That doesn't mean they can't get up to plenty of fun shenanigans - Meet Mav, son of a famous skyknight, and Lilla, orphan vedalken raised by the Gruul clans. Together with a colorful cast of characters, Mav and Lilla strive to uncover the secret identity of Rocman, a mysterious serial-scroll vigilante come to life. Will our heroes bring this villain to justice? Or is there more to Rocman than meets the eye? Chapter 31, now available.
