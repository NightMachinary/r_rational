Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I don't know how to properly research things.

Let's say that I read a report or news item that says eating a pound of peanut butter a week will stave off alzheimers or something equally weird and/or significant (keeping my mental health throughout the aging process is pretty significant to me).

How do I properly understand that this is or is not true? I can look at the sources that the article quotes, and I have done that before, but I don't know how to properly analyze the information in a research paper, and I also know, although I don't know how likely it is, that scientists lie, or mess up, or get paid off, or simply draw the wrong conclusions because research is fucking difficult.

Is that just how things are, and I just need to do my best and try to educate myself enough that I can make my way through dense research papers and come out with enough information to be able to say, "Yes, that seems correct"?

I've struggled with this especially regarding history and politics. Although science is there as well.

If you are an american, you, like me, were probably taught that we, more or less won the vietnam war or that Christopher Columbus was real neato.

Those are both false. So what else is false? How true or horrific was the U.S. involvement in South America during the 60s up until the 80s?

Communism sounds nice, in a theoretical way, but has lead to some of the most horrific dictatorships and mass slaughters in the entire world, so has fascism, so has capitalism. How do we parse what we are told and come to anything even approaching facts?

I don't actually expect a magic bullet here, but I am curious as to what other people think, in part because I think a lot of the people here are a lot smarter than me and can do things I can't. And I kinda feel like I am asking this, for me, certainly, but also as part of the group of people, I suspect, don't know how to read research papers, and don't have a group of friends who are hardcore about their specialized fields, and this is something I struggle with.

That ended up being a lot. But I would appreciate any feedback, and I am not sorry, but I do understand that this is maybe not where this question or post should go? But I don't know a better place?

thanks

What level of certainty do you want?

You can trust that the scientist(s) who wrote the paper were competent in their field, and did their honest best to find what was true. (And if you then have any way of knowing better than them under those conditions, then you could have written the paper, given access to experimental results).

You could hire a competent scientist in the field to read the papers for you, and give you an estimate as to how sure you can be in the conclusion. He /will/ know how to analyze that information, and you will know he is not being paid to lie to you (since you are paying him) - so assuming that he is indeed both competent and ethical, you should get a pretty good answer as to whether or not it is true.

This does not, of course, prevent the possibility of the scientists who wrote the paper getting it /wrong/. The only way to check at that level, I think, would be to re-run (or pay someone to re-run) the experiment yourself; also making sure to check experimental method and other details.

But. This is a lot of effort to go to on the basis of a single claim about peanut butter and alzheimers.

How far do you want to go? How much certainty are you looking for?

**** Well, ideally, enough to make personal decisions on, so a lot of certainty.

But here's the thing, what you described is a hell of a lot to do for just 1 article that may or may not be very significant. There are literally thousands of articles that may or may not be signficant to me, and it would be a very poor plan to pay scientists to verify that many articles.

Also, how do you determine if the scientist is trustworthy? What other sources do you use to figure out his/her credibility? How do you judge that credibility?

Essentially, if why we believe what we believe is that someone we trust told us; how do we make sure that our trust is correct in a way that isn't so difficult or time consuming or money intensive that it is unreasonable?

***** There's two separate questions here.

Question the first: How do we know that a scientist, presenting new science in an article, is correct in his beliefs?

Question the second: How do we know that a scientist, presenting new science in an article, is not lying to us in some manner (e.g. falsifying results, drawing incorrect conclusions)?

The answer to the first question - we don't. However, we can be sure that a scientist, trained in a field we are not trained in, is more likely than we are to make correct predictions within that field.

The second question is more tricky. We need to consider plausibility, how likely it is that a sponsor paid for a paper to serve his own agenda, and whether the author has any motive to lie.

Like, say I visit my doctor and he is like, "Lower your cholesterol." And he says some things that make sense: Exercise, eat better, reduce stress, etc.

And then I go looking for further research. And I come across let's say 8 different articles with 8 different takes on what significantly helps lowering cholesterol. They aren't all mutually exclusive or anything, but let's say they all are fairly time intensive.

How do I determine which article to follow? And now multiply that problem (of cholesterol) by everything I want to improve at.

How do I parse that much information, when simply trying to read articles and keep myself (maybe) informed is already a difficulty in terms of balancing with other important life goals.

********* Hmmm.

Well, what I'd do is assume basic competence on the part of anyone who gets their article published in a journal.

If the journal or the article is sponsored by any player in the relevant industry, I ignore it. (Joe's Cholesterol Supplement will be able to find some way to get an article written that says that Joe's Cholesterol Supplement works if they really try). Apart from that, I assume that the scientist(s) who wrote the article really tried their best to get the science right, and, being trained in the field, their best is better than my best. So, when choosing which one(s) to follow, the best I can do on my own is to rank them in order of which method offers the most gain for the least trouble (and least side effects).

Of course, I don't have to do this on my own. Depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can hire experts yourself - only, instead of asking them to evaluate this or that individual article, you can ask them directly how to lower cholesterol. Or you could find experts in your social circle and ask them. (Note that nutritionalists are not the only experts on things like cholesterol - high-end or aspiring high-end athletes are also pretty knowledgeable on medical issues, for much the same reason as why formula one drivers know their way around an engine).

*** To non-answer the smallest part of your question, we did generally accomplish our objectives in Vietnam, given that our objective was to kill as many VC as possible. Unfortunately, this was a poor strategy for winning a war of any kind, and we certainly lost the war on the optics front.

Our goal was to keep killing until the enemy lost the ability or willingness to fight, and we aren't really sure how close we got.

The issue is that every perspective has a different view of truth, and that there is no universal truth. Two people can believe different things that are conflicting and both true from their perspective. The solution to me is that we need to destigmatize rational thought, invest in education, and foster belief systems that take evidence into account.

**** Okay, so let me rephrase because while I totally agree with what you said regarding "ever perspective has a different view of truth" I am not sure that applies here.

In the peanut butter example. I don't think that has a perspective based truth. I think that is an example of like, "Gravity is a real thing" so make decisions assuming gravity is true.

That is what I am concerned about.

To take it back to the Vietnam example, and this is an example so it doesn't actually fully represent the issue; it is just a relatively easy way to talk about this, I was taught, in school, that we won the Vietnam war.

In a very simplistic way. We just won. We were the victors. Now, in your comment you even said, "Unfortunately, this was a poor strategy for winning a war of any kind", with which I agree.

Did we accomplish many missions in regards to Vietnam, like, as you pointed out, killing the enemy until they lost the ability to fight? We might have. But did we stop communism from spreading or win the hearts and minds of Vietnam? No.

So, the idea behind the example, is that it is a lot more nuanced and complex than what I was taught, and to be fair, this was what I was taught in, like, middle school.

But my point still stands. Issues and history is incredibly complicated. So figuring stuff out, stuff like science and food nutrition and acceptable risk and finances, even if we had all the facts lined up is difficult. And it feels nearly impossible when people obfuscates facts on purpose or not.

Does that make sense? I feel like I just did a kinda bad job of explaining.

It's a little harder than that, though. You need to figure out how to read history books, learn the common standards of historical evidence, and get enough of an idea what to read that you don't spend all your time reading radicals from one side of the spectrum.

And that's for areas where there's enough evidence to reach a decent conclusion. I haven't looked into US involvement in Latin America, but I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of significant evidence is still classified, so the historical method might not be able to reach the right answer there yet.

Wikipedia is a pretty good source of information too. I've read and trusted wikipedia before.

Now, for this specific example, we could both double check sources and come up with an answer. But that is just one thing in a sea of things I want to learn, and you can see how if a person had to do that amount of research and discussion before finding the actual facts it would be very difficult to feel confident in your decisions or understanding of the world.

It's not perfect, but it's a reasonable baseline. I've found that while Wikipedia often demonstrates a certain amount of implicit bias, the facts are usually unassailable.

Maybe a better question than "How do I overcome my ignorance?" would be "When should I be skeptical of a particular claim?" I would say be skeptical of everything. Once skepticism sets in, it's usually not too hard to find more information, assuming the topic is even worth studying. On the other hand, recognizing effects that turn off skepticism is harder.

I want to talk about dreaming. Specifically, exactly what the experience people call "dreaming" actually involves. Because I am genuinely confused by the way people talk about dreams and dreaming.

The TL;DR if you don't want to read the whole thing is that my best guess is that I don't experience dreaming in the same way as most people. The thing I mainly want to know is whether dreaming is typically or often "experienced" in a way similar to the experience of "perception," like when you're awake and experiencing the real world, or "imagination," like when you're thinking about stuff. (Or something else?) Is the experience vivid, detailed, and involving multiple senses? (Typically hearing & vision.) Are you embodied, or is it mostly just a series of disjointed sensations? What is the quality of the experience? (What is it /like/? For me, it's most like being lost in thought, but to a greater degree.) I want to know because if people typically or often dream in a way similar to perception, and it can be vividly real, and feel as if "things are happening to you," then that would explain a few things, for example why kids might wake up screaming after a nightmare and run to their parents. But if this is really the way it is, the typical response of "it's just a dream, don't worry, you're safe," seems /incredibly inadequate/. The experience is /legitimately terrifying/, and it is absolutely mind-boggling for me to consider that the things people say about dreams might be like, literally accurate. Because if that were the case, how are you not all terrified of going to sleep?

So, in more detail:

My interpretation of things people typically say about dreams is that they are experiences people have while not fully conscious (ie "asleep.") There's already several things that don't match my experience just in that short definition. For one, the "experiences" part. People talk about dreams as if they are sequences of things that happen to them; as if they see, hear, or otherwise /perceive/ things in a similar way to what happens when they're awake. That has never been my experience. I can relate to the whole disjointed scenes/images/sounds and so on, and even so far as making a "story" operating by "dream logic," but I don't /perceive/ these things. The /quality/ of the experience is exactly the same as when /imagining/ things while awake; in other words, for me, "dreaming" == daydreaming, but while lying down trying to get to sleep.

The other confusing thing is the "not fully conscious" part. People often talk about not being able to tell they're dreaming, and there's advice for "lucid dreaming," where people offer tips about how to tell whether you're dreaming and "take control" or whatever. Indeed, this unawareness is the whole premise behind /Inception/. But... I honestly cannot understand how anyone could possibly be confused about whether they're awake or dreaming. The experiences are /very obviously different/ for me. It's not a matter of needing "tips" or "realising it" or whatever: if I'm aware /at all/ then I'm not uncertain about what's going on. In that vein, "not being able to wake up" from a dream also doesn't make sense to me. I get that sleep paralysis is a thing, but it's not universal and thankfully doesn't happen to me. My experience is that, if I'm "experiencing" anything at all, then I don't consider myself "asleep." I never have trouble "waking up," if I am aware at all.

In terms of actual /sleep/, what happens is I gradually become less "focused," until (presumably) at some point my consciousness "dissolves" entirely (obviously I don't remember when this happens) and then at some future point, whether 30 minutes or hours later, I become aware again and am "awake." This is why I often tell people I don't dream, because if I do, I'm not actually experiencing it (or at the very least not remembering).

There were two specific occasions where this has been different, and seemingly more in line with what people seem to be talking about. Both times I went from awake, lying in bed to "dreaming" without loss of consciousness or awareness, and was consciously trying to "lucid dream." This is apparently called a "wake-initiated lucid dream."

These times, I was experiencing things more in the way I normally do while awake. It was still disjointed images (at first), but these were consistent and detailed, and I could act /as if/ I was perceiving them, for example reading the number plate of a passing car, or looking at the way the pixels on a (dream) computer screen made up the image, or reading the text in a book. In the last particular case, the text didn't actually make /sense/, but nevertheless it was much more vivid and realistic, and in every way a totally different experience from usual.

The first time, I eventually came to a point where I had a dream body, and was "experiencing/perceiving" things. The dream was nothing special: I was lying in the exact same position in the room that I went to sleep in, although I could look around so on. What eventually happened was that a weird, evil caricature of my grandmother came into the room and started grabbing me by the neck with claw-like hands. This got a bit scary so I had to wake up, even though this was the first time I had successfully "lucid dreamed" and it was entirely new experience. (That was why I was reluctant despite not exactly liking the experience). I remained completely aware the whole time that I was dreaming, and that I could choose to wake up at any time. Nevertheless, it was scary, and I woke up with my heart pounding, and realised that my neck was sore from being badly positioned on my pillow.

The second time the dream was also that I was in the room where I went to sleep, in the same position, but this time I "got up" and walked around a bit. In this state it became harder to tell that I was dreaming; I still knew I was, but I couldn't directly feel it as easily. In the dream, a few people came to the door; one of them eventually went and started cooking something, and for the rest of the dream I heard sounds of cooking (pots & pans, microwave, extractor fan etc) even while other stuff was happening. These were extremely realistic and sounded like they were actually coming from the kitchen, given that I was in my room. But eventually I put a stop to it because it was starting to be hard to tell that I was not actually experiencing these things, and I wanted to check and make sure that I was actually still lying down where I originally was. That's the closest I've been to being unaware that I've been dreaming: still intellectually knowing but being unable to directly /feel/ the difference. But even just that much was a bit scary.

So, if I put together these experiences I've had and the things people say, the possibility arises that people actually experience things like this, /regularly/, /without/ being certain it's not real, /without/ being able to stop it at any time, and /scary things can happen/. Is this actually the case? Because, holy shit.

As far as telling the difference between dreaming and waking - I have on one memorable occasion, when I was still in school, dreamed my way through an entire day to the point where, when I woke up on the following day, I thought it was the day after. I do see things, and hear things, I do have a body in the dream - I don't /notice/ that anything is missing. (I also don't notice anything odd in the fact that I am, for example, wandering around the university I haven't visited in about a decade looking for an exam in I-don't-know-what subject). But, in retrospect, I don't think that's because nothing is missing - I think, rather, that the moment at which I start looking for something, the dream supplies it, so that I don't notice it wasn't there before.

It's not so much that I don't have a choice. It's more like I am not /aware/ that I have a choice at the time. Lucid dreaming, as far as I can tell (and I haven't ever really bothered with it much) would be mostly about realising, while dreaming, that I have a choice.

When I dream, it's an experience. (Sometimes it's a disjointed experience; sometimes I am not present, but merely somehow observing events that happen to other characters). Sometimes I only remember parts of the dream, which often don't make any sense in retrospect.

So, I guess the question then is, how often do I dream and remember my dreams on waking?

Not every night. Not even every week, I think. But multiple times a year, certainly. Perhaps once or twice a month? (I don't exactly keep records, so I'm not all that sure). It seems to depend to some degree on my state of mind - if I am anxious, I seem more likely to remember my dreams.

Most of my dreams are good ones - where I go swimming through the air or I can put my car key in a tree, turn it and drive the tree away. It's rare for me to have a bad one. Though I suspect that this changes from person to person as a function of general happiness and mental health.

  I'm not going to say "as bad as I thought" because I didn't actually believe it should be given how people behave.
#+end_quote

Would "as bad as you feared" be a reasonable description?

For what it's worth, I think that there do exist people who have things as bad as you'd feared. Such cases are both rare and tragic, and might be found (for example) in a war veteran who finds himself back in the trenches every time he falls asleep; I think that severe nightmares can be a symptom of both post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. And, in either case, this is something that requires the aid of a medical professional (to whit, a psychiatrist).

But, for most people - my dreams originate from within my own brain, with all the filters turned off. There's no part of me that's all that interested in scaring myself, and I don't have any particularly unsettling experiences to relive.

I do know that, in a significant fraction of people, watching a horror movie will lead to meeting the monster from that horror movie in their dreams for the next few nights - with vividness depending rather on the person in question. I think that's more a case of the mind trying /not/ to think of pink elephants and thinking of them anyway.

Curiously, nothing like that's happened for me since I was a kid, even when I've been really perturbed (if not scared) right before going to bed.

My guess is that a lot of people are unsettled /at the base of their mind/ by that - some part of them is actually, at root, afraid of unknown things in the world, and so things like horror movies can play on those subconscious fears. As far as I can tell, I'm not (in large part because of my religion, IMO), so I don't get those nightmares.

***** I second everything [[/u/ccc_037]]'s said about his dreams: I experience them in pretty much the same way, even down to the average frequency. For me, though, they often come in waves. I'll get a week with two or three of what I call "real dreams" or "interesting dreams," and then a month or two without any.

When I was a kid I sometimes had bad dreams in which I was legitimately frightened, but those almost all vanished... I'm not sure when, but definitely before I was fourteen. Now, I've had maybe one bad dream in the last four years. (I'm not counting the handful of "Oh my I'm back at college and forgot to go to this class all semester"; they're disturbing but not frightening. Curiously, I never had them till after I graduated.)

*** I dream fairly vividly and usually remember a few dreams a night, which I credit to dream journaling and making a conscious effort to think about my dreams for a few minutes after waking up.

#+begin_quote
  The thing I mainly want to know is whether dreaming is typically or often "experienced" in a way similar to the experience of "perception," like when you're awake and experiencing the real world, or "imagination," like when you're thinking about stuff.
#+end_quote

Somewhere between both of those for me. It's convincing as an experience while I'm dreaming, but after reflecting on it while I'm awake it has a slightly imaginary quality. If you were to put it on a scale between imagining and experiencing, I'd say it might be about 80% leaning towards experiencing. Though take that with a grain of salt, because I might also have a poorer than average ability to imagine things while awake.

#+begin_quote
  Is the experience vivid, detailed, and involving multiple senses?
#+end_quote

Vivid, but I feel like the mind glosses over a lot of detail and you just don't notice while you're dreaming. Yes to multiple senses, I've experienced the main five in dreams.

#+begin_quote
  Are you embodied, or is it mostly just a series of disjointed sensations?
#+end_quote

Definitely embodied.

#+begin_quote
  I want to know because if people typically or often dream in a way similar to perception, and it can be vividly real, and feel as if "things are happening to you," then that would explain a few things, for example why kids might wake up screaming after a nightmare and run to their parents.
#+end_quote

Yes, the experience of "things happening to me" is definitely, 100% what makes nightmares awful. I very rarely get them, but even as an adult they can be pretty bad and have a lasting effect on me for a few hours after waking depending on what it was exactly. I can still make myself feel mildly panicked by thinking about one in particular.

#+begin_quote
  But if this is really the way it is, the typical response of "it's just a dream, don't worry, you're safe," seems incredibly inadequate.
#+end_quote

It's the exact right thing to put distance between yourself and the experience though.

#+begin_quote
  Because if that were the case, how are you not all terrified of going to sleep?
#+end_quote

For me, nightmares are so incredibly rare that they're not worth worrying about. For people that have reoccurring nightmares, they actually can become terrified of going to sleep though. Here's a blurb from WebMD:

"What Are the Health Effects of Nightmares in Adults?

Nightmares become much more than bad dreams when they have a significant effect on your health and well-being. Among people who experience nightmares, those who are anxious or depressed are more likely to be distressed about the experience and suffer even more psychological ill effects. Although the relationship is not understood, nightmares have been associated with suicide. Because nightmares may have a significant impact on your quality of life, it's important to consult a medical professional if you experience them regularly.

Sleep deprivation, which can be caused by nightmares, can cause a host of medical conditions, including heart disease, depression, and obesity.

If nightmares in adults are a symptom of untreated sleep apnea or post-traumatic stress disorder, the underlying disorders can also have significant negative effects on physical and mental health."

#+begin_quote
  I honestly cannot understand how anyone could possibly be confused about whether they're awake or dreaming
#+end_quote

When I'm awake, I'm 100% sure I'm awake. There's no confusion for me as I type this for example. When I'm dreaming, it's like I'm experiencing things with my critical faculties turned off. It's impossible for me to tell I'm dreaming because it's not the kind of thing that I'd ever think to ask myself while I'm dreaming, if that makes sense. When weird things happen, they don't set off any alarm bells.

#+begin_quote
  People talk about dreams as if they are sequences of things that happen to them; as if they see, hear, or otherwise perceive things in a similar way to what happens when they're awake.
#+end_quote

Would definitely agree here.

#+begin_quote
  So, if I put together these experiences I've had and the things people say, the possibility arises that people actually experience things like this, regularly, without being certain it's not real, without being able to stop it at any time, and scary things can happen. Is this actually the case? Because, holy shit.
#+end_quote

Yep! Every night pretty much night, and it's not as bad as it sounds.

**** I /wish/ I remembered a few dreams a night. When I do, at least half the time it's really fun. How do you think dream journaling helps? When I don't remember dreams, usually they're gone within a moment of my opening my eyes, so I wouldn't be able to even begin writing them in a journal; do you think journaling the dreams I do remember would help change that?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That's almost always the case for me - but there've been a few exceptions. Once in a while, I've noticed something weird right before I wake up. And then there was one memorable dream from when I was out camping with my dad when I was seven or eight or so, when I remember going around $Place in my dream asking my dad "How did we get home from our camping trip? I don't remember!"

***** Well first off thanks for your comment, it helped me clarify my thoughts about the whole thing while trying to type up an answer.

I think dream journaling works by forcing you to pay conscious attention to your dreams in a critical period that happens immediately after you wake up. The same effect can be had if you lay there and think about / mentally replay your dream before letting your mind wander anywhere else after you wake up. Right now that's all I do, I don't journal any more but I take a very short moment to think about what I dreamed and that's what causes it to stick. Your memories are there, I think it's a recall issue because if I wake up and get distracted immediately I'll still end up forgetting what I dreamed too. On those occasions, some times I can remember if I try really hard, but it's a bizarre kind of experience to remember one thing about what you dreamed and then suddenly go "Oh right!" and have the rest of a long dream suddenly available to you.

*** I rarely dream, but often when I do dream it's awesome, multi-viewpoint-character epics. I have multiple senses, with vivid, consistent scenes taking place one after another, with consistent narrative structure linking them together. They often don't make sense, but I often times see recurring setting or images happening in my dreams.

I don't really get nightmares. Sure, scary things can happen in my dreams, but dreams are very very far away from my waking life. I'd say that the experience is closest to watching a scary movie. Sure, it can be freaky in the moment, but the brain quickly moves on to other things. Even though it gets a first person perspective on the action, it just doesn't hold any relevance to my waking life. Saying "It's just a dream" is the same thing as "It's just a movie"

** To start us off: Someone at work put out some colouring-in equipment on a table next to a sign that reads something like "Research shows 5 minutes of colouring repetitive designs is equivalent to 30 minutes meditation".

I did some quick Googling and did find a paper about colouring-in improving attention: [[https://kar.kent.ac.uk/56833/]]

One paper isn't definitive but I might give it a go this week during morning breaks and see if it affects my productivity at work.
