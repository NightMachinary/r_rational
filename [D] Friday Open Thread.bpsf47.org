Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I'm on vacation in Europe and I'm not sure if I'm experiencing more racism than in the US or if I have an inferiority complex. Either way, I don't like it.

*** As a brown-skinned person I definitely experienced more racism while visiting Europe. It's to be expected because they are much more racially homogeneous than the US. Look at how Sweden for all its supposed progressiveness is having such a strong right wing turn following immigration despite still being more than 80 percent white.

**** Well, there's also less charged history with race though. From the outside, it seems to me the US has more seething issues under the skin, but also has developed more ways to deal with them or at least bury them under a pretence of nicety at the surface level.

In Europe you're certainly more likely to get people assuming you're a foreigner for looking different, but I wouldn't consider that "racism" per se, though it can be annoying. Will you meet xenophobia? Yes, and that's on the rise, but heavily dependent on your country of origin. Will you meet actual, bona fide white supremacists who believe in genetic inferiority of black people? Possibly, but I suspect those are actually less than in the US.

*** I don't know what part of Europe you are in, but when I was in France, there was far more racism there than in the US.

Our group was mostly Indian subcontinent, and quite a few people complained in French about the "dirty foreigners" on the assumption that none of us could possibly understand them. We frequently got poor service in restaurants and in general met a lot of surly people.

This wasn't just our group being jerks; in the same month I went with a group that could pass as European (mostly Americans actually) and things were far more pleasant.

So it's not just you.

*** Hm, hard to say. Probably depends on a) your race, and b) the country you're in. If you look Arab or so you'll probably have it worse in some places, while in others you'll literally just blend in with the locals if you're on the lighter skin end of the spectrum. I don't think there's much against Asian people, especially Chinese/Japanese/Korean, but that depends on the country possibly. Black people... depends, again, but my guess is in that case origin would matter more than looks. In Italy at least you may be looked down upon if you're African, but whip out an American accent and I expect that to change. Though dunno how things changed in these last years, it's not gotten pretty.

Australia isn't Europe but racists here definitely target the Chinese because they're perceived to be "buying up" a lot of our land/businesses/etc and the Japanese are perceived to be "generic annoying tourists", so I would be very surprised if places with more tourism and/or worse economies weren't similarly annoyed by them. Whereas here I think racists don't so much mind dark-skinned people of African descent but do mind Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander peoples and people from the Indian subcontinent. But who knows, I'm in a white progressive bubble.

***** Well, Australia is closer to China. I guess the immigration fluxes may be different. Me, being from Italy, I can tell you most definitely right now it'd be Africans and people from the Middle East who would have it worse. The Chinese might be looked at with some suspicion, partly because they tend to form really secluded communities, send children to study back in China and such, but I think most people just consider them as minding their own business and not as potentially 'dangerous' the way they tend to fear Africans, or anyone who they perceive as being probably a Muslim. Next on the list are probably some of the Eastern European peoples, and Roms especially. The Japanese and Koreans aren't much common but they certainly aren't seen as anything particular. They do not emigrate usually, after all; they only visit as tourists, and even that hit peak in the 90s (the economic crisis made Japan a bit poorer after that). And it's Italy, we've got a lot of tourists, in fact some regions outright live off them, so you get used to it.

*** My understanding is that in Europe they care more about nation rather than "race" per se. You're British, or French, or German, or whatever, based on what country you are from. Nobody cares about the color of your skin, or where your ancestors originate from but they do care about where you yourself are from, and are willing to openly discriminate based on that.

The U.S. is one of the most tolerant countries on the planet, the fact that we have so many people complaining about racists proves how much we care in the first place.

** A showerthought: let's say I wanted to create the ground rules of a science-fictional universe which has lots of culturally distinct civilizations.

Right away there is a problem to overcome: the very first intelligent life form that arises is probably going to come millions or billions of years before all the others (because the creation of life is such a rare event). That head start gives it an enormous technological advantage. The civilization built by that life form might want to make sure no other civilization ever rises to threaten its existence (which might happen between two civilizations through mutual distrust and prisoner's dilemma type arguments).

That civilization might feel threatened because the technological advantage from being first won't last forever: at some point everyone will likely reach the point where you figure out all the laws of the universe, and also figure out more or less everything that can be usefully done with them. The first civilization could ensure its survival either by direct conquest, occupation, or more indirect methods of influence (for example, covertly shaping the cultural evolution of other life forms as they arise).

Well, how about this: I'll make sure that, starting from any planet, you can only ever reach a small part of the universe. How can that be done? I suppose I could put in uncrossable barriers (maybe it looks like empty space, but if you try to move past you just stay in the same place) but that is difficult to incorporate into physics, and besides it might lead to the civilizations in question to devoting much of their efforts to theological speculations about the origin of these barriers.

How about this: create a limit on how fast anything can travel, and then also make sure all the planets are moving away from each other at high speed, with more distant planets moving away progressively faster. That way if two planets are far enough apart, they'll be moving away too fast for one to ever be reachable from the other.

Oh wait a second...

*** That's a nice showerthought! It sounds like an elaboration of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle][anthropic principle]], or a combination of it with the fermi paradox.

If the universe were such that 1) an alien civilization develops billions of years ago, and persists, 2) for whaetver reason, they are pre-disposed to eliminate all future civs, and most importantly 3) it is physically possible to go on a universe-wide preventative genocide. If all these were true, then you wouldn't be around to remark how curious it is that the universe isn't that way, like you're doing now.

*** I'm actually struggling to think whether I can conceive a completely consistent set of rules for a universe /without/ a finite speed limit (for world building purposes) and I can't find one. Granted, fundamental physics are already mind-bogglingly complicated as they are, so having to rewrite them from the grounds up ain't exactly easy, especially since simply having c go to infinity is likely to break most of it...

**** You might be interested in Greg Egan's /Orthogonal/; it's set in a universe where the Minkowski metric has signature (+,+,+,+) instead of (-,+,+,+) like in ours.

The author has written some essays on the physical consequences of this, which he's [[https://www.gregegan.net/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html][published for free online]]. One of the immediate consequences is that there is no universal speed limit.

***** I've read it! Egan's work on that is amazing, but still, it's relatively simple compared to what I had in mind, which was removing entirely relativity from mechanics. All he does is change a single /sign/, and even that fucks up almost all of physics into something unrecognisable (and it must be said that Egan found a very clever way around the problem of solving differential equations in a ++++ spacetime. There is a paper by Max Tegmark that explored this among other possible dimensionalities and metrics, and it seems to suggest that really, our -+++ is the only one in which life can evolve).

***** Not easy at all. You're just thinking cosmology. Try rewriting quantum field theory, relativistic quantum mechanics, and electromagnetism with an infinite speed of light... my best guess is you could have a finite speed for EM waves, but it /not/ be the fundamental speed limit of everything. However, in QFT as we know it, that'd be a weird thing, because it would mean either photons have mass (and then behave in some weird way that resembles more what other particles do than actual photons) or everything goes tits up and we're in no man's land. Of course QFT itself was born out of the necessity of making QM fully Lorentz-invariant, and with no light speed, that's not a requirement any more, so what would we have in its place? I can think of a /classical/ quantum field theory, I don't think it's impossible, but working out what that would be like, well. It isn't easy.

******* The thing is, having c > 300,000 km/s but /finite/ only brings about quantitative change. Taking it to infinity is a whole another matter entirely.

Out of the top of my head, merely increasing it would certainly change a lot - for example the energy released in nuclear reactions, probably the rates at which certain processes happen, not to mention the relative strength of electric and magnetic fields. But make it infinite and off the top of my head I think you'll get:

- decoupled electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell's equations (rot B ~ 1/c^{2} dE/dt)
- infinite rest energy for matter (E = mc^{2)}
- no gravity (there's a 1/c^{4} term in front of the stress-energy tensor in Einstein's field equations)

That doesn't look like our universe - indeed, it doesn't look like /any/ universe, the whole of physics basically breaks down. So you need to go deeper than just our equations, assume some more fundamental principles, assume that Newtonian + quantum mechanics is all there is, and then rederive everything from there.
