12. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] Description: Slytherin!Hermione. A golden gem with the most competent Lockhart I've seen anywhere and reasonably gritty Hermione.

** Here are some fanfics I've enjoyed:

Narnia:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5615090/1/Chanson-de-Geste][Chanson de Geste]] by LVDB is my all-time favorite, a Narnia fanfic that presents a more realistic view of Narnia based on medieval history and politics and focuses on the ghost of the White Witch, Jadis, haunting Edmund. It even manages to make you like Jadis while not undermining her status as a genocidal villain.

Harry Potter:

1. The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AlexandraQuick][Alexandra Quick]] series takes place after the events of Harry Potter, but in Magical America. The cast is all OCs, but the story is great and makes good use of its setting with plenty of references to American history.

Zero no Tsukaima/Familiar of Zero:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7736264/1/Emperor-of-Zero][Emperor of Zero]] is a Zero no Tsukaima fic in which Louise summoned Napoleon Bonaparte instead of Saito, resulting in a story that focuses more on politics and military strategy. Yudkowsky has recommended it in one of the HPMOR author notes.

My Little Pony:

1. [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/5523/nights-favoured-child][Night's Favored Child]] is an MLP alternate universe fic in which Nightmare Moon won against Celestia long ago and rules Equestria, which hasn't seen the sun in thousands of years. Twilight becomes her student.

2. [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/55377/blueblood-hero-of-equestria][Blueblood: Hero of Equestria]] is an MLP fic where Prince Blueblood is forced into being an officer in a war with the Changelings. He's selfish and cowardly and doesn't really want to fight, but he ends up doing some pretty heroic things because he's not as stupid or stubborn as the military higher-ups. This fics has really engaging narration and does a good job of making Blueblood likeable.

Avatar: the Last Airbender:

1. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108225/1/][Gilded Green]] is an Avatar: the Last Airbender fanfic about how the Dai Li capture and brainwash Lu Ten after the Battle of Ba Sing Se. The brainwashing is chilling and is balanced well by the portrayal of the Dai Li as humans with families and ambitions that they are willing to do horrible things for.

2. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3036180/1/][The Problem with Zuko]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6360866/1/][When All Your Dreams Come True]] are excellent, unrelated-but-similar oneshots about the Avatar from Avatar: The Last Airbender being captured by the Fire Nation/by Zuko and Zuko realizing that that is not a good thing.

3. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4845588/1/][His Father's Son]] is a oneshot about Zuko from Avatar: The Last Airbender learning to rule the Fire Nation. Some of the plotline might seem familiar, but it was actually written long before the comics were released.

Madoka Magica:

1. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To The Stars]] is a Madoka Magica fanfic that takes place four hundred years in the future, where magical girls have come out of hiding to help fight an alien invasion of human worlds. This fic has a lot of excellent worldbuilding and an interesting story.

Code Geass/Elfen Lied:

1. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5327665/1/][Galton's Children]] is a Code Geass/Elfen Lied crossover. It's also written by LVDB and has really good dialogue.

2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3816236/1/Lelouch-of-Britannia][Lelouch of Britannia]] is probably the most popular Code Geass fic, and for good reason. It's an AU where Lelouch wasn't exiled from Britannia and has some well-written battle scenes. Updates are very slow, though.

Bartimaeus:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3854897/1/A-Day-in-the-Life][A Day in the Life]] is a Bartimaeus Trilogy fic set in an AU without magic. Bartimaeus is a human bookstore owner and Nathaniel is his employee. Kitty is a waitress at the cafe across the street. Unlike some modern AU stories, it has an actual plot: Nathaniel overhears Simon Lovelace, a politican, doing something shady and is put in danger because of it. The dialogue and narration are great, which is essential for a Bartimaeus fic. It's slow-paced at first, but the humor and dialogue keep it entertaining even then.

Animorphs:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3464631/1/Sacred-Host][Sacred Host]] is about a Yeerk who infests a religious young Christian girl and is influenced by her faith. I know a lot of people here aren't particularly fond of religion, but this story is well-written and quite funny.

2. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/93341/chapters/127330][Out of the Blue Box]] is a sort-of-munchkiny Animorphs fic about transgender people post-series who use or choose not to use the morphing technology to permanently morph into the opposite sex.

*** I just read Chanson de Geste - wow. One of the best pieces of fanfiction I have ever read. The author's prose was excellent and the story was extremely well written.

I would love any other recommendations you might have for something similar - I am currently looking through the rest of the author's works.

**** I also liked Galton's Children by the same author. All the other fics I listed here have good plots, but there aren't many stories I know of that have both good storytelling and prose, at least not catering to my tastes of preferring action stories over romance. Usually I prefer fics that have exciting, action-packed stories with decent prose over stories with good prose but stories that interest me a little less. But I have read quite a few romance fics that do both well. Here are some I've read:

Persona 4:

1. [[http://badx2bathhouse.livejournal.com/543.html?thread=136735#t136735][Predawn Girls]] is a Persona 4 AU in which all of the male characters from the game are girls and focuses mainly on a Souji/Yosuke romance, though there is a nonromantic plot too. Here's the summary: Yasogami High is now St. Yasogami's School for Girls, a small, well-known, all-girls boarding school with a reputation for taking in delinquents. Local families get a huge discount for sending their daughters there, as a "reward" for putting up with the place. Nearly all the girls are dangerous in some way. There's a more readable, edited version of it on AO3 [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/329124/chapters/531072][here]], but that version is incomplete. The prose was pretty good iirc, and the dialogue really stood out for how good it was. It felt similar in tone to Chanson de Geste, though I don't think the plot was as good.

The Legend of Korra:

1. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2808119/chapters/6302432][Icarus and the Sea]], though I have to warn you that I haven't finished reading it yet (around 20% through). Still, so far it does a really good job of portraying Varrick and Zhu Li's relationship which I think is pretty impressive since Varrick especially seems tricky to write well since he's funny but really weird and kind of a jerk. The prose is good, and the dialogue is well-written.

2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8442158/1/dream-of-the-lotus-in-bloom][Dream of the Lotus in Bloom]] takes place in an AU where Amon kidnapped and raised her from childhood. It does a really nice job with Korra and Amon's unhealthy father/daughter relationship and the AU was explored well. The prose is pretty good too, but I felt a bit hesitant about recommending it earlier since it comes across as a little too melodramatic at times (though the conflict Korra goes through probably warrants it) and there's something about the prose that, while good, bothered me a little, though I couldn't put my finger on what it was. Definitely worth looking into, though. There's some Mako/Korra romance too, though it's not the main focus.

Also, if what you liked about Chanson de Geste was mainly the dialogue, then you might like A Day in the Life or Sacred Host, which I listed above.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers][Embers]] is an AtlA fanfic. It is ridiculously good. It expands on the spirituality of the series in a believable way. Starts slow, but rapidly picks up the pace.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4381366/1/A-Matter-of-Honor][A Matter of Honor]] is another good AtlA fanfic. Not very serious, light hearted and believable Taang and Zutara. Plays with the series' spirituality as well, in a unique way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4041754/1/Time-and-Again][Time and Again]] is a Naruto time-travel fic handled pretty well. It's fairly old, and the sequel was never finished, but it's worth a standalone read. The twist ending's also pretty amazing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7415078/1/Naruto-Ouroboros][Naruto: Ouroboros]] An AU where Orochimaru didn't leave the village, Naruto was born eight years before the Kyuubi's attack and becomes his apprentice and his little sister's the jinchuuriki. Very well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2218705/Kenchi618][Kenchi]] is a prolific Naruto fanfiction writer. I would highly recommend all of his fics (although the older ones are not as good) He does Naruto crossover ridiculously well. He made NarutoxStreet Fighter WORK.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5002293/1/A-Protector-s-Pride][A Protector's Pride]] is a Bleach fanfic that's really good. It's a retelling of canon after a certain point. Nothing's drastically different, at first, it's just grittier and more well written. This butterflies into AU later. Wouldn't suggest going into it without prior Bleach knowledge, at least up to when Ichigo meets the Vizard.

General tip for the noobie fanfiction viewer as well: On fanfiction.net, I suggest sorting by reviews and going from the top down in whatever category you please. Obviously, not all top reviewed stories are AMAZING but you can usually find some of the best of the bunch in at least the top 30-40 in any fandom you can name.

*** Thanks for the reminder of 'Here be Dragons' - I forgot to include that in my list, it was so good, especially [[/s][Spoiler]] - it was really only one of a few scenarios where it'd work well . Sadly I couldn't get into 'An Imago of Rust And Crimson' despite 3 separate attempts. Security and Zenith were kind of meh for me, but I'll definitely read 'When a Lioness fights' and I don't mind the Drarry slashfic - especially when it's well done, like it was in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]].

** *Harry Potter:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2009130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Battle-of-Wills][Harry Potter and the Battle of Wills]] Really good alternate Book 6+7 (before the release of either), and a wonderful characterisation of Severus.

*Star Wars:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2897153/1/The-Shadow-of-Vader][The Shadow of Vader]] Don't let the fact it's not "Published" deceive you - it's just lacking a planned epilogue, so the story is completed and in a very satisfying way. Best SW fanfic I've read. It's an alternate universe diverging from ROTS where Obi-Wan becomes Darth Vader.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2945228/1/Fall-of-the-Sith][Fall of the Sith]] & [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2987152/1/Descent-Into-The-Dark][Descent into the Dark]] Absolutely brilliant AU diverging from ROTS where Mace Windu kills Palpatine. Has a prequel (which works with canon) set hundreds of years before that tells the story of Yoda's touch with the dark side (and explains how come Yoda knows so much about the Sith in Episode I).

*Star Wars EU:*

[[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gvdfqocb976an44/-W4fVfxqbf][Legacy of the Sith]] This is a series of eight books. Technically, Legacy of the Sith is books 5-8, with 1-3 being an AU of New Jedi Order. /However,/ it's not entirely necessary to read 1-3 (or the intervening short fic 4), nor to know much about the EU - I started reading book 5 (Age of Heroes) and understood everything in short order even without reading any of the post-movie EU (just relied on Wookieepedia to fill in gaps), and it was so brilliant it actually got me into reading the EU!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][*"Prince of the Dark Kingdom"*]] is thus far the only non-rational Potter fanfic (out of the 4 other top recommended ones I've tried) that has successfully held my attention. I still didn't finish the whole thing because it's not /consistently/ awesome, but /certain parts/ of it are extremely awesome. (It's really good, it's just harder to hook me as I am getting older. I rarely finish giant stories these days unless they are uber level or meted out in short doses.)

*Summary* (no major spoilers): Due to small alterations in distant past events, Voldemort is no longer shortsighted and insane (but still sociopathic) and Harry's parents fled with him to Germany, but they still die for unrelated reasons. We start out with Harry in Pivot Drive and Voldemort as leader of Wizarding Britain and Headmaster of Hogwarts. Make no mistake, Riddle is evil and the world is much darker underneath his rule...but, business does continue as usual and at least some things are better, simply due to Riddle's rational self interest and the lack of constant warfare between the light and dark following his decisive victory.

*Why it's good*: It's not the plot, it's the world building. The book /really/ fleshes out the world. The mechanisms of magic are linked to a system based on fairly well researched pagan mythology. Also, we find out all about the other societies - international politics, werewolf clans, elves. You might randomly stop reading because the plot isn't addictive, but it is satisfying. I'm told it gets even better in the parts I haven't read yet.

(Admittedly, I started reading it in the first place because I decided to /check/ what people said the best fanfic was after reading hpmor, so this is not an independent observation of quality)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5166693/1/Scorpion-s-Disciple][Scorpion's Disciple]] is a Naruto fanfic in which Sasori goes to ground in Konoha after losing most of his collection (for minor spoilery reasons which make sense from the canon universe) and he runs into academy student Naruto. IMO it features excellent characterization, both of actual characters, and of techniques and training/fight scenes.

Was never officially finished, but there is an author's note detailing how the epic final climactic battle would have gone down. Follows the original storyline, with significant deviations, up until the time skip. (I suspect the author's first language is not English, as there are minor grammatical errors here and there.)

** Some video game favourites of mine:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6615342/1/Breath-Of-Fire-II-War-Of-The-Demons][Breath of Fire 2: War of the Dragons]] - straight game novelization. It's also my favourite non-rational fic, because it really brings the game cast to life. I also love the developing theme of fighting "destiny bullshit."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5465572/1/Queen-of-Sorrow][Queen of Sorrow]] - Fire Emblem AU with an originally morally-pure character falling off a slippery slope to evil. A bit contrived at times. Great characterization of Ike (normally the protagonist of the series).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5951824/1/The-Fifth-Act][The Fifth Act]] - FF7 Peggy Sue. Cloud makes relatively poor choices to take advantage of time travel, but he seems pretty in-character (I haven't played FF7, though, so no guarantees).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5264810/1/I-Just-Want-a-Vacation][I Just Want a Vacation]] - Zelda, Post-MM. Features OP Link trying to stay under the radar. The grammar is a bit weaker at the start (the author isn't a native English speaker) but picks up in the middle. There's better Zelda fics out there, but I loved the theme that developed in this one about 3/4 through the story.

**** For BoF2, you won't need canon knowledge. It has enough description and backstory for you to figure out everything on your own.

Queen of Sorrow is probably the one where canon knowledge is the most helpful. Almost all of the characters that are very accurately portrayed. As you say, you won't really appreciate it without having played the game (or possibly having read the game-script for [[http://serenesforest.net/path-of-radiance/scripts/game-script/][FE9]], [[http://serenesforest.net/radiant-dawn/scripts/game-script/][FE10]], and the [[http://serenesforest.net/path-of-radiance/scripts/supports/][support conversations]]). And just straight dialogue is a shoddy substitute when compared to having visuals and music and gameplay. As much as I liked it, you might want to pass on it if you aren't familiar with the series.

I read the Fifth Act only having watched the Advent Children movie, and not having played FF7. I found it enjoyable, but it's not especially different from any other Peggy Sue. I think it'd make a bigger impact on people who've played the game. A wiki-page would be sufficient if you wanted to read it.

I Just Want a Vacation requires almost no canon knowledge of Zelda to appreciate (it's semi-AU anyway). A few minutes glance at a wiki-page is enough for back-story. It's not deep or complex. I just liked it because it was amusing, and I liked some of the ideas that sprang up at the end of the story.

*** I kind of thought that Harry Potter and the Natural 20 IS rational fiction. Milo's thinking is VERY rational for the WEIRD alien universe he comes from, and to the extent that they've been explained so far, the rules of both universes and their interactions are predictable and possibly self-consistent. Although I'm not sure how much the story is going to explore the rules of the non-DnD universe since it's from Milo's perspective and it's doubtful he'll ever comprehend that much of it because he would probably have to take feats in Knowledge (physics) or something which would probably require him to class in "scientist" or something, and that isn't a character class available to him.

The opposing (and winning) theory at the time was that rational fiction should be about very smart and actually rational people with transhumanist leanings.

Milo's approach to the world makes sense in the world he's from - and I can't fault his rationality for the first few chapters - but at some point if he was a proper rationalist he'd have had a hefty "notice that you're confused" moment and rethought his worldview.
