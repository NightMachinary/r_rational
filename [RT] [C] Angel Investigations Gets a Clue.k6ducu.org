** According to your description it wasn't a spell we saw able to achieve this but a curse. There is therefore the possibility that the necessary components for a spell that returns a soul to a vampire is deep personal hatred for the vampire in question and deep pain from the recent death of a loved one.

As an aside, if there is a creator god in the buffyverse it is obviously a sadistic one. It would fit its profile if it made it so the only one who could restore a vampire's soul is someone who hates it personally.

** Yeah. it's always a problem with vampires in stories like buffy. I will point out that the resouling ritual does seem like very dangerous high magic as Giles couldn't cast it, and it seemed to be very risky for the caster. It also may not really be modifiable as even Willow just recast it instead of removing the "one moment of true happiness" caveat.

*** Fairy tale logic. Curses always have an end condition, and the cursed person has to know it. I think Willow could have stuck a different condition on it, but curses without one just do not work.

More importantly, curses may also absolutely require you to be a deserving target.

** My main issue with rat!fics like these is that assuming an entire setting is stupid is irrational in and of itself, especially when there are hints of in-setting explanations for why people do things already.

** From what I recall Angel's soul is still condemned to go to hell after his eventual death, and /I think/ it's not just because of the evil he has done. It's the default for vampires, like they get burned by crosses even if they are freshly risen and never did anything unholy.

So, that would actually be a terrible idea as it trades eternal torment for health, strength and a longer lifespan. Which admittedly is the kind of Faustian pact we usually see in media. But still just bad math, temporary happiness for eternal suffering.

*** Vampires in Buffy are corpses animated by "blood demons". Their original soul is not present. At the start of Angel, he is unique in that regard. So I don't think we can draw conclusions from the other vampires as to what happens to his soul.

That being said, Willow casts the curse to re-ensoul Angel again in the show without modification, implying that his soul is wherever it originally was before the first time it was stuffed back into Angelus.

**** Alright, I looked through some transcripts, came about this in S05E04 Hellbound

"You think any of it matters? The things we did? The lives we destroyed. That's all that's ever gonna count. So, yeah, surprise. You're going to hell. We both are."

So it may not be the default but punishment for their deeds. Still, feels weird to punish the soul for what the person did when they were a soul-less demonkin.

Either way, I wouldn't consider mass vampirification a good idea. Soul or not, human blood is still a strong temptation and plenty of ensouled people are not the kind of person to trust withstanding the lure, or not to abuse their new-found power.
