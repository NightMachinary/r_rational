Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** *Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 4: Pewter*

Ok, week four of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries. For a general overview of this series and the magic systems in question, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is pewter. Its powerset is probably a little more straightforward than the ones we've seen before, but I'm curious see what you all can come up with. As always I'm interested in what a pewter twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantic pewter enhances your body. The most obvious effect of burning pewter is that you become physically stronger, roughly two to three times stronger than you were before (+note: this means the effect of allomantic pewter is amplified by being in good physical condition+ edit: this is wrong, see below), but that is only the tip of the iceberg. You also become faster and more agile, your reaction speed and sense of balance improve and you tire much slower and heal much faster than a regular person. On top of that an allomancer burning pewter has a vastly higher tolerance for pain and is able to push his body well past its normal limits, ignoring lethal wounds and continuing to fight or run long after normal person would have blacked out from shock or exhaustion.

With enough pewter to burn, an allomancer has essentially unlimited stamina. Combined with the added strength and balance pewter gives you, this allows for a process called pewter dragging: by burning large amounts of pewter continually over an extended period of time, the allomancer is able to run across extreme distances at speeds faster than any galloping horse, even through dense forests and other types of difficult terrain. In a semi-pre-industrial world like scadrial this means pewter allomancers can get to places faster than anyone else and even be in a condition to fight after they get there if needed.

Worth noting is that pewters healing ability isn't Wolverine levels of healing, it makes you recover in hours to days from wounds that otherwise heal in weeks to months (if ever). More significantly, it allows the body to continue to function /despite/ those wounds: regenerating lost blood, preventing you from going into shock and letting partially severed muscles work without tearing themselves appart further. Also worth pointing out is that enough aluminium in the wound surpresses all of these effects (which makes aluminium bullets a good way to deal with pewter allomancers).

Burning pewter is not without its own risks either, if an allomancer runs out of pewter to burn they immediately lose their enhanced stamina and pain tolerance and they run the risk of collapsing to exhaustion they didn't realise they had or wounds that they had written of as irrelevant. An allomancer running out of pewter during a pewter drag can easily kill themselves through over-exertion. Moreover, pushing your body past its limits for extensive amounts of time takes its toll on the body and an allomancer coming out of a heavy pewter drag may need days or even weeks of rest to recover. All of this only happens if you seriously abuse your body though, in normal day-to-day life, pewter allomancers are healthier, more energetic and need less rest than regular people.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemic pewter stores physical strength. This differs from allomantic pewter in that feruchemy works on the level of actual physical muscles. When storing strenght, the feruchemist visibly deflates, becoming scroungy and weak. Afterwards, they can tap the pewter metalmind created this way to become more muscular and powerful. A feruchemist tapping a pewter metalmind can be much stronger than a allomancer burning pewter, but they do not gain any of the other benefits that pewter grants an allomancer. Moreover, because feruchemy physically increases your muscle mass, tapping too much strength makes it harder to move around as your motions become limited by the sheer bulk of your muscles.

The key difference between a pewter allomancer and a pewter feruchemist is that the former are more athletic and mobile (packing their enhanced strength into a much lighter package), while the latter have more raw strength and the momentum that comes with being physically larger and heavier.

And that is it for pewter, the last of the physical metals. Next week we start with the mental metals!

*** A Pewter compounder is an easy source of biomass for any project which needs it. You can get effectively infinite muscles, cut off some irrelevant and easily-healed ones, and survive the process with Pewter endurance. Furthermore, since burning Pewter protects you from the effects of crushing as well (mild Mistborn spoilers, there), a compounder could use their ability to become arbitrarily large to destroy any room/building they were in by just overfilling it.

I'm now imagining a world dominated by ever-swelling mounds of living flesh cascading outward from particularly distrought Pewter compounders.

Infinite muscles means infinite blood and skin, which means you just need to find cooperative pewter compounders of all blood and tissue types to solve blood shortages forever. This also gives scientists a limitless supply of human tissue to experiment upon.

This is kind of a nitpick, but burning pewter provides a flat bonus to your physical abilities, it doesn't multiply your pre-existing strength. Most pewter mistings still like to pack on muscle because it makes them that much stronger, but a body builder and a starving street urchin would both be receiving the same degree of enhancement.

#+begin_quote
  "So," Ham said, "an Allomancer doesn't have to be physically strong to be incredibly powerful. If Vin were a Feruchemist it would be different-if you ever see Sazed increase /his/ strength, his muscles will grow larger. But with Allomancy, all the strength comes from the metal."

  "Now, most Thugs-myself included-figure that making their bodies strong will only add to their power. After all, a muscular man burning pewter will be that much stronger than a regular man of the same Allomantic power."
#+end_quote

Also, the amount of strength pewter grants is somewhat beyond two/three times a regular person's- Vin, for instance, is capable of swinging swords that weigh as much as she does with a single hand.

#+begin_quote
  Vin Pulled on the fallen sword. It lurched up at her, but also pulled her down with its weight. She caught it as she fell---the sword was nearly as tall as she was, but flared pewter let her handle it with ease---and she sheared free the attacking koloss's arm as she landed. She took its legs off at the knees, then left it to die as she spun toward other opponents

There is a direct [[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/9/#e7674][WoB]] for regular burning roughly doubling and flaring roughly tripling your strength. Though obviously these are deliberately vague numbers and the allomantic skill of the person in question probably also plays a role.

*** Does Pewter Feruchemy also protect you against the consequences of having such high/low muscle mass? You mention it being hard to move around - is that only due to physically reduced range of motion due to increased muscle mass? Does it protect against hypo/hypertension due to the massively changed blood pressure requirements for all the new muscle mass? Can Feruchemists control what muscles they are storing/tapping?

There are a lot of obvious problems with this I can see: Draining/boosting muscle mass seems like it would very easily kill you due to changing the thickness and strength of your ventricle chambers. The muscles that control saccades in your eyes would start overshooting, blurring your vision. It'd enlarge your tongue, making it hard to talk or suffocating you. There's a /lot/ of things in the human body that are classified as "muscles" that would start fucking up if they just increased in mass in a second.

Also, muscle /mass/ isn't all that important. It's muscle density - there are lots of really bulked out weightlifters that can't lift that much due to never cutting. And even then, you wouldn't be able to do "superhuman" strength feats without tearing your muscles from your bones since the weak point is as the connective tissue.

You'd also start experiencing loss of breath due to not being able to oxygenate all those new cells, even if it handled blood volume and pressure for you - there are lots of story about professional bodybuilders essentially always being out of breath as a consequence and how it kinda ruins their life. Things like prolonged fights or having to run anywhere at increased muscle mass would be a very bad idea, and you'd be liable of passing out.

There's the very obvious solution of "use this to get free power" - it very obviously increases their mass, so just get a bunch of them to stand on hydraulic plates and oscillate, even more than the more esoteric "increase momentum but not weight" metals since there's no loss from burning any resource or need for complex setups.

I'd also be interested in what force the muscle expansion would have, like the sibling comment says - best case scenario you could stick a finger in a hole, jiggle your muscle density back and forth, and shatter rocks due to stress as your finger muscles expand and contract like water.

How does damage to your muscle work? If you tap pewter and get increased muscle mass, is it at the same "damage" as the rest of the muscle group, or what damage it was when you stored in the metalmind? If the first, then you have a pretty efficient shield for bullets - bulk up, get shot, shrink and have comparatively much less damage. If it's the second, then you could just store away the damaged mass of muscle again and be fresh as daisies, or do stuff like storing your damaged muscles in one metalmind and tapping unharmed muscle from a second to cycle out any damage you take.

You could also constantly store muscle mass and prolong your life for quite a while if you're ever trapped in a rockslide or somewhere without food by decreasing calorie requirements, but that might be dangerous depending on how muscle damage works since you'd start cannibalizing your muscles for calories.

Feruchemy always adjusts the body to be able to handle whatever powers it gives, but only to an extent. I imagine the connective tissue between muscles and bones (as well as the bones themselves) just get strenghtened to match the new muscles, otherwise the power just doesn't work. For the same reason I'm assuming feruchemy affects both muscle mass and muscle density.

Oxygination of the cells likely gets compensated for to some extent as well, but I imagine it would become a problem for prolonged fights and long runs. Minor spoilers: All three of the pewter feruchemists we've seen in the story were full feruchemists, so they would have another power, which we'll get to in a few weeks, to compensate for this, but they still tended to only hulk out very briefly whenever they used pewter (though conserving feruchemic charge would also be a factor, at least for two of them).

#+begin_quote
  It being hard to move around - is that only due to physically reduced range of motion due to increased muscle mass?
#+end_quote

That, and the physical extra weight of the muscles, but that is mostly as a comparison to allomancers who become much stronger while weighing the same (so allomancers can jump higher, change direction quicker etc, than feruchemists).

#+begin_quote
  Can Feruchemists control what muscles they are storing/tapping?

No, it's all or nothing. Though note that 'all' here doesn't literally mean every muscle in your body, nor is every muscle affected to the same extent.

#+begin_quote
  There's a lot of things in the human body that are classified as "muscles" that would start fucking up if they just increased in mass in a second.
#+end_quote

Very mild spoilers: Perhaps worth noting that feruchemy is not a naturally occuring phenomena, it is a magic system designed by a pair of sentient, near omniscient gods so there is some intelligence involved in what muscles bulk up and to what extent.

#+begin_quote
  How does damage to your muscle work?
#+end_quote

Damage to any particular muscle shrinks and grows with that particular muscle. So, yeah, getting damaged while hulked out and then shriking would indeed reduce the size of the wound, though I'm a little skeptical about how much help this would be against getting shot.

*** I'd want to explore what constitutes a "camera" "seeing" me, but the first order of business is finding any way to actually know the effect has triggered, since it essentially reverses time, which seems observationally identical to the triggering /not/ happening at all. It seems like without any loss of generality we can characterize the same effect as looking /forward/ one second and preventing any course of events that leads to being seen by a camera. "It happened and then unhappened" seems to lead to back to the exact same world-state as "it hasn't happened", except for the reset count going down by one.

If the universe is deterministic, then any number of reset counts has the exact same effect - none. There is only one possible timeline, and whenever it passes through being seen by a camera you'll fall unconscious after it pointlessly resets a few times. Observational history will be identical the anomaly to having no effect except "being seen by cameras knocks you out".

If the universe is fundamentally probabilistic, then you could observe the effect as making being seen by a camera anomalously unlikely, with you falling unconscious if you push it by being exposed to lots of cameras lots of times. You might be able to get an angle on what the day's reset count is if you can measure just /how/ anomalously events where you're seen by cameras just fail to happen. Maybe some setup with rolling a die and opening a shutter to a camera if it comes up 6. 6's should suddenly appear to happen less often as the attempts where the effect is triggered cause a reset (assuming rolling a die is sufficiently probabilistic. If it's not, try radioactive decay triggering geiger counters or something). This should be quantifiable, but you'll have to consider that /other/ ways the camera-incident could not occur will also be effectively boosted, like the camera failing in some way.

This just seems like a puzzle for gaining partial information about how many times the effect will work. I'm not sure I really understand it though. Is the idea that you can say "1 2 4 8 16 32 48 96" and then learn which is the last-occurring number that exceeds the day's reset count? So if it's 16, you know the effect can trigger between 8 and 15 times before you're knocked out?

Best I can tell this is "you've got unconscious reality-bending that's camera-shy, but if it gets tired you pass out", with a side of being able to gain limited information about how strong the effect is that day. I assume it varies from day to day?

I hadn't realized at the time what they meant about being aware of the chosen numbers being exceeded.

Looking back at it, doesn't this let you set an arbitrarily high number as the last threshold where you'll be knocked out? It sounds like you could push this as hard as you like. In a deterministic universe it isn't as big of a deal (you'll just repeat the same scenario a lot in the last interval of activation counts, since there's only any new influence on you when you cross a threshold), but in a probabilistic universe this seems to amount of reality-warping with dialable strength. Put the upper limit at some ludicrously high number, and the universe essentially rerolls all the relevant dice up to that many times a day whenever a camera would see you in the next second. Any unlikely-but-possible occurrences over those one-second intervals that could prevent that outcome become much more likely. Cameras will spontaneously fail, etc.

****** Yep. You could use this as some sort of probability pump as long as you can tether control of a camera to some sort of random event and you can trigger it within one second.

I don't think you could win the lottery this way, since you can't get feedback about whether you won or not within one second. You could perhaps get some sort of monitoring device that checks whether you had a heart attack or have been shot or some other serious trauma, and opens a camera to look at you if you have, which will pump all the probability into scenarios in which these things don't happen, but you'll still run into issues if the initial cause and the detection are more than one second apart. Also, you'll pump probability into scenarios in which your aparatus spontaneously fails rather than whatever you're trying to prevent, so this puts a soft cap on the unlikelihood of scenarios you can cause, based on how reliable you can make your device.

You might be able to use it to solve NP-hard problems and factor large numbers to crack cryptography and stuff. If you have a computer randomly guess at solutions and open a camera at you if it's not correct, then eventually it will guess the right solution and you can keep it. You'd need some source of randomness like radioactive decay or something, and you'd still only be able to solve problems that have higher probability than your computer malfunctioning, but if you get a reliable set-up you might be able to make a killing at cryptocurrency mining or something.

But for most problems one second is way too short to do anything really useful, this power is probably a net-negative, and probably the best you can do is practice avoiding cameras so as not to get knocked out, or set the theshholds incredibly high and use it as an ability to spontaneously destroy cameras.

Some possible angles:

*What counts as a camera?*

Film? Digital? What if you remove the film, or set the digital camera to not store anything? How ephemeral can the internal effect of the light be before the effect stops triggering? Does a pinhole in a box count as a camera when you introduce film at the back of it? What if it's so badly focused that it doesn't really form an image?

*What counts as seeing?*

Photons that last directly interacted with my skin? Or does some kind of pattern-matching happen? Does a camera seeing a reproduced image of me also count, or is it something more intrinsic to my person? Is there a limit to how /many/ photons work? Does a photo taken from five miles away where I'm an unresolved speck still work? What if there is very, very low light? Does bouncing the image off a mirror stop the effect? How about bouncing it off of frosted glass, such that the image is scrambled?

*What counts as me?*

Is a body part enough? If so, does any body part work? Is there a size effect? Does a square centimeter of skin do it? I can't think of an easy way to test the same thing, but does getting a skin graft from a donor transfer the effect to the new skin or not?

This isn't a simply physical phenomenon tied to some property that only I have. It's an intelligent process watching me and making distinctions that can only exist in the abstract space of a mind.

***** Okay, so one obvious danger is getting into a situation where you are unable to find a way to avoid being spotted after eight tries. Or you exhaust six tries, figure it out, and then try to retreat from view only to end up getting spotted and using up your last two tries. This creates danger in the form of potentially serious fall injuries.

The other danger is the random effects that may occur if you set your threshold(s) really high. If the lowest number you set is 10^{10^{10,}} you can almost guarantee that something that could be astronomically improbable will occur to prevent a camera from seeing you. This could mean you suddenly die, or the camera malfunctions, or its line-of-sight is broken.

If you want to use high thresholds, you may want to get or make an electronic device with a true random number generator based on radioactive decay. Something like a USB geiger counter, a bit of Americium from some smoke detectors, and a tablet or laptop to plug it into. Write a short script to sum up the number of detected particles from the geiger counter in the last millisecond and play a sound based on the improbability of the result (1 in 100,000, 1 in 10 million, 1 in a billion, etc.). As long as you pre-commit to certain actions for certain sounds, like ducking, turning around, activating a small incendiary to instantly release a cloud of smoke, etc. you should be able to iterate through all pre-planned actions until one of them breaks the loop.

Later that day you walk into view of a camera and get reset... and you loop, walking into view of that camera 9 more times. The 11th time, your sense pings and you know to stop. Absolutely nothing happened/changed during those extra loops. The outcome is identical to if you had picked 1 as your second number and your sense pinged before you entered the view of the camera.

No matter what numbers you pick, you will always only find out about the first 7 camera-sees-you events you might have encountered with 1 second to avoid them, and the 8th one will knock you out.

*** So I can basically run really powerful (and dangerous) optimization processes on the universe, just by setting up cameras to see me unless something I want happens, and choosing a really large number. Of course in practice that would probably just make my own existence too unlikely(well depends on the right interpretation of Qm and its interaction whith the loop )or reward hack the universe, So I shouldn't pick really big numbers, and be really careful when designing camera setups. The rollback of the universe being just 1 second makes it less convenient, and the falling unconscious would interfere a lot whith my life , but apart from that it's not that different from all other powers that let you run optimization processes via time travel.

***** Right , forget the qm bit I was thinking about a different kind of loop.

About optimization processes lets say I hock up my computer to a source of randomness that changes each instance of the loop, and use it to turn on its webcam if the number it gets its not a prime factor of a large integer.\\
The universe would loop until I got the correct number of the camera malfunctioned or something else.\\
Or you can just use it as an outcome pump([[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARaTpNX62uaL86j6/the-hidden-complexity-of-wishes]])directly, It just has the same dangers.

What repeated time looping does is basically find a combination of the random variables of the universe that makes me avoid the camera.\\
The universe just resets until something happens that makes me avoid the camera.\\
(I call this an optimization process )

Exploiting it is a question of ensuring outcomes where I'm not seen by the camera are outcomes I like.\\
If I let it run too much it will just kill me or make the cameras malfunction.\\
So there's a balance on how much repeats I can use.

The lops being 1 second long makes it a bit more difficult to use , but using a computer whith a webcam gives me more options.\\
Mostly solving np problems , cheating at some games etc.\\
I can easily manipulate any rng that I immediately know the output off .

Not sure how much times I would feel safe rerolling the universe though .

The 8 numbers things doesn't seem that useful since I don't have that much time to react.\\
Maybe for specific fast actions If I have an easy to turn on camera whith me .\\
And I could have a key to press if it reaches that point in the computer example(or just something to cover the webcam whith ) .

** Werewolf prison break (only the werewolf is an employee, not an inmate)

A minimum security prison employee is a werewolf, and he transforms out of schedule during one of his shifts. He had just enough time when he felt the change starting to lock himself in a cupboard - and, appearance-wise, he looks enough like an irish wolfhound to not destroy the masquerade if he's found. (Fortunately, he was not working with inmates at the time).

Due to not being an idiot, he's got a backup plan for this situation: a panic button he can press on his person that sends an emergency text message to another werewolf friend of his, a lawyer.

Any out of the box ideas for how she and her assistant can sneak the werewolf out of the prison? They don't need to take him anywhere in particular: as long as he gets out of the walls, he can run home.

*** Honestly, just go walking down the hallways with your tongue lolling out sniffing stuff. A dog wandering around a minimum security prison is /weird/, but minimum security prisons don't have any perimeter fencing and I think some don't even lock their doors, and if it's obviously friendly there's no reason the response is anything other than "sent to the pound and chalked up to a hole somewhere". Then have your lawyer friend buy you, or break you out from the pound where there's much less scrutiny.

**** I like that idea, but he's in a particular prison and I just checked it on google maps and it definitely has a large perimeter fence. It looks like parts of the prison are outside the fence (it's a prison farm, so I can see a field, and there's what I assume are admin buildings), but probably not the part Our Hero would be in when he changed.

Still, there's something to be said for playing it straight as a dog getting into the prison as being a good way to deal with it. People would be looking for the non-existent hole in the fence for a while.

I figured with him being a prison employee, changing at work would be his worst case scenario, and then a prison break would be a fun thing to do. But is there somewhere else that might be worse?

***** Worse would be transforming before a court witness appointment for an inmate and being forced to miss it. Depending on how nice the judge is feeling, you can be charged with contempt, fined, or sent to jail. Your job would also be /very/ unhappy.

It's also pretty boring though, since there isn't any resolution other than "miss your appointment and beg for leniency".

****** Yeah, plus he has a documented "medical condition"/"disability" that he uses to cover up the transformations and the somewhat predictable but somewhat not monthly need to miss out on work. (I discussed the particulars with a friend of mine who's a doctor, so there is something that makes enough sense that a werewolf-allied-doctor would be able to claim that Our Hero has it).

So I'd imagine it'd just fold into that, similar to how if a witness got hit by a car on the day they were meant to appear in court, there'd be a continuance.

I just heard back from my friend in the prison industry, and he says there's fencing "but it's not very secure and the gates are usually open" and "Pretty sure they only put them in in the last 20 years and purely for political reasons. Probably less secure than your average high school"

So really, for entertainment value, he needs to be a high school student and change just before gym class or something. Pfft.

**** He's in control, but if a prison staff member goes missing, that's a kind of major incident, and the cupboard would definitely be searched, and then there's this giant dog and a torn prison uniform: that dog is being put down very quickly because to all appearances it just killed a staff member.

He has a fake illness he uses to cover for the werewolf changes, so when he gets home he can use his giant, paw-friendly keyboard to send a very apologetic email to his boss and say that he had to leave work suddenly because he felt an attack coming on early and he won't be in for a few days.

Worst case scenario he can try his luck with animal control and bust out of the cage / hope that his werewolf friends bust him out, though. But a cover story for his boss would be harder then as it doesn't explain why a dog was in his classroom.
