** I get the feeling that Malicia will end up attempting to use Black to drive a wedge between Catherine and Scribe. For instance, if she captures him, she can get Scribe to share intelligence in order to keep him alive.

*** I think she would be independently motivated to keep him alive (and both Catherine and Scribe would know that), given their prior relationship

** This was a weird chapter for me. It felt like the discussion they were having after Cat already said Scribe could join was pointless. I mean sure they could technically kill her if they wanted, but she's already signed onto the Truce & Terms. It doesn't matter how much paperwork Hakram loses, the story of a villain signing on and then being immediately killed will get out somehow. Killing Scribe after the Terms are already under attack would see them pretty much collapse.

Ultimately from a meta-narrative perspective we know she's joining because why else would this chapter be written? Having Scribe show up and then die immediately would be so pointless.

*** The discussion would need to be had. Even if meta narratively we knew the end.

The guide has been good about the world building and making the characters seem real. This is a discussion that they would have had even if we know the end due to narrative reasons.

*** I don't think that "meta-narrative" logic holds at all. Just because we think we know what the outcome will be doesn't mean the story isn't worth reading.

**** Yeah I wasn't trying to imply that. It just seems like from a Doylist perspective the meeting to decide if the Scribe can join should take place before and not after she's already joined. It felt out of place to me.

It isn't necessarily bad and it's hard to judge something that literally just happened in a story without knowing how it will play out. Often something that at the time seems weird or nonsensical will be re-contextualized as the story goes forward.
