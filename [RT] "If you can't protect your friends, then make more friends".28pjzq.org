  But it wasn't just world domination. Rarity was vaguely aware that she was now part of some kind of group of magical girl ponies who could unite to vanquish evil.

Coming this summer from Tatsunoko Production: "Mahou Shoujo Unicorn World Domination". The new series of friendship, magic, and industrial espionage.

From the people who brought you [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CControl?from=Main.CTheMoneyAndSoulOfPossibility][/Money of Soul and Possibility/]].

  “My sister was able to threaten the world with the power of the One Bank. No pony could resist her. Therefore I will create nine daughter banks centered in economically strategic locations to aid and, if necessary, oppose the Bank. The Nine Daughters will make Equestria's economy more stable and robust than ever before.”

  “With the One Bank to rule them all?” Twilight said.

  “Yes,” said Princess Celestia, “And with the rainbow bind them.”

*** Apparently FIM was influenced by /Sailor Moon/ (another cartoon I never watched) and /Lord of the Rings/, so, you know, this stuff writes itself....

**** I was one of those kids who tended to see the last few minutes of /Sailor Moon/ before /Dragonball Z/ came on, but actually, I see very, very little of it in ponies. In fact, just don't bring it up again, as it will encourage Hasbro to start designing Sailor Senshi (more like /fail/or senshi, amirite, aaaah brain why) outfits for the characters and then subjecting the viewers to elaborate and somewhat inappropriate transform scenes.

Yes, I actually do believe that Hasbro would insert damn-near-perverted transform scenes of cartoon horses into their show if it justified adding another line of merchandise.

NEVER SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN.

As to /Lord of the Rings/, it's basically impossible to write any kind of fantasy series these days /without/ being influenced by it. Any kind of swords-and-sorcery, Middle Ages-style fantasy (even if it /actually/ seems to be set more around the early 19th century, with bits and pieces of modernity showing up) is going to incorporate tropes built by LotR. The downside is that as a result, any modern fantasy series will suffer from the [[http://www.salon.com/2002/12/17/tolkien_brin/][flaws in Tolkien's ideology]].

(I wasn't saving that for you; I just like pointing out LotR's reactionary and problematic tendencies for the lulz whenever possible.)

If you were looking for influences, I'd mostly say Greek mythology. They stole from that source: the pegasus, Tartarus (actually named as such in the show), manticores, minotaurs, a centaur (at one point), phoenixes, and of course the God of Trolling.

(Protip: if you have to describe why Nightmare Moon became evil, go with some version of the /kalisti/ myth. It suits a lot of people's headcanons, has never been disconfirmed on-screen, and shows that you damn well know your classical mythology.)

No word on whether they have an Elysian Fields or that last one (haven't had coffee this morning) for heroes and normal people to go to when they die. But they definitely have Hell, though for what or whom I don't quite understand.

(Yes, I read mythology and fantasy too much when I was a kid. And by "too much", I mean I'd have been better served by reading hard scifi, to help myself pick out a career.)
