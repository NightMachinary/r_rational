** So the /real/ villain of this story is /Fluttershy/, who is plainly one of the greatest torturers and manipulators alive.

** Would have posted update myself but for knowledge that all the Test: X chapters will be coming one after the other, so will be seeing Pinkie Pie's Test: Calculated Risk today/early tomorrow, and then Rarity's Test: Grey Goo Is Tacky day after that, with perhaps day's break or so between one or two of them due to intransigence of life plus fact that can feel brain squishing into shape of pony. Very imperfect chapter, wrote it mostly while very tired, could be lots of typos, subconscious code telling your dog to tell you to murder peacenik musicians.

Probably updating too frequently; sue me am impatient. Will wait week or more to get to the confrontation with Nightmare Moon, plus week or more after that for confrontation with Nightmare Moon's backers the venture capital firm.

Goddamnit, what is that, six chapters in and you're /already/ going to gray-goo the planet?

I thought she was an evil central banker, not a Silicon Valley start-up founder.

** There's not a huge amount of content around. Posting updates is a good way to ensure this sub doesn't die prematurely. But I feel like this post might have been too soon.

What's the optimal update posting rate?

*** In the middle of national emergencies such as Nightmare Moon tightening interest rates and inducing a debt crisis, post updates early and often.

**** Twilight acknowledges no debt crisis, only nominal crisis. If excess of debt causes surge in demand for money is one thing (where is plausible model plus what about creditors?), but plain fact is that Nightmare Moon is tightening money supply for laughs; no need to reach for further explanation.
