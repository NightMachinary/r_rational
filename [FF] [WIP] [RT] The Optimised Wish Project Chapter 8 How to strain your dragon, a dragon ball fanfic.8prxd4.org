** Excellent as always. Shenlong is pretty cool, and having Bulma just violently die like this is fairly shocking even though death is a revolving door in Dragonball. I can posit a guess as what the "and things generally worked out" path of events for next chapter would be: Goku gets back before Mai has the chance to use the dragon balls (possibly killing her out of anger and to prevent her from speaking a wish) and wishes Bulma back to life. The "oh shit heightening of stakes" move would be "Mai makes her planned wish and makes the Red Ribbon Army an incredible threat", which would set up the next arc pretty nicely and keep Goku with a solid goal of finding the dragon balls again and wishing Bulma back to life.

Alternatively, she opens the sealed envelope from Commander Red and reads out the wish....please make Commander Red taller.

*** There is another possible plot path: That Mai really did betray the Red Ribbon Army, and just wants to use the wish for herself. Immortality is not a good idea right now, with a lot of enemies on her heels, and would probably settle for a power-granting wish to deal with the short term problems.

On the other hand, she would have lawyered up her wish like Bulma, therefore making the same mistake, giving Goku enough time to interrupt her.

** The obvious way out here is that Shenlong, being allowed to work from intent, can grant the immortality wish retroactively without even without Bulma speaking the last syllable. It remains to be seen, I suppose, if you'll surprise us.

*** To be honest, I figured that that retroactively granting the boyfriend wish would have been how/why Bulma met this version of Goku. It seemed like such a very obvious setup...

** I don't have much of substance to say except that I'm very much enjoying this fic even though I have only a passing familiarity with the dragon ball universe.

** This chapter took some time longer than usual to post! As I explain in the notes, it's been long to write next chapter (the finale), but now I'll take a bit of a pause to get my stuff together before writing the next arc. Hopefully you'll like this one - it was possibly the one I had the most fun writing yet!

** Would you believe that I am actually looking forward to a hyper-competent Red Ribbon Army, if Mai was just a small taste?

** Loved your depiction of Shenron here. I also loved how he was pushing immortality on Bulma in a covert attempt to be like "Oh btw, your life's in danger."
