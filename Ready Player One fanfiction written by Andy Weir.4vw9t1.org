** I'm reading The Martian and Ready Player One, both are absolutely awesome(RPO is not rational, but I love it anyway).

I was very surprised to find out that Andy Weir(the author of The Martian) wrote the RPO fanfiction, I think it's really cool.

*** HAH! This is the best thing I ever read, somehow it's not annoying to read netspeak, so that was pretty great.

**** Relevant to the subreddit by theme and conceit, and to the post by way of author.

*** The thing is you can't go halfway. Either you focus on the real world to make it better for people, or you upload everyone so you can focus on the simulated world. If you do neither, then you have a bad world that you dont like to live in, but the technology isnt good enough for true immersion.

**** Oasis is objectively better. Why not upload?

***** I'm not saying uploading is better or worse, just that you can't go halfway or its worse than either. Also, I haven't read the book but I think Oasis was controlled by a corporation, so you might not want to upload into [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFe9wiDfb0E][something like this]].
