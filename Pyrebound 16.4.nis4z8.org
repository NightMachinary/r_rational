Six installments left now, I hope.

[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2021/05/22/chapter-16-4/]]

Pyrebound is an original-world story, a bit shy of 250K words now, featuring deep worldbuilding, political intrigue, and what the ancient Near East might be like if the priests had immensely powerful fire magic and an evil star replaced the sun every four days. [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/]] is the first installment, for those of you who want to start there.

As ever, I welcome any comments, questions, concerns, critiques, or original yo' mama jokes, whichever you happen to have handy. Thanks for reading.


** This chapter was really good.

In order to say more than that, let me add some criticism. There were two main 'cool' things which happened, namely (1) reforged Flamekeeper sword armor, and (2) using the water goddess's locus to negate the Fire god's.

(1) relied on developments in-chapter (namely, the revelation that the battle of Barenmul cost a large number of Flamekeepers and that this also contributed to Ram having greater leeway. By giving us these key pieces within the same chapter that we see their consequence, we don't have the same opportunity to engage in speculation as is often the case in many webserials.

As far as (2) goes, we are told in chapter that:

#+begin_quote
  A wellspring, as it turned out, did not create water from nothing in the same way a pyre made fire. It could only make existing water feel an attraction for a particular location, and move there in spite of its nature.
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  something he had seen at work himself, every time he went to the Goddess's shrine in Urapu.
#+end_quote

I cannot recall if we have gotten hints of these facts earlier in the text, but I feel like the key pieces were only revealed here. If so, that also means that readers didn't have an opportunity to theorize about the resolution to the Mannagiri situation after the last chapter.

I think that this style of introducing and closing a lot of the key points within chapter leads to a lot less discussion than otherwise. Not that it's clear that author's should be optimizing for discussion or discussion as a proxy for engagement, and this sort of terse style is definitely one of Pyrebound's hallmarks, but ti definitely makes the experience different than for a lot of works posted here.

*** Yeah, I couldn't think of any way to foreshadow this beyond the revelation in the rain itself to tell readers "something about a rainstorm around a pyre gives Ram the idea that Mannagiri's not invincible after all." Wellsprings were introduced waaaaaaaaay back when (Ram visits a wellspring in 1.4 IIRC, and they're mentioned maybe three or four more times in-text), but there's no particular reason the reader would hang onto them as relevant. So it was a storytelling problem with no clear solution. TYVM for giving feedback, I depend on it to know when the story's going off the rails.

(I thought of the armor as just a fun bonus to show that Ram wasn't sitting around with his thumb up his butt the whole time; the real killer app is the heatsink shield IMO)
