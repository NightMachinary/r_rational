**** well I generally like friendly AIs because they always turn out to be total bros rather than devolving into the usual evil AI trope.

In Rob's case I liked how in the battle he managed to completely wreck the opposition with intelligent moves while still pretending to be dumb. Also his implied rationality lessons previously in the chapter(s), that was a pretty nice touch

** Wow. Rob is smart. /Really/ smart. Maybe even /too/ smart, to be honest to him. He's, what, ten or twenty times the mass of any other robot on the field? Every single one of the opponents was disabled by pathological environmental obstacles placed by his throws. I'd be hard pressed to do that myself, even if I were strong enough to do it. It's very surprising that not even one of his targets was killed just by being hit by being hit by something heavy moving fast. Maybe Rob's intellectual bent is showing through? "I refuse to dirty my hands with something as crude as a thrown rock. My methods will be more refined. Unless it's that guy's mech. /That/ I'm going to beat to death with my bare feet." :P

That said, I doubt anybody's going to come up with that suspicion. That'd be so far outside their hypothesis space that it's not even funny.

Good story. :D

*** Well, he did drop a heavy sheet of metal on top of Yanno's mech. He was trying not to specifically take out any of the mechs with direct strikes, because then it would be clear in people's minds that he had deliberately attacked. This was all just him being clumsy, right? The fact that he caused the destruction of every other mech on the field (aside from the hopper)...well, that's just luck, right? Much like a Jackie Chan battle.

And, yes, I agree that "That's just luck, right?" is a pretty reasonable conclusion for the onlookers right now. I'd give the grad students the least bad chance, and then only if they start getting suspicious for other reasons.

It wasn't as heavy as you'd think; his lifting arm is stronger than a human, but not by a lot. His mid arm is about average human strength, and his fine arm is quite weak but very dextrous.

** This all reads great and has a nice plot to go, the downsides I see so far are:

1.Lack of sufficient emotional response by protag.

1. Illogical plan by agents of murder.

2. Survival plan is going a little too easy, the dinner job was pure luck.

This all indicates either some plan by forces that be for protag, or your choice to skip the rebound parts and go on to plot and powerup. Or something else entirely. Or just accident. Or I am reading too much into this.

Rob is great, character definition and behavior is also great, but character descriptions are bit weak, how does Jess look like, how does Rob look like? 3 legs? 3 arms? humanoid build, tall, short, stocky, caricature-ish?

Its possible I overlooked descriptions, so pls forgive. Feel free to repeat character appearance, in context to actions or similar though.

Rob was described in this chapter as a coatrack (spine) with a big box on top (head), three nested Rubik's cubes in the middle (body), and a spot just below the body where three legs go down and three arms of varying sizes go up.

/looks back/ I thought I had described Jess at the beginning but apparently I did not. Oops; that's quite an oversight. I'll add it in next chapter and probably retcon it into chapter 1 as well. Thanks for pointing that out.

This is a weakness of my writing style that I'm aware of and trying to focus on more. I tend to have an external view of events and don't get inside the characters' heads. I'll have more of it next chapter.

Also regarding 3 rubicks for thinking, would it be possible to hide them with a layer of regular metal and allow greater processing power?

As for the lack of emotional response in face of death, I feel my views are limited on that mater. No one of importance to me died. The closest I got was one of my aunts, and my reactions were slight reminders of her not being with us anymore, anytime I would be in her neighbourhood.

"No more cookies at Aunties place" or "Aunt is gone" or "Auntie is dead"

So dont listen too much to my thoughts on feelings.

***** Keep in mind, though, that usually right after that kind of trauma the mind and body is still in shock, in the "I can't believe this has happened" mindset. So it hasn't yet sunk in completely what has happened and the relative consequences, especially since she's been busy trying to survive and provide for the robot.

If [[/u/eaglejarl]] goes for realism we'll start seeing her slowly break down in the next days, once the immediate dangers are taken care of and she is more comfortable and thus capable of sitting down and thinking about the situation.

**** The explanation regarding Rob's variable intelligence for sure, although I have a small doubt: since he has gone into a general purpose build that has limited his capability in various fields, how come he still has the advanced visual processing required to accurately throw heavy objects around so that they land exactly where he wants them to?

Aside from that, I like how you characterized the protagonist. In the betting situation she behaved at the beginning in the same way a normal girl her age would have, with only later on taking control of her emotions and taking a more rational approach with visible difficulty.

Definitely curious to see how this project continues. It could indeed become a good enough story to overshadow your previous magnum opus.

** Cathartic! The television series 'Robot Wars' comes to mind.

May I ask about the 'cramping the ratings'/'screwing up the odds' concept? If the odds are changing to treat the other robots as being less likely to win since she put money on Rob, meaning that the payoff is bigger if a non-Rob robot does win (which could be at least partly paid for by the money she unsuccessfully put on Rob), why should people counting on(/assuming) a non-Rob robot winning be unhappy about the change to the odds?

*** It's been a while for me, but think of betting odds as probability mass. If the odds of one racers goes up, then the odds of all the other racers must go down to compensate. Since the odds on Rob winning went from 30:1 to 50:1, then all of the other mechs must be seen as more likely to win with lowers odds adjusted, which means they have a smaller pay-out in that scenario. If a 'better' mech was used instead of Rob, then their mechs are perceived as being less likely to win with a larger pay-out when they win.

I don't know where you read that the other mechs are less likely to win just because she put money on Rob, it's not anywhere in the chapter that I can find.

**** Ahh! I somehow overlooked the 50:1 shift, and misunderstood what they were talking about! For some reason I thought they were trying to convince her not to bet on Rob, when upon rereading they were trying to convince her to take Rob out of the race altogether (the 'slot' for the race, not for betting).

--And, yes, the effect on others makes sense if it's being compared to 'if there's a more competent robot using the same slot'.

Thank you both!

I'm glad you liked it. And yes, I was thinking about Robot Wars and Junkyard Wars when I wrote it. I remember hearing from one of those shows that the dominant bodyplan had become 'wedge shaped rammers intending to flip the opponent over' -- this might have had some impact on the chapter. :>

As to the probability stuff -- pretty much what [[/u/xamueljones]] said.

Thanks. This battle was actually an interesting thing to write. I kept trying to plan it out and getting nowhere. Then I just started writing and it unfolded in front of me. It was very satisfying.

The mana thing isn't messing with her emotions -- mana is just energy that you get by eliminating potential world-states. Jess is just doing everything she can to keep from thinking about it.

That's the Watsonian answer, anyway. Doylist, I tend to get focused on events and forget to do emotional response; it's a failing that I'm working on.
