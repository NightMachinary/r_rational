** Nobody made suggestions for what we put in this interlude, so we decided to do William yeeting axes.

Of course, it comes with a side of character development and a teaspoon of worldbuilding.

(Note that I've named the 'universe' that VFL and my one-shot occur in Electrum, so that's gotta be significant, somehow, right? Mostly in my own head, tbh)

Hope you silent masses are enjoying it; there's a discord now (linked on AO3) which, while being really self-indulgent, is actually a nice, quiet little chatroom.

** Is this a good story? I've never been that interested in romances but is that the main thing? Whazut like?

*** It's not the main thing in that there's no quivering members or anything like that; it's an urban fantasy story set in 1944. There are no sex scenes in the story, though the characters do canonically have sex (you know, the old "in bed, fade to black" sort of teen-appropriate way).

Standard human-vampire romance (both men, which seems to turn a lot of people off offhand, but eh), but there's deep worldbuilding. Starts out with the MCs falling for each other, but then it becomes about the obstacles that start falling between them being together and how they overcome it.

Apart from the worldbuilding (which I literally have had a phD mathematician who also has a physics degree help me get right), I've been told people consider the writing itself high-quality (I've aimed to have it be very polished and well-edited).

The reason it's rational is because this is not a romance where the conflict is from comical misunderstandings: the partners communicate with each other, they work on their relationship, and they experience growth because of it.

Here's some praise I've got from an [[/r/rational]] perspective if you'd like to hear what others have to say:

--------------

"It's not Animorphs the Reckoning but dangit sometimes I just want Visser Three and Marco to sit and drink coffee for ten pages and maybe kiss" - [[/u/Callmesalticidae]]

"Normally I go [to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]] for munchkinry and fun, but this was good and gripping, and I read the entire story to date in one sitting." - anonymous

"You know what you do well? Presenting strange information to our blank slate stand-in and have him actually ask questions about how things work. He's asking questions I actually want to know" - [[/u/leakycauldron]]

--------------

That said, it's not for everyone: I'd recommend you read the first chapter. I'm actually just about to post the most recent chapter - I have no idea how it stands alone, but it's pretty representative of the worldbuilding and character type stuff that happens, and is very light on the romance, so if you wanted to go straight there it might be worth a shot: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744/chapters/58964515]]
