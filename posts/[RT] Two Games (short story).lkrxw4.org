***** I use RSS all the time, and Twitter hardly ever (I certainly never use it to track creative fiction).

Email alerts are also good.

***** Also enjoyed this. Tone-wise, it's very similar to Wildbow's /Pact/. Definitely worth a read, if you're someone who wants to/can read things in the same genre/idea space as the concept you're working with.

****** I read ~2/3 of Pact when it was being published. I should probably go back and finish it.

Pact's milieu is absolutely amazing, and Wildbow's writing is very addictive, but I eventually stopped reading because I was frustrated that even hundreds of thousands of words in I couldn't model the magic system very well.

In Worm when something cool happened in a fight I would usually go "ooh, that's clever" or "ooh, I didn't realize this cape could do that, that has implications X and Y". The exact mechanics of magic in Pact were never quite nailed down enough to produce that same feeling. I would be reading a fight asking myself "I wonder if this time magic will turn out to work in such a way that things are OK" rather than "How is this set of tools I understand going to be used to get out of this one?".

******* Definitely that problem, and imo it's barely ameliorated in the same-universe sequel /Pale/, despite extensive efforts to do so.

The basic issue, I think, is that the magic is fundamentally shaped by people's desires, and since the world/spirits are conceptual in nature, their limits are more in line with "what are you willing to pay". Which is cool but definitely not as Rational as Worm.

*** I'm not sure. I suspect someone else just had the same idea. At least for me, I've been so primed by movies that when I read news stories involving asteroids the narrative part of my brain autocompletes to them crashing into the earth for some reason.

**** late reply, but [[/u/SpecialMeasuresLore][u/SpecialMeasuresLore]], I know exactly what you're thinking of, because I had the exact same thought---it's probably [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DdiSNDXT-ZL5gMEZ7C7ikcZixX4X7ZkcC1K39F3siQI/edit][Sisyphus]], a 2015 Alexander Wales short story released via Google Docs. To be wholly honest, I think I prefer your take, it was just hurt by the fact I'd seen it before!

I checked out the other shorts on the site; "Two Games" was my favourite, really great concept told well, but the other two both had some compelling ideas going on too. Looking forward to seeing /Crescat/ when it's ready!
