[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5514187/1/Unsung-Story-of-the-Inconspicuous][This fic is good]], and I think meets the criteria for being a rational fic, if in a sort of Meta way.

Raiku Gairano is part of a small and unimportant ninja clan in Konoha; unimportant by choice, as they are both able to see, and are naturally immune to, narrative convention.

As I said, pretty meta, but it does nicely highlight one of the key tenants of rational writhing: nothing happens 'just because', but only as the rules direct. In this case, the world is built in with rules that direct the Plot, thus giving our aware MC a very interesting perspective as she tries to do her family proud... by not interfering with the Grand Story of the Universe and living as unmemorably as possible.


** Does the tone change much? I remember trying this one a couple years ago and being put-off by the character's lack of empathy when messed up stuff happens to others.

*** In the author's defense, a certain apathy is necessary to be able to actively ignore events you know are going to happen, especially when it concerns lives to be saved.

*** Sorry for replying to an old comment, but it does. Raiku's lack of empathy is a plot point of sorts. I can't defend anyone else though if it seems unrealistic at times for humor.

*** I think so. She tries to maintain a bit of distance but she's only human.

** Ive only read the first chapter but the comedy comes out well. My favorite part so far is the drama levels.

#+begin_quote
  Uchiha Sasuke -- level five risk of drama. Impressive, since there were only three levels.

Quickly followed by:

#+begin_quote
  Uzumaki Naruto -- drama level ten, human whirlwind.
#+end_quote

I got in trouble for laughing out loud at work.

**** This may be an obvious pun, but her name means lightning, and so story grounds itself out around her.
