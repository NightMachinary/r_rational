** I wonder how historians in this world ever make sense of the things that happen, because the narrative and the events happening are two entirely separate things. Here, the allied army attacks, is pushed back by the Drow, and then "wins" a crushing "victory" once Pilgrim used his miracle. But the narrative is that Cat just stabbed him with a metaphysical knife, and that's such an abstruse move that it'd be difficult for an outsider to understand, much less study.

The story will be about the fall of a righteous man who went to hell on a road paved with good intentions.

The Story is about the fall of the Pilgrim who so valued fighting Cat that he ignored the Dead King.

** Something occurred to me when talking with a friend about the story, and the Drow in particular...

Cat has a unique fighting force, rarely seen in any form of fantasy or sci-fi. Namely, she has a military unit that does *not* get weaker as individual members are killed. Because of the way the Night works, any 'losses' that occur amongst the Drow here don't really matter in the grand scheme of things.

Let's pretend there are 50,000 Drow, all as strong and skilled as baseline Human soldiers (we're lowballing here, for good reason). We'll call this their 'combat level'. Let's say they fight against 50,000 Humans, who obviously have the same 'combat level'. Let's say both sides lose 10,000 combatants in a fight.

At the end of the day, the Human fighting force has a 'combat level' equivalent to 40,000. 4/5ths what it started with. But the *DROW* have a 'combat level' equivalent to *50,000*, the exact number they started with.

The Drow's losses, while important from the perspective of repopulating their species, are meaningless in the terms of military conflict, so long as they have access to the bodies of their fallen, and thus their Night... which includes their magic powers, their memories, and the skills they acquired over their lifetimes.

Of course, their numbers do give them obvious benefits, like being able to split the numbers into smaller armies, etc, etc. So having 1,000 of them each equivalent to 50 Humans each might have some drawbacks, the concentrated Night opens up more possibilities as well, that weaker troops can't match.

Also, when it comes down to fighting the Dead King, the Drow are perfect for the job. We know that memories and skills are part of the Night, and so when those are harvested, any corpses raised as Undead by definition can't be the sapient kind, and at best would be some common mindless zombie. While losing Drow is not ideal, doing so does *NOT* advantage the Dead King at all, and instead makes the remaining Drow /that much harder/ for him to kill.

--------------

*TLDR*: Cat can tolerate the losses of her special Drow troops *far* more easily than any other fighting force on the field. This will come in quite handy when fighting the Dead King as well, since if the Night is harvested, the corpse is functionally useless--no skills, no training, it's nothing more than an empty meat puppet, and all the living allies of the new Undead are that much stronger.

Going to the Everdark was possibly one of the best, most game-breakingly awesome decisions Cat ever made.

*** Don't forget that the Drow can grow the Night by harvesting from creatures they kill. That's how they get new skills in the first place. They've also mentioned that it works on the undead as well, so they're especially well suited to fighting the Dead King since they'll get stronger every time they kill one of his former Named revenants.

**** I haven't forgotten this, it simply hasn't happened yet.

Cat has /talked/ to people about the possibility of this, and it has been stated as being /possible/, but we as the readers/audience have not actually seen it done 'on camera', as it were. So, until we do, it stays in the realm of the hypothetical.

However, *if* it is true... well, then they are even more OP then I had originally thought, and you are right in that they aren't just one of the best counters to the Dead King's forces, but perhaps the /best/ counter to them.

Lesser Drow could potentially gain in strength fighting and claiming the Night of the lesser Undead, while the greater Drow would do the same hunting down the ex-Named. It could easily snowball out of hand and turn on the Dead King quickly.

Even better, his usual approach of "Kill it, then make it mine" won't matter too much so long as Cat or another is designated "First Under the Night", AKA, High Priest(ess) of the twin goddesses. Because we *have* seen Cat use their power to strip all the Night from a living Drow. Even if the Dead King manages to get his hands on a Drow and convert it to undeath, the First Under the Night can simply take all its Night away and leave it powerless.

I must admit, I originally thought the Everdark excursion was simply 'filler', but recently it has turned out to be one of the key lynchpins to Cat not just surviving, but perhaps pulling off a win over the forces arrayed against her. Fortunately, I am quite happy to be wrong about it.

*** Actually, it's even better than that, because when you fight, you improve. In a classical army, this experience can be lost (if the guy kills 5 opponents before dying himself), in a drow army, it doesn't. So the result at the end of the day for Drow isn't 50000, but something like 55000 due to the experience gained (and even more if you consider that drow will also harvest opponents).

​

However, it's not exactly true either. Because some of what which make someone skilled will be shared by everyone and thus, won't give anything to other. If, for instance, your army is composed by guys who have at 100% the exact same skillset, then, you won't gain anything by harvesting them. You won't because twice at good at holding a shield or using a sword if you harvest someone who hold the shield or use the sword in the very same way than you.

So what are we looking at here. If he accepts, it breaks the rule of three narrative he'd built and leaves the armies under her command as POW's they have no way of holding, and if he rejects it then he's probably consigned to a narrative that ends with defeat in this battle and long term narrative advantage for Cat.

Thus, this would break the three, meaning Pilgrim isn't guaranteed a win in their next encounter, meaning he loses his knife.

Thus, I don't think this is the knife; this doesn't guarantee Cat anything, it just means she ISN'T guaranteed a loss. Unless this starts a NEW rule of three, and the next encounter will lean to a draw and the last one will be a victory for Cat...

A sword that swings itself even when its wielder doesn't want to is not a good sword. Swords cannot broker the details of peace deals or weave stories, that's why they get beaten into ploughshares.

Saint's weakness is basically that she leaves all the thinking to the Pilgrim and everyone else. She just cuts things up, even if it ends up for the worse for "her side". Might end up kissing a pillow held by the Pilgrim if she goes too far.

** So if this is the knife, Vivenne's the bet and Kairos is the lie? It makes sense but if anything seems too simple, I'm wary for some inversion. [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/04/08/chapter-31-fall-or-flight/][Cat repeats the order, knife, bet, lie, both before and after dictating the letters, to Kairos, Pilgrim, and Vivienne, respectively.]] I can't see the shape of it yet but it makes thematic sense that that's the order the letters are written in as well*. Can't wait til Friday.

*I realize on the face of it that there's a bunch of logical reasons why that order doesn't make sense, but for story reasons, the apparent lay of things makes TOO much sense and we're already mostly aware of it so Narrative makes me suspicious it can't be that.

*** I mean, if she follows through with the unconditional surrender, her "full power and influence" is null and void. She just needs to draw Kairos closer so the crusadres stop focusing on her.

**** She still is the drow high priestess. And leader of the hunt. Those are not tied to her black queeness

*** You forget that the parts influence each other. The letter is in many ways also a bet. The Tyrant needs a peace conference and he can't get one if the Callowans surrender. The letter among all the other things it does, forces the Tyrant to act and make sure the surrender does not happen.

** Anyone else feels worry over Wandering Bard not appearing for a long time? I have a bad feeling about the lack of exposition of the damned Intercessor. I feel like she is secretly pulling the strings and Catherine and everyone else is unwittingly dancing to her tune. My thought is that she caused Hasenbach to think that she needs to engage the Army of Callow (by deceiving Augur), and all that unfolds is the result of this. It also seems to me that she has her hand in nudging Tariq towards his conviction that Catherine is a danger to Calernia and needs to be exterminated. Does anyone else feel this way?

*** Yeah, Hasenbach's corpse-weapon being left unattended for so long is somewhat wracking my nerves. Take that and the fact that her overseer told Rosala that she can allow to let the Legions go, and I'm wondering whether she's planning to drop it on them or the League.

** This is definitely the highest peak for us with Cat. But from a story standpoint, these high highs make me super nervous for the Big Fight coming up. Erratic is basically lifting Cat up only to show us how insignificant she is against the Dead King. We're gonna lose some folks, people. Bare yourself. Or as Zeze says, *Witness*.
