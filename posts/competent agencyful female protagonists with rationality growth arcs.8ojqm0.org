So I really like character arcs where someone is pretty smart, tries to be rational, realizes it's really hard, struggles, eventually gets better at rationality and pulls through in the end. Also, they grow as a person, and stuff.

For example, I like Red from origin of species (goes out into the world, finds research is really hard, but slowly makes some progress) HJPEV (totally OP, but still makes a bunch of screwups, not sure if he really fits this criteria or not) or the characters in Animorphs: The Reckoning (really bright kids, but man they are way out of their depth).

I also really like female protagonists, but I can't really think of any stories that fit this mold with female protagonists. I loved Worm (although it's not about rationality), I thought Time Braid was decent (character was too OP though). I tried Practical Guide to Evil but unfortunately couldn't get into it.

Any other recs?

***** Knowing a little about Twilight and having read its first few chapters (before giving up) I could appreciate the occasional jab here and there, like Luminosity's Bella being actually nice to her dad who bought her a car rather than an annoying spoiled brat like in the original /ahem/.

That said, it probably works full well without, and it made me often wonder how much of the world building was pulled from Twilight and how much was just made up for the fanfiction.

** You might like Strong Female Protagonist, an ongoing webcomic. A large portion of it revolves around some of the real-world implications of superpowers (not as well as Worm, but it does a decent job), and it features a mostly rational but flawed protagonist. There's already been a decent amount of character development, with the MC coming to terms earlier on with the fact that not all of the world's problems can be solved by punching them in the face---though more development will likely happen in the future. SFP has its flaws, but on the whole, I would recommend it.

** - Flicker from /[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/179564-doc-future][Doc Future trilogy]]/ --- she's not rational, she's impulsive, and both she and others close to her are aware of that trait of her personality.

- Ami from /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DungeonKeeperAmi][DK Ami]]/ --- matches the request criteria weaker for several reasons: 1) the story's more focused on munchkining the universe she ended up than on building herself into a more rational character 2) the story as a whole gets a bit penalised as a rational story because the whole character set is zombified at times due to several recurring tropes (fanservice, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvilJustMisunderstood][NotEvilJustMisunderstood).]]

** It may not fit your criteria 100%, but one of the most rational protags I've ever seen in media is Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character in 10 Cloverfield Lane. She's extremely clever & competent and makes exactly zero of the stupid mistakes that horror movie protags usually love so much. I guess minor thematic spoilers ahead.

It's not a story about improving the rationality of her worldview, but it is very much about developing strategies to defeat a physically superior, intellectually equal opponent on his home ground. Each tactic can only hope to work once, and each new thing she tries makes it less likely for the next one to work.

It's also a straight-up awesome movie.

There is going to be a lot of "actually being rational/ doing things is hard".

That said the "main" character is not actually as smart/ competent as she thinks she is and a lot of the growth is going to be learning to be better at things and not trying to be everything at once.

So might not be your cup of tea. I'm also taking stuff a bit slow to let the custom setting sink in for the audience and avoid infodumping for pages and pages. So it might take a while to get to what you'd call the "good stuff" in this case.

aaaand [[http://unicornjelly.com/uni001.html][Unicorn Jelly]]. With sort-of sequels [[http://pasteldefender.com/to%20save%20her%20000.html][To Save Her]] and [[http://pasteldefender.com/cover.html][Pastel Defender Heliotrope]]. It may start a bit slow, but it's seriously one of the most amazing examples of world-building you'll find.

*** I'll cheerfully second /Honor Among Thieves/, which in my view is substantially better than the originals. There's plenty of fan music for the canon series available too - search for "harrington filk" and, uh, it's certainly a thing.

Canon basically had two problems: it starts as a straight "Horatio Hornblower /in SPAAACE/", and then devolves into endless sequels and no resolution. The latter problem is obvious; the former mires the setting in a late-20th-c interpretation of mid-20th-c stereotypes about early-19th-c imperial politics and society. If you want British naval tropes plus a clear love of orbital mechanics, Webster delivers; if you want the /human/ part of the setting to be interesting I'd recommend something else. If you want a story arc, as above, read /Honor among Thieves/.

** If you play video games, you would like Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn.

She's highly intelligent and independent

** The Tiffany Aching sub-sequence of Discworld is /amazing/. The protagonist does not practice "rationality" in the HJPEV sense of "figure out the rules of magic and exploit them", but does in the real-world sense of "take actions that will lead to your goals being achieved".

Part of the reason she improves is that she starts out at 9 and ends up at ~17.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12805575/chapters/29229972][/Tact/]], a /Pride and Prejudice/ fic where Elizabeth Bennet has some. Beautifully written, and the characterization presents everyone at their best /without/ simply fixing their problems.

Period romance obviously, but with a decent treatment of gender roles.

** I'm not aware of any that fit your requirements exactly, but you may enjoy these.

Branches of the Tree of Time (short) - a modified Sarah Connor from Terminator is the protagonist, but starts out rational.

Bluer Shade of White (short) - Disney's Frozen - Elsa is the protagonist though she is not the most rational character in the story.

Taint and Trials - [[https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/]] - both unfinished. I'd say they are rational friendly but not rational. In Trials the protagonist is a man reborn in a woman's body so don't know if it counts. I find Taint very enjoyable.

Mother of Learning and the Good Student are great but male.

** I can do a bit of shameless self promotion and advertise my /Optimised Wish Project/:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863641/1/The-Optimised-Wish-Project]]

It's a work in progress rational Dragon Ball fanfic, and Bulma is so front-and-center in it you may as well say she's basically the protagonist, with Goku as a co-protagonist. I'm going for a pretty humorous tone so I don't know if it'd fit your bill for a growth arc though; she's pretty flawed and some of those flaws may actually get worse, but she's certainly got /a lot/ of agency.
