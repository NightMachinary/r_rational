** Why did he burn his findings? That's one of the least helpful things you can do, short of fabricating information.

*** He was suicidal. He wanted to destroy himself and his work.

Not that it matters much, if his society is already doomed to Rot. There's nothing that can be done; if other people learned the truth, it would only cause them distress.

**** Or maybe they would be motivated to attack the Rot problem even more furiously than before, utilizing knowledge from biology they previously thought was completely unrelated.

Not speaking about "houses and people are same" thing. It's an overwhelming insight having a lot of unexplored ethical, biological and metaphysical implications.

For Cthulhu's sake! If no one before him had noticed the Rot in humans, then there is a possibility that humans /are/ naturally resistant, and one afternoon of a genetic engineering will create new breed of safer houses.

***** If Gingerbread Man were acting rationally, he wouldn't have committed suicide. He lost his family and his home, to a disease that he'd spent his life studying and /still/ missed the most important detail.

And we know, and Gingerbread Man suspects, that there isn't a cure. Gingerbread goes moldy if it isn't eaten.

This isn't your HPMoR or your 2YE. This is a critique of the arrogance of mankind. Sometimes there just isn't a way out, no matter how brilliant you make your plans.

Not in the vacuum; not in the very dry environments.

They are able to manufacture microscopes, so they are presumably have the means to melt sand into glass (fire, probably). So they can build big glass domes, sterilize them/get rid of the oxygen with fire, and then live inside them without fear.

** Why would it be the arrogance of mankind? He gave up. If he had moved forward and tried to understand everything about the universe then perhaps you might say it was arrogance to try and understand everything.

I enjoyed the comic btw, just having some introspective analysis.
