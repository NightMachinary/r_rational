** This originally was going to be one, longer chapter (because I didn't want to have chapters that didn't have at least /some/ Pony influence) but given that I haven't released an update in almost six months and I want to reassure everyone that I will finish this story, I went ahead and turned this into a standalone chapter.

*** Would it be possible for you to post the story to Archive of Our Own? That way you can have the comics posted in the same place as the text. Ao3 allows authors to post images unlike [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]].

This entire chapter was an excellent demonstration of Albus' guilt and fears concerning his past and how Tom Riddle so strongly echoes his worst traits.

**** Yes! I didn't even realize the "no links" limitation of [[https://FF.Net][FF.Net]] until I tried to post the comics.

Do you plan to update more frequently than twice per year in the future? :-)

*** I'm on a strict once per half-decade update schedule.

Naw, I plan to complete it before Q2 2019. Much of it is already written and it just needs to be copy edited.

*** If you recall in HPMOR, McGonagall draws a distinction between "free Transfiguration" (the arbitrary transformation of one substance into another) and "Transfiguration Charms" (highly structured charms for a specific purpose). The preservation of Aberforth's head would fall under the latter category. Something along the same lines one might use to preserve a human corpse for the purpose of making a Mummy or an Inferi, neither of which wear off upon the caster's death.
