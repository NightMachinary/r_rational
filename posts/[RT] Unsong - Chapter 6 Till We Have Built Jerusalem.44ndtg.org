Jesus H christ and all the the other true prophets. Euphemism.

So the second spell they discover gives them 20/20 eyesight, while they talk about terrible outcomes of their plans... Obvious foreshadowing to the "hindsight is 20/20" proverb is obvious, in this case "foresight is 20/20"... Euphemism!

****** It started with hisses.

"Hank," Terry said, "did you hear that?"

They were slowly panning the city in a black unmarked van. Hank's coffee sloshed slightly as he turned a corner - Terry had no idea why the man drank it, it wasn't like anyone would bring him in for speaking the Wakening Name - probably the taste, as odd as that sounded, Terry couldn't stand the taste himsel - /hiss/.

"Hank," Terry said, again, "did you hear that?"

Hank turned his head. "What, you mean /hiss/ those hisses?" He shrugged, pulled up to a stoplight. "Yeah, I- there's one."

Terry hadn't heard a hiss.

/hiss/

"Probably nothing," Hank said. "Tinnitus, or something."

/hiss/ /hiss/

Terry stared out the window.

/hiss/

That couldn't be right. If it was right, the hisses would disappear if they started driving right now. And so it was probably noise from the radio.

The radio was off.

Solar flares, Terry thought, desperately, it's solar flares directly inducing current in the speakers.

Uriel had debugged solar flares last year.

And Hank was hearing them at different times.

/hiss/ /hiss/ /hisssisis/

Terry turned his head and stared at Hank, and he said thus:

"/Hank, trust me, we need to get the FUCK out of the city/"

"-but-"

"*DRIVE!*"

Hank drove.

/hiss/ /hisssisis/ /hisssss/ /hiss/

The sky turned black behind them, and the sun burnt red.

  “Whenever you use a protected Name of God,” I continued “UNSONG agents with the Sentinel Name tattooed above their ear, and the Names involve tattooed on their foreheads, can track your location. In practice they rarely do, because a million people do that every day and they don't have a million agents or a million jail cells to put people in. But if a dozen people use all sorts of Names in the same spot every day, they know it's a place where singers hang out and then if they're bored then they come and raid you. This is probably what happened in Colorado.”

  (“We have no idea who UNSONG can and can't track,” I said in my imagination. “The Coloradans weren't stupid enough to consistently use Names in their hideout because no one is that stupid. So something else went wrong. We could do everything by the book and all get arrested tomorrow.”)

And that is... unexpected.

Quite literally so. 217 is the gematria of "לא צפוי", which means "unexpected".

** I have an idea on how to make this safer, but it's based on some assumptions that I'm not 100% sure are correct.

1. If you don't know that something's a name, then you get the vision of what the name does and the name doesn't activate. This is true even if someone else has used the name before.

2. If you know that something is a name, then the name activates without the vision even if it's the first time you used the name.

Based on 1 and 2, the current system is that Llull is outputting a name without activating it, and then Aaron, knowing that it's a name, activates it without knowing what it does. This seems so obviously dangerous that I don't understand how Aaron and Ana don't see it.

My idea is to have Llull output a list of, say, nine dud names and one real name. If Aaron reads this list, will the real name give him a vision and not activate? Does knowing that one of the names is real sufficient to activate the name without a vision?
