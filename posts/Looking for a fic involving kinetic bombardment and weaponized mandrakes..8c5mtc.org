Title.

I loosely remember reading an arc somewhere about Harry Potter abusing transfiguration to drop tungsten rods from broomsticks at high altitude and dropping mandrakes to incapacitate ground forces.

--------------

Especially the idea of transfiguring tungsten rods sounds a /lot/ like HPMOR, but I've just been through the entire thing for a second read and it didn't come up there.

** Did it also have house elf space marines and some discussion of using temporary transfiguration + an indestructibility charm to compress matter into a black hole? If so, I think it was [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-si.233048/page-17#post-8464838][this.]]
