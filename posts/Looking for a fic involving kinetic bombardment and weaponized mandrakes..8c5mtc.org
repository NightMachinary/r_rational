Title.

I loosely remember reading an arc somewhere about Harry Potter abusing transfiguration to drop tungsten rods from broomsticks at high altitude and dropping mandrakes to incapacitate ground forces.

Especially the idea of transfiguring tungsten rods sounds a /lot/ like HPMOR, but I've just been through the entire thing for a second read and it didn't come up there.

** Did it also have house elf space marines and some discussion of using temporary transfiguration + an indestructibility charm to compress matter into a black hole? If so, I think it was [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-si.233048/page-17#post-8464838][this.]]
