I thought the story was a bit simplistic, to be honest. It felt like Promestein's side-plot was tacked on without being properly integrated with the main narrative and underdeveloped overall. It's a bit disappointing, since it resonates much stronger with me than the trite "love that overcomes all obstacles" main plot.

** "The Dagger and the Coin" Quintet by Daniel Abraham.

It's entirely rational except for one thing, which is perhaps explainable with in-universe reasons.

The author's been recommended here before for a short story, and I've recommended him as well. I've heard good things about his other works, but can't attest to their rationality myself. I'd wager they are, though. He seems an author of a thoroughly rational bent.

*** I listened to the entire series on audible. It's definitely a work of rational fiction, and a good one at that. However, it takes place in a pretty realistic late medieval/early renaissance setting, and there's very little magic in it. The characters don't have access to modern neuroscience, economics, decision theory or any of the scientific literature we have on heuristics and biases like we do in the real world. Because of this there is a limit to how rational characters can be, and you won't be seeing as much munchkinning in this story as you might see in some of the other stories here. That being said, there is still munchkinning and it is pretty impressive munchkinning even by the standards of the modern world.

It's not that the character is blunt or rude, although the fact that he's an asshole even beyond his anxiety to communicate with others doesn't do him any favours.

However, if you don't like the style so far I would stop because that's consistent throughout.

Regarding the situation at chapter 11, I don't think I would have done much different, he did do things reasonably well and at a good rhythm(in such a way that what makes me so surprised is how some groups got done on the village in just one or two days), but its more related to the contrast between what he wonders and what he did, how many times does he refer to dwarves and elves instead of asking if they exist? The stuff with the rabbits and the ecosystem around, those are the kind of answers that other groups probably didn't get by themselves so his pride in lacking communication with the inhabitants and/or the captain certainly didn't help.

*** Seeing this recommendation I decided to try it out. Like [[/u/Drexer]], I was... less than impressed with the beginning. The main character is so damn unlikable. But the chapters are short, and sometimes wit, humor, and memes showed through, so I stuck with it.

Now it's less than a day later and I'm on chapter 80. I've laughed out loud plenty of times. The MC is still really unlikable but more in a curmudgeonly way than an outright asshole like he first was. Still pretty frustrating with his sexist tirades, though. I don't know the age of the author, but I wouldn't be surprised if he was mid-20s or younger - the immaturity that oozes through the MC's words just seems too genuine. But hey, if the author is instead a woman in her mid-40s or something, damn good job getting into the head of an annoying male college student!

I wouldn't necessarily call it rationalist fiction (because the MC lacks the social grace to make rational choices and seems to have INSANELY good luck), but it's really humorous and catchy. I feel like the story caught its stride after the first score of chapters - probably about the time they found the, uh, unicorn bunnies.

Hmmm, maybe... but I feel like [[/u/whywhisperwhy]] is correct when he says the characters act consistently. The MC /does/ act like a socially reclusive and antisocial late teen without any higher education might act. If their ages skewed lower the behavior might be more forgivable and less alienating to readers. But even at their current ages I think it's still believable. Heck, I'm sure we all know people several years older than the characters who behave and think far worse.

I actually think it would be less believable with younger ages in some ways. At 15-16 you could be jaded and cynical, but usually it's based on emotional rebellion (feeling superior because you're stand-offish and act like an asshole). At 19-20, I more easily buy that the MC is just depressed and cynical, but still has the life experience to detach himself from others and think about the situation in a different way. He's an asshole not because being an asshole is cool, but because he expects nothing from the world and doesn't give anything back to it. I see that as requiring more years of experience than a 15 year old would have.

Yeah, thinking about it, the ages work. If he was 5-10 years older he'd probably have his temper under control and at least be smart enough to think before he goes off on people. At 19-20, he has enough experience to recognize the illogical actions of his group but not enough to stop himself from making things worse with his outbursts.

Not sure if that answered your question or just rambled ;-)

To me the question of the ages was less about the main character and more about the other visitors, as their organization in stereotypical high-school groups seemed to me much more of an younger behaviour than a university behaviour. But then I reminded myself that my local culture and behaviours in that regard can be wildly different than the UK one, so maybe it's minimally consistent?

It just seems to me like the behaviour of the other groups/characters is far too similar to what one would expect from a teen movie to feel realistic.

****** [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/][The Gods Are Bastards]] is an on-going high fantasy web serial that is rational and has very high writing quality. The world itself is based on standard D&D worldbuilding, but is just starting to undergo industrialization and has a very modern feel to it.

The primary focus is on a small, eclectic group of young adults who are essentially maturing adventurers at the beginning of their careers, but the overall cast builds up to least ten unique, fleshed-out POV characters and there's a dizzying amount of intrigue once the story starts going. Again, it does draw some inspiration from standard high fantasy stock but overall the plots and characters are creative and have a lot of depth. The magic system isn't anything special but it is very consistent and logically ordered.

I think its best points include: 1) very witty, pithy dialogue, 2) characters are pretty uniformly rational and capable of learning, and 3) the overarching plot is epic and mysterious with good pacing. The main downside is that with so many POV characters, the world can start to sprawl slightly and plot can move slowly (however, to be fair I would describe ASoIaF this way too).

It consistently updates 2-3 times a week (MW, periodically F) and has a ridiculous word count at this point.

I would suggest reading the first several chapters and deciding if you like the style, it's pretty consistent.

*** I geniunely like reincarnation fic, but it's just a subset of my like for portal fics in general, so it gets kind of annoying how they drown out everything else. My theory is that they're extremely easy to justify (built in ROB) and the wish-fulfillment helps people get over the initial worldbuilding hump. Notice how all the early munchkinry and being absurdly competent for a child happens at the same time as most of the boring exposition?

I would like to see more "portal between the planets" stuff, though. The MLP fandom had a shitload of it, for whatever reason, but it's pretty rare in the general sense to society-scale instead of just main character-scale interaction.

******* Forgive me if I get some of the details wrong or mixed up between books. It's been a while.

Consider Phlebas opens with the main character being tortured by slow drowning in sewage. Later, some time after he escapes from that, he is captured by a bunch of people from a high tech society who have formed a cult worshiping an enormously fat toothless guy, who enjoys eating his followers using blade dentures, and making all his followers eat nothing but his excrement. This scene goes on at rather great length. I forget exactly where the dick cutting was in Consider Phlebas, but I remember noting it, and it likely relates to the fat toothless psychopath's liking for what he calls "sweetmeats". Also the ending is pointless, empty, and boring.

In The Player Of Games, early on the main character and some other guy are walking through an amusement arcade when they happen upon a mud wrestling match between an alien female and an alien male from two different planets. The female holds the male under the mud to drown him, but his, um, reproductive organ bobs up to the top and the main character's companion remarks that the male can breath using his organ. Someone in the crowd of spectators tosses the female a knife and she cuts off the male's reproductive organs and holds them up triumphantly to the crowds general approval, while finishing off drowning the male. Neither the main character nor his companion seem bothered by this. The kinda bad guy gets killed in the end of this book, so I guess the ending wasn't quite as pointless. Sorta meh, though.

In Use of Weapons I forget exactly where the emasculation scene takes place, but there was one. I seem to recall some kind of party where naked slaves are used as servants and the guests are invited to mutilate them for their greater pleasure, or something along those lines (possibly the guests were mutilating each other with the aid of high tech healing devices). Once again the ending is pointless, empty, and boring. Actually, in this one the whole plotline is pointless. The main character felt kinda guilty about something or other, so he committed suicide. Wow, that's deep there. Real deep.

The Wasp Factory is all about emasculation, grossing the audience out by creatively disgusting descriptions of disgusting uses of various disgusting bodily fluids and excretions (sorry for the repetition of disgusting, but the book was also /very repetitious/ on the subject), and gleeful descriptions which rather fail at being funny of a child murdering various innocent people. In that one the main character supposedly has his reproductive organs bitten off before the book starts, and there's much on the subject. Twist ending was mildly entertaining for its audaciousness.

After I got to that point, and after I skimmed Look To Windward and didn't notice anything better than in the other books, I swore I would never read any more of his trash again. I'm glad he could release some of his psychological problems in writing, but I fail to understand why people enjoy reading torture and disgustingness porn wrapped in a thin shell of poorly thought out science fiction/fantasy elements.

No, seriously, Star Wars is more scientific than the "science" in his stuff. Gridfire? Cheap FTL travel? Matter synthesis from nothing or the practical equivalent? The science makes little difference to the plot except to sound cool, like a coat of shiny paint the author mixed up and slapped on (unlike in Niven's Ringworld which also has a lot of those elements and yet where the science and its results are breathtaking and awe inspiring, making up for the flat characters)? Yep. And that's fine, I don't mind science fantasy as long as it's internally logically consistent and has interesting characters, societies, and plot lines.

But in Banks' Culture, many of the citizens are apparently bored out of their minds from having super powerful AIs grant their every wish, and what with there being little for humans to do because AIs do everything so much better and are so much smarter. And this society is shown as stable and stagnant over thousands of years. And yet apparently not one single Culture citizen ever said to their personal wish granting genie, "I'm bored. Entertaining myself in more and more extreme and dangerous ways is getting old, but I can't do anything real because I'd screw it up. Hey, why don't you make me smart enough to figure out something worthwhile to do?". And though citizens leave the Culture for various purposes when their entertainment needs become too extreme for the Culture to satisfy (and other reasons), apparently none left to get mental enhancements which their AIs denied them in the interest of preserving their stagnant society.

**** Not a huge spoiler by any stretch of the imagination, and not really relevant to much besides this point, but watch out if you don't want anything spoiled. The disproportionate influence of the mages really clicks when you find out that they have ways of communicating other than sending someone on a horse for half a month or more. Official magi can make what is basically a short range radio in the form of a magical glyph or symbol unique to them. They can place this anywhere, even on people, and use it to talk to anyone near one within it's range. The people on the other end can call up the magus, too, but it requires a level 3 acolyte's power to call it up. It's a method of communication unique to magi that allows much greater communication and organisation of forces and therefore bestows a huge advantage to any magi that decides to command an armed force. Never mind the magi's own personal clout, just imagine what would have happened if, say, Napoleon got ahold of an easily reproducible radio. The magi are in power for a very good reason.

[[http://www.all-night-laundry.com/][All Night Laundry]] which is an awesome interactive illustrated serial story about time-travel and Lovecraftian abominations. Fairly rational since the characters are intelligent and the readers actually want Bina to succeed unlike other MSPA forum stories where the readers were just giving goofy commands. Been updating *daily* for three years now and the author has never missed an update deadline yet.

[[http://www.prequeladventure.com/2015/10/3834/][Prequel]] is a really good character-development story about a Kajit from Elder Scrolls trying to turn her life around from alcoholism and inexplicable nightmares by running away to another town to reinvent herself in an attempt to improve her life. It's not rational, but it's not irrational either, since she has very good reasons for messing up. She genuinely struggles with bad luck, alcoholism, and being homeless/poor (and maybe some depression), but it's all about being optimistic and taking matters into one's own hands to make life better rather than relying on luck or others to do it for you. The first few posts should be enough to decide if you like it.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/235720/dark-horse-a-five-score-tale-from-the-dresden-files][Dark Horse]] is a really good cross-over between /My Little Pony/ and the /Dresden series/. Nothing glaringly rational or irrational. I don't think any more needs to be said.

** Recommending Berserk, a dark fantasy manga (and old anime). Nobody's /stupid/, but the mc does solve his problems with the power of a 600 pound 'sword' rather than using his brain. What it has going for it though is very good characters, a world darker than Lovecraft, and demons.

In a somewhat unusual way of structuring things, I recommend (strongly) that if you read it you start with the 'Golden Age' arc, which starts at the end of volume 3 and runs all the way to volume 14. This is where a 'flashback' starts that is about 100 chapters long, and the plot twist at the end of it is revealed in the non-flashback chapters that precede it. Reading everything in publication order is like walking into the cinema to watch Lord of the Rings with giant posters outside saying "You'll be so sad when Gandalf dies, but then he doesn't!"

Anyway. The anime agrees with me. It skips most of the stuff before the 'flashback'. Though even there, skip the first episode for optimal enjoyment.

**** Manga. If you strongly prefer anime in general, sure, go for it, but it suffers from a low budget, so many still frames and ugly faces. The manga is very well drawn.

(Also see the parent comment as to why you might like it a lot slightly more if you don't start quite at the beginning.)

** Recommending [[http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Sankarea/Sankarea-1?id=3097][Sankarea]] manga. Really interesting dark and weird supernatural romance story about zombies.

I like the Transhumanist angle of trying to overcome death that its explored a little bit in the later arcs.

The characters interact nicely and the story picks up after the first arc conclusion. I like how they discuss their problems unlike most cliché works where all the drama comes from misunderstandings. Be warned though that its not a rational work.

--------------

Also looking for something like [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]. I love time travel stories and protagonists that try to optimize their situation, particularly if they use logic to overcome their problems.

Already read Metropolitan Man which comes close on the problem solving angle. Any other you would recommend?

I've had this plot bunny for a while of a ninja team that is formed explicitly for doing only D-Ranks, all the time. I think it's funny that someone else had an idea along similar lines (disgruntled protagonist cleans up everyone else's messes). I think I'll revisit it when I become a better writer.

[[http://patreon.com/davidstorrs][The Change Storms: Induction]] [link to my Patreon, free download] is a rational superhero story; it's about 98,000 words.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death]] is the rational Naruto quest I co-write with [[/u/Velorien]]. I've written 67,000 words for that and he's written about the same, I think.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko][Team Anko]] is a Naruto fanfiction and about 164,000 words. I think it starts out pretty well but I'm not satisfied with the later parts.

There's [[http://www.amazon.com/David-K.-Storrs/e/B00WCPXLMA][the stuff on Amazon]] under my name:

- The Draugar War: Opening Salvo: A Tale of Anundjå (15,600 words; same universe as 2YE)
- One Hot Night (9300 words; same universe as 2YE)
- A Position So Fragile (8500 words; part of The Change Storms series)
- The Change Storms: Acquisition (11,000 words)
- Pay Attention (17,700 words; rational horror)
- Baby Blues (rational horror and, IMO, the best thing I've written; 15,400 words)

Then there's various odds and ends, plus the various things I've done under pen names. I'd guesstimate that's about another 300,000 but I haven't counted it.

Do you think you could use the power of UNIX to create an EPUB of the stories on your patreon page? I thought it was funny when I opened up the document only to find out that it was an archive containing a folder that contained a folder that contained a folder that contained like 30 /separate/ HTML files for each of the chapters. I can open them and read them, but I thought it was kind of silly.

********** EPUBs, MOBIs, and PDFs are available to Patreon patrons, but otherwise what's there is the raw HTML, which is what I write in.

EDIT: As to there being multiple directories: if you look around a bit you'll see that you're getting more than the story. That is an archive of everything related to 2YE -- the notes, the cover (which, incidentally, I paid for), etc. The various directories are how I organize things when I write. Also, there's only one file per chapter, so I'm not sure what you're seeing. If you see files beginning with _, just ignore them. They are an artifact of the OSX archive tool which I haven't figured out how to get rid of.

That said, avoiding dumb mistakes that appear obvious to my human-level intelligence shouldn't be too much to ask, if the author is going for a clever character.
