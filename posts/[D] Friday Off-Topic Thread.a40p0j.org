Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I found [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2fyviJHwWQ][this video]] rather interesting. It's about when "continuity" matters in film. A good companion is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAvn7CNpdB8][this video]] about what a script supervisor does.

In short, the argument put forward by the first video is that most people won't notice minor continuity errors if they're little things like the color of someone's shirt, the level of coffee in someone's mug, the part of someone's hair, etc. /Obviously/ you'd rather not have those things, but film is constrained by budget, and you can only shoot so many takes, you only have a location for a limited time, and you have to work within actor's schedules, so sometimes you have to choose between whether you take the set of shots that create a continuity error, or whether you take the weaker performance. Given that most continuity errors are "invisible" on first viewing for someone who's watching the movie and engrossed in it, it's sensible to take the better performance, so long as the error isn't immersion breaking.

That said, what's "immersion breaking" is different for a lot of people. Whenever I'm watching a television show or movie and someone gets sprayed with blood (or some other liquid), it almost always takes me out of what I'm watching, because that mix of practical effects and makeup is /incredibly/ hard to do right, and as a consequence, it almost never is. Someone gets splashed in the face with blood (like from a gunshot) and then the blood splatter changes in the next shot, because /there/ it's applied by a makeup artist, and applying specific splatter is really difficult.

*** Continuity is on a lot of people's minds because a break in continuity ruins the narrative that everything in the film was in control and part of a vision. This is less "immersion breaking" on the "this shouldn't have happened" level and more immersion breaking on the level of "the director couldn't control this kind of small thing, what else did they accidentally let go?" See Monogatari Series S2 for examples of continuity breaks being used for comedic effect, like this [[https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11392/why-does-kaiki-keep-changing-shirts][one scene]] where the characters shirts, accessories, and locale all change every cut. (one of my favorite scenes of all time, in any film)

** Has anyone seen any good articles/discussion about the ethics of supporting "free" content creators?

My plan has always been that once I get into my chosen career I will donate $1 a month to creators that I've basically chosen as valuable to myself and not currently well supported. If someone is already making hundreds of thousands I don't mind freeloading, as opposed to someone entertaining hundreds or thousands as a hobby I would love to be part of the group that could support them doing it full time if they choose. Unfortunately this arbitrary system doesn't really mesh with my attempts at living more in line with the categorical imperative. I also predict this will benefit me, with those creators advertisements for support making me feel happy about helping them/others as opposed to guilty about not doing so.

​

Would anyone else be willing to share their guidelines for who/how they support creators online? Also what are people's opinions on monthly vs per publication patreons?

​

Side note - Another consideration for me is that I use an adblocker and skip in content ads, so non-direct support from me is minimal even if I was going to pretend that the percents of cents they would get from me was fair compensation.

** So, what do people think about what's been happening on tumblr?

*** Gross incompetence on the part of the admins, or possibly from the corporate overlords of the admins. It seems like the problem that sparked this was child pornography on the platform, which had gone unchecked (or underchecked) for a long, long time, until it finally got them kicked off Apple's app store. Their response to that has gone /way/ too far, and even if they undid the rules change now, they've created so much uncertainty and done so much damage that it seems unlikely that they're going to last as a platform. This is especially the case when a lot of the people that got caught in the crossfire weren't even doing "normal" porn, just regular art. Drive away the content creators, and there's not going to be much left, and once people start leaving, network effects can't prop up the platform anymore.

(I never used tumblr for anything but following a select few people who migrated to that platform instead of somewhere with more sensible/pleasing UI, and even then, not so much, just due to the way that back-and-forth comments get mixed in with interesting top-level posts, so it doesn't affect me at all.)

*** I was about to say it'll be a pain finding everyone who leaves, wherever we go in the next age, but then I remembered I already knew pretty much everyone I follow from platforms they had elsewhere---/except/ the porn blogs.

Tumblr had the benefit of being a site without sleazy ads/branding, which was good for friends sharing self-porn and for weird porn to operate without having to feel like an appendage on the vanilla porn machine. I think the only major platform like this now is Twitter, which is a little less optimal as it puts more focus on ThreadMode than DocumentMode so the experience is more about conversation than content.

I'm hoping it'll nudge people more towards self-hosting or the fediverse, so we're not relying so much on single points of failure at the platform level.

** Was looking at the [[https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2018?ref_=pe_2701710_378144660&rto=x_gr_e_nf_gca_2018&utm_campaign=winners&utm_content=more_categories&utm_medium=email&utm_source=choice_awards][2018 goodreads awards]] and I noticed that only 5/21 winners were men(and Steven King won in two categories). I took a quick look at the nominees and the ratio is about the same. Of the 21 categories, only 2 of them had more male nominees. Another 2-3 50/50. Most categories had only around 1/4 - 1/3 men. From looking at past years winners and nominees, it's not a new thing either, though it seems a bit worse this year.

I'm honestly quite surprised. From reading the occasional article I had this perception that women faced discrimination and had a harder time getting published or something along those lines. I remember a big hooha about that a few years ago on [[/r/books][r/books]], articles and anecdotes about women who use initials to hide their gender, or women who get rejected by publishers/agents and then re-submit their manuscripts with male names and get accepted.

*** What's the gender ratio of Goodreads members? It's hard to find specific numbers, but if the audience skews heavily female that would explain why most winners are female (based on what I know about demographics and reader preference).

**** Agree. Based on the reviewers of most books I check out on goodreads, the reviews skew 70/30 female. Heavier skew on more popular works of fiction.

**** That I don't know, and I can't seem to find anyone that has written about it. Anecdotally, it seems that most of the higher rated reviews are by women.

[[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/17/business/women-buy-fiction-in-bulk-and-publishers-take-notice.html][This article]] from '97 has it as much as 80% of fiction books are bought by women! More recent articles has it between 1/4 to 1/3, so that seems to match the ratio of nominees pretty well. Also, [[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/25/readers-prefer-authors-own-sex-goodreads-survey][this other article]] says that people tend to strongly prefer reading books written by their own gender.

After digging a bit more, it seems the complaint is specific to literary fiction, which they claim is heavily biased towards male writers, from reviewers to awards. Now I'm wondering if there is a substantive difference in quality at the very top or if there is in fact discrimination going on.

***** I have heard that the Goodreads userbase skews heavily female. Also, the publishers making those decisions skew heavily female (something in the ballpark of 80/20, iirc). So if there is discrimination, this is an intra-womanhood problem.
