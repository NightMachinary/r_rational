[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/82u2ei/biweekly_challenge_meditation/][Last time]], the prompt was "Meditation". Our winner is [[/u/vi_fi]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/82u2ei/biweekly_challenge_meditation/dvf8m15/]["The Arahat Signal"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/vi_fi]] for their tenth win! I've decided just now that our regular "superwinner" rule should be extensible, meaning that instead of getting to select a challenge after 5 wins, it should be every 5 * N wins - a distinction that [[/u/vi_fi]] is the first to attain.

Next time, the challenge will be *Premortem*, here referring to a specific technique first coined by Gary Klein in [[https://www.amazon.com/Power-Intuition-Feelings-Better-Decisions/dp/0385502893][The Power of Intuition]]. In a pre-mortem, you imagine that something has failed, then imagine why that would be the case, as a sort of extension of [[https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html][security mindset]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team][red team]] thinking. For the purposes of this challenge, you don't need to center your story around an actual pre-mortem, only around someone catching a mistake before it happens (or failing to catch a mistake, but at least putting in the effort), which should sufficiently open up the story-space. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, April 4th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be *Comedy*. This will be the third or fifth time we've done a broader genre challenge like this (the previous ones being [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3e98lr/weekly_challenge_rational_horror/][Horror]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4hx2rs/biweekly_challenge_romance/][Romance]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3pp3lw/biweekly_challenge_fables_and_legends/][Fables]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4sq04k/biweekly_challenge_happy_stories/][Happy Stories]], depending on whether you want to count those last two). I waffled between having the prompt as "comedy" or just "humor"; you should consider either as appropriate. Of all the broad style/tone genres, I think that comedy is the worst fit for rational fiction, though it's an element in much of the "rational canon". The most natural point of interaction between them is probably humor as an element of deconstruction, but that's a matter of personal opinion.

If you'd like a more directed prompt, the optional "constrained" version of this prompt is a comedy or humorous piece featuring the "grunts" of some large, fantastical institution, such as janitors working on the Death Star, washerwomen in the Dark Lord's tower, or spectators at a death race - someone who isn't a main character and has to live their own life around the insanity that is genre fiction. (This is, again, optional.)

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 4/4*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8694pp/challenge_companion_premortem/][is available here]].
