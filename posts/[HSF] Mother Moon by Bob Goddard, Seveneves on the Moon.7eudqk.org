** A book very similar in tone and premise to /Red Mars/ and /Seveneves/: Earth is kaput, and a colony on the Moon must struggle to survive. Unfortunately or fortunately depending on your outlook the technical details of the situation don't appear to be the main focus of the story, while still hard sci-fi, the story seems to be more interested in the human aspect. Another fault I could point out with the story is that it's quite episodic, progressing in a series of timeskips. But I believe if you liked /Red Mars/ and/or /Seveneves/ you'll like this one.

UPD: Another thing, the blurb will have you believe that there are two equal parallel plots, that's a misrepresentation, the second plot is no more than a decoration sprinkled relatively sparsely over the story.
