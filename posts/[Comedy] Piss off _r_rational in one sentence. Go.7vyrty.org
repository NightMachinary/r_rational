**** Non-specifically, the idea that suspension of disbelief for one thing (like the existence of werewolves) means suspension of disbelief for a totally different thing (like a plot that doesn't make sense). It's fairly common to see that line of argument used (I have a few guesses why).

More specifically, and what I was thinking of when I made that comment, there were a few episodes of a popular fantasy series ([[#s][show's name]]) where the producers played fast and loose with the established speeds and travel times in order to make their dramatic moments happen, and that particular line was one that I saw a fair amount, because that show has big honking dragons.

***** Indeed, and this is also what really makes the difference between hard and soft sci-fi. You can write a hard sci-fi story in a world with a lot of fantastic and exotic violations of known physical laws, if the world and the plot is consistent.

You can have the weirdest magic, you can have literal gods literally walk the earth, the suspension of disbelief can work if your story sticks to the rules it set up. I could imagine some pretty hard and rational fic in a D&D setting, even if it makes fun of many of its ridiculous features, mainly because how well-established the rules of magic are: it is well known and well described what every spell can and cannot do.

Game of Thrones is set in a universe where Dragons exist. These dragons can fly. It is also set in a universe where throughout the show, people travel at medieval speeds.

Then we enter the last part, and the dragons fly, as we know they can. And some dude suddenly travels 2000 miles in day.... hold up. that ain't right. How did he do that? And our suspension of disbelief is broken.

********* it was a problem through the whole series that came to a head with that flight.

More and more, characters started jumping around from place to place like they had jetpacks. Littlefinger and Varys were the worst about this. They would pop 1000 miles in the course of an episode, where it took months in the past. This was hand-waved all along by show watchers as just asynchronous timelines, and while it felt weak it was an explanation that just had to be accepted.

The scene on the frozen lake put an end to the timeline explanation.

Here we had events that had to be lined up chronologically, because they were causal.

1. Jon and team gets chased by wights.\\
2. Jon sends Gendry to run to the wall.
3. Jon is trapped on the island in the lake. it is day time and the lake is melty.\\
4. Gendry runs to the wall - a trip that was a substantial trek just an episode earlier\\
5. A raven is dispatched to Dany\\
6. Raven arrives at Danny. It is day time.\\
7. Dany starts flying to the wall.\\
8. It's night time on the lake, and the ice freezes. wights attack.\\
9. Dany arrives.

This all has to happen in less than a single day. The distance from Dragonstone to the wall is thousands of miles. It's completely implausible, and compiled on top of all the previous examples of teleporting characters it just broke the ice, so to speak.

************* Then they could have taken a few seconds to /show/ those extra days. It would have cost maybe six minutes total of the episode to show the blacksmith running heroically through the snowy landscape (and lets forget he saw snow the first time in his life just days ago, and has lived in a city all his life), shown the gang on the island suffering from the cold more and more every day, and shown the raven and dragonflight passing over various geography at various times of day. It could have been short cuts mixed in with some other part of the plot going on.

Terribly handled. I was going /"oh, come on!"/ multiple times in that episode. And it doesn't end with the travel times.

Like when Snow decides to run /away/ from the rescue dragon (/doh!/), fall and /sink/ into a freezing lake, not only survive but crawl up, find his sword within easy reach and then /not/ die from hypothermia before a deus ex ranger rides in, puts snow on his undead-immune horse and then promtly sacrifices himself. It is so /obvious/ that those painful plot acrobatics were just to make Denny worried and then happy when Snow lives.

So, yeah, that rant felt good. It's even more glaring when the series is so damn good in other aspects.

****** I think that it actually /is/ common for different works to adhere to different standards of "reality". Cartoons would be one good example, especially the classics like Bugs Bunny or Wile E. Coyote; the work is absurdist, and exists within this framework wherein someone getting smashed in the head and growing a foot-long lump exists beside gravity kicking in when you realize that you're not running over flat land. Magical realism is written such that metaphorical or visual aberrations are part of the grammar of the work. Surrealism is about evoking something in the reader rather than being strictly literal.

So then you get people who come to science fiction or fantasy, and see something like a dragon, and think "oh, okay, everything in this story is metaphor or allegory or not /supposed/ to make sense on close inspection" even when that's clearly contradicted by the narrative grammar, word of god, or just common sense.

In a way, fiction trains us in how to read it, and I think the reaction of "it's fantasy, therefore it's made of plot holes" is just that training gone amok. (As compared to something like telenovellas or soap operas, which often /are/ made of contrivances and plot holes, but that's part of how they're meant to be enjoyed, and how they present themselves.)

(I think maybe if I make this argument again it will be with an extended metaphor using painters like Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso, and Chuck Close, each with their own unique style, where their individual paintings would be ruined if a tenth of that painting was done in a completely different style.)

Eg changing from the Maxim of Persistence: Perfection is Eternal, which requires exactly accurate performance of rituals, to the Maxim of Perseverance: Repetition Unto Success, which doesn't care about accuracy but requires the rituals to be done hundreds of times.

Cue societal chaos.

/Master of the Five Magics/ actually starts out pretty hard-fantasy but by the end I'm going "you did the equivalent of auditing the first class in 'intro to the fifth magic' and now you're beating up demons with it?"

OK, I enjoyed it, guilty pleasure, but if I was reading it now I'd classify it as wish-fulfillment SI fanfic.

I vaguely remember what you're talking about but I don't actually remember reading the sequels. Maybe I did.

***** [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]] is almost certainly the other one you're thinking about, and is arguably a better example than Ra, since Ra's particular brand of magic is mostly consistent even though it deliberately flies in the fact of most known science.

Unsong, on the other hand, has a world where rational materialism is literally breaking down in favor of metaphysical symbolism and abstract theology. So of course megacorporations start manipulating this by using sweatshops to brute-force discover the setting's magic.

**** Ell Goonish Shive has something sorta like that, Magic is intelligent but not in a way we would recognise and the rules are "built?" with narrative causality in mind, they thus can be slightly inconsistent and with exsploitabilities and flexabilities but this is fine due to the cultural circumstances this iteration of magical law surrounds, if Magic can't remain in it's cultural context or it's fundamental laws are called into conflict and it cannot be resolved with minor subtle changes I.E. a magitech civilization limited by hideously expensive elemental aluminium finds a way to mass produce it or something philosophically important to the Magic like the distinction between organic and inorganic becomes irrelevant or like in the stories case fundamentally secret magic becomes public then the whole thing is rebuilt from the ground up, this principle works in reverse too, if the removal of some particular laws means that a race that uses shapeshifting in their biology can no longer shapeshift and would go exstinct then those laws are less likely to change. That said it's not that big a part of the story, if you want something much better then try reading Fine Structure, it quite different, rather darker, more complex and definitely "Sci-Fi"er and has a mechanic like that quite centeral, I shant say more.

Let's be charitable here and say you spend another lifetime not only becoming as good at harp as you can pretty much ever get but also just screwing around with it. 100 years to make sure you're a master, 100 years to get bored of being a master.

I find even one lifetime spent on this a stretch because it'll pretty much be "light" everywhere, but whatever, you're bored and spend a lifetime examining all the minutiae of the plasma. Let's say you spend another lifetime becoming a sun expert. 200 years.

Let's say a lifetime to git gud enough to go there and two lifetimes to get bored of studying it and come back. 300 years.

That doesn't sound fun to me at all -- it's novel initially but ultimately you're not doing much more than breaking rocks in space. Let's be conservative again and say you spend a lifetime as an asteroid miner and 2 additional lifetimes on the journey there and back and to add it to your memoirs. 300 years.

#+begin_quote
  Play high stakes poker and win Play high stakes poker and lose

I find it hard to believe poker will still be interesting after you spend 200 years becoming good enough to effortlessly count cards. Let's say 100 more years learning to read people. 300 years.

#+begin_quote

Let's be super conservative here and say you spend 10 lifetimes, hell 100 lifetimes, screwing your way through the earth's populace, 10 lifetimes learning enough chemistry to make cures for all the diseases you get and 10 lifetimes to manufacture them. 10,000 years +1,000 years + 1,000 years let's round that and say 20,000 years.

#+begin_quote
  Go on a space walk
#+end_quote

Maaaaybe 200 years to get there and have your walk for ~50 years and get back. It's just black and stars all around you, I can't see it being fun for long. But let's say 500 years.

#+begin_quote
  Ride on a space elevator
#+end_quote

Physically impossible, sorry.

Let's say 3 lifetimes before someone lets you strap yourself to a rocket to get launched in space and another 2 to get back. 500 years.

45,320 years in total.

Gratz, by my calculations, you're still in your "teens." 4% of 1,000,000 years. Even if you're resistant to boredom and triple all my estimations, that's still barely more than a tenth of 1,000,000 years, nevermind a billion years.

After this you say, screw it, and do everything here all over again. And again. And 7 more times, 10 total.

Putting aside the fact that you /vastly/ underestimate how much of something it would take to get bored, and that you don't factor in the fact that some of these objectives might be done at the same time, we still haven't even skimmed the top of the barrel. How about: meet every human that ever lived, will live, and is living in every town within every country on every planet and get to know them until I love them better than they love themselves. Create simulated universes that perfectly represent my favorite fictional worlds and live out lifetimes as every single man woman and child within them, forgetting each time. Work on enough science to discover the key to faster-than-light travel and unravel the mysteries of the universe. Create alien species, if I can't find them on my own, and work silently to uplift them to the same standards that I hold myself.

The point isn't the amount of time any of these things take. The point is that I want to live a thousand years already in order to fulfill my goals, and in a thousand years I expect I'll want to live a thousand more. If these are things I can come up with as a sub-centenarian babe like myself, how many more objectives will I have thought up in a thousand years? What about a million? If I don't have any new goals, that's surely a crisis of creativity, not an objective limit on the number of possible unique mental states that a human can experience.

You can count cards in blackjack, but in poker the deck is completely reshuffled after every hand so it's completely worthless. Poker skills are about learning probabilities, bluffing, and reading and understanding all available information (raises, folds, bet sizes as well as unconscious signals people may send when nervous). If you're joined in your pursuit by other people you might be able to spend a lot of time one-upping and learning from each other.

  avoid death by boredom.
#+end_quote

I was thinking more likely madness, with the brain conjuring up fantasies of what's not physically possible in order to entertain itself. There's bound to be more physically impossible things than physically possible ones so living in one's imagination would probably become easier. Sort of like how people start to hallucinate when sensorally deprived -- someone would have experienced pretty much everything there is to experience, many times over, so anything outside their fantasies might seem effectively like white noise to them, or close enough to encourage the same symptoms.

Either that or maybe just "death" by wireheading. I'm not sure burning out pleasure receptors is something that can get boring.

"Do you realize what genre cavets and aesthetic trappings are? They're the things you put in a story to evoke a feeling that 'this is cyberpunk' or 'this is high fantasy' or 'this is a coming of age story'. Things like, megacorps which don't very much care about you, or not wanting to grow up and become an adult, or a strange new world that doesn't exactly operate according to your rules of logic (for example, strange wizards who do things in strange ways?). These are things that settings live on. If you drive a monster trunk full of your 'logic and reasoning' over these things, you are failing to understand what makes these settings evocative and inspiring in the first place."

**** I will be honest. This one is one of the most annoying quotes in this entire post to me. The reason is that it was clearly written by someone who has some clue of what they were talking about but somehow missed the obvious reasons for rational fiction. A logical world with people acting with human minds has many advantages. The magic system or whatever is special about it sets as a different world, whereas the reasonable villains and others show that people are still people. The consistency of the world helps with immersion, and lets people speculate ahead regarding the plans of the characters. All of these are positives that require the logic the author of this quote hates. This person said something that sounds reasonable unless you think about for a minute and that annoys me the most. A consistent world with consistent people is plus whether you like exploring people or exploring worlds.

**** There isn't a good reason for Taylor not to have joined the Wards before her first night out. It is dismissed in one line as bad because of teenage drama and scheduling but then she is so desperate for affection that she joins the undersiders with more teenage drama and problems. You can say unreliable narrator and someting about her father but her father her is basically a non-entity.

There are obvious problems with going undercover in a group with a thinker called Tattletale and expecting that cover to last long term. There are obvious problems with going undercover in a group when you have no official backing and indeed official disapproval. Taylor approaches Soverign Citizen level stupidity which drains a lot of sympathy.

Conflict keeps getting propped up by one dimensional villain charachters like Bakuda and the Slaughterhouse Nine.

The Leviathan fight is some bullshit. Armsmaster's plan was bullshit and shouldn't have worked at all. Leviathan may have great mobility but that shouldn't prevent Legend or Eidolan from keeping up with it and providing updating location reports. Armsmaster plans to and does fight Leviathan one and one. That is completely suicidal given how dangerous Leviathan and the other endbringers are stated to be. I don't care if he can predict or has the halberd to damage it. Leviathan should have still wiped the floor with him immediately just on its strength and speed.

At the hospital they lock Skitter into restraints because she is a villain including her broken arm. Then she gets out (no one notices her swiping the keys with bugs and the bugs are able to unlock her restraints) and moves into the next room over to find unmasked Shadow Stalker (They keep heroes and villains right next to each other. Shadow Stalker's mask is taken off and kept off for some reason. Shadow stalker is set right next to Skitter). Then she is caught by the heroes and then her team mates show up immediately (She gets restrained to her cot but not them and nobody questions this)

It has a lot more flaws but I don't want to reread it to find them.

Bear in mind Taylor is a child, and not one prone to making good decisions. She's also much more put off of the wards by her experiences with authorities like the school, whereas the Undersiders were decidedly more anarchic, as she subconsciously likes. Also, Lisa's a pretty excellent manipulator.

None of these are “good reasons” if your standard is “a protagonist who never makes mistakes.” They are absolutely good reasons if your standard is “people doing things consistent with their character.” A protagonist who does things because of their flaws is not the same thing as a protagonist who does things for no explained reason at all.

“There are obvious problems with going undercover in a group with a thinker called Tattletale and expecting that cover to last long term.

It drains sympathy... because none of us have ever been arrogant, stupid, anti-authoritarian teenagers? Armsmaster is 100% correct when he raises every single one of these points to her, it's one of the earliest indications we get that Taylor is indeed an unreliable narrator.

“Conflict keeps getting propped up by one dimensional villain charachters like Bakuda and the Slaughterhouse Nine.”

I wouldn't call some of the Nine one-dimensional, but whatever. I suspect you're using morally ambiguity as a shorthand for “depth” here, but I think one can absolutely be both evil and still be a well-developed character. And, not to put too fine a point on it, but shallow people and serial killers and the like absolutely do exist. Not everyone is particularly complicated.

“The Leviathan fight is some bullshit. Armsmaster's plan was bullshit and shouldn't have worked at all.”

Did you miss the part where it emphatically didn't work at all? Armsmaster expected that his Nanothorns would be able to cut through anything, and they didn't. He expected his predictive software to work, and it didn't. He got his arm and leg torn off for his hubris and nearly died. Worse, Leviathan wasn't even deterred. It took Scion's arrival to drive him off.

Look, I get it if you don't like the work, you're entitled to your opinion. But your nitpicks don't even make sense.

Crawler - Masochist, that is it.

Mannequin - Mind raped by Ziz

Bonesaw - Some depth. Twisted mindset associated with being a good girl, basically mind-raped by Jack and later Contessa.

Burnscar - Mind raped by her power

Cherish - Some depth, shitty person trying to take advantage of shitty circumstances.

Jack - Has narcissistic issues like Arms-master but is a villain and succeeds where arms master fails. A bit of depth but also a bit derivative.

It's certainly not “impossible.” Remember we're talking about a story, here. Armsmaster set about trying to isolate Leviathan, and he succeeded, much to his detriment. Recall that he honestly believed that his nanothorns would kill the beast, he was in a very bad headspace at the time, and even under the best of circumstances he had an arrogance problem. The flyers couldn't track Leviathan very reliably because A: it was raining cats and dogs, and B: Leviathan is incredibly fast. Recall that Legend, for example, can accelerate to move faster than sound, but as he accelerates, his awareness dims proportionally. Alexandria is possibly even more nimble despite being slower, but her senses aren't as sharp as his, and Leviathan had nearly drowned her. Glory Girl has a middling Mover rating, and her top speed is 80 mph. So it's not at all incongruous to me that Leviathan can take advantage of the confusion and slip away, considering he's regarded as the fastest non-teleporting creature in the world.

You can sum up basically any character or their motivations like that, though. Go ahead, try.

The real factor that makes a character deep, to my mind, isn't how simple or complex their personalities or motivations are, but rather how they engage with the world around them. Normal people can understand and relate to that much easier than they can to a simple motivation to commit murder.

In fairness, think of Leviathan's goals here. Sure, he can go fast enough that he could probably have spoofed Armsmaster's software earlier than he did. But his entire schtick---and that of the Endbringers in general---is to provide a good fight, to raise up glimmers of hope just so that it hurts more when they smash that hope to smithereens. It was perfectly consistent with Leviathan's motivations and best interests to allow Armsmaster a brief moment to shine before mercilessly crushing him. This isn't just my interpretation, either---both the text and Word of Wildbow confirm that the Endbringers were deliberately holding back just to make a show of things.

Basically paraphrasing this: [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent]]

Wildbow's characters consistently think up new and brilliant ways to get ahead, or leverage their own powers, or exploit the weaknesses of others'. It's what Yudkowsky would call the “spark of optimization,” and it really helps sell the illusion that these are real people with thoughts and desires.

Armsmaster's fragile mental state doesn't excuse taking this risk, but we're not trying to make excuses for Armsmaster's hubristic madness, and nor is the story. I'd also note that what we learn of Endbringers later makes his actions look far dumber in hindsight, and with understanding just how far he'd fallen to get to that point. It was still dumb given what Armsmaster believed about the Endbringers then, but people do dumb things all the time and Armsmaster is certainly no exception. He's a lot like Taylor, ironically enough---bad with impulse control, and can easily point out flaws in others but not his own biases. Eminently human failings, those.

Prince Zuko is arguably the most complex and well-developed character in that series, and even he and his motivations can be summed up as “hotheaded prince” and “restoring honor,” respectively.

then it's not in the story. the author's external views not aligning with taylors is not the same thing as the portrayal of a character within that story.

she's written as a protagonist with good intentions who gets pushed into being a villain by her environment. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that take on a character or story, mind; but given she's supposed to be the "good guy" in the story some of her questionable actions do seem to be excused or treated lightly.

my problem with it isn't really that, though. It's how wildly unrealistic her successes are. The timeline selection deus ex only works so far; if it were a true rational fic she should be dead early on. the situations and enemies she survives are ridiculous.

********* I think you're not giving Wildbow enough credit here. Not only is Taylor /obviously/ morally questionable from basically square 1, but she also experiences a huge amount of realistic losses right on top of the other really early in the story.

In terms of Taylor's character itself, you don't even need to look further than 1.01:

#+begin_quote
  It would be so easy, so easy to just go Carrie on the school. To give the trio their just desserts and make them regret what they had put me through: the vicious e-mails, the trash they'd upended over my desk, the flute --my mother's flute-- they'd stolen from my locker...

  I was all too aware that I'd get caught and arrested if I attacked my fellow students. There were three teams of superheroes and any number of solo heroes in the city. I didn't really care. The thought of my father seeing the aftermath on the news, his disappointment in me, his shame? That was more daunting, but it still didn't outweigh the anger and frustration.

  Except I was better than that.
#+end_quote

Right off the bat we get a glimpse into her violent tendencies. She wants to take revenge. She doesn't even care much about the opinion of her own /father/ (one of the most sympathetic characters in the book) - the only thing holding her back from "going Carrie" on the school is her belief in her own moral superiority. For the rest of the story up until Arc 8, we keep seeing increasingly questionable decisions on her part that lead to direct punishment (using immense force against lung, coming up with the hostage plan at the bank, antagonizing Armsmaster because she can't listen to his perfectly reasonable advice, taking out Lung's /eyeballs/, using unsportsmanlike like tactics against the heroes at the Gala, and finally, burning the letter to Miss Militia) throughout each of which she maintains that she is making the right decision, even though she later faces /direct, well-foreshadowed/ consequences of each. None of these are excused by anything other than her internal monologue. Taylor was never doing "the right thing" as in the objectively correct decision, and an observant reader would have noticed this as well - it's just so easy to be suckered in and accept her narration as the objective facts. Her villainy isn't subtextual, it's literal.

As for early Deus Ex Machina, have any in mind? I think the Undersiders showing up against Lung was justified very well by the story in all respects, and it would be silly to dismiss it for not properly foreshadowing their existence in the /first arc/. The bank was nearly a flawless operation, but it made sense in context. Bakuda's toe rings were foreshadowed about a chapter after she first stepped on screen, and besides, in this fight Taylor takes heavy injuries and gets a concussion that's used to spur yet another plot forward. Lung's vulnerability to Newter's drug bodily fluids was foreshadowed in the meeting in Somer's Rock when Newter was introduced, and then again in Gregor's Interlude, I think. And in each of these early victories it's pretty explicitly stated that Taylor is hunkering down somewhere like fifty feet away while her bugs do all of the work. She's actually rarely in direct combat, and whenever she is it's treated like a very big deal. With Rachel she got stitches in her arm, in the bank she got knocked out with a fire extinguisher, with Bakuda she hurt her limbs again and got a concussion (which took a good week of recovery and never really got better until a bit after /Leviathan/), Oni Lee nearly decapitated her, etc.

I could go on forever. Just know that there are more details in /Worm/ than you remember. All of it is in the text if you aren't in a hurry to get it over with.

********** having losses or injuries doesn't balance out the victories. the world isn't some cosmic karma scale. the question is whether it's plausible that the series of fights she won/drew could all turn out as they did. honestly the list of injuries (bakuda, oni lee) just reinforces how she continues to have close calls where she should simply lose and die.

While there are individual /explanations/ within each scene, there's no plausible justification for why she continues to survive and be successful in general even when facing melee specialists in close combat.

in terms of specific deus ex machinas, they ABOUND. I alluded to a big one earlier: Grue's second trigger event with bonesaw. This is an egregious cliffhanger scenario with the whole team knocked out or helpless and about to be cut up, and one team member just suddenly gets extra powers.

Look, the story works as a dramatic superhero tale. it doesn't HAVE to be a rational fic to be what it is. it leans on narrative necessity and set pieces, makes heavy use of tropes and deus ex machina - and these are all acceptable tools to create an entertaining story.

2. It was inconsistent with the plot as it was portrayed previously. (e.g. a god descending from the heavens to solve the plot even when they had opportunity to do it previously, and did not take it)
3. Relies too much on serendipity, and the power of cosmic coincidence.
4. It solves all of the characters problems.

Grue's trigger fits exactly one of these criteria - number four. We know about second triggers from the dialogue about Narwhal in Gregor's interlude and at the beginning of arc 8, specifically that it comes from a stimulus that is worse than the original trigger event by a large margin. So we know it's possible beforehand. It's not inconsistent with the plot or too coincidental, either - we know for a fact that Grue is disassembled into bits and stashed into a freezer, fully conscious and in pain. This is introduced to us /before/ the others are even in serious jeopardy. So even if Grue's trigger is convenient to the characters, it's not "god being lowered from the rafters" convenient. And moreover, it doesn't immediately solve all of their problems - it scares off Bonesaw and gives them a chance to retaliate, but Grue is left permanently scarred, the Slaughterhouse 9 is still in town, and their worst offense has yet to come.

I'd like to know what you think a justification is other than "individual explanations within each scene". Ignoring those individual explanations is tantamount to ignoring evidence for something because you believe it to be impossible - just because an outside retrospective view makes success seem unlikely doesn't mean that a real, plausible explanation for why it happened is nonexistent. I would understand saying that if these moments were off screen or narrated after the fact, but they weren't. You can't say that "coincidences are piling up" when individually most of these coincidences make sense in context and aren't really coincidental at all. You /can/ call them contrived - they almost certainly are - but rational fiction doesn't care about contrivances so long as they fit the rest of the rules of the genre. Otherwise things like the magic in HPMOR would automatically invalidate the story. I feel like Worm very safely falls within the boundaries of rational fiction.

(Also, I've been meaning to say this, but I avoided it in the main essay because it was a little off-tone: saying /Worm/ relies on tropes of the superhero genre is like saying /Game of Thrones/ relies too much on the tropes of historical fantasy. It's the kind of completely idiotic assumption you could only make from a bubble that has /never read/ a story that relies too much on tropes, or doesn't know how to distinguish genre reconstruction from the original genre itself. Worm takes superhero tropes, takes them apart and tries to reconstruct them to fit a setting that makes sense as a coherent whole - if you didn't grasp this immediately, you either didn't read Worm properly, or you have never watched a Marvel movie in your life. Watch those and then tell me what a Deus Ex Machina in a superhero story looks like.)

How Taylor views and rationalizes her own decisions through a haze of her own biases is very different from how the plot and other characters treat her. Many people empathize strongly with her and think she is the “good guy,” but I see that more as the story doing its job well.

And it's fine if your problem is more with the scrapes she gets out of. If that breaks your immersion, you have every reason to not like the story. But it didn't break my immersion, and I think that there was adequate explanation/reasons things turned out the way they did.

Its purpose is not to educate on rationality nor science, or even good storywriting. It's a character- and plot-driven work, and in my opinion, that brings much-needed diversity to the loosely-defined “genre.”

Characteristics of Rational Fiction:

#+begin_quote
  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

this is the cardinal rule, and it is violated constantly. the plot is structured as a series of Boss Battles, with build up and world filler in between. The protagonist goes into every fight as a scrappy underdog, and yet comes out unscathed, even in ABSURDLY ridiculous odds.

Characters are tropey, and Worfed constantly - the next Big Bad is always set up by other characters raving about how scary they are, and mini-baddies getting their asses kicked, only to be put down by a TEENAGE GIRL with a power that has extremely limited combat applications.

In a rational fic with consistent rules and realism, she should not have survived /any/ of the major fights, from Lung to Armsmaster to Hookwolf and on and on. Every fight is increasingly implausible, and after a while I just became numb to the whole thing. I'd spend the fights waiting for her to stumble into a scrappy victory, and the time between fights trudging through all the setup for the next one. It lost all the tension and drama.

That said, the worldbuilding is great. it's a fantastic setting with great characters and creative powers. It has a ton of promise as a universe; it's just not rational fic, which is fine.

******* Eh. I disagree. I think the worldbuilding is a big part of what makes it a rational fic, and from my perspective, rational fic is not at all the same thing as literary realism, nor should it try to be. Because then that would mean there was no actual story in many cases. You always have to accept at least a little bit of compromise to make things interesting.

And that definition of rational fiction is a bit basic, but even there I'd argue that pretty much everything in Worm happens for a clear and well-established reason, but whether you find those reasons immersive or plausible is another matter entirely. The story both A: has an internal logic and B: follows its internal logic consistently, which in my opinion makes it a rational fic, if not necessarily a rationalist fic.

Of course, Worm mostly stands out because the other stories in its genre are the polar opposite of rational fiction. They have no logic, internal or otherwise.

******** worldbuilding has nothing to do with rational fiction. worldbuilding is part of any fantasy or sci fi narrative and is not by itself sufficient to make a story rational.

I am not demanding realism in the sense that the world must conform strictly to reality - obviously I'm perfectly willing to accept super powers or magic as part of the story. What rational fic demands is strict realism within the world it describes.

If a villain or hero is described as a terrifying, cold and relentless killer who has defeated countless other capes and eluded top law enforcement for years, then an expectation is set up within the rules of the world that they be that powerful.

If that same villain is then defeated by a teenage girl who is not rated as especially proficient at combat and doesn't have a power that gives her exceptional survivability or offensive abilities, those expectations have been broken, and the logic of the world is not consistent.

Lets put it simply:

The endbringer that attacks brockton bay kills dozens of capes and holds off hundreds more, including ridiculously overpowered S-tier heroes.

Armsmaster nearly defeats that same endbringer in 1 on 1 combat.

Taylor defeats Armsmaster, TWICE.

The reader is left going "WHAT??" There should be a transitivity of relative power here.

You can do the same thing with the slaughterhouse nine. They shred through other capes in increasingly ridiculous Worf scenes, yet taylor manages to outfight some in direct combat, and outmaneuver the group. Again, Mannequin beats Armsmaster (with caveats, he didn't have suit, I get it) then Taylor beats mannequin despite his being immune to insect bites and peper spray, her main forms of attack. It's completely unbelievable.

One of the most important aspects of "things happening for a reason" in terms of rational fic is that the story does not leverage Deus Ex Machina to drive the plot. Worm makes heavy use of this trope to let Taylor survive ridiculous situations and move the plot in the direction the author wants.

This is fine for normal fiction. You admit Worm is a character and narrative driven story, and this indicates also what it is not. Not everything has to be rational fic. Worm can be an enjoyable story without fitting that genre definition.

It does have creativity and some rational elements in how it approaches powers and worldbuilding, and I think that's why many [[/r/rational]] folk like it. The way powers are used is clever, and the world is interesting. That rigor unfortunately doesn't extend to the story itself, which is why it falls short of being a rational fic, but it's not necessary for it to be.

********* “worldbuilding has nothing to do with rational fiction. worldbuilding is part of any fantasy or sci fi narrative and is not by itself sufficient to make a story rational.”

True, but I'm using the term “worldbuilding” loosely, as shorthand for “this is not a story with radioactive spiders and immortal telekinesis mutants.” I consider it rational because it A: has an internal logic that makes sense and B: follows this logic consistently. That's all.

“If a villain or hero is described as a terrifying, cold and relentless killer who has defeated countless other capes and eluded top law enforcement for years, then an expectation is set up within the rules of the world that they be that powerful. If that same villain is then defeated by a teenage girl who is not rated as especially proficient at combat and doesn't have a power that gives her exceptional survivability or offensive abilities, those expectations have been broken, and the logic of the world is not consistent.”

I think this is not an accurate way to look at this. Why? Because in the context of the story, there's a difference between how a thing is perceived, and what it actually is. Taylor's power is actually quite good, but it's routinely underestimated. It's a mistake overconfident characters in the story make, and helps explain why many of them are defeated. And it's not just Taylor---Jack Slash is considered to have an underwhelming power, but it's actually much more than it seems, which is how he was able to build up such a record.

“The endbringer that attacks brockton bay kills dozens of capes and holds off hundreds more, including ridiculously overpowered S-tier heroes.

Armsmaster nearly defeats that same endbringer in 1 on 1 combat.

Taylor defeats Armsmaster, TWICE.

The reader is left going "WHAT??" There should be a transitivity of relative power here.”

Again, in the context of the story, Armsmaster deployed an experimental weapon against Leviathan (which didn't even work), Leviathan was deliberately jobbing the fight, Armsmaster had the time to set up his predictive software and isolate the battlefield, and Armsmaster STILL lost badly and nearly died.

By contrast, he was never, at any point, trying to kill Skitter, but she went all-out against him. That's quite an imbalance, especially considering Armsmaster consistently underestimated the scope and diversity of Taylor's power. Also, calling them “defeats” may be a bit of a stretch---Skitter managed to get away. Trainwreck defeated Armsmaster after Skitter slipped away from the gallery attack intact, and she used human shields at the confrontation at the school.

“You can do the same thing with the slaughterhouse nine. They shred through other capes in increasingly ridiculous Worf scenes, yet taylor manages to outfight some in direct combat, and outmaneuver the group. Again, Mannequin beats Armsmaster (with caveats, he didn't have suit, I get it) then Taylor beats mannequin despite his being immune to insect bites and peper spray, her main forms of attack. It's completely unbelievable.”

Perhaps in your opinion, but Taylor's beating at Mannequin's hands speaks for itself in my opinion. He underestimated her, and she forced him to retreat at great cost. Also, Mannequin is not the entirety of the Nine, he has his own strengths and weaknesses. Taylor hardly proved effective against Manton/the Siberian, or even Jack and Bonesaw.

“One of the most important aspects of "things happening for a reason" in terms of rational fic is that the story does not leverage Deus Ex Machina to drive the plot. Worm makes heavy use of this trope to let Taylor survive ridiculous situations and move the plot in the direction the author wants.”

Deus Ex Machina implies that the salvation was inexplicable and not previously alluded to or shown. I frankly don't think it applies here, as my previous examples show. There's almost always a reason things happened the way they did, and in my opinion pretty damn good reasons at that. The latter is the most important factor, I think, and the fact that it also happens to serve the themes of the plot and characters just doesn't spoil that for me.

for SOME villains to have an overblown reputation is plausible. for her to face the biggest named heroes and villains again and again and come out on top is just railroading. that the narrative gives /excuses/ for this in the context of the scene isn't sufficient to make it a rational story, or set it apart from any other superhero narrative.

For example, saying “If the enemies Taylor defeated were as easily bested by "underestimating" as you suggest, they would never have gotten where the were” only makes sense if you put it in the context of the story. If YOU were writing Worm, you might have done things differently for different reasons, but the fact that this isn't what happened does not necessarily make the reasons why it happened invalid. And I'm not saying that underestimating Taylor is necessarily a make-or-break factor in any of her fights. Rather, underestimating Taylor is a make-or-break factor in whether the READER accepts the outcome of her fights.

In other words, if you consider Taylor's power to be deceptively quite strong, like I do, the outcomes of her fights become a lot more plausible. Likewise, if you're looking at the same reasons and logic but working under the assumption that Taylor's powers are relatively weak or useless, it's not going to seem plausible that she can survive as long as she did.

A series of individual coincidences or reasons why any specific fight went her way does not suffice. It is the TREND that matters. This should be plain to any bayesian analysis.

The reader must be able to ask "is this outcome likely, given the conditions and context I'm given?" For worm, this answer is no. The story relies on coincidence and improbable outcomes.

This is probably the most rigorous definition of a rational plotline, now that I think about it. Does it conform to probability theory given the context and constraints provided?

************* “I'm looking at objectively the powers she is shown to have, and the powers of her opponents.”

Define “stronger.” In Worm, powers work on anything but a linear scale of strength. It's more akin to chess, or rock-paper-scissors. Or, to mix metaphors further, you can say the Bismarck is “stronger” than a teeny little biplane carrying a torpedo, but in Worm as in real life, pure “strength” isn't everything in determining the outcome of a fight.

“She consistently fights stronger opponents and wins or draws. This is a fact.”

Actually, the most common outcome when Taylor finds herself arrayed against a stronger opponent such as Armsmaster, the Siberian, or Behemoth is that she either manages to flee, fails outright, doesn't pick a fight in the first place, or teams up with others to fight them on the most favorable terms she can manage. Taylor is rarely shown to tackle any opponent singlehandedly, aside from unpowered thugs and capes at a huge disadvantage.

“There is no explanation offered for why Taylor is exceptionally good or lucky at besting stronger opponents.”

Probably the single closest thing to this argument actually being accurate is when Coil tries to kill Taylor, or when Taylor kills Alexandria singlehandedly. In the former, the text itself explains why and how she escaped. In the latter, it's not really a Deus Ex Machina, because A: Taylor was far away from Alexandria at the time, not in arm's reach, and B: Alexandria's weakness to suffocation was foreshadowed at least twice before in the Leviathan and Echidna arcs. Now, you may or may not find these explanations satisfactory in a literary or probabilistic sense, but you can't deny that they exist, and that the story is being consistent with its own internal logic (regardless of whether you agree with that logic).

again, the most important point from my last comment was that it's the /trend/ that matters, not individual incidents. If by coincidence and scrappiness a hero wins against the odds, it's just another heroic story.

If this happens five, ten, twenty times in the same story, it starts to become a pattern. In this case, individual explanations for why EACH event occurred are no longer sufficient. The narrative must explain the pattern as a whole, or cease to be rational.

How do you even define “post facto?” If you assume that Worm was basically complete in the author's head prior to being serialized---with everything planned out ahead of time to be a certain way to conform to a plot---then how is it different from any other novel? Yudkowsky even says that it's an author's prerogative to “cheat” by being able to jump forwards and backwards in time. What matters is if the plot makes sense in the sequence as it is written, not as it is conceived by the author.

Even so, Worm was not actually written like this. Upon starting, Wildbow had finalized most of the worldbuilding and characterization, but not the actual plot. That flowed much more organically, and could have followed many different possible paths depending on how certain things turned out. Worm is a truly serialized work, not just a very large book that happened to be released in installments.

Warning to anyone who wandered this far down the discussion but doesn't want any spoilers: there's lots in here.

The S9 are explicitly stated multiple times to be constantly losing members. The impressive thing is that the /organisation/ lasts so long, but the individuals in it drop like flies. The members who have lasted a long time are the Siberian, who's literally invulnerable (Manton isn't, but he's protected by Cauldron); Bonesaw, who's stupidly durable and has the second-best medical power in the whole setting from what we see; Jack himself, who has a really strong Trump ability that makes him a threat to /Contessa/; and Crawler, whose power is basically that he recovers from almost any damage. Of those, Crawler is killed by the Protectorate in BB, and Dragon kills Manton.

Mannequin doesn't beat Armsmaster 'with caveats' - Armsmaster's a Tinker, so without access to any equipment he's physically just a regular guy.

The S9 in general are mostly scary because they strike and disappear. They can't stand up to a whole city's worth of capes, and they don't. When they go toe-to-toe with other capes, they tend to either outnumber them, outgun them, or otherwise stack the deck in their favour first. The scary thing about the S9 isn't how strong they are, it's all the collateral they cause and how hard it is to put them down for good.

********* I agree with everything you've said except one nitpick: power does not have to be transitive. cf Rock/Paper/Scissors

That's definitely a nitpick in this case since Taylor should have lost to almost every cape she fought. Also, a story loses the "rational fiction" tag the minute it requires a hate plague of evil mind-control worms in order for its premise to work.

Other than that,

********** correct, it does not HAVE to be, you can have RPS situations. But taylor's power isn't a direct counter to most of her opponenets abilities; she wins despite a power disadvantage, not because of it. IE - outmaneuvering armsmaster in close quarters combat when he's set up specific countermeasures to her abilities.

  and yet comes out unscathed
#+end_quote

Unscathed can hardly define what Taylor comes out as in most of her big fights. Unless you said "unscathed" but you really meant "alive". In which case, I point out to you that despite the lethality of so many of the powers we come across, most superhero fights don't end in death (it would be a waste of characters if every single engagement ended in someone dying). However a good chunk of them do end with multiple deaths, especially the fights with the walking WMD's.

Especially considering that Wildbow established in-universe that there's a reason most of these fights don't end in deaths; the consequences are that much worse for everyone that wants to stay within the lines.
