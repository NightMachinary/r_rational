** Note that the first of these chapters (7.~) is a dream with lots of hidden text.

A [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L0E9DEOw382SxcnBB_old0rCqCa13xMuj6te5UD4Fgs/edit?usp=sharing][google doc]] was created by readers to try to decipher as much of it as possible in a cooperative effort, with some decent success at least in the first few paragraphs. Mind you, the author has warned that the vast majority of the hidden text was NOT designed by him to be decipherable.

  Sounds annoying to read with a screen reader.

The 'hidden words' in the chapter I'm talking about they are replaced by tildes, they're not meant to be actually read/undestood right now, though am sure we'll have a full reveal of them eventually in some future chapter.

Am a bit confused what you mean. The thread is already tagged NSFW.

***** Ah thought NSFW went before the title, it's got it's own thing. Guess I'll find out how the screen reader handles a bunch of text with tildes. Probably not well.
