Imagine a situation in which perfectly rational behaviour is /counter-productive/. Trying to acquire information and draw conclusions from it is pointless. Clear and logical thinking leads you to incorrect answers, whilst biased, emotional or thoughtless actions would lead to victory. Attempts at being reasonable fail you, while relying on intuition, poorly-made guesses, and biased thinking is the right choice.

In extreme cases, the situation would be such that you're unlikely to figure that last bit out, even. Rational behaviour would lead you to death, irrational behaviour would grant you victory, but you'll most likely die before you understand this --- unless you're irrational to begin with.

A story based on such premise would be an example of */irrational fiction/*: a peculiar subgenre of rational fiction in which rational behaviour is punished. (Perhaps a fitting alternate genre-name would be "rationalist horror", though being horrifying is not a strict prerequisite.)

It should be noted that it has to feature an actual difference between rationality and irrationality. A rational person could /model/ an irrational one, query this model for advice, and follow it whenever it seems to be a good idea --- in fact, this is exactly what we always do when interacting with irrational people. In this case, it must not work, either because the problem is internal, or because the ability to model irrationality is imperfect, or because of some even more esoteric reason. You would need to actually /make yourself/ irrational to succeed.

- The most prominent example of this subgenre is, of course, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][/CORDYCEPS: Too Clever For Their Own Good/]], which self-identified as an irrationalfic, coining the term. [[#s][Spoilers: Cordyceps, All]]

- A weaker example is [[https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/selfdelusion.html][/On Self-Delusion and Bounded Rationality/]], a short story. [[#s][Spoilers: OSDaBR, All]] As opposed to /Cordyceps/, becoming irrational not the most optimal way forward here, but it's arguably one of the better alternatives.

- Stanislaw Lem's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_Found_in_a_Bathtub][/Memoirs Found in a Bathtub/]] could be considered an irrationalfic as well: the Building's plots within plots and layers of disinformation would be very resistant to rational scrutiny, and the best way to function there is to accept the insanity.

- Scott Alexander's [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/324957.html][/The Last Temptation of Christ/]], if interpreted as an attempt of Devil to deceive an actual Christ, would be an interesting edge case. Jesus doesn't have any evidence that he isn't insane, and can't gather them, so the only way for him to win is to disregard the rational conclusion, and, for all he knows, doom himself to a life of insanity. Albeit his thought patterns don't change, all his thinking from that point onwards becomes compromised.

--------------

What do you think about it?

Do you know any other examples of irrational fiction?


** The premise does not make sense to me. (Instrumental) rationality is ability to archive one's goals. Whatever arcane process you use to decide on a course of action, if it consistently brings you closer to achieving your goals, then it is rational by definition, regardless of how emotional, impulsive, spastic, random or inexplicable it appears to be.

Thus acting "irrationally" (thoughtlessly, impulsively and randomly) in the environment you describe is actually quite rational, and acting "rational" (based on drawing conclusions from prior evidence using reason and logic) is irrational.

Basically, you described a universe with different rules for what constitutes rational decision process from what we are used to, but that does not make it (the process) irrational.

*** Rationality is the ability to achieve one's goals in a wide variety of circumstances. This is about a pathological circumstance where your ability to achieve your goals is negatively correlated to your ability to do it in other circumstances in general.

As an extreme example, imagine you stick someone in a simulation that's indistinguishable from reality, see how many lives they save, and then kill that many people. The more (generally) rational that person is, the more people will get killed.

*** *Edit:* Yes, one would need to have a contrast between the two approaches, i.e. what we consider rational and what is rational in this story. In /Cordyceps/, the particulars of the situation make usually-irrational behaviour (i.e. such that it can't be expected to let you win in most cases) rational; in /Methods of Obstinacy/, it's the contrast between rational approaches in two universes.

--------------

Take /Cordyceps/ as an example. Someone found themselves captive in an institution with no memory, and found strong evidence that their memory is repetitively erased by the people who hold them there. We would expect that staying put and doing what they're told would have unpleasant consequences for them, while trying to find out more and make a successful escape would constitute a victory; in actuality, it's the opposite. A rational person would fail here, while a gullible one would win.

Similarly, as in [[/u/ToaKraka][u/ToaKraka]]'s example, there could be situations where trying to study a phenomenon using scientific method would have counterproductive results, as would be trying to systematically find any kind of pattern in behaviour of this phenomenon. Trying to manipulate the outcome by simulating an irrational person would perhaps also fail, simply by virtue of you expecting this to succeed based on rational analysis of the situation.

In some examples, yes, it would still be possible to make a rational decision to act irrationally (as in, how people without any rational training act), and win this way. In other cases ([[#s][]]), it wouldn't be.

this is the key word here. If the behavior that leads to success is not consistent, you cannot really call it rational.

*** By this standard the most rational characters are Mary Sues/Gary Stus who just succeed all the time because their worlds run on authorial intervention and plot armour.

Rationalfic protagonists do not necessarily achieve their goals more often or more efficiently than normiefic protags - they achieve them more believably.

I /like/ Yudkowsky's meta/non-definition as opposed to the Enlightenment /tradition/ of rationality, but it's clearly not the only thing at play in the designation of the genre.

*** Very interesting. I do think it qualifies as irrational fiction.

I'm not convinced that it's impossible to figure out meta-rules by figuring out how the rules of physics change, though.

Even if we're using the omniscient GM analogy that deliberately sabotages all attempts to munchkin the rules, rational optimization is still possible, as all rule-changes would be made to achieve some goal. In a tabletop game, the GM optimizes for entertainment of players/own's entertainment/building an interesting narrative. Similarly, this inconsistent universe should be optimizing for something, and the way to victory is figuring out what it is and making sure your goals align.

Even if the universe smites anyone trying to make even those judgements, it's evidently not smiting those who note that it's consistent in its smiting of people who try to study it. As such, rational people could see the corpses of all the other rational people who tried to understand it, and decide to not do that, instead choosing the vague direction of making their lives a satisfying story.

Except when it does. Random peasants who keep their heads down and don't do any of the things you're not supposed to do can still get struck by lightning from a clear sky, or eaten by dragons, or fall into the sky after gravity stops working for no reason.

Consider Descartes. The thing about reality being run by an infinitely powerful deceiving demon is that it's not very fun to live in that reality, and there's literally nothing you can do to avoid arbitrary consequences. Whatever you think you've figured out is subject to revision at any time, including your thoughts and memories, if the malevolent entity in absolute control of absolutely everything thinks it'd be funny.

This leaves the only /working/ method to get one over on reality is to play the demon, not the game... which, as has been noted, is also something that usually ends badly, especially if reality happens to notice you trying to be manipulative like that. However, it still likes what it likes, and if you're clever, you've noticed that it likes 'epic' and 'heroic' stories, and gives more leeway to individuals whose actions fall under those tropes. This might not work any better than anything else; wannabe heroes die in droves. But when you're a helpless pawn dancing in the palm of an infinitely powerful demon, your only real choice is whether or not to attract its attention... so if you are going to try getting that attention, you should at least try to do so in a good way.

If at all approximately possible, a more sensible course of action still is to flee the universe by any means available.

** I read a great book once called Every Heart A Doorway (sample excerpt [[https://io9.gizmodo.com/seanan-mcguires-new-book-is-just-so-mindblowingly-good-1768914959][here]]), which is about a boarding school/support structure for young people who've returned to Earth from various fantastical realms. The realms are broadly categorized as points along the spectra of Logic<->Nonsense and Virtue<->Wickedness. Students from "High Nonsense" worlds tend to behave absurdly, and this is explained as basically a residual survival mechanism from their time in those worlds. So I imagine the experience of surviving in a High Nonsense world would be similar to what you've described. There's an upcoming sequel set in one of those worlds, so I guess I'll find out when it comes out.

**** In the book's setting it's more common for girls to pass through doors to other realms in the first place. I remember it positing a couple of possible explanations for this, having to do with the ways girls are socialized/treated differently (e.g., girls might be more likely to feel out of place in the real world; girls might more easily slip away unnoticed). Actually none of the students at this particular boarding school /wanted/ to go home--there's apparently a different school for kids who had a shitty time in their fantasy realms and want to move on with their mundane lives.

I wouldn't even call it representation porn. One character is ace and one character is trans, but that isn't solely what defines them. Meaning, they don't exist in the story just to be ace and trans, which I think is what people usually mean by "representation porn". I don't think you'll be disappointed if you read it--it's pretty short anyway. (It's not like super rationalist or anything though, just well-written and emotionally compelling.)

I was basically thinking of whether this falls before or after the "Steven Universe Line". I can pretty well enjoy /Steven Universe/, but it /does/ sometimes slip into baiting me with a show about aliens who fight monsters and then switching to an emotional drama show... with /contrived/ emotional drama. It was very obviously written to appeal to Tumblr, however much it succeeds by other measures.

From the segment you linked, /Every Heart a Door/ is actually closer to /Harry Potter/ than /Steven Universe/, so yay.

I think SU (which I do love) can be more heavyhanded with relationship and identity stuff because it's primarily aimed at children, who don't pick up on subtlety that well. But this is aimed more at older teens and young adults, I think. So it's not as much trying to teach the reader a lesson.

I think the representation parts are probably over/represented/ (ha) in the reviews because every time someone publishes a really good work of fiction with ace or trans characters, those communities are like "SWEET" and pass them around amongst themselves. So a lot of the people buying the book are there for the representation content. That's actually how I found the book in the first place, although I ended up loving it even aside from the ace part.

*** So do I, to the point where it worries me. I discovered rationality at a time when I was a hardcore New Age hippie weirdo who was getting a physics degree specifically to study psychics and Reiki. Now I have that degree but no idea what to do with it, suffered multiple existential crises over whether the spirits I talk to while meditating are real, and regularly experience depressive episodes due to doubting that my positive thinking can influence reality.

Part of me feels like I made a wrong turn in my personal development. I've become as implicitly loyal to epistemic rationality as any religious doctrine, attempting to live up to ideals even when I am psychologically incapable of doing so purely because I was told they were good. Now I second guess everything I believe due to concern over unobservable biases, which has ruined the optimistic worldview I once had. Now I don't have confidence in my ability to control myself and the world around me.

Life wasn't easy before this transition happened, and it would be conceited of me to believe that other experiences I've had couldn't also be responsible for my change in mindset, but it was extremely comforting back then to believe in an immaterial higher power that was guiding me and giving me more control over my life despite my mental illnesses. Now I have to contend with lingering doubts over whether any of it is real if all I can measure is how much I despair I'm in when my faith wanes.

I already concluded, long ago, that I am not psychologically capable of being an atheist or materialist. I cannot live happily if I reject my dualistic beliefs, I will always feel like I'm living half the life I did before because it all still seems real to me. However, I cannot reliably maintain my belief in such things when I also believe it is virtuous to constantly be skeptical about my beliefs and seek out objective evidence for them. I'm glad I don't believe in pseudoscience and confirmation bias anymore, but without it I can't rationally justify a worldview that is foundational to my ability to self-actualize.

Ok. So let's ask: do causal arrows flow from your actions to your self and your life around you?

(I totally feel the existential despair angle on /perceiving/ oneself as having little-to-no affordance, little causal effect on the my-salient stuff of my lifeworld. I guesstimate that it's a major component of the feeling of despair, which is admittedly common sense. But also, I keep getting told not to view myself that way Because Reasons.)

Sounds like you're already a materialist, and just believe you believe in dualism and believe strongly that you /ought/ to believe in dualism.

I used to be religious, but ultimately, what kicked me off it wasn't so much /factual evidence/ one way or the other, it was [[https://reasonpapers.com/pdf/28/rp_28_9.pdf][throwing out the fact-value dichotomy]], thus ceasing to ideologically wall-off certain beliefs from evidence on grounds that they were the Values rather than the Facts.

Besides which, I feel like I've got a lot more Spiral Power now that I strictly look for the causal arrows that /make stuff happen/ rather than trying to delegate important parts of the work to Above, so despite me having followed a conventional religion rather than believing in any sense that I could will drills into being, stuff actually feels kinda better.

**** So I don't actually know about the character this conversation is about, just jumping in because it seems you're having a crisis with a concept I think I can say something meaningful about. I bring this up hoping it will have a positive effect, but with the acknowledgement that what I'm doing may only aggravate, though I justify that you probably have a decent chance of running into this concept in the normal course of life and may already know about it to begin with.

Do you know about [[/r/tulpas][r/tulpas]]? It's essentially the concept of having a different self in your mind. I read enough to think that the phenomenon is real, and while I personally think the most likely explanation for it is purely psychological, it's not inconceivable for it to have a spiritual basis, and I think some of the people in the subreddit do believe whole-heartedly that that train of thought is the correct one and developed their tulpas with spiritual methods. Whether or not you identify your spirits as being similar to tulpas, I think a community of people already versed in communing with non-physical beings might be able to help you or give you good insights if you have your own, uh, headspace issues, so you might want to try talking to them.

The one thing I doubt this will help you with is your former feelings of reassurance from a formerly-believed in higher being. But the people at the tulpas subreddit indicate they have made positive, even constructive relationships with their tulpas, and I think you should start on making something similar first. Who knows, if you manage to accomplish that much, that might just be enough for you to live with.

** I was thinking of No Game No Life. It's not what you said though. It's more like that it's just like a rationalist fic, in that it has (seemingly) smart characters and teaches lessons in how to be rational, but everything it teaches is wrong.
