** Hmmm.

U-V is missing. Does "Valley of the Shadow of Death" have a meaning in Truman's world that it doesn't in ours?

It's also interesting that Meryl and Marlon, his canonical wife and best friend from the movie, don't make it past eleven in this world. It makes sense that expecting kids to lie to their "best friend" for years on end might be traumatic for them.

** damn this is starting to feel downright apocalyptic. mass climate change and something else outside the dome that is outright scary...world governments collaborating on the truman project makes it a lot more than entertainment like cannon. some interesting threads to follow

*** Actually, could you tell me which part you were reading when you first started to notice it was stilted? Beginning of chapter 1?

**** The first three chapters. It was stilted from the beginning but that was how far I read before giving up.
