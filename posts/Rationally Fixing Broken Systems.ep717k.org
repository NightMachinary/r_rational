** I found some points in this interesting but I don't think that it provides anything extraordinarily insightful that hasn't been better put elsewhere. Additionally there are several points that I don't necessarily agree with. For example, that people don't support movements that benefit them directly. The article didn't seem to address the fact that many people do support movement that are primarily about fighting for groups of people other than their own and that people can benefit socially from being seen to support a movement even if they don't care about it personally. The article seems to greatly oversimplify the problem of social change as well as the number of agents involved in it. Here's a vastly better article on a similar topic for anyone who is interested though [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/]]

*** I'm not saying it's holy writ to follow if one wants to change a system, nor am I claiming it's a pioneer of any of its ideas. No solutions are foolproof and disagreement-proof. It definitely doesn't account for your cases of people supporting social change - though I've also read some cynical pieces on how much people at large are really invested in a fight for outgroups (beyond a token nod). I also agree that it's substantially oversimplified (but that's true of any issue as large as this). I haven't read your linked article yet, but a glance at it shows it's not nearly as approachable to a general audience.

**** My reaction was more negative than it just wasn't insightful. It is self-contradictory, actively harmful in the information it presents due to how shallow and generally poorly framed it is, (nearly all of its links are to other blogs that are mostly click bait "7 ways you can increase your will power" "10 ways white people are more racist than they realize" "Why we resist change, and what leaders can do about it", "How To Use 10 Psychological Theories To Persuade People" etc) and gives terrible advice for a rationalist (i.e. "ask forgiveness, not permission.").

I found it to largely be the opposite of what you found it to be. What within it did you find insightful or eloquent?

***** - It explains his reasoning on why systems are resistant to change.

- He breaks down a system into parts supported by systems theory: input (humans), processes, output (results).

- The human element is further split into a quandary often brought up here: logical vs. emotional motivations (sadly he doesn't really explore the conflict).

- He points to the biases for the status quo and asserts that it's at least partially due to perception of systems as a zero sum game.

- He gives two reasons why radical revolution (or moralizing) would be ineffective.

- He gives tactics for more effectively changing the minds of calcified thinkers (supporters of the status quo).

- Presents alternative options for changing a stubborn system: join it to change from within, beat it, or subvert/exploit it.

- Then a word of warning to that change starts with you - i.e. act instead of whining.

- And a last ditch option: show results because that's what meritocratic systems thrive on.

There's nothing anti-rationalist about "ask forgiveness, not permission" - read in another way as "sometimes it's better to take the first step, then see where you're at".

--------------

Alright, now seriously, why is the burden of validation on me, and both you and [[/u/VorpalAuroch]] can use judgemental language without the least support? ("not particularly insightful, self-contradictory, actively harmful, shallow, poorly framed, terrible advice")

Besides your accusation of its sources, which I admit some links were questionable, what about it was exactly:

1. self-contradictory

2. actively harmful in the info it presents

3. shallow

4. poorly framed

5. terrible advice

Sorry for any pressure, but low effort put-downs have really been getting on my nerve lately.

This specific argument and variants of it are particularly annoying to me.. Who do you think is braver ? The one that takes a beating quietly and never complains or the one who fights back ?

Who do you think is braver, the ones that get beaten by the system and take it quietly? Or the ones that fight it with whatever means they have, be it complaining, protesting, rebelling ?

Is it the person willing to lose his life for sticking his head out to try to make things better for everyone else or the one quietly taking it with no complaint ?

I know which are brave and which are cowards, and they aren't the ones people that don't like change love saying are stronger. Maybe because those are the ones that pose no threat to them..

I can't make heads or tails of this sentence, but I got the gist and I don't think the blog frames it as bravery vs. cowardice. It sounds like it's a spin of Gandhi's famous quote "Be the change you want to see in the world." It's not a dichotomy where you're either sacrificing yourself or being passive: my interpretation is that he's a behaviorist. If one type of response doesn't change the environment (system), then try another.

**** Characters in fiction often eat ice cream. "Rationally eating ice cream" is still off-topic.

Everything in this is an extremely surface-level, cursory analysis of social systems and change, and ignores basically everything about how systems are /actually/ changed in practice. There's approximately one piece of advice in it which is any good, which is "make a better system in parallel", which everyone already knows because that is the Silicon Valley approach. It doesn't even talk about the drawbacks of that advice, which is, as you can see from Silicon Valley, that even if your alternative is better you will probably fail. (E.g. [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x5ASTMPKPowLKpLpZ/moloch-s-toolbox-1-2][Danslist]].)

***** That's an inappropriate analogy and you should know it.

There's no doubt it's a surface-level, oversimplified analysis of systems. You can't in good conscience finish the sentence "ignores basically everything about how systems are /actually/ changed in practice" without citing decades of academia and historical meta-analysis. Forget surface-level, this blog and your linked article combined don't even scratch the surface of modeling systems and failure states.

As for why I shared this and not another article from the depths of slatestarcodex or lesswrong with a high vernacular threshold is simple: between EY's meditations and the OP blog, which would you select to inform the average person of the complexities plaguing systems change?

It is, separately, a load of horseshit, on the level of bad self-help books in its total ignorance of its uselessness.

******* Since you need me to spell it out, let's look to the subreddit sidebar and go over why -on the meta level- an article on ice cream is not the same as an article on fixing systems when it comes to this sub:

#+begin_quote
  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Characters in rational fiction are often trying to work past a hostile or what they perceive as an inadequate system. If they want to fix it (which they often do), they creatively apply their knowledge and resources and try out (different) solutions. In fiction (and much more in real life), it's hard to say whether any one solution is correct or effective. Also, like this blog, fiction has a very heavy bias for the human element (though fiction in general also has a propensity for radical revolution). And guess what, the blog discusses a lot of potential options in an iterative fashion. Speaking for myself, I'd find it more rational if a ratfic showed itself aware of these systems dynamics and social structures, regardless of whether they deem it viable in the story.

And what was that about ice cream? Your turn.

#+begin_quote
  It is, separately, a load of horseshit, on the level of bad self-help books in its total ignorance of its uselessness.
#+end_quote

When you unironically say lines like this, are you an armchair specialist or an actual expert? Sometimes I find it hard to tell on Reddit where people spout with the conviction of holding multiple doctorates on the subject.

To everyone else, I know I'm feeding the troll but sometimes I'm optimistic.

** FWIW, I think the strength of the negative feedback on this post is due to the effect Eliezer mentioned recently, where people who have the strongest responses are most likely to act upon them (vote and comment).

My own opinions on the post:\\
Content-wise, I thought it had useful things to say, but also got annoyed at how little some of the statements were explained or expanded upon.\\
Style-wise, it started strong, but didn't seem to provide a good structure further in. If I was going to make a similar article for a general audience, I would write something shorter or choose to make a strong throughline (eg. taking a broken system and exploring different ways of trying to fix it, showing if and how they fail).

Overall: Not terrible, but if I was looking for something to share to a general audience, I'd hope there's a well-edited youtube video that explains the same.

You've sunk to name calling and take your own correctness as axiomatic, when in fact you've offered barely more than patronizing, low effort comments (besides your one mention of drawbacks and link to another essay). Seriously, go through the thread and do an objective count of how many belitting adjectives you use versus statements of value (reasoning, non-judgemental analysis of faults). Then compare it to my contributions - that's a rather insightful disparity, yeah?

I enjoy learning experiences that change my mind, so why don't you change it? Oh wait, that would require effort on your part, which seems unlikely based on your current track record.

To be fair, I'm petty as well. Otherwise I wouldn't have continued engaging when I already knew the type of responses I'd get.

You've just waffled about how it has points despite not actually attempting to justify the correctness of any of those points. Even just reading your statements /in defense of it/, the case that the article is useless garbage is quite clear. That you haven't realized this yourself means you're either a moron or totally unwilling to change your mind.

EDIT: Looking at your recent post history, it looks like recommending low-quality material to audiences with more discernment than you, and then getting condescendingly defensive about your shitty recommendation, is a habit for you. So if I wasn't sure you were wrong before, I sure am now.

********* You keep trying to "prove" me wrong by asserting you're right, using one technique: repeating "you're wrong" and "this is garbage / you're a moron" in different permutations ad nauseam. I've engaged in reasoned discussion about what these alleged flaws are in the blog but you seem pathologically incapable of reasoning through a /single/ criticism. FYI linking an article and mentioning something that the blog fails to mention don't constitute a refutation. At all stages, I've been explicitly open to arguments that the blog is wrong (see questions above), but you've been exceptionally resistant to rational discussion.

Funny you should dig through my history to shore up your arguments and try, again, to put me down. Ironic question: do you know who that thread about low effort negativity applies to?

It's an outline of the issues and solutions involved in fixing broken systems. Best of all, this comes up often in fiction! In honor of fixing broken systems, anyone have some recommendations for the best examples in fiction?
