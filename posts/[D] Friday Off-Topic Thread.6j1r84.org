Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Where does the "furry" art style come from?

I really like anthropomorphic animals, and my current campaign in D&D features them heavily. The problem is that I want pictures for them, but searching "anthropomorphic wolf" brings up a lot of furry stuff, and it's all an art style that I find extremely aesthetically unpleasing (like a cartoon wolf you might see selling children's cereal, I guess). This probably relates to some subcultural norms that I'm ignorant of, but I find it quite annoying.

*** A while back, I worked on some werewolf mods for a couple of games where the point was to make the werewolves look more like natural animals rather than your typical slavering monsters. Unfortunately, finding good, non-creepy reference images was a challenge. I did come across a few artists on DeviantArt who might have what you're looking for:

All three have also linked to works by artists with similar styles in their favorites section.

*** u/GaBeRockKing:
#+begin_quote
  Where does the "furry" art style come from?
#+end_quote

Personally, I'd think this would come from a combination of anime/the neonatal instinct and body image/self-identity issues. *

If you look at any piece of furry art, they tend to have

- large heads
- large eyes (in proportion to their heads)

These are characteristics humans are ingrained to find "cute." You see them pretty much everywhere in media not deliberately designed to look realistic. Cereal boxes particularly exaggerate this, as they're aimed towards children for whom cute things must be /really/ cute, but even looking at American programming like /Archer/ or a Seth McFarlane cartoon you can see elements of this.

Combined with the fact that furries are a very visual subculture, and that much of furry art is derivative from sources like Sonic, pokemon, catgirls in anime, whatever, that explains why those traits are so exaggerated.

For a literary comparison, look at the people on royalroadl-- because they're so influenced by translated Chinese xianxia and light novels, many adopt the same style of writing, even if their work isn't, strictly speaking, a fanfic.

Similarly, garish colors are probably inspired by the crazy, colorful hairstyles of anime characters.

But I mentioned another cause, too-- body image/self-identity issues. You probably know that furries are a rather isolated subculture. From other comments in this thread, people get /really/ up in arms about them. But as a result of human psychology, group persecution makes it easier to take up a more "us versus them" psychology. As a result, furries are predisposed to be accommodating of members that are also from other minority groups, such as (most notoriously) gay men.

So you have a whole bunch of people who aren't quite comfortable with themselves and with their place in society. And, in keeping with the traditions of the internet, they craft themselves avatars distanced from their mundane real-life selves. Deliberately unrealistic, because a realistic avatar would defeat the point of having an avatar.

And then, even if these people account for only a fraction of the furry population, you hit a self-reinforcing affect with regards to the art: the unrealistic stuff is popular anyways, so versus the extra effort of makin realistic art, artists make unrealistic stuff. Which makes the unrealistic stuff more popular, and so on and so on.

Of course, I may be overthinking this stuff-- maybe furry art is just unrealistic because people feel guilty about fapping to animals.

* Disclaimer: I'm not actually involved with the furry community, although I've read furry works when they intersect with my other speculative fiction related interests. (ex. the stuff DataPacRat writes.)

I think a large part of the reason furry porn is popular is that it safely keeps to the far side of the uncanny valley. Drawing things that clearly aren't meant to be people means we don't pick up on the bad proportions etc, and ingest in a more abstract way - which helps stimulate/enables imagination in case of porn, and helps emphasise in case of plot.

In my opinion, the vast majority of "anthro" art falls into the uncanny valley.

This offers more insight:

[[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/why-is-it-so-difficult-to-make-cute-characters-81160.html]]

Excerpted:

#+begin_quote
  So what makes a cartoon character cute? You could reduce the answer down to a few basic characteristics: big eyes and head, fluffiness, warmth and chubbiness. “Cuteness is based on the basic proportions of a baby plus the expressions of shyness or coyness,” wrote Preston Blair in Advanced Animation . According to Blair, other cute traits include:

  - Head large in relation to the body.
#+end_quote

- Eyes spaced low on the head and usually wide and far apart.

- Fat legs, short and tapering down into small feet for type.

- Tummy bulges---looks well fed.

#+begin_quote
  But cuteness is far more complex than even Blair's set of rules; some consider E.T., Yoda and WALL·E to be the epitome of cute, despite their furless, odd appearances. Cuteness and a character's perceived hugability aren't always determined by aesthetic appeal. “Cuteness is distinct from beauty,” wrote Natalie Angier for The New York Times . “Beauty attracts admiration and demands a pedestal; cuteness attracts affection and demands a lap.”

  But with any extreme comes another. If a character is too cute and sugary sweet, the audience can develop skepticism. “Cute cuts through all layers of meaning and says, ‘Let's not worry about complexities, just love me,'” philosopher Denis Dutton told The New York Times . It is for that very reason cuteness stirs uneasiness and sometimes feels cheap.

  After all, the adorable, smiling face of a child can hide the havoc he just wreaked by breaking all of his toys. “Cuteness thus coexists in a dynamic relationship with the perverse,” writes Daniel Harris in his book Cute, Quaint, Hungry And Romantic: The Aesthetics Of Consumerism . You could call this the Gremlin Effect---a character with an underlying creepiness. Troll dolls (which were recently acquired by DreamWorks Animation) and Cabbage Patch Kids are the inexplicable result of this paradox.

There is a huge network of support groups for pedophiles endorsed by the government specifically for this reason. They don't believe anyone should have sex with children and any who do are evil, so they need help to deal with their own feelings and educate others about them.

Pretty decent progress this past week.  I'm in the middle of writing XGEF, which, contrary to some people's expectations, is not going to be all that big. It basically handles setting up a very bare-bones framework around which an engine can be built, while also providing a few systems related to managing mods. In particular, it will handle the system that takes a set of mods, compares it to the code that it's modifying, and then performs any alterations that need to happen before compiling them.

I had thought that this last bit was going to take loads of work, but as it turns out Microsoft has actually done a good job with a library called Roslyn.  Roslyn is the compilation engine that Visual Studio itself uses to compile C# code (as well as Visual Basic, but who's counting).  Since it itself was written using C# and then subsequently open-sourced, it means that those of us looking to compile C# code on the fly have an extremely powerful tool at our fingertips.

It's not just compiling, but it also handles code analysis, which for us is really the important part.  I need to be able to look at the actual symbols that the code represents, and not just the text of the code itself. For instance, here is a symbol graph that Roslyn generated based on the entry point of my test program:

[[http://i.imgur.com/GadZbhR.png]]

The blue nodes are /symbols/, which is to say, the /actual/ constructs that I'm worried about manipulating.  The green nodes are the actual code that was typed (read them all left to right to see what the program that was analyzed was), and the grey and white are things like whitespace and other chaff that, while important for actually reading the code, does not affect its meaning.

This system is /powerful/.  Manipulating only nodes, I could, for instance, load up a mod in Roslyn, search for a blue class node, grab its name, look for that same class name node in the core game symbols, and then just copy-paste. Boom, moddability.

(Granted there's more to it to make the system intuitive, but I was /not/ expecting to have this level of progress after like a week's worth of work.)

--------------

While discussing this progress on the Discord server, we had a bit of discussion over the minimalistic bare minimum version of a standard Pokemon game.  What I mean by this is, what is the absolute least number of mechanics that one could include to have a simple game still contain the core gameplay loop of Pokemon?

I can't remember where I first came across this concept (probably Extra Credits), but I remember the example they gave of the original Super Mario.  You pull Mario down to the barest of bones and what do you have left that's still fundamentally Mario gameplay?  A block that can move right, jump, and a pit in the ground to jump over.  That's pretty much it--all the rest (lives, score, time limit, goombas, mushrooms) is simply building off of that corest of mechanics.  

The conclusion I came to for “what's the most theoretically minimalistic version of Pokemon” was basically a never-ending string of battles, my argument being that the overworld is really just an excuse to get you from one battle to another.  Pokeballs, however, are still included in this pared-down version, as the game is essentially not just about fighting, but about building a team that fights.  It almost looks like an even more sparse version of Safari Zone: Your options are Fight or Capture, and the game is over when all your current team have been Fight'd to death.

Why bring this up?  Well, we've been trying to hash out where the line needs to be drawn between hidden, compiled, inaccessible game system logic, and exposed, open, freely end-user-changeable moddable files.  This exercise was an effort to try and define that line, but I don't think it works: Combat and Team-building are certainly core, but neither one is a single all-encompassing system to have a fence built around it, and there are other concepts that are just as crucial that ought not to be meddled with.

In the end, I'm betting that most systems will be more-or-less hybrid: some bits that can't change to ensure the stability of the game as a whole, and then some parameters or configurations that are freely moddable (you can't remove or change the fundamental concept of a Stat, but you can change ATK or DEF or add a new MAGIC stat if you so choose).  However, it will be important to ensure that everything that should be in the walled garden, is.  For every system that we permit to be potentially modified, it increases the complexity of the system as a whole, and introduces what is essentially a random element to the game's structure.  

So with that, I leave you with a question:  what is /essential/ about Pokemon to you?  What parts could you absolutely not part with if you still wanted to call something a Pokemon game?  On the flip side, what concepts could you absolutely do without?  Any input would greatly help our efforts to map out this territory.

*** I have apparently gotten a very different experience out of pokemon than you have. I play it, primarily not for the battles but for the experience of exploring the world, experiencing the detailed storyline, and seeing the npcs. I just played through the battles to get them over with. Once I unlock repel in a game, I use it constantly. You could get rid of the battles and I'd have just about as much fun. So honestly if you were to get rid of the overworld, you would have gotten rid of the enjoyable part for me.

Maybe that's why Pokemon is so popular, it appeals to different people for different reasons - the collecting, the battling, and the exploring.

**** Yeah, I was mostly attempting to identify the /mechanical/ reasons that one might be attracted to the game--after all, I'm trying to identify what systems ought to exist at a core, unchangeable level. Story and setting are things that were probably the primary reason that the games were so successful, but it's not something that I can enshrine beyond ensuring that dialog, visuals, and NPC interaction are things the game has, which isn't very helpful as a focus.

I can certainly respect the multi-group attractiveness of the formula, it brings to mind the four player archetypes. Rest assured I'm not attempting to change the design at this point, simply trying to organize it.

This entire line of thinking has certainly shed light on the broad appeal of the games, but has been nearly worthless for its original intended purpose. Oh well. You can't force eureka moments, I suppose.

*** Can a /game/ be irrational? Surely the story parts of the game can, but the playable mechanics? You have a set of rules that define the universe, they are encoded in the game's program.

Ah wait, single-player games are always rational (story notwithstanding). But games where you interact with other characters, if those characters don't have a set of goals, could also be considered irrational. Even though those characters have /rules/ and act according to then, they should then be considered part of the environment, rather than agents. In any case the presence of NPCs can make a game irrational if you care that they have no goals.

EDIT: nevermind, you've thought about this. It's in the linked google doc:

#+begin_quote
  So, to recap: a rational game does not force the player to perform any actions that violate the agreed role of the player (or player-character), whether that be because all actions within the entire world have been constrained to fit a particular mould or because the role has been broadened enough that all actions possible within the game are reasonably within the bounds of the player role contract.

  The big box retailer Costco is building a new chicken processing plant in Fremont, about an hour from Mueller's farm. The company plans for the plant to slaughter 2 million birds per week. To raise all those chickens, the company is recruiting about 120 farmers to sign on as contract poultry farmers.

  Mueller wants in. But to do that, he plans to take out a massive $2 million loan to finance the construction of four chicken barns.

  As pork and poultry production grows in the U.S., this is an increasingly common arrangement. Farmers sign multi-million dollar deals to do business with big corporations. The company provides animals and feed. The farmer builds the barns and cares for the animals. It requires a major investment from the farmers who enter into the agreement and hope the investment will pay off.

Serfs of the old-fashioned sort were almost certainly worse-off than modern chicken farmers, but relative to their time and culture, they're probably about equally unhappy with the circumstances of their job.

******** In the literal sense of the word, you're right.

In the realistic examination of human thought and behavior, career changes are hard and often times go against people's innate sense of identity or purpose.

Like, I'm a therapist. Therapy does not pay well unless you primarily work with wealthy clients. Which means that if you want to help the less fortunate, you have to rely on insurance companies, which means you have to be okay with an industry pay model that was developed about 40 years ago and hasn't changed since.

Yes, I could give up what I believe and care about and say fuck it (more and more therapists are doing exactly this as the cost of living and inflation continue to make the amount insurance pays inadequate) but many don't because a career change seems infeasible to them or because for whatever reason they really care about helping the underprivileged.

Chicken farmers are in a similar situation but have it way, way worse. And for whatever reason, a lot of them can't realistically just change the course of their life and stop being a chicken farmer to go to school for plumbing or programming or whatever.

You'll be /really/ hungry afterwards the first few times, though, as your body realizes it has to build up the resources to do /that/ again. Weightlifting can help raise base metabolic rate, but it mostly just makes you look good and have an easy time doing physical labor.

Learn to cook healthier. This isn't nearly as hard or as ascetic as you think it is; you just might not have been /taught/. For instance, putting lemon juice and the right herbs on things is /just better/: it turns dull steamed vegetables or chopped salads into delightful but extremely healthy meals. Favor baking, roasting, steaming, and grilling as preparation methods; avoid sauces. Favor fish, vegetables, and complex carbs like legumes or whole grains over simple carbs. When wanting something sweet, the right fresh fruit can really hit the spot -- but you have to know how to get /tasty/ fresh fruit, which can be hard in some places.

Don't ever get ascetic or make a healthy lifestyle into a punishment.

*** I lost weight without any kind of special diet or exercise routine, so just going to list what worked for me in case it helps you too:

1) Reduce food portions and eat slower. Give yourself more time to feel "satisfied" by a meal, and practice stopping there rather than eating until you're full, or eating past that point before you realize it because your stomach hasn't finished sending you the fullness signals yet. Practice cutting extraneous things first. If you get fast food, don't get fries or a soda. If you eat at a restaurant, don't get an appetizer.

2) Drink water. Cut out all soda /including diet soda/, but also any fruit juice, which is just liquid sugar. /Water./ Tea and coffee are okay, as long as you don't add sugar or cream. Vegetable juices can be, though pay attention to their sugar content. Similarly, use more seasonings, less sauces. Salad dressing should be oil and vinegar based, not creamy. Lots of things can be made tasty with lemon juice and/or salt.

3) Exercise is /healthy/ but it is not necessary to lose weight. It can even be detrimental if it makes it harder for you to limit your food intake. Start by limiting your food intake: if you feel like you're handling it okay, try exercising. If you start snacking more after you do, you're undoing the calorie loss of the exercising. This could still be okay if you're replacing fat with muscle, but it is a slow process and will not be encouraging on the weight scale.

4) /Use social pressure systems./ Tweet or post your weight every week, if you have twitter or facebook. Yes, it's embarrassing. Still worth it. It's amazing how powerful a motivator it is to get support from friends and family, as well as have that extra voice of embarrassment speak up when you feel the urge to grab a cookie or soda once in awhile but you don't want to end up with a higher weight when you post that week. Shame is a shitty thing to feel, but if you're going to feel it anyway, weaponize it to your advantage.

5) Most of all, don't get discouraged if you backslide a little every so often. You are going to be undergoing a process, and should not expect yourself to master it immediately. You will fail once in awhile. You will learn from these mistakes. You will get better at recognizing the right balance of food to keep away hunger pains without ever eating beyond the point of fullness.

Good luck!

*** With regards to exercise, I'm told that if you're not panting, you're unlikely to be losing weight from a given exercise. (Exactly at which point you start panting depends on your current fitness level and so forth). You don't want to be so intense that you injure yourself, but you do want it to be at least that difficult.

Also, keep hydrated. Water's easily taken in and just as easily lost - drink as much water as you want. (Dehydration can be nasty).

Thirdly, other people have already talked about diet. Diet is /very/ important, and what's mostly important there is portion size. Try cutting back a little on that. Once you're used to the cut-back portions (and your body realises it's not actually starving on the reduced intake), then the cut-back portions will become the new normal. Then cut back just a little again. Rinse and repeat.

...I hope that's helpful.

This is the quintessence of bad information around there. Calories out > calories in is a /consequence/ of successfully doing things that lose weight, not a strategy to lose weight.

See also [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/12/the-physics-diet/][Scott]]

As to how to lose weight - yes, definitely try exercise, yes, definitely try different diets and see if they help. Start cooking for yourself, more as a friction mechanism preventing eating too much, rather than because eating out is particularly unhealthy (unless you fastfood. quit fastfood. also quit sugary things like soda / candy, if you consume regularly).

In the end you just have to try things, and hope they work. A dietitian will probably help, in that they should at least prevent you from starving yourself by accident.

But if nothing works for 6-12 months, at some point you might have to reevaluate whether it's worth the effort. If you're not mordibly obese, being a bit fat is not really that bad.

Well yes and no. If a person were to have infinite willpower, then they could eat just enough calories/macronutrients/vitamins/etc. that it's healthy, but still being less than the amount of calories that they burn in a day, then they would wind up losing weight. Of course, people don't have infinite willpower.

****** There are things you can do to increase your willpower or to make things take less willpower. For example, instead of stopping eating candy and constantly focusing on not grabbing that chocolate bar, you could just remove candy from your house and fill it with healthy food. Now, you can still eat candy if you go get some, but it's easier to eat healthy food and the candy isn't literally right next to you tempting you constantly. Avoiding candy consumption in such a situation now is easier. So there are things you can do, willpower wise!

** I like guided meditation tapes. There's a sub genre of guided meditation that uses visualizations like "walk through a garden" or "beach at sunset."

I've found that these can be neat. The visualization exercises end up feeling like something between a 'memory palace' and a lucid dream.

Unfortunately, most of the image-based guided meditation tapes seem to be built around some specific goal like improving public speaking, or dieting, or whatever.

I'd like to find something that just had the imagery, without any kind of purpose beyond enjoying a cool lucid dream.

Have other people tried guided meditation? Any recommendations for good readers?

And does anyone know of a series that does the visualizations without attaching any specific self improvement goal?

I'm actually suprised by this. I'd assumed most would focus on religion. My parents made me go to a sunday class that was provided by the local catholic church while I was in high school. This type of exercise was fairly common.

** Which coins do you consider to be the most pleasing in form? (Note that I'm talking /primarily/ about the overall size, shape, weight, and color of a coin, rather than about the designs pressed into each of its faces.)

As a USAian who has only minimal experience with the coins of other countries, I'd hazard a guess that the plain quarter is my favorite. I'd rate the Sacagawea/presidential dollar coin a little lower---perhaps because I feel offended at the pretension of a mere layer of brass to make the coin look like a gold piece from a fantasy story. I vaguely remember also liking the Anthony dollar coin (basically, a quarter with an undecagon on each face), but it isn't around nowadays.

The approximately-1-inch size of the coins enumerated above definitely is the size that I like the most. I consider the 1.2-inch half-dollar coin (of which I happen to have controlled a single example for many years) somewhat fantastic (not =cool=, but =unrealistic=) in its largeness, while the 0.7-inch dime is right on the edge of being annoying in its smallness. The nickel seems just a hair too thick for its diameter (diameter ÷ thickness = 11, compared to 14 for the quarter and half-dollar and 13 for the dollar, dime, and penny). I can think of no objection to the penny, other than perhaps its tendency to gain a patina, which can be ugly.

** So, munchkin this: you have a pocket computer. It's kinda like a supercomputer from the 1980s in terms of computation power, but /way/ easier to use. Also, it magically sends information to other people's pocket computers. What could you do with said pocket computer to help you win at life? Which specific computations can you perform to lead you to better outcomes?

What are you doing with your phones, basically? What would you /like/ to be doing if there was an app for it? How has your pocket computer improved your life?

So far, I've found that having an infinite library in my hand helps with patience and waiting, and that a microphone/camera and data storage helps with memory. Using timers and the stopwatch helps with time sense and short-term memory, and having wikipedia/wolfram helps solve silly debates about known facts. If I ever start a company or otherwise complicate my finaces, it seems that spreadsheets are and always have been the killer app for personal computers in general, but with my current budget having instant access to my debit card amount is enough.

But none of these really feels revolutionary. I have a sense of /so much potential/ that I'm not taking advantage of. It feels like everything so far has been /small/ compared to what could be done.

In particular, I think there's potential to try and use it to automate doing-the-math and therefore make the results of actually calculating things out more available.

How are you using your pocket computer to be more rational?

*** Ok, reporting some ideas so far (1 day later, talked to ~4ish people on [[/r/rational]] briefly, probably 10-15 minutes of mental effort):

Starting with a better definition of the problem: how can a cellphone become a better /mental prosthetic/? How can the always-with-you computer help as a mind-extension?

1. It can generate random numbers. This is actually an upgrade, as people really struggle to be properly random. Helpful when you need your actions to be /unpredictable/ more than anything else. Also works as a tiebreaker/timesaver/introspection tool for hard decisions.

2. You can get device-automation apps that let you hook up various tools and apps into custom solutions to whatever problem you're having. Worth investigating, but I'm not sure anything out there has a unix-command-line level of modularity and composability yet.

3. When people want to use a computer to mathematically model something, they reach for tools like MatLab/Gnu Octave. I should learn one of these and/or figure out if anyone's shrunk them into a pocket version. This is more about desktop than mobile, though. I doubt I'll have problems to apply it to that also need /quick/ thinking.

4. I take notes with pictures, drawings, and text, but I should get a diagram editor as well for thinking about things that break down into clearly-defined parts.

5. Whenever doing day-to-day tasks I'm uncertain about, I can check against WikiHow. This seems like it could be an effective anti-akrasia weapon: fear of messing things up keeps me from doing so much basic, everyday stuff that it should be embarrassing.

6. More willingness to be a dirty winning cheater would lead to actions like looking up strategies for boardgames I play with friends. In fact, more willingness to check strategies against google in general would help. I could get a lot more out of that technique. Same goes for using photos of things as eidetic memory: I should use it more.

I also asked in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6j8m0r/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/djdbv6h/][Saturday Munchkinry thread]], please take a look at that as well.

*** Probably the most moral use of the Death Note would be euthanasia.

In my home state, California, euthanasia is legal. However, it's still difficult and unpleasant. When my father was dying, he went through the process to acquire the medicine that he could take to end his life. He was worried he would become crippled and in pain, and didn't want that.

The medicine for ending your life is basically a bunch of sleeping pills with some anti-vomiting pills. You take them, fall asleep, and never wake up. However, nobody sells individual sleeping pills in doses that would kill you; you have to have a bunch of them. The procedure the doctors showed us involves crushing a bunch of pills, like 40 of them, into a slurry with water then drinking it. Unpleasant and difficult. Dad never used that option, but he appreciated the control it gave him. He knew he'd never be trapped in a painful body, wishing for death. If it came to it, it would have not been a great time eating those pills.

The Death Note, however, can provide something better. For example, you could write in it "painless peaceful death" for the person instead of having them do this pill protocol. If it works, you might even be able to write "30 days of healthy life, then painless peaceful death" (it's unclear how much the Death Note controls these things).

  To be clear, if the doctors thought there was any way he might make it, I would have taken that chance. I truly would have put myself through anything. What I came to accept was the fact that I would never get to be this little guy's mother---that if we came to term, he would likely live a very short time until he choked and died, if he even made it that far. This was a no-go for me. I couldn't put him through that suffering when we had the option to minimize his pain as much as possible.

  *So you're going to Colorado.*

  There are a few doctors in the country---four of them, you interviewed one of them---who will do this. But my doctor had previously referred patients to Dr. Hern, who's in Boulder. He's this 78-year-old man who's been doing this for decades, who developed a lot of the abortion procedures that we know to be the most safe. He's had 37,000 patients and he's never lost anyone. And he's a zealot, but he has to be. There are websites dedicated to offering money to kill him; his practice has four layers of bulletproof glass. They've been shot at. He was there during the /Roe v. Wade/ decision. He's been through it all. And the only other peer he had at his level was Dr. Tiller, who was killed in 2009.

Really? And can we justify "free speech" in terms a little closer to the ontological fundamentals?

That's not to say I think we can't.

The problem is, speech and an earnestly believed model of the world often fail to coincide.

I'm not convinced of that, actually. If you kill hitler, let's say you save a few million people who would have otherwise have died. But then, under the butterfly princinple, there would be an incredibly low chance, for any conception, that any specific sperm reaches an egg. That means there would only be a 2^{-48} (24 chromosomes, two parents) chance of that sperm having the same chromosomes in the altered timeline as the original. (A little better if you're inbred.) That's would effectively mean that every single person created after the divergence point would be a different person, killing the original timeline's version. So to save a few million people, you kill billions. Really, this isn't just limited to killing hitler-- any timetravel would do this, assuming things are actually "changed."

Now, you'd get billions of /new/ people to replace the dead ones, but ethics really starts to break down if you try to assign moral value to people who don't actually exist yet, so from the perspective of a pre-timetravel person, it would be unethical to timetravel, just as a post-timetravel person would fine it unethical to not timetravel.

*** I'm interested in the potential of the Death Note as a positive mind control device. After all, you can write about their actions before death.

So for example, you can write "X devoted the rest of his life to researching a cure for cancer, advancing the study as much as he possibly could, then died." Since X would be mind controlled, their emotions would be blunted and they would focus solely on research, allowing it to advance far more rapidly than if the Death Note wasn't used.

So I would kill volunteers. Or rather, I would get them to kill themselves. Write their own names in the Death Note along with the conditions of death, allowing themselves to single-mindedly focus on solving one particular world problem or another and use their abilities to their limit.

**** Okay, on one hand this whole thread is awful and disturbing and I really don't like the whole "Who do you think deserves to die" dynamic.

On the other hand, I would love a story about what would happen if someone started visibly making examples out of political figures of a certain movement and using a magic book to kill them.

How would they react? Politicians are being picked off by a threat they can't fight against or defend themselves from; some of them might continue on anyway, out of confidence, ideology or hoping to stay below the killer's notice. They would try to find ways to protect themselves from the killer's power, like maybe looking for ways to militate for their policies from an anonymous position (if the killer keeps killing off elected official, the government will probably restructure itself to have some sort of anonymous senate). A climate of paranoia would appear, with politicians doing everything they can to protect their identity.

Uh.

******** No, you're kinda missing the point. The thing about ethical and meta-ethical views is that, unlike "free-floating" metaphysics, they /need/ to supervene on the natural/physical world to mean anything at all. Since morality needs to supervene on the natural while retaining a basic action-guiding nature, the precise nature of the supervenience tightly constrains what morality can logically be.

The upshot is: if you're a nihilist with a materialist metaphysics, you're going to have to be a nihilist with respect to "richer ontologies". Adding Platonic things which /fail/ to supervene on the natural in an action-guiding way completely fails to buy you a morality.

Again, materialism is an ontology, nihilism is a view about objective meta-ethical truth. To claim there is no meta-ethical truth is to say there's no truth about what moral discourse actually refers to, which is logically contradictory. You can have discourse without a referent (nihilism, error theory), but you can't have no answer about the referent in the presence of discourse.

You're seriously not very good at logic. Take lessons.

**** Putting aside the unethical nature of your plan, it is too optimistic.

People aren't idiotic enough to not notice only political leaders with leftist views are being killed. And they are going to realize it's not a god doing the killing, since you will almost certainly make errors. They are going to be angry, and want vengeance against the killer (you).

Now, they don't know that it is you specifically doing the killing, but the fact that only political leaders with leftist views are dying strongly suggests that it's someone with rightist views doing the killing. Tensions will run high, and conflicts will break out between left and right. And as more and more leftist leaders die, those conflicts will escalate, eventually becoming a civil war. And a large number of nukes are currently being guarded/controlled by soldiers with leftist views...

So odds are, nuclear war will happen, what's left of society will be in ruins, and you will probably be dead. No happy ending for anyone.

He's an unbelievably moronic hateful prick that can't back up any of the reasons he uses to justify his views with any sort of actual fact. It's been interesting talking to someone who's on such a completely opposite side of the moral spectrum from myself.

But he mostly just slings around fancy words in an attempt to make his hateful rhetoric seem legitimate. He's a white supremacist, anti-Jew bigot that has no good reasons for any of the views he has. And can't give me any supporting facts for why that is. Ugh.

****************** I'm sorry to dig up a quasi-dead horse, but I'm not really comfortable seeing you ban someone after you had an extensive, heated political debate with them; especially since you've demonstrated political bias before, and *especially especially* since during said debate you said things like

#+begin_quote
  You're seriously not very good at logic. Take lessons.
#+end_quote

and TRIPLE especially when you delete every post he made, even though most of these were no less constructive than your own posts, political opinions aside.

I understand that the ban was a result of a mod discussion, but I really wish the whole situation had been handled by [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] and/or [[/u/PeridexisErrant][u/PeridexisErrant]], with one of them announcing the ban and officially ending the thread; I don't think you should have put your mod hat at all to close a debate you were part of.

******************* I'd rather let this stay firmly in the past, but with my mod hat on I'll confirm that we all discussed it, decided /not/ to ban him, set clear criteria for a ban (basically incitement to violence, dehumanising people, or apologia for violent hate groups), and then /after/ that saw new posts that met the criteria for a ban.

Personally I hate using bans, but if that's the cost of not-being-4chan I'll do it.

******************* You're welcome to message the mods as a group. We can confirm that we were talking over the option of banning the guy after last Friday's off-topic thread, since he'd basically taken over half the comment volume.

What made me pull the trigger /wasn't/ his politics. You /know/ that: we would have banned him much, much earlier if it was that. The trouble was that he directly told a user that their happiness was irrelevant and that things they enjoyed were degenerate. Once the trigger was pulled, there was group agreement, and if the mod group disagrees, we can reverse the ban.

Advocate bad ideas, well, I'll make fun of you to high heaven, but no mod action. Devalue human lives or happiness, in so many words, deliberately and directly? Banhammer 40K, in the Emperor's name let none survive.
