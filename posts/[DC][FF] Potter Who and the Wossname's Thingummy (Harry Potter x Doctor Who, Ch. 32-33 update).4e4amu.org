** (In what is quickly becoming my default fanfic review:) Starts out great, eventually loses steam. Stop reading as soon as you stop having fun.

** This is a cross between Doctor Who and Harry Potter - the Doctor enters Harry's mind on Platform 9 3/4 in the first year of Hogwarts. Really cool and interesting writing, and amazing worldbuilding. It updated today with 2 full chapters. Updates are highly irregular but the story is amazingly high quality.

** Definitely recommend this, even if you, like me, have no knowledge of Doctor Who except from cultural osmosis. Reading Chapter One is enough to figure out whether you're going to enjoy this or hate it.
