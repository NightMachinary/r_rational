Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Super power contagion, social graph version: The original super was a timeline jumper that entered our timeline from ElseWhere, and promptly got a job as a caretaker at a hospice. Over the next year the original nine supers - Frequently called the "Gray wave" or the "Rejuv 9" came about. He explained matters to them, and seven of them took up the same mission.

The way it works is, that for every Empowered Person who knows you (loosely defined, but you cannot "know" a thousand people. You got to know something about who they are. The biblical sense, however, always works, as long as it was consensual, even if they do not recall your name. Yes. There are people who try to exploit that. ), if something happens to you that is fatal, you get a one in 127 chance of instead getting a super power that prevents that death.

This is a /separate/ roll of the dice for each person who knows you, so you can, if sufficiently lucky, get more than one power, but you also cannot make yourself deathproof by befriending 127 powered people.

Patient Zero spent a lot of time talking to people about to die, mostly from old age - and eventually some of them triggered, generally with healing or regenerative powers that reversed that condition.

Most powered people are still both from, and at least 50% employed at, hospices, with some kind of self-healing power.

The second largest group are the drowning-proof, which is a crack-pot military scheme where you stand in front of a auditorium and tell your life story for 2-4 hours, and then they drown you under medical supervision, lying highly discouraged.

The power you get is generally somewhat stingy - The strongest powered are generally the hospice sourced, because fixing "is 98, and about to die from a laundry list of illnesses" generally requires an outright healing factor, while the drowning program usually just gets you super hemogoblin or the ability to manifest gills.

Now. What is the most mad-cap abuse of this you can think of?

*** Depending on the definition of death, things like heroin ODs and electrocution are also highly reversible triggers. Making someone immune to electrocution through some random means seems more helpful than making them immune to drowning. There's also Commotio Cordis, where hitting the chest at exactly the right angle at exactly the right 1/100th of a second during its cycle stops the heart. You might just get a power which fixes the defect and not notice, you might get something more esoteric.

The Empowered community should eventually all become immortal. If they all make a point of knowing eachother (an annual orgy is, hilariously, possibly the most efficient means), the community will eventually be large enough that everyone gets thousands of rolls per death, and each new person added to the community will also be able to add their own family members to the network with relative ease.

HIV might become a blessing rather than a curse. AIDS kills you a bunch of ways at once due to a wasted body, exotic cancers, and generic diseases becoming lethal, so becoming immune to all of that at once would be akin to a hospice death which also makes you immune to most or every infectious disease. This would also contribute to the annual empowered orgy.

1/127 non-still infants with Trisomy 13 born to Empowered mothers would trigger with something which prevents them from dying to Trisomy 13. This is utterly terrifying, and might be world-ending if the power is something like perfect instinctual biokinesis. Other similarly lethal birth defects would also run this risk.

Eventually, and assuming a particularly dangerous infant isn't born, a system might be set up where cells of several hundred empowered invite new people in, power them up, and then send those people off to new cells. This would maximize the number of new rolls people get per death, allowing the creation of absurdly powerful individuals with potentially dozens of powers. Someone will eventually get the time travel power and close the stable time loop with this scheme, and the world would become a patchwork of empowered villages. Iterate to Singularity. We're even protected from the usual worries about AI and paperclippers in this scenario, as the AI would have to dodge every seer, kill every brute, and trick every thinker, and then plan around the dozens of powers each person they try to kill could get at the moment of death. If a GRB ever hit Earth, most people would develop some form of radiation immunity, assuming they didn't have it already. Sun-diving would become a fun activity for the family as long as you have several thousand unused death rolls in reserve, and I don't even want to think about the powers you could get from that.

Congratulations, you just turned the entire world into discount Crawlers who might become even more powerful than Crawler.

*** Why do they drown you rather than subjecting you to other dangers whose solutions would be more interesting? For example, if you stand in a room that is about to slice you into a million pieces using blades, you might get force fields or control over metal/machinery/computers or turning into liquid or, if a random number generator rarely disables the trigger, probability manipulation. Or divination, if a password disables the trigger.

**** Because you can fairly reliably bring back a drowning vic if you do the whole thing in a controlled setting.

Having ways out of the drowning other than the obvious is a neat exploit, and would definately trigger something interesting in the cases where the subject "rolls" multiple successes. - You cant trigger the same power more than once, so a drownee with a hundred witnesses who triggered 5 times might get gills, the ability to phase through materials (Once/day) , a gremlin-touch ability to make machinery break (once/week), the ability to enter suspended animation, and the ability to hold their breath for two hours.

You cant do the drowning bit twice though, or at least, not on a success - The second time your life is just not in danger, and experiment indicates you also only ever get one roll from each witness. - Trying a second death method right after the drowning /always/ fails.

Does your trigger chance per witness scale with the number of powers the witness has?

Does the roll depend on the recipient's belief that he is about to die, or the fact? If the first, the asleep are helpless. If the second, we could try looking into the future: Get a bunch of empowered observers to know each of another bunch of plebs. On command, kill the plebs with extreme prejudice unless they just showed signs of gaining some power. Whenever a pleb shows signs of gaining some power, immediately send the previous command. When we would have reason to give the command, the hope is that we got a signal about that in the past. And then we could use that to launch our nukes 30 seconds before the Sovjets or something.

We can have unknown plebs speak to the auditorium. They sure would be motivated to make themselves known, if we tell them what's going on.

We could provide big discounts to people who want to sign up for powers if they accept a 50% chance of death in the process.

There might be a brain region or other organ that the observer thinks more important than we do, with our knowledge of what one can save someone from - just as the observer thinks people ought to be saved from drowning even though they were never actually highly certain to die permanently.

If you want a better incentive than cracking passwords, other applications include proof search and asking "Is any of these many ways of zapping this pleb something you think ought to be prevented?".

"The biblical sense" seems the only way to achieve this, with a loose definition allowing thousands per day (meaning you can do this until there's no more new powereds since you should outodds deaths as they occur). You could use this along with extensive registry to get the world's entire population to non-superpowered pretty quickly if everyone was willing.

***** I don't think it's impractical to get together a group of current immortals and immortal wannabes for a rapidly rotating orgy until everyone "knows" everyone else? And once you get a small group going the gains should be exponential since you can bring more in and others have more incentive to join. People who have benefited but don't want to continue chip in to maintain the group for everyone else. If you could prove something gave people powers or death resistance people would put up with a lot to get that. People don't hesitate to go through chemo for "only" a chance at "only" a decade of life for comparison, and most do it for years.

A minimally invasive way would just require 5-10 minute meet ups throughout the day, which seems reasonable in the pursuit of powers and immortality. 3 a day gives you close to 2 1% risk of deaths a year for half an hour a day, a better return than exercise and you'd get your daily exercise on top of that!

Edit: if people are 100% into it you only need to be immune to: starvation, dehydration, exhaustion, lack of sleep, cardiac muscle buildup, and friction to be at a point where you don't need to live a life outside the "Grinder". Once you have those your ever increasing known numbers should outrun deaths from more specific things as they crop up.

Also The Great Grinder would be a fantastic name for this faction/place!

** *Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 10: Duralumin and Nicrosil*

Ok, week ten of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]].

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This week we have the second pair of enhancement metal, duralumin and nicrosil. As always we're interested in what a duralumin or nicrosil twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial. Duralumin and nicrosil are again metals where the allomantic half is not particularly useful on its own, so for those metals you'll be stuck with the feruchemic half (plus compounding) on earth.

*Allomancy*

Allomantically, duralumin and nicrosil are paired in the same way as aluminium and chromium. Both make an allomancer burn their entire supply of metals in one massive burst, but duralumin affects the allomancer themselves and nicrosil affects anyone else the allomancer is touching.

In both cases, the effect depletes any metal reserves the targeted allomancer is currently burning and in exchange massively amplifies the effects of that metal for a very brief amount of time. What this does precisely differs slightly depending on the metal being burned:

- Iron/Steel: Very briefly apply a ridiculous amount of force between the allomancer and a metal object. This can easily result in the allomancer getting crushed by their own power if they don't have access to some kind supernatural durability (eg. burning or tapping pewter). Duralumin/nicrosil enhanced pushes/pulls are also able to affect metals that are partially inside a person (though only metals in their metalic forms, you still can't pull all the iron out of someones blood).

- Tin: The allomancer's senses all become massively more sensitive, causing an immediate, crippling headache as the allomancer is overwhelmed by the influx of sensory information.

- Pewter: The allomancer briefly becomes unbelievably strong and near invulnerable, capable of crushing a persons head with a headbut without so much as getting a scratch themselves.

- Bronze: Duralumin or nicrosil allow a bronze allomancer to pierce copperclouds and detect allomancy over a much larger area than normal, though only in very short bursts.

- Copper: Duralumin/nicrosil enhanced copper allomancy can very briefly create a near impenetrable coppercloud and shield the allomancer from duralumin/nicrosil enhanced mental allomancy.

- Brass/zinc: Create a very brief, but massive change in the target emotions (eg. make the target feel a short burst of uncontrollable panic). Duralumin and nicrosil allow soothing/rioting to affect even an allomancer burning copper. In addition, duralumin/nicrosil enhanced soothing or rioting a person with a sufficiently damaged spiritweb allows the allomancer to take direct control of the targets body. This effect lasts even after the allomancer stops soothing/rioting the target. Allomancy and feruchemy don't provide a direct way to damage a persons spiritweb (though other magic systems do), but we know emotional trauma and/or certain mental illnesses can also cause your spiritweb to crack. Such cracks are typically too small for allomancy to sneak through, but it is not inconceivable that an extraordenarily horrifying experience can break a person to the extend that the allomaner could take control.

*Feruchemy: Duralumin*

Feruchemically, duralumin stores spiritual Connection. Storing Connection makes the feruchemist become less noticible in a crowd and makes it harder both for them to relate to other people and for other people to relate to them. It becomes harder to pick up on social cues and interpreting the intent behind what a person is saying (eg. getting when someone is making a joke and when they are sincere) and similarly other people will have trouble understanding the feruchemist.

Tapping Connection does the opposite, making the feruchemist more relatable and making it easier for them to interact with other people. It is theoretically possible, but very hard, to store or tap Connection to specific people.

Tapping sufficient Connection also creates a conduit between the feruchemist and the cognitive realm in the area around them, which has the peculiar side effect of letting them speak and understand any language that is commonly spoken in this area.

*Feruchemy: Nicrosil*

Nicrosil feruchemy allows you to store (Innate) Investiture. Investiture is the power of the gods that diffuses into the world, it is what powers all the magic systems and most importantly for us, it's what makes someone an allomancer or a feruchemist.

Nicrosil feruchemists are able to store their feruchemic and allomantic abilities in Nicrosil minds. While storing, they become worse at using the magic system in question, burning metals generates less of an effect and they become less efficient at feruchemically storing and tapping attributes. Then when tapping the resulting metalmind, they become better at using those powers.

For a Nicrosil compounder, this means they can store their allomantic nicrosil ability for a time (during which they wouldn't be able to use their powers) and then tap the created nicrosilmind while burning nicrosil to create an even greater than normal burst of power in any allomancer they touch.

*** And with that we're done with the enhancement metals! Next week we get back to some more clearly defined powers when we dive into the temporal metals.

I had a whole bit about unsealed nicrosilminds in here originally, but we don't really have any idea on how those work and the speculated explanation was getting crazy long so I decided to leave it out. Sorry for anyone with plans to start mass producing Bands of Mourning.

Using duralumin enhanced allomancy to take control of people not affected by hemalurgy is speculation. We know the mechanism is based on damage to the spiritweb and from Ruin and Kelsier talking to people suffering from mundane mental trauma (as well as the whole system of the Nahel bond) we know you don't need magic to damage a spiritweb, so I don't think it's much of a stretch.

It might also be worth noting that everything in the Feruchemy: Duralumin section is just side effects of having a lot/very little Connection, the actual use of the power is likely something completely different.

If it let you get 1.1x as much as you stored, then that seems like it would break the world quickly - compounders can do positive feedback loops for their metals and break stuff, but you've mentioned a few times that they're very rare. Necrosil sounds like it would let /anyone they touch/ do a positive feedback loop.

Supercharged Brass/Zinc sounds very exploitable, especially since you mentioned it stays after they stop rioting/soothing. Is there any other upkeep cost? An amoral king could just horribly torture people to harm their spirit web and build a thrall army

For feruchemy it's higher caps at how much you can store/tap at a time. So if you can normally store 10% of your speed at a time, you can now maybe store 20%.

It is. We don't really see the limits explored that well, you control the targets body as if it was an extension of your own and we never see anyone take permanent control so it's likely that it takes some concentration or that you automatically lose control when you fall asleep or something.

** I was reading *The City and the Dungeon*, which is a decent but not amazing litrpg.

The economy is a mess though and makes me wonder how easily it could be destroyed.

The basic gist is that there's a city with a massive magical dungeon and people can choose to convert themselves into beings that can enter the dungeon and grow in power.

The trade-off is that in order to survive, they must eat one red crystal a day. The dungeon has 100 levels and gets exponentially harder as you go down and adventurers can find different types of crystals (blue, yellow, orange, green, etc). Tiers follow a similar progression, with blue adventurers needing a blue crystal.

Where it gets weird is the conversion rate.

1 green crystal = 1000 yellow crystals = 1 million orange crystals = 1 billion red crystals. A blue crystal is "worth" a trillion red crystals.

Obviously absurd, but what could you do if you had regular access to high level crystals? In the book, one example is a high level adventurer buying up all the shirts in the city.

*** I haven't read the story so I might be completely off: My first thought was: "Good god why would someone choose to do conversions that way?" Immediately followed by: "Damn, I use a system that has a 1:1760:5280:63360 conversion path."

Just to double check I understand this right: each step along the ROYGBIV order is a thousand times more valuable? (Theorizing that there are indigo and violet?)

You could crash the economies of lower tiers I guess, but generally adventurers would be creating different economies for each level since they basically only care about the color they need. The only munchkin use of high tier excess is to influence other high tiers that are struggling to get their daily. Anyone further up the tier that has excess high tier can immediately flood the market below them, but then people should just promote up eating up the excess.

Munchkin: fund huge numbers of lower tiers to get them to your level to help you?

Not munchkin but theorizing: In spite of the 1/1000 conversion ratio there might be some crazy power point where it's easier to force taxes on lower power adventurers than it is to get them yourself? If what you say is correct this is the end game: the dungeon gets exponentially harder so tiers must be exponentially stronger to keep going up. The cost per tier only grows multiplicativly so your power grows faster than the lower levels cheapen to you. If people have powers that lend themselves to subjugating the first one to reach a new tier can become a tyrant and live off taxes. If the dungeon gets too hard some form of this would become a necessity
