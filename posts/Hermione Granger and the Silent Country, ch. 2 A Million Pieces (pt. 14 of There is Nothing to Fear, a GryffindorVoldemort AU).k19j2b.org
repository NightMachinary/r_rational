The latest chapter, "A Million Pieces," can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/67848083][here]].

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

** I don't understand.

Last chapter they were terrified to have her set foot in brittain at all because she could be kidnapped and spirited away for diabolical purposes.

Now they are planning a semester there? And Minerva is fine with it, even though she herself can't go back for fear of being attacked by Riddle?

This makes absolutely no sense to me, I feel lost.

*** McGonagall isn't fine with this:

#+begin_quote
  McGonagall sighed and retrieved an envelope. It was thick and heavy and yellowish, and it sat there in her hands for a little while before she looked back at Hermione. “There is another matter, which will perhaps make all this moot. Your earlier request, to attend the Beauxbatons Delegation for the Triwizard Tournament, has been...reevaluated. And accepted,” she said, *as if it took great effort to force the words out.*

  [...]

  Hermione looked up, her face brighter than any lumos. “This is it, I'm really going!” Then the wheels of her brain began to turn and her smile fell apart at the edges, collapsing slowly into a frown. “Madame Maxime said it wasn't to be done, that I was too young. Why would---why would Laurent Octobre get involved in this?”

  “Politics,” McGonagall said, *with no small amount of venom*. “There will be no end of the photographs for La Lune, I am sure. Octobre was in the Secretariat for Foreign Affairs before, and I'm sure that he'd like them to...”
#+end_quote

Neither is Maxime, for that matter, but it isn't Maxime who gave the approval---it's a high-ranking government official (the meaning of his title isn't apparent, but Hermione knows who he is and wonders /why/ he got involved, not /how/), and McGonagall seems to think that he's trying to score a political win by setting up some kind of photo op.

There /may/ be more to this, however, because McGonagall mentions that Octobre used to be in Foreign Affairs, and the very last entry from the previous story, "Political Realities," includes a recommendation from France's "Black Room" (evidently some kind of intelligence department) to encourage particular diplomatic attitudes and actions with respect to Britain.

In either case, Hermione is being used for political purposes by people who don't care about her, and who have the influence to overrule the people who /do/---and Hermione, being fourteen, has too much tunnel vision to back away from the chance that she's been offered.

**** In the case that it's a bad idea I would expect Mcgonagall to say so, as Hermione's friend and mentor, and I would also expect Hermione to listen if she did. I could see her being overruled and someone else convincing Hermione to go behind her back, or just cutting her out of the loop entirely, but if M has any say and knows how dangerous Riddle is, she would try to sway Hermione not to go.

Did she not? It sure looked like she did. As much as she could without overtly setting herself against people with power over her, at least.

** Wow. Hermione with even more to prove than in canon is a force to be reckoned with.

I guess it's obviously the case that the age restrictions from canon aren't in place for this version of the Tournament? Is Hermione really puissant enough that she would be allowed to compete on merit, or is this just meddling by Riddle to get her to Britain?

I loved the "Adele Dazeem" reference.

I'm interested to know what the difference is between "Alchemy" and "Potions." The canon Potions courses are pretty much how I would describe alchemy.

Tom Riddle frowns at the suggestion of age restrictions! >:]

It's definitely meddling by /somebody/ (on SB, another theory is that the French intend for her to be a provocation).

I'll make sure to tell my beta reader! It was her idea.

Alchemy is an intersection between potions and transfiguration.
