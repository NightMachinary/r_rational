Hey, I remember a Royal Road story being posted here sometime last year about a deity who had to leave the plane of gods due to a war or something. He became a god of a tribe of orcs or elves and his center of power was a tree in an enchanted forest. Does anyone remeber this story? If so, a link would be very much appreciated.

** Here's another one featuring a tree: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/17173/bloom]]

Though I haven't read it yet and the description is pretty vague.
