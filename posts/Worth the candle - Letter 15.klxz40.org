Spoiler warning

I want to ask if the guard that raped Fenn goes unpunished.

I hope not, it would make me drop the novel, I hate when an author drops something like that and leaves it without a conclusion.


** WtC is, in large part, about trying to make power worth something when you /can't/ neatly counter the past traumas.

Singling out Fenn's rapist for revenge when she herself has other priorities? Her emotional wounds won't be neatly solved by a simple violent payback. Why should we be allowed to pretend otherwise? The story does address a different rape later on, in substantially more depth. But that later, more detailed rape-response is not "and now we've punished someone, so things are fixed."

Lots of stories have awful things happen, and then act like they can be neatly set right. But WtC isn't about un-breaking what's broken and un-scarring what's been scarred. WtC is all about the /other/ kind of getting past trauma.

That no-erasure attitude makes WtC more glum than I like at times... but also makes it meaningful and authentic.

Yeah, it could be frustrating that in this gamelike world, Fenn's unhappy past isn't reduced to a tidy kill-the-baddie quest. But that's key to WtC. In a genre full of "power = easy escapism," WtC lets me read the other side of it: "I have huge power, and I /still/ have real problems that power won't erase."

So inaction is something that makes it real for you? Then why are you reading this story and not a slice of live novel? There is all the inaction that you can wish.

It all boils down to justify why they let a rapist roam free and all the asinine reason that people have to try justify it.

**** This conversation would probably be more productive and enriching if you assumed good faith and didn't rephrase your opponents' points in the most uncharitable manner possible. That said, Joon's goal has always been to ascend to pseudo-divinity for the sake of healing the harms of Aerb, with death-of-baddies being ancillary to that and in some cases actively avoided. In fact, in later chapters, while the action continues, he goes out of his way to avoid solving problems by violence, even against people who certainly deserve some serious pain. There's still action--there's one hell of an extended duel sequence down the road--but there's also a growing recognition that he can't punch every problem to death, and that there's something unhealthy in rejoicing in the deaths of even genuinely bad people. If that's not your cup of tea, yes, you should probably avoid this story.

**** Joon isn't just letting evil happen. WtC, unlike a "slice of life", is showing Joon working towards power enough to fix everything that's wrong with the world. Then he can cure it all, from each individual unpunished crime to the billions being continually tortured in literal hell.

But WtC /doesn't/ let him line up his quests as perfect tidy cures for past suffering. Even the companion quests don't erase the bad days before. That's the key difference between WtC and the more trope-obedient stories it's deconstructing. Joon gets to gain unrealistic power, yes. He gets to be a huge hero. But he has to do realistic work to make that power and heroism emotionally fulfilling for himself and his people, with all his and their personal problems in the way.

Is the story flawed by Fenn mentioning her prison rape without making it a quest or focus? At most, only for not sneaking in a reminder to "rape is a Villain Signal" readers that in WtC, rape is just like other past suffering. It's something you build past, not something you tidily undo.

*** WtC is a story about story tropes. So I can kind of see how OP would think "hey, the story mentions a rapist, that's a Villain Signal, why aren't they doing something about it?"

But in real life, most rape victims don't want to be defined by the rape, and most rapists are the alarmingly typical product of screwed-up societies rather than distinctively evil cackling villains. And for Fenn's rape WtC mostly follows life, rather than tropes.

It didn't confuse me, unlike OP. But I could imagine a paragraph where Joon thought about a hypothetical revenge mission, both in terms of whether the DM means it as a quest hook and how Fenn would feel about it. Not because WtC sets us up to fetishize Fenn's rape as defining her - it doesn't, it's obviously way more concerned with her unhappy childhood among "proper" elves - but because there are other stories that would go that direction.

So why didn't AWales write in that paragraph? Maybe because "avenge a rape" is more of a trope in /films/ than in /games/. Personal revenge on random lowlifes who hurt your people? That's not a tabletop RPG thing. When you run a fantasy game, the party's Designated Villains are going to be people with interesting setting content - like the pureblood elves.

I don't think this is true, and it seems like a pretty un-nuanced take.

You seem to suggest that the only reasonable reaction to learning about tragic history like this is to immediately demonstrate and signal how much you care, but that's kind of making it all about yourself and taking control of the situation/recovery away from the victim.

It would be one thing if Fenn asked for help taking revenge or whatever, but frankly it seems like overstepping boundaries to suggest that the only valid response to having vulnerable information shared with you is to aggressively take revenge to demonstrate that you care.

Even making the suggestion runs the risk of opening up old wounds that Fenn might not want to be forced to confront.

********** Even if she wouldn't be against it, that's not really the question -- the question is what she actively wants.

There's a segment later in the story about how you might feel differently internally and externally about wanting people dead, and given the severity of the circumstances I'd say it's better to act in accordance with externally stated wishes and not take the risk by assuming internal ones and potentially being wrong.

When you assume someone's internal state to justify your choices like that, you're taking control away from them. That seems to me like something you don't want to do with victims.

--------------

You're quoting Chekhov's Gun.

My response to you would be that the story /does/ use the information -- the reveal (and ensuing discussion) serves to demonstrate that Fenn is making herself vulnerable to Joon (and trusts him), and beyond that it serves to inform her character and her attitude towards other events in the story going forwards.

The information is given in the story in service of character development and character relations, not to kick off a revenge arc. I wouldn't consider it an unfired gun at all.

She wants to take vengeance against the elves that wronged her, I assume that being raped is pretty high on the list of things to be angry about.

She is a person that killed a lot of people, I don't think that she is a weak victim, only that she got no form to retaliate.

I just feel that thinking that she just wants to forget it and do nothing about it feels like looking down on her, like she can only suffer without being able to do anything.

************ I thought his support was demonstrated pretty clearly.

Immediately after reading the letter Joon is depicted as weeping and needing time to get over the strong emotions he's feeling.

The focus on the child-solace is when he's speaking speaking with Amaryllis, with whom it would be inappropriate to talk about this with.

The following caps off the conversation with Mary:

#+begin_quote
  I know,” said Amaryllis. “And Fenn? Are you judging her?”

  “No,” I said. “I would tear apart the world for her.”
#+end_quote

When he does see Fenn again (the very next chapter), the very first thing Joon does is reassure her and demonstrate his continued support of her:

#+begin_quote
  When the month was up and the door to the time chamber was finally reopened, I rushed out and found Fenn. There were no surprises waiting for me this time, only a slightly anxious-looking half-elf. I'd reread her letter, the heavy one, just so that I would have it in mind, and the hug I wrapped her in reflected what I felt.

  She'd been right that none of what she'd told me was the sort of thing that normally pinged at my instincts, and that there was a bad kind of damage, when it came to what I found compelling, but I was already in love with her, and all I could think was that I wished nothing bad had ever happened to her. There was a small part of me wondering if this was all somehow my fault, if every bad thing in her life was just set up in order to manipulate me. I was still trying my best to just live my life without second-guessing though.

  Loyalty Increased: Fenn lvl 26!

  “You're crushing me,” Fenn whispered into my ear. I relaxed my grip on her. “No,” she said. “It was good, more crushing please.”

  So we had our moment of reunion, and then went away from the others so we could talk.

  “You don't hate me then?” asked Fenn.

  “No,” I murmured. I was still holding her.

  “Well, good,” said Fenn. “Good. I should have told you. It felt like there were just some things that I needed to dance around, and --”

  “I understand,” I said. “I wish you didn't have to go in there, or that we could take some time together, or ... something.”
#+end_quote

--------------

This seems to demonstrate pretty explicitly that he cares and still loves her.

The story leaves specific mentioning of the incident out because it's tactless -- mentioning it directly will just open wounds -- and seemed to me to do a pretty good job of showing how to show support for this kind of tragic event in someone's history.

The key quote imo is "I was already in love with her, and all I could think was that I wished nothing bad had ever happened to her. There was a small part of me wondering if this was all somehow my fault, if every bad thing in her life was just set up in order to manipulate me."

Yes, and Joon /doesn't like it/. He quite frequently thinks about all of the people he kills, and the moral implications. Notably, he very rarely sets out to kill someone; they usually provoke him first (trying to kill him, kidnapping Amy, etc.). Even if a person "deserves it", Joon isn't going around killing every single bad person on Aerb. He's not the Punisher, even if they have comparable body counts.

It is important because the mc is supposed to "fix" Aerb, and letting loose a rapist that he can end in half a chapter is jarring.

Remember the chapter where he attacks the DM because of how messed up Aerb is? But now he doesn't go after a rapist? That makes him look like a hypocrite, whining about the DM but doing nothing now.

It is funny how many people are trying to justify that the mc doesn't hunt down the rapist, why is that? Are they in favor of the rapist or are they fanboying the story and don't like when I point out these things?

The rapist can be killed in half a chapter and the other half can be about Fenn having a catharsis.

Edit:

I skimmed a few chapters and now I know why, Fenn dies, so the author wanted to put a lot of drama for her story, but didn't want to invest more chapters in her, after all he was going to kill her off.

***** I can't speak for anybody else, but it never occurred to me that they would hunt down the rapist. Snuffing him wouldn't un-rape Fenn, it would mostly be gratification for the reader to see our heroes slap around somebody who deserves it (and who couldn't fight back--it would seem like a rather superficial pleasure for the reader, no more than a revenge fantasy). The subject of rape does come up again, just FYI, and it's major and consequential. Along with Joon's hangups about sex. TBH I wish it would address both subjects a bit less.

However, supposing Joon did find and hurt the rapist, well, it would require minimal effort for him to actually hurt the guy. As a gesture to Fenn, it would be roughly equivalent to going miles out of your way to buy somebody penny candy. Maybe she'd enjoy it, but the deeper issue is the harm it did to her psychologically, and hurting the rapist would, again, not resolve that. Also if you read her "read in case Fenn dies" letter, we find that she was explicitly trying to be a kinder--and less vengeful--person at the time she died. A more meaningful resolution, in story terms, would be for Fenn to try and help other women the guard hurt. Murder-justice is cheap.

****** And wouldn't it help other woman if the rapist is no more?

Or should she wait for the rapist to act again so she can comfort his victim?

Your great solution is to help the victims of the guard, and not stop the guard from raping them in the first place? Are you serious? That is your solution? This convoluted plan just to not punish the guard?

Would you leave alive a band of bandits that kill and rape just so you fell better about not killing them? Even if letting them live would cost the lives of innocents?

Cheap justice is still justice. You are trying to convince me that letting a rapist go unpunished is a good thing, and i will never accept that.

You are trying to convince me that women that are raped should endure it, that they should live with it, and i will never accept that.

That you are trying to convince me of such things make me wonder what are you thinking, is it that difficult to say that rape should be punished? Is it that hard?

It doesn't matter what asinine arguments you try to explain why it is a good thing that a rapist goes unpunished, i will never accept that.

Edit: I'm a bit harsh, but I'm sick of people trying to downplay the rapist, to try to justify why he should go unpunished.

That saying something as simple as the rapist should be punished, and there being a bunch of people that is trying to convince me that it is fine to let him keep raping because some silly arguments, that the victim doesn't want the rapist to suffer, or that taking justice with your own hands is a bad thing in a basically lawless world compared to Earth.

******* I'm not trying to make an abstract argument about rape and justice, I'm trying to explain why it's not good for the story, qua story, to have Joon and company do this. It's simply hard to see how it could be written to be entertaining or compelling or take the characters in an interesting direction. At best you could have a one-paragraph aside along the lines of "also we had some downtime so we hunted down the guy who raped Fenn and threw him into the Gay Rape Demon exclusion zone and Fenn was very happy okay back to the story." Wronged woman gets powerful friends to avenge her is the literary equivalent of double-stuf Oreos.

But it seems no one sees it. The rapist was Poulus Cambria he was a soldier convicted for rape and send to zombieland that Mary killed.

So your argument that it is not interesting is moot, because the chapter was there from the start.

And a chapter killing a rapists is not compelling for you, for other people it may be.

Or are the flashback chapters that important? You can skip most of them without problem.

********* Are you talking about the one dude Joon teamed up with around chapter four who tried to get himself taken along on the soulcycle instead of Joon, only to have Mary decide he was a fink and shoot him? That wasn't about the rape; AW made his crime rape so they'd pause and go "wuh-oh," Mary being a (sort of) vulnerable young woman, but the chapter as a whole would work about as well if the guy had been a bank robber who otherwise acted identically.

Taking time out for rape justice for Fenn would have contributed little to her or Joon's character while harming the flow/pacing/structure of the story.

If that dude was Fenn's rapist and in the future we know for sure then it was intelligent of the author, if not then giving Fenn that backstory is plain dumb.

A good story doesn't leave things inconclusive.

And all those flashbacks that doesn't matter don't hurt the pacing of the story?

That it hurts the flow is your opinion, if all those flashbacks don't do it one chapter to kill the rapist won't either, if he is still alive.

The author spoke about Chekhov's gun:

"Chekhov's gun is a dramatic principle that states that every element in a story must be necessary, and irrelevant elements should be removed. Elements should not appear to make "false promises" by never coming into play"

So putting such a backstory without conclusion is a "false promise"

************* That you think the flashbacks irrelevant shows that you don't understand what the author is going for here. This isn't supposed to be a standard isekai, and Joon's past is entirely relevant to the world born out of his ideas. Even when the flashbacks aren't critical to understanding why thing are the way they are (as with the unicorn), they generally have a thematic tie-in to the current action.

EDIT: Yes, you dragged me back in after I said I would drop it, congrats. But seriously, this is the equivalent of, I don't know, asking why Taylor from Worm doesn't go save Africa from parasites and malaria. Yes, that would make sense, but it's not that kind of story.

******* You do remember they're on a quest to save all of Aerb, including trillions of people on the hells, a large number of which, I'll wager, are constantly being raped and worse? Sure, Juniper could've taken the time to go solve this one specific evil he knew about, but Fenn never asked it of him and they have bigger fish to fry. It seems like you think it's unforgivable of him not to go all white knight to get revenge for her when it's clear she didn't want it (she almost didn't even tell him) and he offered what she actually expected in return for her sharing: his full support and no condemnation.

Yes, rape is horrible and no rapist should be left unpunished, but when she didn't ask it of him, it's not his place to go all “tell me the name of this knave and I shall slay him!”.

Like I said before, the story still isn't over, it seems you already know of her death, but it's not impossible she might return. And even if she doesn't, it's not impossible that it might be addressed in another manner, for example (possible spoilers about content you might not have reached yet): Amaryllis currently has a great deal of power within Anglecynn, it wouldn't be impossible for her to discover where Fenn was arrested, which guards worked there back then and order some investigation into which of them were raping prisoners. Then have them sent to trial for their crimes. All of which would merit maybe a paragraph telling us that it happened in the background while Juniper was more preoccupied with saving the world.

******** Investigate? I'm pretty sure that Fenn knows exactly where she was prisoner and who the guard is.

It's not to go all white knight, it is really easy for him to do it, but he won't, that only makes him a hipocrite. He accused the DM of being responsible of all the evils of Aerb and doing nothing to fix it, but now he ignores this rapist when he can deliver justice.

That means he is not better than the DM, even after hearing something like that he can easily ignore it, like nothing happened, that only shows a lack of care.

It is impossible to not go into a rage after hearing it.

People misunderstand that the opposite of love is hatred, it is indifference.

So showing so little emotion for something of this magnitude only shows how little he cares.

So what if he cry's a bit? So what if he gives her a hug? A normal person that cares about someone you love wouldn't be able to keep this composed, he would imagine what she's been through without being able to keep calm.

But he accepts it so easily, if it would be me my stomach would be churning I would not be able to sleep and I would be imagining some scumbag defiling Fenn without her being able to do anything.

Imagine the MC of Goblin Slayer being composed after what he saw, just ignoring it and living his life like nothing happened.

That unbridled rage is much more real than this piss poor reaction.

Ultimately, it seems your position boils down to the fact that you can't accept anyone reacting to what she told him with anything but unbridled rage at the rapist, so I don't really see a point in arguing further. Just know that not everybody would react that way, some people (perhaps even most) would prioritize what the victim wants and what Fenn wanted he gave her.
