Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** What do you think of this power of limited precognition: at the expense of some energy/mana/whatever, a person would be able to look into their future self's timeline for an answer to a specific question. The questions asked must be something the "skipper" (tentative name, open to suggestions) would answer eventually anyway, so long as the answer is something that he or she would find out anyway, had she not had/used this power.

Caveats: the further into the future, the harder it is to answer a question. There is no guarantee that the answer you find out in the hypothetical future is correct, necessarily, just like in one's own life. And finally, it's useless to ask question that in order to be answered requires your death or severe injury.

So an illiterate shaman can't ask if P = NP or "when Winds of Winter will be released", but he can ask "is this stranger trustworthy" or "will Winds of Winter be released in the next month".

*** It sort of seems here like the specific formulation of the power isn't super relevant. What's important is that it lets you send messages back in time. So obviously you use this to abuse the stock market and once you're rich start anonymously introducing future tech/science breakthroughs in order to speed up advancement in those areas significantly.

Why? "Is this hallway boobytrapped?" seems like a perfectly valid question to me.

**** He said the skipper must eventually find out the answer anyway, without using the power. So if you ask "is this hallway boobytrapped", and your future self says /"OH GOD YES WHY OH WHY DID I DO THIS! AIEEEEEE!!"/ You will know it is booby trapped, but you will know that you will find out by triggering the traps anyway, because that's the only way your future self would have found out.

At least, that's how I interpreted it.

****** It's not exactly a single timeline. You can still make changes depending on the answer you get, but you can't change how you find out the answer at the future time you are queried.

So for example, I can query myself one week in the future: "Hey you, what are the winning lotto numbers?", and future me can just look them up online and tell me. I can then proceed to buy lotto tickets with those numbers, win the lotto, then proceed to look up the winning lotto numbers online and tell past me.

The reason this doesn't work for deaths/serious injuries is that if you query yourself 1 hour in the future: "Hey you, is this hallway boobytrapped", future you can indeed just walk into the hallway to find out, and can indeed tell you "ARGH YES ARGH!!". You can then proceed to make some changes, like maybe telling your party members not to follow you into this horrible horrible trap, but in the end, within the next hour, you *will* be forced to walk into the hallway to find out that it is booby trapped without using your power. Then you will be seriously injured/dead anyway, so that answer doesn't really help you.

It still helps your party members though, so I guess you can still technically munchkin if you're willing to make the sacrifice. But then, if you are willing to make the sacrifice anyway, you could just walk into that hallway like a normal person. No need for future querying. Your party members can see you get horribly maimed well enough without any fancy future sight.

******* I don't understand the difference. Why would one of those situations allow you to change the future but the other one compel you to follow a manifest destiny of death?

******** Both situations compel you to follow the destiny of determining the answer to current you's question.

In the lotto numbers situation, I am compelled, within the next week, to look up the winning lotto numbers online.

In the boobytrapped situation, I am compelled, within the next hour, to walk into the hallway to find out whether it is boobytrapped.

Essentially, if you ask yourself from T seconds in the future the answer to some question X, and future you derives the answer by executing some method Y, you will be compelled to execute method Y within the next T seconds. Everything else about the future can be changed, only that one event that originally led future you to the answer for question X cannot be changed.

********* Here's an alternative way to munchkin the boobytrapped hallway.

Ahead of you are two paths. One leads to certain death, and the other leads to survival. You ask the question "is the left hallway boobytrapped?". The answer is yes, so you go right and see through your survival that the left path is the boobytrap and the right path is the one that allows survival.

Is there any flaw in this situation as I present it?

PS I'm assuming the power works by giving only yes/no answers.

********** Huh, I'm not sure whether that would work. On one hand, it sounds like the method for determining which hallway is boobytrapped is the mundane method of walking into one. But on the other hand, the full method for finding out which hallway is boobytrapped uses your future knowledge. I mean, if I understood correctly, the proposed method is essentially this:

- Step 1: Ask which hallway is boobytrapped, left or right.
- Step 2: If left, go right. If right, go left.
- Step 3: See that the hallway you went into is not boobytrapped.

Seeing as step 1 is literally the usage of your future query ability, this isn't a mundane method of finding out which hallway is boobytrapped.

In order to work, I think you may have to resolve to walk into a specific one of the hallways regardless of the answers to your future queries, since intuitively, that's what the original-timeline-you would have to do.

*** What does the future self that answers my question remember happening when he asked the question I'm currently asking? If he did not get an answer, does that mean he knew the whole time that he's in a simulation whose only reality-affecting channel is his current message? If so, he may very well jump into the possible booby traps to gather information for his real self.

*********** Hm, yes, I was thinking along the lines of arbitrarily smart enemies attacking the current self with dangerous memes or ASI-style brainhacking messages, or bullshit mind magic. If the enemies are nearhumanbaselines, then yes, questions on gathering of objective information would work --- but then I really doubt that they would be able to brainwash the future self to the extent you're implying to begin with.
