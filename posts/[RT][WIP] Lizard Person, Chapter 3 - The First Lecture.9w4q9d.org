** u/adgnatum:
#+begin_quote
  I firmly believe that connection and mutual understanding are the solution to all problems.

#+begin_quote
  I used to think I should try to convince people to like me without resorting to telepathy, but it's hopeless.
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  Of course, that's not the main reason I'm here. There are currently only a couple dozen human telepaths on the planet, and I intend to dedicate much of my life to increasing that number.
#+end_quote

A nice combination of relatable and ambitious.

​

I bet she's right, and true understanding of the limits of telepathy will be a reassurance. I'm looking forward to seeing how that shakes out.

** As always, your thoughts are greatly appreciated. I ended up being quite busy this past month so it took a lot longer than expected.

Big thanks to confettibin for editing!

**** I think the best label might be speculative fiction, but that term is broad. It's contemporary with a hard sci-fi backbone.

** I'm not a big fan of this story, character and premise wise. Mostly because every time they casually mention alien presence and telepathy existence, I get a little voice in my head yelling: You are are giving me a time turner to help my sleeping problem?

Only in this case is: You are subjecting the world to mental influence of an alien whose nature you cannot fully understand or even block?

And this time it's worse because apparently all the telepath has to do is make body contact for a short while with a person. Diseases take longer to spread, if there is even a sliver or malice or alien intent in the process or mental sharing then human nature is basically FUCKED AS SHIT.

Never mind things like pathogens, which I understand you as author may have skipped since its boring/hurdle to bypass, or even personal body bacteria.

We are seeing here an alien invader who is given free reign and is the only expert in telepathy and defense against it. This is crazy. Imma keep read tho.

*** Thank you for this!

It's funny: in an earlier version, telepathy required no buildup at all, just "hello stranger, I'm speaking in your mind." It might have been simpler to shove the characters into freezing water rather than have them ease in.

A few points (I'm not trying to argue, since any failure to communicate/explore these is entirely my fault):

- First is the claim that in telepathy, defense trumps offense. It's something everyone in the story knows by now, and is generally assumed to be true. If you read chapter 1 before chapter 2 was posted, I hadn't stated this explicitly. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9khn3e/rtwip_lizard_person_chapter_2_lies/e6zlli8/?context=3][Additions to ch1 here.]]
- The fact that it spreads so quickly is a moderate point in favor of Rose and/or claims that defense trumps offense. The world does not appear to have been taken over, and telepathy has been around for 7 years. This thing was never in a box to begin with.
- Alien existence is a bit casual after a couple years. For most people, it affects nothing in day-to-day life.
- There are human telepathy experts (but they're obviously compromised, so that's weak)
- Rose has invested a /lot/ of effort in PR (I really should have described the political climate in more detail)
- Pathogens are plotted away in the same manner as many other things. Rose isn't some random alien.

None of the above points are hard evidence, so no paranoid person should be deeply satisfied. But there's a limit to paranoia. You could always barricade yourself from everyone else, but the physical contact requirement is /obviously/ a lie to disguise the true limits of the power. If everyone on the planet is assumed compromised, what are you supposed to do?

I don't want to get in the habit of putting new information in chapters after posting, but I also don't want to address things after they are most relevant. The correct answer is, unfortunately, to get things right the first time.

** I enjoy reading this, but new installments dribble out too infrequently for me to stay as engaged as it would otherwise deserve.

*** Thank you!

I'm trying to improve my process, which for chapters 2 and 3 involved writing about twice as many scenes as appeared in the final pieces.
