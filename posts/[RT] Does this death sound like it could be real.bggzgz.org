** I mean...it would definitely be one of the most ridiculous things I've read in the paper. I'm fairly sure there is no way in hell that they would write that and that the coroner would assume they were strangled by someone using their arms and wouldn't jump to the assumption that someone used their thighs.

** In 2013 in Oklahoma, a man and his adult stepson were doing some drinking when the son got the idea in his head that he should give his dad an atomic wedgie. The underwear became wrapped around his stepfather's throat, and he strangled to death before anything could be done. The stepson was sent to jail for manslaughter, even though he claims the whole thing was an accident.

The lesson here is that there is no death so stupid or implausible that someone hasn't died of it.

In short, yes, I'd believe it if I read that on the paper.

*** While I agree that it is a possible way for someone to die I'm not sure that there is a realistic way for a coroner to identify it as a cause of death

** I mean, you probably couldn't do it like a strong woman crushes watermelons with her thighs.

However a leg triangle choke looks dirty and will cut off the blood flow to a brain in under a minute. You would just need to keep it up for about ten minutes till some brain cells die of ischemia and you should be set. Although there is a good chance anything less that like twenty minutes has a chance of the person being ending up in a hospital on life support. Their brain will be mush. But they could die slowly over the course of years in a nursing home. Which is brutal as hell tbh

** I have no trouble believing that somone got strangled between someone elses thighs. Though it seems like it'd be hard to actually kill somone that way.

However I'd find it weird for that detail to make it into the paper unless it had come out during the trial, as it seems a bit overly specific for what I'd expect a coroner to actually be able to determine from an autopsy (I'd expect "strangulation with a large unknown object", to be more along the lines of what goes on the report) and while I'm not sure how true it really is cop shows have trained me to expect the police to avoid leaking details like that to the press during the investigation as a means of verifying potentially false confessions and to avoid revealing to any suspects how much they really know.
