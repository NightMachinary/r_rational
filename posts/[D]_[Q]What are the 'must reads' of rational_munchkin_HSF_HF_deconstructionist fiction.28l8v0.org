I've been curious for a while now on this, so I'm going to see what the community here has to say about it. What are the fics that 'everyone' has read, or has to read? What is the best of the genre? Contribute a list of 5-10 and see how they compare.


** I think I'd really only consider [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][/Luminosity/]] and [[http://www.hpmor.com][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]] to be in "the canon". Most people have read [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][/Worm/]], but it's sort of adjacent to the subgenre instead of really in it.

Other than that ... maybe [[http://us.macmillan.com/book.aspx?isbn=9781429983624][The World of Null-A]]? Maybe some of the stuff [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Ealexanderwales][I've written]]? I tried to do "sort - top all time" for this subreddit, but that didn't offer much in the way of illumination.

Edit: I only read half the title.

*Munchkin*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor][The Two Year Emperor]]

Categorizing works is hard, especially when the works aren't written with that categorization in mind. Hard science fiction and hard fantasy are terrible about this, especially when so many people seem to put /A Song of Ice and Fire/ into the "hard fantasy" category when the rules for its magic are /completely unknown to the reader/. With that said:

*HF/HSF*

- /The Mars Trilogy/ by Kim Stanley Robinson
- /Blindsight/ by Peter Watts
- Most things by Greg Egan
- /Mistborn/ by Brandon Sanderson (and many of his other books)

*Deconstructionist*

- /Watchmen/
- /Goblins/ the +(no longer updated)+ webcomic
- /What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, And The American Way?/

I may go back and edit this after giving it some more thought.

Trying to work out why I agree with you - I think there's a distinction between "rational fiction" and "rationalist fiction". The former is defined by the four mandatory points in the sidebar; the latter /adds/ explicitly rationalist themes to a rational structure through real techniques and approaches (ie the bonus points in the sidebar).

Basically, the first points together form an uncommon but known style; while difficult to pull off well most writers could at least make an attempt if they wanted to. The latter, like very hard SF set on a spacecraft, won't work /at all/ without an unusual amount of expertise backing it up - and since readers can try the techniques at home, assuming your readers aren't experts either won't help.

So the (acknowledged) "rationalist canon" is basically limited to /HPMoR/, /Luminosity/, and /The World of Null-A/.

One written under a nom de keyboard advertising a rationality community (by it's founder), one by a member of that community, and the lesser-known novel by a brilliant author of SF. Oh, and chapter one opens:

#+begin_quote
  Common sense, do what it will, cannot avoid being surprised occasionally. The object of science is to spare it this emotion and create mental habits which shall be in such close accord with the habits of the world as to secure that nothing shall be unexpected.
#+end_quote

The challenge of finding more candidates was set out [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/][five years ago]], and I don't know of anything convincing that's been found.

**** I can definitely see the resemblance. I loved the first book in that series, but remember feeling more and more let down as I went on until eventually I stopped. I think part of the essential problem of munchkinism is that eventually you break the world wide open and change everything, which most authors don't seem willing to do. But I must have read those books back in the 90s, so maybe I'm getting some of the details wrong.

[[http://belltower.dreamwidth.org/8579.html][Effulgence]] is basically (a long, indulgent examination of) what you get. If the best bits of it were edited down into a single, short arc (and the confusion of Bellas collapsed down a bit), it'd be a wonderful thing to throw in the face of any SF author who thinks conflict requires mortality, scarcity, etc.

****** I think that's about where I stopped reading the first time, too. I tried again, much later, though: it does get way, way better.

Importantly, Bella's agency /increases/ exponentially over the course of the books, which feels (if you haven't experienced this in a book before) a bit like a series of weights you didn't know were there, being lifted off your chest one by one. It's an addictive feeling.

There are still some narrative flow problems; the one that stood out most to me at the time is that, for every chapter where the protagonists actually /do/ a thing, three chapters are spent with them /meeting and planning/ to do that thing. While this is likely realistic for motivated rationalists, it doesn't make for compelling prose. But the story is still told well, and it's a good story.

**** After having been reminded about it, I think I'd add in the /Wizardry/ series by Rick Cook, which has the distinction of actually having been published - see the other comments. Beyond that ... it's possible that either [[http://darthsanddroids.net/][Darths and Droids]] or [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=612][DM of the Rings]] would qualify, though I'm not a hundred percent sure on that, and both are rather more hemmed in by a literal DM.

I have no idea whether /The Two Year Emperor/ was published under another name, but I sort of doubt it - I've been following that one since chapter three, and so far as I know it's always been there.

***** [Author of The Two Year Emperor here]

First off, thanks so much for including it...I'm flattered. And yes, not breaking the world is a problem. I've been having to deal with that for dozens of chapters now. I'm fairly satisfied with my solution but YMMV.

No, it never appeared anywhere else. Although <shameless plug>I do have a spinoff novelette over on [[http://greendogpress.blogspot.com/][GreenDogPress]]</shameless plug>, being sold for $1. (It's my MVP to see if people will pay for my writing. If so, I'll do more.)

I read and loved the Wizardry series as a kid (although the first book was definitely the strongest; he clearly wasn't expecting to write sequels and didn't leave himself a lot of outs, so the others had a "um...look! magic thingy!" feel).

The biggest influence on 2YE, however, was The Guardians of the Flame series by Joel Rosenberg. Fun series; a group of D&D players are translated into the game as their characters. They start off fighting to get home and then run into some difficulties: does the guy with muscular dystrophy want to go back, or does he want to stay a badass berserker dwarf? Can the team walk away from the anti-slavery fight they accidentally started? And so on. The only real Munchkinism is that their wizard happens to be a civil engineer so...yeah.

In a similar vein is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Stargard#The_Cross_Time_Engineer][The Cross Time Engineer]] and its sequels, by Leo Frankowski. An engineer gets sent back in time to 1231, just before the Mongol invasion of Poland. He's got 9 years to gain enough influence that he can gear up Poland and its environs to hold off one of the greatest armies in history.

***** Must be my history error instead, hopefully I'll figure out where I left it off.

And darn it appears I've read everything that's in internet form then, does munchkin really only apply to DnD crossovers though, I thought it could be min maxing in anything, say learning the best spells in Harry Potter and finding the in universe way to min max, kinda like Natural 20 but Milo can't even use in universe spells so

I'll throw in [[http://www.erfworld.com/book-1-archive/?px=%2F005.jpg][Erfworld]] for being similiar to Two Year Emperor (in that someone is teleported in).

**** Why not make one for popular rational fiction available for free online? It could be invaluable for those just starting to become interested in the genre our hubble subreddit has been hoping to build up over time.

Also having events effectively celebrating our communities best contributions so far and reflecting on such just sounds like a good idea in general whenever we add new works to this ever growing list. I know I would thoroughly enjoy it.

Not to mention that by having such highly-lauded recommendations at the forefront of our subreddit for every new visitors to see could spark the kind of interest that'll motivate and inspire the next great authors of rational fiction to add to the pool of works that this community should have the chance to look forward to now and into the future.

So yes, we should totally try something like that, that would be awesome.
