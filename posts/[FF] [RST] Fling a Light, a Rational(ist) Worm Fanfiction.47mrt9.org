** A big thank you to Anderkent, who caught the fact that I somehow managed to misspell the /title/ and informed me posthaste.

** The plan sound excellent, even if a bit simple. The economy parts also sound good, though my lack of knowledge prevents me from saying if any of it's true.

The human behavior judging is laid a little to thick, and there is no reason for Taylor to stay in public school, a private tutor or private schooling can be easily acquired with portal dosh.

When can we expect more?

I don't think she's out to her father, and she'd have to explain the money if she made that change.

*** My writing tends to be a bit erratic, so I don't really know for sure. I'd like to update once a week, but that might be wishful thinking.

The human behaviour judging is just me trying and failing to imitate Terry Pratchett's voice. So far, the times I've improved the most have been my efforts to copy people, so I've been doing it more often. Taylor is still in public school because, as Anderkent mentioned below, she isn't out to her father yet. Actually, she doesn't have any "portal dosh" yet, either, since she isn't due to sign on with Appalachia-North until Thursday, and 1.02 took place on Wednesday.

** I liked the first two chapters. The writing's okay, the somewhat uncharitable portrayal of corporate leaders doesn't strain suspension of disbelief too badly; taylor's still likeable.

Gotta get more into the plot to really judge the story, but it's a good start!

** I read something similar on spacebattles, but it started after she and accord had already set up the train stations.

Is this related?

*** Yes. It's a rewrite, actually, though the plot is going to be somewhat different.

** I liked it. Especially the commentary on homo sapiens. I look forward to Tesseract's rapid rise. Not sure if I fully understand her powers. Do the portals exist forever after she creates them? Is effort on her part needed to maintain them or to destroy them? If equipped with a space suit can she portal to M31 in Andromeda for instance? Is travel through portal instantaneous or light speed limited?

*** Wow, you hit on a lot of the important details, there. Her power will be elaborated on over the course of the story, naturally.

**** Thanks. Tesseract reminds me of the kind of person I wish I had been in my teens if only I had learned to ask the right questions. But despite all the books I read, I never quite managed to progress from sapiens to sapiens sapiens in modes of thought. Hit a cord there. Speaking of portals, one thing that bothered me about the video game Portal is the apparent violation of conservation of energy, such as if falling through a portal on the floor can transport you to a portal at a higher elevation where is the potential energy coming from. I am not saying that Tesseract's portals should or should not work that way, but it seemed overpowered in the sense that a portal powered super villain could evacuate all of Earth's atmosphere into space if energy conservation wasn't imposed...

***** That's another important detail, yes. The explanation I'm going with that is that sending an object through a portal either releases or consumes energy, depending on relative potential energy. The shard handles all of that, though, soaking up waste heat for the former and providing the necessary input for the latter.

Your point stands as far as Taylor being able to destroy the world, but that's canon for Doormaker anyway.

2 chapters since August though, is this going to be really slow?
