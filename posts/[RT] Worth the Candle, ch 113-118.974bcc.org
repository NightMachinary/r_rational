** Some thoughts:

- Fenn was my favourite character for the majority of the story and i'm terribly sad to see her go but, presuming she actually remains dead (at least for a reasonable portion of the story), i'm happy AW is willing to kill off major characters. I personally love the tension added to a story when there's a genuine risk of character death.

- I thought the break up scene was beautifully done; i was left with this kind of aching sense of loss. For me personally the death scene following right on top of that the chapter after didn't give me enough breathing room and meant Fenn's passing didn't hit as hard as perhaps i would have liked. I'm curious if others felt similarly because i predict i may have just been an outlier here.

- I guess we're going to get an opportunity to see how Joon's developed as a person as we compare how he deals with the loss of Fenn versus how he handled Arthur's death. I wonder if he'll confront Bethel, seeing as her presence would have made Fenn's death less likely.

- Fenn's death occuring immediately post-break up is no doubt going to give Amaryliss plenty of narrative theory thoughts to chew on.

- Joon leveling up has just gotten a lot more dangerous. If he levels up post combat and amaryliss is incapacitated then he's in trouble.

- Loved Valenica's mindgames with the fake breakdown; Devil & Demon Valencia is one of my very favourite parts of this story. I have a massive soft spot for Valencia the character too; the kind of naked vulnerability she showed when Joon was doubting her is very endearing. It's not hard for me to see how she's 'Joonbait'.

- There's a lot of appreciation on this subreddit for when a story goes the extra yard to make the worldbuilding or the plot especially real and true to life, and this story does that, but one of the ways it sets itself apart is how it puts this same attention to detail in making the characters real. One extremely innocuous example from the latest chapters: Fenn saying she may need to leave the group for a while, putting some physical space between her and Juniper, after therapy has broken down and the break up's in progress. The next day Joon narrates in passing that it looks like she decided to stay. This kind of small detail makes everything so /real/ to me. Like, most other stories would never have Fenn mention something like that to begin with unless it was set up for her /actually/ leaving, yet that sequence of events is exactly the sort of thing someone might do during a break up - either overreact in the moment or really try to hammer in to the other person how you feel, wielding this big emotive club saying 'yes, i feel strongly enough about this to do /that/', but come the next day not actually follow through or even have ever been particularly likely to. The story is littered with details like this and in the same way that digressions about dragons effecting the commercial airline market make the /world feel real/ it's these little character moments that make the /people feel real/.

I really appreciated the breakup scene, too -- though I don't think I got hit with the sense of loss just then. I remember fixating on Fenn pouring her heart out, then inner monologue "I have so much I want to say... *I stayed silent.*" And my main emotional reaction to that was just frustration with Joon. I figured it'd play out and get resolved, comfortably, and probably soon.

At the end of 118, that feeling of loss you mention - it caught up with me pretty hard.

** These chapters hit pretty hard, and were pretty sad. I was especially struck by Valencia's comment that Fenn was the only party member - Jun included - who wouldn't be able to bring herself to kill Jun even to save the world, and how that contrasted with Jun's poison-treatment triage leaving Fenn for last.

Kind of a depressing end for the woman who apparently valued Jun's life more than Jun himself did.

  Jun's poison-treatment triage leaving Fenn for last
#+end_quote

In fairness to Juniper's triage prioritization, after treating Solace, their healer, he seemed to have worked on each of them based in large part on the order in which they succumbed to the poison. Fenn was the last one standing and fighting, so in combination with her luck, Juniper probably guessed that she had been the least-affected, and thus was in the least danger.

In hindsight, this had already resulted in Fenn being the last one carried out of the danger zone, giving her potentially greater exposure, and Juniper did not take a moment to reconsider that.

But yes, leaving Fenn for last in both the evacuation and the treatment does seem to contrast with her views.

** Crackpot theory time: Val killed Fenn

#+begin_quote
  Valencia swooped forward and took the crown from Solace's head, then placed it firmly on Amaryllis', standing back slightly and giving every appearance of counting to herself. I couldn't see her face, but she was radiating tension. After a few moments of the crown of thorns being in place, she took it from Amaryllis' head and placed it on Grak's. *Valencia glanced at Fenn, just for a moment, then back to Grak.*
#+end_quote

Devil-inhabitted-Val certainly sees something in that glance, and I think we can assume that she either knows at that point that Fenn is dead, or that Fenn isn't going to make it, and goes on treating Grak.

Did Val, who could read "Blue Fields nuke", really fail to predict that their enemies would split so lopsidedly, and, explicitly when mentioning scenarios, fail to see that one half would be willing to turn on and kill the other half right there?

It is conceivable that +the Simurgh+ Val arranged the breakup between Joon and Fenn in such a way that Joon would triage Fenn to last priority, and kept Bethel away so that the group would be at a disadvantage which could be directed to her own ends on the battlefield.

I could see if she helped arrange the breakup so that she could swoop in as the rebound. I could see if she gave less attention to Fenn in the heat of combat because she doesn't like her so much.

But it's way too much to think that she planned out her death via getting her opponents to do it 24 hours in advance. It's just way too chaotic in a fight for her to try and rely on that.

What exactly did Valencia see to know something was up? She seems to just blurt the warning out. Once she identifies it's poison, why does she only pass her crown to Juniper? During the group's preparations, why is she intent on downplaying the need to prepare for an attack?

Hmm... A poison that corrodes the soul... Sort of seems like the kind of thing Fallahtehr would've been interested in. O'kald probably just had some laying around though... Hey Valencia sure is being helpful, grabbing Amaryllis and handing her off to Juniper... Without going back to pick up Fenn...?

Oh.

  “For years,” Valencia said, “For years,” she said again, between breaths. “I was theirs for /years/ and I don't, I can't.” Tears were streaming down her face.

Maybe eating a thousand demons is a bad idea?

Edit:\\
From Chapter 102:

#+begin_quote
  Even with a lesser devil like this one, it was sometimes hard to find herself in the mix. The devil was dead, taken apart into component pieces, but those pieces were a part of her, augmenting her thoughts and, to some extent, feelings. She had been working hard, with Mary's help, both to become more of herself, so there was less for the devils to overwhelm, and to keep from reaching into that well of understanding just because it was there. She tried to think about the devils as voices, independent characters, but that wasn't really true. They were dead, and she was simply using their skills or knowledge. It was easier to think of them as separate, so that she could say it was a demon telling her how to kill everyone in the room, rather than her own thought that she wouldn't have had without the demon in her.

Luck isn't really well defined, so if we assume that it works by a principle of warning you when your worldline would collapse to the point of inevitable harm/death/other negative consequences, then at the point of it triggering they would be either soon nuked to oblivion (where she dies) or it would end up in an inevitable no-stops-pulled confrontation (looking at O'kald's tenacity I don't imagine they could have avoided this however they tried) where Fenn would end up getting neglected in triage due to the falling out or generally being to low on Joon's list of priorities (where she, again, dies). And hence the luck already did trigger back then, when Joon's decision to stay made this inevitable.

Nothing concrete here to prop this up, given how luck is underexplained, but just some food for thought.

** Holy fuck, that got intense. Moreover, if this took more than five minutes, Fenn is in one of the hells (assuming the soul poison wasn't deep enough to destroy her soul entirely). Come to think of it, I'm rather unclear as to how the hells work. We know there are different hells, with the higher numbers being deeper and worse. But what determines which hell you go to? My prior assumption had been that you start off at the first hell, and every time you die you go a level lower, but that doesn't seem to be the case, looking at the details in these chapters regarding the hells.

Regardless, given that Joon just saw recently how bad the hells really were through the infernoscope, it seems quite likely that Fenn's presence in the hells will be discussed. I can't see Joon leaving his ex girlfriend trapped in the hells. Valencia can make her time there more bearable, but not by that much. Joon's quest to destroy the hells may become quite a bit more urgent. Killing literally all of the demons and devils would be a start, but I'm not sure Valencia is up to that yet. If we've been told how many there are, I don't remember it, but it's got to be in the billions at least. A way to enter and leave hell would be an important step, but I'm not clear enough on the metaphysics of Aerb to even speculate as to whether that's possible.

Well, I'll speculate a little. Valencia could act as a gateway between world, potentially. If her tendrils can grab onto the souls of non-infernals, she could pull them up. And we know she can avoid chewing them up, since she did so with the Locus. But the locus entered willingly, and the only evidence we have that she might be able to grab human souls is that one ability she has.

***** There are two souls, or two parts to the soul, I'm not sure which. From chapter 67:

#+begin_quote
  “The term ‘soul' is imprecise,” said Fallatehr. “You likely think of it as a small white thing pulled from the heart or head after death?” He gestured first at his temple, then at his chest. “That is the anima exa, a physical manifestation of the soul, unique to the mortal species, but not synonymous with the anima ipsa.”

  “But the soul can be extinguished,” I said. “And as far as I can tell, that has no bearing on the bones themselves.”

  “The anima exa can be extinguished,” said Fallatehr. “And in fact, nothing in the world can prevent that, so far as is known to me. That has little bearing on the anima ipsa.”

  I frowned at that. “Naively, that doesn't make sense. You're saying that the soul continues to exist in the bones, regardless of whether someone goes to hell?”

  “No,” said Fallatehr. “What I am saying is that by every method I have been able to use, the soul continues to be accessible well after death, even for those confirmed by infernoscope to have passed into the afterlife.”

  I heard movement from behind me. “If that were true --” Amaryllis began.

  “It is,” said Fallatehr.

  “There would be metaphysical implications of that,” said Amaryllis. “If the souls of those in hell could be manipulated by means on Aerb we --”

  “They cannot,” said Fallatehr.

  “Why not?” asked Amaryllis.

  “The principle of planar disjunction,” said Fallatehr. “It was the talk of the Guild of the Essential Soul, prior to the subjugation and death of ninety percent of its members when Manifest's exclusion zone was created.” He seemed slightly wistful for a moment. “Obviously I had no ability to conduct novel research on planar disjunction from within Amoureux, and I was not allowed the courtesy of taking a copy of the relevant studies into the penitentiary, but all available evidence pointed to the fact that the soul was, in fact, incapable of crossing the planar boundary.” He waved his hand. “Much of this is tangential to the subject at hand.”

  “Har har,” I said, raising my deformed hand slightly.

  “We might think of the bones as intermediaries,” said Fallatehr. “If the soul is a complicated book of exceptional length, the bones are men who study that book and give answers to those who seek them. Each has a deep connection to the soul, and is conversant on its own area.”

  “But when you burn a bone, you affect the soul,” I said. “So it wouldn't seem like a very good metaphor to me.”

  “Metaphors are rarely good,” said Fallatehr with a shrug. “We -- I say we, but there are by your accounting few left alive who might have given me a proper conversation on the subject -- don't understand precisely what happens when bone magic is used. It appears to affect both donor and recipient at the level of the soul, with other effects as a result of that, but the actual mechanism is opaque, despite the numerous tests we've done.”
#+end_quote

It's always seemed to me that the "anima exa" is the part that gets collected and used for fueling motorcycles and the like, and the "anima ipsa" is the part that goes to the hells. Or that, because the "soul" can't cross planar boundaries, maybe the anima ipsa already exists on another plane.

**** I thought about addressing this idea, but I didn't end up doing it. I don't think this is the case, for various reasons:

1. Aerb doesn't seem like that type of world to me, where you get something that in some way correlates with what you deserve, even if in reality nobody deserves hell. Aerb, while not universally shitty, just doesn't seem to be the sort of place with even that level of fairness.

2. This implies a fundamentally true "Good" and "Evil" baked into the universe. There is admittedly some evidence for this, given the effect in the white tower, but I'm not sure we can conclude yet that this is a universal force rather than a mental effect that uses one particular person's form of morality. That said, a determinant for who goes to hell based on a morality that Joon or most readers wouldn't agree with, for example with soul magic being inherently evil like the tower seemed to think, is probably the most interesting form of a morality based hell sorting. I've toyed with the idea of a campaign based on that idea in the past, where good and evil are fundamental forces of the universe but don't necessarily align with what I or the players see as right and wrong.

3. Mary said that the first few levels of hell weren't much worse than the island the story started on. It seems worth living under those conditions. People tend to think of themselves as good, so if there was the belief that if you're a good person you don't suffer that much, I'm not sure soul burning would be as universally considered the right thing to do as it is; even shitty people would rationalize why they're actually a good person and would be on one of the first levels.

** OK so I have a question about the nature of threat confrontation. Heshnel said after Uther went missing, his followers stopped the rising threats but only after heavy losses. But how heavy are we talking? It sounded like the group facing the threats were small, powerful groups of Uther's people so the losses would be relatively small too. Dozens, maybe low hundreds in terms of lost members or family/loved ones but nothing in the grand scheme of things right?

Yet if the scale and number of threats are really that bad, shouldn't this be a unified, planet-wide effort with every major government setting things aside to deal with this rather than a small group? Joon and Uther are powerful, but not as powerful as an entire organization since individual power can only go so far. They've very nearly lost fights when they go up against other small groups like this one, Larkspur, the gold mage etc. Imagine if they were facing 20 Bellads, 50 mages of all types with a support staff of hundreds, there'd be no winning in a fight there, only retreat. Equally, such a large force should do better against the rising threats.

The thing is, the manner of threats Joon and Uther typically face are like DND party sized things, enemy parties, BBEG, giant monsters, etc, never entire militaries because those types of confrontations are narratively difficult and less dramatic and personal than the party sized stuff. But if you were optimally trying to face some insane apocalyptic threat, why throw dozens at it and hope when you could throw thousands? I imagine an international special forces organization with a strength in the tens of thousands should be created to deal with this stuff.

**** People like Vervain and the rest of Uther's knights were probably unique in the same way Uther was since they gained power proportional to him. But guys like Everett? He isn't one of a kind. He could be a fantastically intelligent and talented individual, but those kinds of people are commonplace enough even in our world. Even if he were the 1 in a million type, there'd be 17,000 others like him.

Skill, intelligence and talent can't be as irreplaceable as your making it out to be, it doesn't make sense for it to be that unique a commodity.

Do you mean that because certain threats aren't threats that can be physically confronted with an army? Like a guy in a room? Or do you mean meaningless because the loss of so much high level talent would make it Pyrrhic?

***** Sorry I was unclear. A couple points:

- Everett was one of Uther's Knights, this is mentioned a couple places.

- Furthermore, Everett discovered a form of immortality with some limits; if he wasn't exceptional there would be an increasing number of skin mages using it. Hell, a lot of people would become skin mages if there's a chance at immortality. 17k people a generation over 20 generations would mean that there would be 340k immortal skin wizards; far more if you count the fact that population is slowly declining and used to be 20 billion. It's improbable that they could keep a secret that big.

Fallatehr studied the soul for centuries, and only made it up to 180 skill. Dwarves and Humans are at least 2/5ths, probably more, of the total population. Members of the shorter lived races wouldn't have the opportunity, and Fenn said most elves would make shit scientists. Juniper is a mage of "some skill" at a paltry 24. Fenn was the best Archer in a major city with a handicap at around 50 (I believe).

I think a reasonable conclusion is that gaining power isn't very easy for NPCs on Aerb. If that's true, than 1 in a million is probably too low a guess on their relative rarity. 1 in 100 million might be closer, in which case you're talking about a relatively close knit community of several hundred to a few thousand. Deaths would be felt intensely.

- If top tier talent is very rare, then you lose a couple things. You lose training, combine that with a declining population, and the bench of top tier talent is probably much more shallow than when Arthur left for good. With population decline, major events, and exclusions, they've proabably lost more than 1/4 of their pool.

- Additionally, you lose an economic incentive to research top tier magic. Making a cheap password locked tattoo and selling the plans would probably make more money than researching a Gem magic spell that had 100 times more dense particles but required 10 times the mental fortitude. However, the dense beams would make it easier to understand particle physics.

- Militarily there might be threats that are too esoteric to defeat with thousands of mooks or even an army of low level wizards. An army of creatures made entirely of energy; fifth dimensional invaders; the soul magic version of grey goo; creatures made out of the void; wizards that could summon antimatter.... Only the first and the last could be countered with an army of low level wizards (including revision mages), and the last it would be a roll of the dice.

****** Woops.

Anyway, everything you're saying about the rarity of talent seems right, the lack of tens of thousands of powerful people running around is evidence enough. But that makes no sense to me.

Here's my model of how the universe operates; presumably the people of Aerb follow a bell curve of talent and skill similar to our own. People like Fallatehr or Everett (But not quite Everett since he has that insurmountable knack bonus) are at the extreme end of the curve right? Let's go with the 1 in 100 million number, that should still mean there should be more people a step below them that are 1 in 90 million. There should be people half as good but far more common since the relationship between skill and talent and occurrence isn't linear, i.e there should be far more than double the number of people half as good.

And this is what I mean by throwing thousands. Throwing thousands of nameless mooks and redshirts against those types of enemies might literally accomplish nothing, but a force of even hundreds of people almost as good as the absolute top tier should be far more powerful than that small group of top tier.

For extreme talent like Fallatehr to exist and to not have anyone appreciably near them in skill would mean the bell curve must be heavily skewed towards the middle with Fal and pals being extreme statistical anomalies, and that makes no sense to me. For talent to be /this/ unique, it tells me there must be some kind of meta that arbitrarily limits the number of powerful people for narrative reasons. I know there's Uther the Chosen One, but ordinary powerful people managed to put down the remaining threats when he left, albeit at great cost.

This model is probably fundamentally wrong somehow, but I feel like the people of Aerb should have these threats in the bag. Half a dozen world ending threats have been mentioned, but even if there were a hundred, with 17 billion people working the problem, I can't see how they lose when considering the talent they should have.

In one story popular on this sub, Mother of Learning, one of the reasons for why powerful individuals aren't more common is because the people at the top tend to hoard their lore rather than sharing it and teaching capable people freely. There's nothing special keeping the number of powerful individuals down except societal reasons. I wonder if a similar principle is at play in this story.

Finally, I feel like the response to these threats are woefully inadequate and a consequence of the nature of threats on Aerb. There's no doubt in my mind that the nations of Aerb if they really tried could deal with many of the exclusion zones themselves, but simply don't try because the threats are bottled up, not pressing and would be too costly to attempt. I don't understand the blaise nature of governments when there's literally only 2 years left in the library. It's like their all just waiting for someone else to fix their problems.

******* I've typed and rewritten this post a couple of times; it's a good thinking exercise.

First off I think we have to assume that most of the threats mentioned are so esoteric, throwing waves of mooks at them would be useless. In many cases, it could make the threat worse, like Manifest or the Necrotic Zone. That said, artillery probably does exist, and many of the various exclusions could probably be flattened. Delores Finch or Manifest are prime examples.

What you're saying makes sense; the hex is huge with a lot of diversity. Land that has supported 20 billion people and now has 5 billion people should have a lot of resources to throw at any problem; especially since it's relatively industrialized. Why does Aerb suck at producing high powered individuals when the potential is there? I can think of a couple answers, but I'm not super-convinced by them.

- Arthur had a completely different mode of thinking. If you read old fantasy, /The Dragon and the George/ has several examples of puzzles that a Medieval knight would find impossible to solve just because they grew up to become a Medieval knight. When they lost Arthur (and Vervain), they didn't just lose his power, they lost his ability to unconventionally solve problems and his metagaming ability. They had to do things the stupid power heavy way.

- Power comes from research, research comes from centers of learning, and centers of learning come from areas of high population. But too much power means an exclusion. It could be that every time there's a Silicon Valley of Aerb, someone invents an exclusion worthy magic. The exclusion worthy magic has probably killed most of the city, thus preventing a lot of people from reaching their full power. We know this happened to Pendelham (city of flesh), Silmar (necrotic field city), and Lankwon (capital of the Second Empire).

- Researchers can't stand on the shoulders of giants, because the DM imprisons those giants. 6 of the 13 Horrors to slay seem to be people who researched new magics.

- Almost no one else in the world actually gets to increase their primary stats.

- Investiture rules keep powerful people from getting entads that would make them Epic. And a bunch of powerful relics are wasted on rich idiots.

- We're underestimating the skill of the party /and their enemies/, and it's throwing off how we see skill distribution. During the Fallatehr section, Amaryllis described herself as fighting like a seasoned fighter of the pits; essentially a professional athlete. I did a bunch of research here, but it looks like just playing in the top tier leagues puts you at somewhere between 1:80k and 1:100k. So two adventures ago there should be something like 50,000 people that could compete with Amaryllis physically. I think it's implied that Joon is a better fighter. At the same time Joon is a better bone mage than a certified one. There are an average of 290 doctors per 100k people in OECD countries. That puts Juniper midstory at 1:34m. The math gets more complicated if you split the doctors up between bone mages and blood mages. Assuming similar proficiencies with gem and blood magic and by midstory, Joon is somewhere in the magnitude of 1 in 10 billion by the end of their third adventure. I only mention this because fighting+bone+blood+soul have synergies together. This fits with Solace having a 1 in 5 billion power.

Pallida is a Renacim fighter good enough to stay in the fight with Joon. In Vallencia's chapter she says that there are only about 20,000 Renacim in the world. If the Renacim have the normal distribution of professions (which they probably don't to be honest), and Pallida is as good as a veteran pit fighter she would be at least a 1 in 25b individual.

My point here is that, the narrative has been dealing with the high ends of the bell curve since relatively early on; and right now the characters are on the very extreme ends. (My math is real shaky here) So right now the characters are somewhere between 6 and 7 sigma; going up the bell curve means that guys the tier below tor even two tiers heir power are still pretty rare.

It's been a long time since I've taken stats, so correct me if any of this is off.

******** God this has taken like an hour to compose.

Man I must look like an idiot, I keep getting the details wrong. I could've sworn I read there were 17 billion people on Aerb. I'm digressing but this is interesting me, how'd they lose 15 billion in 500 years? I got the impression exclusion zones were relatively small, the size of a city and the surrounding area, a few thousand square kilometers maybe. Even if all 50 of them (I hope this number isn't wrong too) happened to mega metropolises like New York, that's still only half a billion and that's assuming everyone caught inside the exclusion zone is doomed and none escape.

What kind of events are happening to cause 15 billion in deaths over that time period? That's insane, I'm now wondering why the people on this planet aren't more traumatized. This universe is worse than Warhammer 40k. It'd be like more than 3 WW2's worth of deaths happening every year. That first year alone, presuming they have a birth rate even half our own of 19 per 1000, they'd have to lose 190 million people just to keep the population stable. That's mindbending, what the actual fuck is happening there?

Your point about research makes me wonder if that could be the eventual fate of all schools of magic. Tattoo magic users develop it too far, DM says OP and excludes it.

Anyway I like all your points since they all go some way to explaining away the lack of powerful individuals, but just not enough in my eyes to account for the numbers we're seeing.

Your final point on the statistics of powerful individuals is the most convincing if its right, it does balance what we're seeing with the numbers, but I'm not sure it is.

A number of counterpoints:

- I hope this isn't wrong too, but I thought no one other than Uther and Joon multiclass into multiple magic schools, everyone else just specializes in their school or build. This means you can't extrapolate the power of his enemies/companions with a straight multiplication of the odds (I'm presuming this is how you got the 1 in 5 billion number with Solace since measuring her power by saying she is the last druid left alive doesn't make sense). If Joon is 1:10bn and he is facing a velocity mage that's a massive threat, you couldn't accurately say that threat is 1:100m or 10m right?

- The measurement of power and talent also can't just be a straight multiplication of the odds, after all, you wouldn't say a proficient fighter-bone mage would be 290x more powerful than a fighter or a bone mage 290x weaker than a fighter. It'd be like judging the skill or talent of a high level sous chef by comparing the odds of him to a Olympian neurosurgeon.

- The pressures and motivations on Aerb are vastly different and combat applicable skills would be in far greater demand than here on Earth. Not many people, relatively, are needed or want to grow up to be professional athletes or soldiers. This isn't true for Aerb, there is a pressing need for combat capable people and likely much higher stats.

- If Joon is 1:10bn, and the people a tier below him are 1 standard deviation down, there'd be 500 of them roughly, 5000 roughly for 2. 5000 is around the lower end of the number I had in mind of powerful individuals, but it still sounds like enough to deal with 50 threats if they are almost as powerful as Joon, as they collectively would necessarily have near mastery in every school of magic, access to extremely high level entads and resources. This feeds into my next point.

- In terms of power on Aerb, there are diminishing returns as you go up the bell curve. The difference between 6.46 and 6.8σ is an order of magnitude, but that doesn't mean each order of magnitude translates to a 10x increase in power. Even towards the end of Uther's journey where he was arguably the most powerful individual on the planet. Falling and hitting something could kill him. If you placed Joon and his party up against 5000 people 2 sigmas below them, they'd lose, period. Joon might be able to do a few things that group couldn't do, but the worlds greatest swordsman can't beat 700 decent ones.

Two of the arguments I can think of against a group of powerful but not absolute masters not being able to face some of the exclusions that explain some of it:

- Certain magics, even at mastery level, are of no use against certain exclusions

- Absolute mastery or skill past an extremely high threshold is inherently necessary for even basic survival against certain exclusions and near mastery, regardless of quantity won't help.

Also, what do you think of Doris Finch, how would you deal with her? She seems like one of the more easier ones to deal with.

********* There were 20 billion under Uther; 5 billion presently. Major invasions like the Ice Wizards and Apocalypse Demon could easily kill some. Prophylactics, industrialization, and genetically incompatible interspecies marriage could lead to 500 years of sub-replacement fertility. Just 200 years (10 generations) of a global average of 1.8 kids per women would lead to 7 billion people on the world; unless I was reading the calculator wrong. That's actually a pretty common birthrate in our world (the US doesn't have positive population growth without immigration). Amaryllis does mention prophylactics in particular. The exclusions probably get too much credit.

The reason I mentioned Solace in general is the fact that she's a druid got the response “How much raw power is your side of the table packing?” However, that makes your point even more valid; if druids were so powerful, and they are, how could the second empire exterminate them?

And while I agree that a straight multiplication of rarity, the powers synergize pretty neatly. Joon can pump speed, strength, and vitality by draining blood and bones, and then replace those bones with soul magic. And heal himself. It's not a perfect translation, but there is a noticeable correlation between dual classing in this case and power.

So I think we're nearing a point of agreement; which is that this system is heavily titled more towards offense than defense. There are so many avenues of attack that defense is very hard, and offense is very easy. Alpha strikes become hugely important.

So, to answer your original question about why it was so hard; Uther's minions were playing constant defense for threats that came out of the woodwork.

And while I think you're right that increasing skills has diminishing returns, it's not an exponential curve. The reason I see is virtues like Bladebound. Some virtues seem really powerful, like soul sight; it's not just increasing your combat ability, it's also increasing your ability to perceive, prevent, and protect against alpha strikes. (Which gets to another point of agreement; there are threats that you could never see without soul sight.) It's probable that without these virtues, you don't survive certain threats.

One more tangentially related point; Uther's minions were also losing magic items as this was going on. His greed heirs were taking stuff.

As for Doris Finch: a government could probably repeatedly void bomb the area, hire a dragon to raze the area, starve the area, etc. The easiest way for the party would probably be creating a soul virus. Assuming that she uses soul magic somehow, alter two of her so that the alteration would make her value the mission of exterminating non-altered Doris Finch, and hate herself in general. As part of her programming, she would reinforce her own programming before it could fade. Once all the non-altered ones are dead, the remainder have a kool aid party. You wouldn't even have to alter that many values to do it.

Heh, this is pretty devious. Would Doris have a single soul that was connected for all her copies or does each copy have it's own soul? If it's the former, that's an easy win.

How would you deal with Manifest, Door into the Soul, Unwavering and Better with Loops? I only mention those because the rest are too vague to properly gauge the difficulty of. Though Z-Word, Everything Eater, and Fleshsmith all sound like straight up regular fights against tough bosses, the abstract ones like REDACTED and Loops seem the toughest to me.

Caldwell sounds like a dude with an incredible first strike ability but just a regular guy, deal with at a distance. Unwavering might be done with a soul value changes.

Btw, Fel Seed is being hyped as the BBEG and Joon said the magic surrounding him was quite degenerate, but I wonder how bad it could be. He kinda just sounds like a super rapist, what powers would that entail and why would it be impossible to kill him? Does he get reincarnated inside one of his brides spawn or does he enter the person that kills him?

I assumed multiple souls for Doris because the different ones can't get along and have different magical powers. However, because they can't get along, they would probably be shit at facing a unified threat.

Better with loops = teleport, snag with glove and kill him inside the separate dimensional space with a team B to do extraction if one side gets caught; but by that time I would bet Joon will have revision magic. Soul poison would also do it, or sucking his bones out, or having Valencia suck his soul out.

Manifest you could use a magic artifact that refreshes your souls and can't be taken off; Joon might be able to make non-Entad artifacts. Or just send Valencia and Bethel; neither of which have souls to be affected. Really I think getting / building cruise missiles could solve a lot of these problems. Unwavering would be much the same; with the added problem that the loyalty the Goblin is inspiring is the same as Juniper's loyalty.

Redacted sounds like the hardest to me, it sounds like blanket destruction would be your best bet. This would probably need some ridiculous epic level magic; or an industrial state carpet bombing.

Door into the Soul sounds like they need some sort of stealth, invisibility, or flattery. Then a quick stab would do it.

I don't know about Fel Seed, but my guess is that he's Arthur; that's just mine and most people would disagree.

Bad example. Soul mages were specifically hunted down, and soul magery was outlawed. Therefore, if any other soul mages of similar tier existed, /they would hide their existence/. In fact, since magic exists to /test/ for their abilities, they might want to fake their deaths to stop (well, reduce) people from looking for them!

A more convenient explanation would be Fallatehr's prison, which makes him unique because the /entad/ is unique - it traps him (and therefore likely stops him from faking his death+disappearing), but also protects him and makes faking his death unnecessary. Thus, he's the "only" amazing soul mage alive.

Also global warming is a very distant and impersonal threat, not something people are really equipped to respond to rationally. People just don't respond to certain threats proportionally because we're still just animals. If a dozen people are killed by a pack of wolves or machete wielding maniacs in your city, the response would be extreme right? If a dozen people died due to antibiotics no longer being effective because of their overusage, the response wouldn't be the same.

zeroing out the co2 emissions of a country is relatively straightforward if you are a government willing to be dirigiste about it - A ten, fifteen year sprint of reactor construction, no taxes on electric cars, and taxes on gas (including natural gas for industry) that escalate on a formula each year, and there you go, global warming done, with no unreasonable hardship for your citizens, because you are now the electric nation, and your electricity is carbon neutral.

Given that skills range all the way up to 100, I would be surprised if there are more than a few, if any, practitioners in most/all fields of magic that would have (equivalent) values above 70-80. Let alone such values in multiple skills, which might have synergistic effects.

Amaryllis explained the, the biology, I know how, it just seems so gross.” She dropped her pose and looked at her hands. She looked up at me. “This is what I think I was trying to say.”
#+end_quote

Val loves Juniper. Val wants Juniper. Val wants Juniper to be happy. Val -- who in many ways is still a child-- knows for a fact, via devil juju, that she could use her talents make Juniper happier than Fenn /ever/ could. The closest thing to an ethics class she ever had was reading /Harry Potter./

I think Val did it, but I don't think Val is at fault. She is at the mercy of forces she cannot understand or control, and has been failed badly by the authority figures in her life.

So, about Grak. These chapters made me realize that Juniper has been doing the same thing to the rest of the party, too. Only Amaryllis' quests have been prioritized, ostensibly because gathering the resources and power of Uther's bloodline should make the rest more doable, but... what has he really tried?

Solace was polite about the fact that Juniper has been ignoring the Locus. Joon even feels kinda bad about it. But the reason he went to hang out with the Locus was the breakup.

Juniper is selfish, but doesn't want to think of himself as a selfish person. Maybe Fenn's death will help him realize that he could have been pursuing her side quests, /helping/ her the way she has helped him from day 1 instead of just accepting the assumption that he's the most important person in the universe. I don't know if that can happen as long as Val is nearby and continues to have the same values.

If Val is going to make a play to wrest control of the party from Amaryllis, Grak's life may be in imminent danger.

Is he? He strikes me more as apathetic, without any coherent long term personal goal he is pursuing (it used to be the accumulation of power, but that stopped after he soul edited himself). It looks like he seems to be mostly following short term pressures to avoid bad events, for example their current quest line got started because they were worried about the dream skewered accidentally saying 'Shia LaBeouf'. Before that they needed the time chamber to get Solace back faster in order to save the locus, before that they needed to a soul mage to save Juniper who burnt through his own bones, before that they needed a cure for rat rot for Amaryllis, before that they needed to save Amaryllis from a gold mage, before that it was acquire Amaryllis's artefacts (which is the last time the parties main activities have been directed at a coherent long term goal).

To me it looks like Juniper will go to extraordinary lengths to protect his friends but not do much to advance their, or his, position.

*** I thought Val was a terrible relationship counselor. She had a clear conflict of interest and didn't facilitate well at all. A lot of her arbitration was towards more escalation and she really policed the conversation in ways that just led to more conflict without resolving the extant conflict. She also kept inserting her interpretations of either of the two as the last word, which I found grating even just reading, but I hate that sort of serene psychoanalysis in real life and I think that bled over there. Val did a lot to raise and identify problems in their communication; she did very little of the actual, necessary therapeutic work identifying what steps they could take to /fix/ those problems.

I also thought she was way off base trying to impose her ideal relationship on Fenn/June with that "you don't make each other better" garbage. Yes, June may not be the same person he thinks of his ideal self as. That doesn't make who he actually is incompatible with Fenn as she is and wants to be and it doesn't mean their relationship is a net negative.

All that said, I found the breakup part very believable. The way they never really talked about the letters and their emotional ramifications has been a red flag for a while, looking in from our outside PoV. On the other hand, conservation of narrative means we don't see every minutiae of their relationship or even every "big" conversation. I just found Val's social-fu lacking: if Val possessed the otherworldly social acumen needed to make such fine-grained insights about them she should also have been able to shepherd the relationship back to more stable ground. Instead she shattered it. The lines about devils not knowing how to build, only break, and being disposed to only tear down, I just didn't find persuasive enough.

e: so I guess in conclusion you can put me in the "Val sabotaged things" camp and also that that chapter really hurt to read for someone who ships Fenn/June (even if Best Girl was becoming a bit of a weeb).

***** Fair warning, this is probably not worth the read. I'm in paper-writing mode and it's really showing, I think, but anything to avoid thinking about my deadlines for a bit.

I do think Fenn and June could have made it work. I also agree that ultimately it was Fenn's choice. I blame Val for her stage-setting and for the way she framed their relationship as an overall bad thing and not only unworkable but not worth working /at./

Unlike teaching, when it comes to real behavioural change I don't believe the Socratic method is effective. It's not enough for the therapist to lead the patient around in circles with insightful questions; especially not when it's couples counselling. Behavioural therapy has to take steps towards modifying that behaviour. Fenn and June weren't in that room to talk about their feelings and their deep-seated Oedipal complexes; they needed direction just as a much as they needed to be heard by each other.

The first step in achieving any goal is figuring out what that goal is. The first step in problem in problem solving is, perhaps not surprisingly, quite similar: identifying its specifics. Val did this really well, such as when it came to things like Fenn and June's systems of thinking and how they communicated.

However, it's not enough just to raise a problem as a therapist. Val consistently did two things that really bothered me. One, she really did very little to offer /positive/ feedback. Val picked out a bunch of June and Fenn's problems, but she didn't do much prescriptive work in terms of what they could do to improve, marginalize, or diminish those problems. Second, she had a pessimistic outlook on the relationship and I think it really coloured the way she led the discussion. Take this passage, for example:

#+begin_quote
  “It's deeper than that,” said Valencia. “There are disconnects between the two of you, both in terms of who you are, who you think you are, and who you think the other is. Those are the things that we need to very delicately reconcile.”

  “Very delicately ... because otherwise we'd fall out of love?” asked Fenn.

  “One or the other would, yes, or neither would, but the relationship wouldn't be salvageable,” said Valencia. “This is the reason I thought it would probably take a few hours of discussion. It would be better to resolve things over the course of weeks or months, a little bit at a time, but the problems between the two of you are already interfering with our ability to function as a group.”
#+end_quote

As a glimpse into Val's thoughts, this shows both that Fenn/June comes second to group cohesion in terms of her priorities and also that Val is capable of incredible leaps of logic. Also, and most importantly, she appears to believe that June and Fenn are fundamentally incompatible. I don't think it's a huge stretch to say she walked into that room poisoned against the very idea of Fenn/June.

I didn't expect the therapy conversation to magically fix all their problems. I did expect that Val, capable of determining that the relationship "wouldn't be salvageable" (is she a precog, now?), would also be capable of guiding the conversation in such a way as to have Fenn and June leave aware of their problems and working to bridge those "disconnects" having slightly "kissed and made up." Instead they left with their relationship over.

Maybe it's just my inability to appreciate how fundamentally capital-E Evil inhabitants of the hells are and the strange way their social skills skew away from doing anything positive. But they're also capable of perfectly modelling good behaviour and are perfect actors; it seems odd to me that Val doesn't have the toolkit, even if it's a warped, abstracted idea of it, to guide and frame the discussion in a way that would have had Fenn and June walking out tentatively reconciled, aware of their problems, and working to fix them.

What's more likely - that the uber-competent devil-channeling Val failed, or that she got exactly the outcome she was looking for? My view is that in a lot of ways, Val made the choice for Fenn and June, here, that they weren't going to work out and jumped ahead to that outcome. Fenn came in thinking it was "just a fight" and June had similar thoughts. They left broken up. Is the same Val, who can model a traumatic breakdown and how it will cause schisms in a group she hardly knows, simply not able to treat people she's intimately acquainted with with kid gloves? Draw your own conclusions, I suppose.

****** I'm on the fence on whether Val consciously decided to sabotage the relationship (it's not like she grew up in the sort of environment that rewarded principled ethics), but either way, I do wonder what the thought process was in deciding that Val should be Joon and Fenn's couple counselor.

Leaving aside that therapy on close friends is a bad idea in general, Val had very strong incentives to want Joon and Fenn to break up. Even if we assume she didn't break them up consciously, she probably let some bias creep in without realizing it. Even if she didn't, that doubt is going to color her relationship with Joon (and maybe Fenn) for /years/.

I mean, they're rich, and they have a teleportation key. If they want couple's counseling, hire a therapist. If they want to give Val some experience at therapy, have her get some formation first, and give her a part-time job with people she has no prior relationship with.

Wait, if the problem is "they're in a relationship," then isn't it the case that the therapy conversation magically solved all of their problems? I think she was basically right about what interested Juniper about Fenn, and how that conflicted with what interested Fenn about Juniper. I think the version where Juniper sees Fenn as an equal and a resource, rather than 'the fun one,' and they're able to establish an equal partnership, happens because Juniper and Fenn stop dating for a while and he treats her like a coworker and then they later resume dating, if it makes sense for both of them.

******* Thanks for your thoughts. First, there's no sarcasm attached to my use of the word incredible. It's clear Val is, socially, operating several levels beyond where anyone else in that room is. Together with your second point that's pretty much the gist of what I'm trying to say. Val sees the relationship itself as a problem, for whatever reason - that's not why Fenn and June went into the room, though. That's not what they wanted out of her "therapy." If Val wanted to, she could have done a lot more work to heal their budding rift. Instead they broke up.

Because - it appears to me - she made the unilateral decision they should break up for them. That their relationship didn't match up with her paradigm/ideal of a healthy one, plus the fact that them breaking up would lead to a better group dynamic for the Council of Arches as a whole. That's a decision that I see as incredibly paternalistic from someone specifically in that room to mediate. Someone whose own life experience when it comes to romantic relationships, by the way, can be summed up as "has read Harry Potter." I don't think that's Val's choice to make.

Like June said to the Locus, and I'm paraphrasing, "it didn't feel unhappy." Maybe you're right, and Val's right, that June and Fenn were interested for different reasons, looking for different things, and had several issues communicating. That doesn't mean their relationship isn't worth pursuing. They were still happy. And, contrary to Val, I do think they made each other better people.

Again, I'm being fully serious when I say Val's incredible in social terms. If she can so accurately predict their flaws and relationship conflicts and how things will end up, though, she should also be able to model their behaviour in the room right in front of her. I think you have to take away that Val got exactly the result she wanted out of that session. A result that both (a) diminishes Fenn and June's own agency in their own damn relationship and (b) isn't in line with what they were looking for when they sought out her help.

- I think Pallida is more likely to provide a love interest for Amaryllis than Juniper, even though it's obviously starting from somewhere unhealthy. I don't think Amaryllis is going to get in a relationship with Juniper, because why would you want to be with someone that is mildly revolted by touching you? Sex with Amaryllis in some ways would feel tantamount to rape because there would definitely be a coercive aspect to the mismatched needs.

- I do think that one or more characters will flip shit on Bethel; she doesn't make sense as a companion right now. She's too useless in a majority of actions the group can take, because she's stationary. Ropey makes a better companion than she does. The worst part is that she probably could have ended the fight much sooner.

- Valencia's social fu is not infallible. She thought Heshnel would probably be on their side, and at first glance it appears like he wasn't. She also thought Everett and Gemma would be on the same side. They clearly weren't. At the same time, her reluctance to drop the devil after counselling was alarming.

Note that Amaryllis is capable of hacking her own soul. She recognizes that Juniper wants her and that it would be pragmaticly useful to be in a relationship with him. If she wanted to then she could get rid of her dislike of being touched, crank her libido way up, and increase her romantic interest in Juniper. I don't think she will because she's smart enough to know that being a rebound is not likely to last, and that it would be too obvious that she was doing it for mercenary reasons.

Thoughts:

- I doubt that Val sabotaged joon/fenn. Infernals are ill-equipped to heal, and we have seen little evidence recently that Val wants to get with Joon -- I'm betting that she simply overestimated her abilities, or was worn down from overuse.
- Holy somkes, RIP Fenn. They still have her soul, but who wants to bet that the Locus won't be as keen to reincarnate her, if that means creating a pattern of use that constrains the locus. If that WAS permissible, then at least they can now hire someone to sit in the time chamber and play mom to Fenn
- Perhaps a quest in the future to find the exclusion zone which made it impossible to overwrite a soul in its entirety? That would be another way to bring fenn back...
- Interesting the restrictions on immortality -- however, there are a number of characters floating around who have gotten past all of that. I'd guess that the soul decays at the same rate for all characters? If so, that's a very slow rate, given the number of very old people around. If damnation in hell is eternal, then that means that decay halts in hell. Soul magic would likely prevent physical or mental decay. Perhaps skin magic, making a complete encasement around the soul (as described in Chapter 80, could wall the soul in and extend its lifespan?
- You can see another realization of this game where Joon focuses on his social skills more. In that outcome, he would have his loyalties much higher, and get wicked companion bonuses. Bethel would be more inclined to come with on trips, and the party would be more powerful together. It is rapidly becoming clear that the value of the social links between party members is very important.
- On a related note, it is likely that Joon will respond to this by investing a point or two into SOC, mitigating some of these issues. However, it's unlikely that he'll invest deeply into SOC, since that would remove most of the interpersonal conflict from the story, which is a major story thread.
- Looks like the team has a few allies now? Pallida was helpful. I hope that Joon isn't to consumed in rage to save/trust her... Their knowledge and resources could be invaluable, and may allow them to bring Fenn back more easily.

And how is Joon supposed to tell what is degradation, and what is a change that Original!Fenn would have made? The relationship counselling session was just the latest in many examples showing how Joon is not great at interpreting how other people think/will act, but even if he had a godlike social skill (as in the actual stat), I doubt he'd be capable of doing that.

He doesn't even completely understand himself, and you expect him to be able model how someone else would act indefinitely?

There's a scene where Joon sees a list of the things he values, and he doesn't understand why one item is higher than another. I don't think even Fallatehr, or anyone, for that matter, could do what you're talking about.

** ... crazy theory, but this feels like the DM was mad that JuniperXFenn was going so well, and decided to /subtly/ maybe use Valencia as a proxy to mess that up so that his OTP (Amaryllis, who he specifically designed for Joon) could flourish.

It didn't work completely since it was only a "break" and there was a good narrative chance of them growing mature apart from each other and then a "second chance" happens which sticks since now they both know each other's flaws intimately and hopefully have taken steps to alleviate them.

To prevent this, the DM actually kills off Fenn. Just like all of Uther's love interests, this has a tangible external cause (the enemies using soul-acid so that Juniper couldn't reincarnate in hell, and soul dissolving being one of the very few things Juniper could heal), and /just/ enough coincidences (Fenn being taken out last, given the crown last, and ALSO being healed last) to make it look inevitable, which means high possibility of DM fuckery/narrative causality.

**** In 1e/2e it was called Girdle of Masculinity/Femininity (which I remembered wrong too)

[[http://flockhart.virtualave.net/afal/table88.html]]

Table 99 here

I have no idea what edition you have linked with the first one and acknowledge that in Pathfinder it was called that, but I assume that since the text is referring to D&D and indeed the early editions of D&D.

#+begin_quote
  You are just assuming the creators of the manual would have cared about the distinction between 'gender' and 'sex' that you are making here?
#+end_quote

Well my first comment shows that I don't really think that was the case, they had separate stats for male and female characters. Women couldn't get a STR higher than 18/50 in AD&D so I doubt they have a strong consideration for the complex meanings of those words. However, Juniper sure does and I'm sure he would have a comment about it being gender not sex.

***** I was sure it had been stated explicitly that Joon dated her and it didn't end well, but it seems I imagined it. I did find the reference to a girlfriend other than Tiff or Fenn in chapter 97:

#+begin_quote
  "She's the only other person he's been with,” said Fenn. “I know that I would prefer if you changed.”

  “Er,” I replied. “Technically there was another.”

  “Wait, what?” asked Fenn, looking over at me. “When? On Earth, or Aerb?”

  “Earth,” I said.

  “Well then why don't I know about it?” asked Fenn.

  “It's a long story,” I said. “Can I be a chickenshit and write you a letter?”

  Fenn crossed her arms over her chest. “Well ... fine.” She said it in a voice that let me know that it wasn't at all fine, and that she was only agreeing because she didn't want to be an outrageous hypocrite. “I just didn't know you had another girlfriend. I told you all about my boyfriends.”

  “She wasn't technically a girlfriend,” I said. “Or, maybe only technically a girlfriend. I shouldn't have said anything.”
#+end_quote

I could have sworn, on reading your comment but before looking for it, that Maddie was specifically mentioned. It seems I just drew the conclusion with her being the only other female from Earth listed as part of the gaming group crossed with the falling out where she is mentioned by name. Luckily I turned out to be right, but I guess I have an excuse to reread and examine where else I've been making leaps that might pay off later.

I don't think it's necessarily as meaningful as that. He was going to have to save /somebody/ last, one way or another. Should he have made a conscious decision to save Grak last, just in order for the last one to not be Fenn?

I agree that it's a /suspicious/ coincidence that Fenn died right after the break-up, but I see at least three possible culprits: Juniper (as per your argument), Valencia (either recognizing that Fenn is doomed and subtly manipulating Juniper to save Grak instead, or (less plausibly) orchestrating the entire thing as per [[/u/NoYouTryAnother][u/NoYouTryAnother]]'s theory), and the narrative.

*Edit:* On second thoughts, he also dragged her out of the building last. Which is possibly why she died sooner than everyone else. Hm.

**** Joon had good reasons for pulling her out of the building last. He went for Solace first as she's the healer and Grak was right next to her so he took both out of the fort together. When he went back in he was confronted straight away with Valencia struggling to drag Amaryliss out - presumably from context she was kinda close to being rescued, so he helped Valencia drag Amaryliss out. I thought the sequence of events was all very natural and understandable. The later decision to attempt to heal Fenn last (and the fact Valencia casts a look at Fenn on the ground before leaving the helmet on Grak) is more open to question imo.

The soul's image of the body was dependent on the body; the scars on Fenn's arms were there on the soul because they'd had a chance to set, and any injury could be written onto the soul as the soul adapted to the reality of living with that wound. This soul would never have a body, and the image of Fenn's body that I'd written over would never change either.

Chapter 114

  “Yeah, I know,” I said. “It's hard to prove, if not impossible. There is this, though.” I held out my hand. “I wish for a hot dog.”

  A hot dog appeared in my outstretched hand.

  Dehla began gesturing frantically as I took a bite. The hot dog wasn't very good, as I had known it wouldn't be. I'd used three of the hundred hot dog wishes already for testing, the first to make sure that they actually did something, and the second and third to make sure that there weren't combat applications. Grak had watched when I'd made the third wish, but hadn't seemed as surprised by the results as Dehla seemed. It was a new wavelength of magic, distinct from the signature of the entad bands, and noteworthy in that regard, but it wasn't going to upend anyone's conception of reality.

** Feels like this is a major turning point for Joon. Now he's confronted with the death of another person important to him, except this time he can do something concrete about it. His hand is being forced for good or ill. But what's the lesson here...? What's the moral at the end?

If he succeeds, it distorts his coping mechanism for the death of loved ones. Does he truly intend to play Aerb's over-god and create utopia at the end of this road?

If he succeeds at a price, it's just more depression fuel of the world he created where "evil couldn't be undone...and the world would never be set right." But maybe the takeaway is that we live in an imperfect world and we can only ever try our best.

If he fails, he's going to have to seriously relearn how to cope. And like others joke about Val, he hopefully has an effective grief counselor. On the /bright/ side, the game won't be skewing his acceptance of the finality of death.

Regardless, I'm awfully sad. Like for others, Fenn was my favorite character and the primary breath of life in their dour party.

  The so-called exclusions came in three basic forms, all geographically restricted. The normal exclusions were like the one that covered the Risen Lands, where some kind of magic (or physics) had proven itself broken and been locked off from the rest of the world by some unknown force or entity (through the book, it was simply called ‘the exclusionary principle', as a way of dodging the question about what was actually happening behind the scenes). Enpersoned exclusion zones were slightly different, as the magic was locked to a single person in addition to the region locking, and entad exclusions were that, but for a magic item rather than a person.

** I'm the kind of reader who tends to enjoy the lore/worldbuilding a lot more than the interpersonal stuff, so it was a little jarring to get mostly character drama, when I was expecting to get more Uther stuff and/or world details.

Props for the convincing, gut wrenching writing style. Actually, it was 3 strikes for me:

1. The relationship that's been nurtured for countless chapters, vivisected, slaughtered
2. Fenn, the fun, carefree character that was breathing some lightheartedness (sometimes) into the story, abandoned and bled to death
3. The plot to eventually heroically rescue the soul of the latter and along destroy the hells and save trillions of endlessly suffering souls, annihilated

** I don't like being critical, but I found these last chapters extremely boring, despite featuring what is presumably a major character death. The new group of NPCs isn't interesting because the story's done this too often before. Fenn dying immediately after the breakup is not only so predictable it's trite but we all know the author is better than that which somehow makes it /even worse that they did it anyway/. Which, continuing to assume that the author is skilled and creative, means that they have a different subversion in mind, but we won't enjoy it because we can only expect it, because the alternative is Amaryllis' Narrative interpretation is correct and this is one of the most obnoxious stories I've ever read.

No, I'm not a hardcore Fenn/Joon shipper who is so upset she died that they'll quit reading. I'm upset that a story with so much promise and When O'Kald said “My wife” as a reason for betrayal and murder I almost combusted with indifference. Again, /assuming the author knows what they are doing/, they are intentionally writing dumb characters to force the plot. And not only is the plot being forced, its forced in a dumb direction, which is dumb in-world, in the meta-context of narrative structure, and somehow even the meta-meta-narrative structure of the story discussing narrative structures.

**** Thanks. I don't think it's particularly acidic. Some people have a hair-trigger downvote reflex (though I would have hoped for less of that in [[/r/rational]]).

I mean, the events and characters of the story /constantly/ talk about the differences between narrative, story-focused games and free-form, sandbox games. This is the biggest selling point of the whole novel for me. It's way more fun for the story to try to emulate a sandbox campaign while satirizing more structured stories. I would say it's mostly succeeded at that .But Fenn dying here, 24 hours after a breakup, comes down extremely hard on the side of this story being more normal, with a protagonist who suffers the drama of various love interests while saving the world, with the "twist" of the characters being fully aware of it. This simply is not as interesting a premise for me, and is annoying for the story to execute a good premise for hundreds of thousands of words then become less good.

Compare Fenn's death to when Solace died to the void grenade in the prison. That came out of nowhere, but it's totally accurate to how characters have died in my own game group and countless others. Characters die when the party rolls bad perception and gets ambushed, not when a narrative thread logically terminates. This is part of what makes these games so engaging.

Seriously, what's going to be the fallout of Fenn's death here?

- If her soul was totally destroyed by the poison and can't be resurrected, then she's permadead, followed by drama between Amaryllis and Juniper and the narrative/sandbox conflict. However, I don't think this will happen.

- If she went to hell, then there will be a lot more focus on Juniper and Valencia as they try to figure out if infiltrating hell or whatever is even feasible. This just means that Fenn goes from being sidelined by the plot to outright damsel'd.

- If they can restore her soul from backup, then it's just a regression of her character, increasing the disparity between herself and Juniper, even though Fenn won't be aware of the fact that she broke up with him. If I were a betting man, this is what I expect to happen, if only because of Maximum Drama.

But I'm not excited about any of these options, which is why I wrote this is in the first place. Maybe the story will take a different and surprising path, but I don't see how any of it is better than /just not killing them off in the first place./

***** Not them, but I don't think you actually gave reasons for your complaints. What exactly was dumb? O'kald had a good reason Valencia didn't catch (and I assume it will be expanded upon in the future), and it led him to betray everyone. Nothing about that seems forced.

The only thing I would call dumb in the last few chapters would be getting on the ship in the first place, but that didn't have any negative consequences on its own, and Fenn is impulsive enough that it's not really out of character.

Valencia intentionally riling O'kald up without having full control over the situation was also a mistake, but I don't think she's experienced enough that you can call it an Idiot Ball thing any more that you can call Joon an idiot for not being the perfect boyfriend.

If Fenn dying turns into a drama handled with the subtlety of a DC superhero comic you might have a point, but we aren't there yet, so I'd hold your complaints til then.
