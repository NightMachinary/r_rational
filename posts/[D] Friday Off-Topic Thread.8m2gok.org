Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

** I've been thinking about popularity recently, in part because I found myself working on a short story (or maybe novella, or since brevity isn't a strong suit, maybe an actual novel) that takes place in the same universe as /Shadows of the Limelight/ (where fame grants powers, if you haven't read it, which statistically you probably haven't).

The question I've been mulling over, mostly while watching a toddler throw rocks into a lake, was "how do people become widely popular". Here are the general answers that I came up with, which I think with some editing I can map to major characters in the story I'm working on:

- *Slow grind:* You put in the work, hone your craft, and grind out a following. I don't think you even have to be /good/, so long as you're good enough to retain viewership/readership/attendance. You stick around long enough that people eventually check you out, and some of them stick around. It's rare for you to have full-on fans, but people are aware of you, and being everyone's fourth or fifth choice can bring a greater popularity than being first choice for a small group.
- *Lackey:* You ride someone's coattails. /They're/ popular, and some of it rubs off on you. They plug your stuff, or if they don't, then the simple fact that you're always around them makes you popular by association. If you're both creators, then maybe people go to you when they've burned through everything the more popular person has made, because you're close to each other, and though your stuff isn't quite the same, it's a substitute that /sort of/ scratches the same itch.
- *Influencer*: Someone known for having good taste, or maybe just with a lot of reach, tells everyone to check you out. A graph of your popularity shows a sharp spike, and if you're good, then you hold onto that audience. Probably before the moment raw influence touched you, you were in the slow grind, but the influence lets you skip years or even decades of slow growth. (Also under this umbrella would be the *Big Break*, which might be getting signed to a record company, a contract with a publishing company, or a spot on a big variety show.)
- *Virality*: Almost the same (and probably overlapping with) Influencer varieties, but much more grassroots. I sort of think that there's a tendency for this to not last, but I'd be pointing mostly to one-hit wonders as an example, and it's definitely possible to transition from a viral sensation into more normal popularity, even if there's a bit of a "lightning in a bottle" phenomenon.

(/Shadows/ runs on fame/infamy, rather than popularity, which is different, but the thing I've been thinking about is mostly /popularity/ as a distinct but overlapping concept.)

I think there's probably something missing from this framework, and it might be "Power", e.g. becoming popular because you're initially well-known for reasons other than popularity (e.g. CEO or king), which offers an easy transition from "people know who you are" to "people like you". I think it's good enough though, and probably useful for creating a cast of characters.

*** I think that just having a measure of power is not sufficient to achieve large amounts of popularity. Take for example members of Congress: the vast majority of the population probably couldn't name the senators or representatives of their respective state despite the fact that these people are directly responsible for relaying the opinions of their constituents.

On the other hand, any president and vice president of the US are generally widely known by the populace. I believe the critical aspect that distinguishes them from other government officials is *uniqueness*. There is only one president and vice president at a time and their responsibilities are distinct from others and affect a great number of people which lends to their popularity.

At its roots, popularity and fame require people to actually care about the individual in question whether through a personal connection or through being affected by the individual's actions. Taylor Swift and other music artists are popular because their music is appreciated by a large number of people. This is why people who produce entertaining content are more famous than faceless politicians, because their products have a more noticeable and distinguishable impact on the lives of their fans. Nobody is going to mistake one musician's songs with another, but a big tax bill being passed can have any number of congressmen that voted for or against.

**** Power isn't sufficient, but I do think it's one of the pathways to popularity; in a way, it's sort of putting the cart before the horse by getting famous and then becoming popular from that fame. A CEO can attain that position without having any particular sort of widespread popularity, then become popular because they have a lot of power, importance, and reach - which is why in this typology I would class them as being popular because of power.

*** In my personal semantics, fame is whether you're worth talking about, popularity is whether anybody wants to hang out with you. Maybe your popularity is negative, and people want to hang out with you in order to yell at you or punch you in the face, but /you're/ what's important.

Wildly popular people are more interesting than the rest of us in quirky ways. They inspire opinions and arguments. They make a difference. They promise the impossible, and they deliver it.

Anybody can be a little famous for a spectacular coincidence or for doing something spectacularly stupid. There aren't a lot of those folks I want to meet. The former only has one story, and the latter is /dangerous/.

Mr. Butcher doesn't really find his pace until then, and while the first two books do tie into the over-arching plot important events whose ramifications will affect other books only really start to happen with the third book. Also Murphy does evolve over time.

Then again I do have the motivator about Harry Dresden [[#s][Rather metal spoiler from around book 6?]] where he's described as Gandalf with an IV of Red Bull or the like included in my picture shuffle screen-saver. The books aren't quite rational but it does have competent characters with fairly realistic motives.

***** I ran into the same problem. However, by the time I started reading the 4th book, I had to stop. For me, at least, it just never seemed to get significantly better.

Personally I felt that Harry Dresden and Murphy never learned anything in regards to their own state or position.

Murphy, despite being characterized as smart, never reaches, what seems to me, to be obvious connections.

But I think what I felt was most problematic was that Dresden refuses to inform people about things that place them in direct and mortal/immortal danger. His reasoning is incredibly faulty in my opinion.

Just to give you another perspective.

The "hacking" is basic as fuck and ramps up in tediousness rather than difficulty (run do_the_hack.exe, do_the_hack_2.sh, do_the_hack_3.py), but it makes up for it with humour.

There's a single really bizarre design decision. There's a side-quest you're given which is pretty gray, and the game outright says "This might be against your morals. Feel free to skip this quest if you don't like it." But the quest is the only way to get an item that is essential to finish the main story! What the hell?

** For anyone here that likes CYOAs, I made two!

[[https://imgur.com/a/J9xthyw][Bringing Back Magic (Beginning with You!)]] ([[https://np.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/8g5o3i/bringing_back_magic_beginning_with_you/][reddit thread]])\\

Well, one-ish.

Reading any further, or reading the 2nd CYOA first counts as spoilers for the 1st CYOA. This matters for game mechanics reasons, although I will say the penalty is mostly just there to manipulate people into multiple playthroughs.

...

Anyways, I made BBM:BWY after a great deal of thinking about how to balance options around different playstyles, but realized I hadn't accounted for one playstyle: people more-or-less completely unwilling to give up humanity for power. I did intentionally make "stay as human as possible" a legitimately valid option in the context of the CYOA, but I found that the people that play style was geared towards would simply rather not play the CYOA.

I thought that was interesting because, relative to some of the CYOAs that get posted, the available powers are still pretty strong and diverse. Even an absolutely minimal point option can be made to be strictly better than regular human. But what I think happened is that they saw the options they /could/ be getting, if the drawbacks didn't become so brutal, and got discouraged from engaging in the CYOA. The relative success of the second thread (where the CYOA it tweaked in favour of humanity rather than power) seems to support that-- 95-100% upvotes compared to 81%.

I think this represents a broader trend that can be applied to most literature. I'm having trouble articulating it, but I think, when writing, being aware of what the "reference point" for each emotion or character is important, because when you do something with that character or emotion, that's what the reader is comparing them to.

Any thoughts?

** So I got around to reading Crystal Eternity this week, and was rather disappointed. The first two books were just so good, but the last one was a let down. No spoilers, but the whole first part with Zephyr was annoying after the reveal, Ro is silly and completely changes the hard sci-fi aspect that I liked, and then at the end various realizations that characters have are never explained to the reader, so I'm left wondering what is actually true and what is merely characters being wrong. And not in the interesting way that Inception did it. Really wished that the story had played out differently, or that the way in which the story was presented was done so more clearly.

I also started reading Dungeon Keeper Ami, and dropped it at the end of the first page of the story only because nothing interesting seemed to be happening. Not really sure why [[/r/rational][r/rational]] recommends it going off the first couple thousand words, because none of the characters seem to be rational or even particularly smart. They're not dumb, but they don't seem to be using the magic system in an interesting way, and the magic seems extremely easy to learn. There's one bit where the main character is trapped with a monster blocking the exit, and she learns and casts a teleportation spell to summon one of her minions as she is reading the spell. If she can do that, there really isn't any way for the reader to know what abilities she has, because she can learn any ability she has in a book on the fly (she can read any book in her library remotely). Despite this, when I stopped she still only knew a single offensive ability, the one she started with. She spends an enormous amount of time trying to make a better minion when she could have spent the same amount of time learning to become a walking natural disaster, when she knew that there were people coming within the week to kill her.

Will probably read some nonfiction now, as the last two novels haven't turned out great. The Worth The Candle update was amazing as usual, so that makes up for some of it.

**** Okay? Then the mechanics of the game make for a horrible story. As of the part I stopped reading at, she looked to be able to learn almost any spell she had the description of in seconds, and can cast it adequately on the first try. She can read any book in her library with only a small delay. In any situation where she is challenged, I as the reader have no way of knowing what spells she can cast, nor the limits of them, because she can almost literally pull new spells out of a hat. There can't really be tension, because at any point she can learn to teleport to arbitrary locations, or learn a new combat spell, or a better healing spell, or whatever. Her potential abilities are basically unbounded save for her mana capacity, which makes it pointless to speculate about how she could use her existing abilities to solve a problem because she can at any time learn new ones.

When she travels to the underworld and gets betrayed by what's his face, it was dumb for two reasons. First, she knew a single combat spell, and what's his face knows that she knew only that one. Any counter to that spell means she is worthless in a fight, and she got saved through a Deus ex machina. She was only in that position because she was the exact opposite of a munchkin and never bothered to learn any combat spell in her possession, when she knew that she was heading to a hostile location, and also that people were coming to kill her soon.

Second, it was dumb because what's his face chose the worst possible time to betray her. He could have waited a single minute, walked over to her, broken the possession thing, and killed her when he was a yard away, instead of giving her adequate time to prepare for his coming. If you want a rational character to be challenged in any way, you have to give them at least mildly intelligent opponents, otherwise the plot and tension just fails.

If the story follows Dungeon Keeper canon, then that just means the canon wasn't well thought out, or that it makes a horrible setting for a story, because it's too easy to overpower anyone if you have a modicum of intelligence. It's an abject failure of world building, but passing the blame into someone else.

**** It's not that I'm unfamiliar with the source material, although I am, it's that the world presented so far makes magic too easy to learn, and the main character's failure to capitalize on it is anathema to some of the major themes of this sub. She obtained a bunch of books from a powerful necromancer. Afterwards she learned a possession spell, started trying to make a golem from imps, and then went on a risky journey while physically incapacitated, and without her normal ability to teleport to safety, without having ever learned more magic. It's just dumb. If she had learned an additional two combat spells, so that fighting didn't consist of her freezing things over and over, or some movement ability, it would be fine, but she didn't.

Being creative with abilities is fine, but she should first be smart with them.

    Most scams are fairly harmless, involving a bit of commission here and there for taxi or moto drivers, particularly in Siem Reap. There have been one or two reports of police set-ups in Phnom Penh, involving planted drugs. This seems to be very rare, but if you fall victim to the ploy, it may be best to pay them off before more police get involved at the local station, as the price will only rise when there are more mouths to feed. There is quite a lot of fake medication floating about the region. Safeguard yourself by only buying prescription drugs from reliable pharmacies or clinics. Beware the Filipino blackjack scam: don't get involved in any gambling with seemingly friendly Filipinos unless you want to part with plenty of cash. Beggars in places such as Phnom Penh and Siem Reap may ask for milk powder for an infant in arms. Some foreigners succumb to the urge to help, but the beggars usually request the most expensive milk formula avail-able and return it to the shop to split the proceeds after the handover.
