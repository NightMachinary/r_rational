** Tantalising.

I find it fun to imagine it as a spiral rather than as a closed circle--one person dies, another is (others are) inspired to seek immortality by the death of those before them, and each generation/{people-who-are-alive} in turn walk the same path, with the same goal, with the same hope and will.

The Type-Moon multiverse also flits through my mind, each mage passing on their research to their successor, everyone seeking the origin of everything through different paths. That always bothered me in how fragile each line was, though--how the fruits of centuries of research could be lost all at once with a single clash and death, with no or little persistent accumulation. Then again, maybe that was a necessity to avoid a world-crackdown that happened whenever the opposite was attempted, part of the exclusivity which was the price for the chance offered.

--However, I cannot actually remember whether that was canon or not. Whether it was truly that each 'loophole' was shut as soon as each person went through it, or just that each approach was different and so couldn't go through the same loophole. But presumably others could imitate it otherwise, so...

Ahh. ( [[https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Magic#Acquisition]] ) Canon indeed? Yet, I've gotten off track.

*** Interesting thoughts!

I'm not too knowledgeable on the Type-Moon franchise - I watched the anime of UBW and Fate:Zero ages ago as part of a group, but I didn't retain much of it - but I was vaguely aware of the conceit of mages pursuing the Root and so on from that mystery show that came out a few seasons ago, which I tried a few episodes of. It seemed be intended to be evocative of the concept of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_opus_(alchemy][Magnum Opus]]) in classical alchemy, which framed the pursuit of the philosophers stone as not something strictly logical and academic, but also as a pseudo-spiritual pursuit that was personal to the alchemist. Creating the philosophers stone granted you enlightenment, and reaching enlightenment granted you the philosophers stone, with the two almost being interchangeable.

Among other reasons, this was why the kind of proto-research alchemists did was usually passed on in a very restricted manner, utilizing complex ciphers that made it incomprehensible to people outside their circle: because the journey was considered just as important as the destination.

Or, y'know, it could have just been because they were hacks who were chasing a fantasy and wanted to keep the reality of how little they understood on the down-low through elitism. Either way.

I've referenced this concept by name a couple of times in the story, I think, since the dichotomy between the "old" style of research based around secretive traditions and shrouded in mysticism, where knowledge is routinely lost forever, and the "new" style founded on everything being shared and the scientific method, is supposed to form a facet of the ideological tension in the narrative. Though of course how you want to interpret the mural in that context at this point is up to you.

(<very curious> Is this an anime involving cards (which is the first thing which flits through my mind, but that I'm not very familiar with), or something else that I've missed altogether? Or Kara no Kyoukai, which I mentioned by name?)

***** Oh, no, I was referring to the The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II. It's about a Fate side character and is structured as a mystery story (well, kind of; it's more like mystery flavor than actual mystery). I only watched a bit of it.

****** I think I've encountered the name before, but I had no idea that an anime adaptation existed--thank you very much for the information!

** (Whoops, forgot to tag the thread title.)

Posting this chapter specifically since it ended up being kind of an [[/r/rational][r/rational]]-ass part, for whatever reason. Incidentally, it's also the one that explains the title.

In addition, I've been trying to edit and trim down the first 3 chapters to make the story easier to pick up, since a lot of people upvoted the comment talking about that in the last thread, but I'm having trouble doing so in a way that doesn't cut important information. So far I've mostly just reduced excessive adjectives. One of my ideas, short of removing the prologue chapters outright and doing substantial edit work to the later ones, was to cut the initial description of the room in chapter 1, and integrate the exposition in the dialogue between the two characters into their appearance at the end of chapter 3 instead, meaning the story would start straight at Utsushikome's first person narration.

In my opinion, it would be a weaker opener, but I can't look at my writing with any degree of objectivity.

** Just caught up.

I'm digging the slow burn world building. Even if I'm missing the more explicit mystery and mystery-related aspects of your previous story, trying to figure out aspects of the setting like prosognostic events or the larger stuff like the meta layer are always going to keep me entertained.

I can't really offer any advice on how to change the first three chapters since I completely bought into them. In retrospect it does seem weird that Utsu has no reservations about looking at the unveiled face of a stranger, even in an extreme situation like this (especially since her freak out at the end could have been a prosognostic event). But it's still not clear exactly how they work, so maybe the caution isn't warranted, or there are other reasons for it.

Anyway, for this latest chapter, Utsu describing the mural as hateful. It seems related to the schism that Utsu's grandfather was a part of. Maybe he got kicked out of the order for being too radical? I could see being bitter about a mural that can be read as glorifying failure when you feel like the order isn't taking options you think are needed. Like, you're patting yourself on the back for creating an enduring legacy of continuing to not achieve your goal when you could have already done it. If you feel like you've cracked true immortality celebrating incremental progress like Old Yru increasing the mean lifespan by a year would make you furious.

One question, (I have lots of questions, but this is the only one where the answer isn't wait and see).

Ran says, "The final scene, which it looks like I'm at now, is about him buying her while questioning what meaning the experiences had," when talking about her romance book. That is a typo right? Should be burying?

*** Thanks for your feedback! Don't worry if you're missing the more explicit mystery stuff - they'll be plenty of that a bit later on. I tried writing a story like this /because/ so many people said that they bounced off that kind of narrative, and wanted to make something that would be more comfortable for the average web fiction reader, hence the fantasy setting and the slow, patient establishment of the setting and the world.

It doesn't seem to have worked as well as I'd hoped, though - so far, this is only marginally more popular. I've probably just created a new problem and made it kind of boring rather than overwhelming. Maybe the only way to completely succeed in this format if you're not writing fanfic is to write stuff with initially simple, straightforward concepts that are easy to jump into?

I won't comment on your speculation for now, but I do appreciate stuff like this. It's nice to see people engaging with the story.

And yeah, that was a typo. I went back and nixed it.

I don't think it's boring!!

I think the slow-burn stuff isn't as much of a hit with the RR crowd, it's true, but you've still got readers from those of us that do enjoy it. Keep it up!
