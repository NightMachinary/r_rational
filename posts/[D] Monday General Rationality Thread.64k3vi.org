Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** A little while back I asked people for their thoughts on reforming education in the Off-Topic thread.

I finally finished the post on competition, reform, and metrics in education! It's on Medium [[https://medium.com/@owenshen/the-ancient-god-who-rules-high-school-e0645b100ae6][here]].

(I've linked to it on LW and a few other places, so if you're wondering it's the one about Moloch and competition.)

*** Regarding solution 1: Yes, realistic views are always helpful, but people need to have some reason to believe that they are or are not in the top 1%. Keep the Dunning-Kruger effect in mind. There's a risk that more competent individuals will compete less because they more fully understand the scope of what they don't know, and thus believe they are not as competent. Realistic views may not be very helpful and could even be harmful if students are not given enough comparative data to see where they stand, and that's tricky if you don't have a good metric to allow students to see their standing.

Solution 2: Good point, and I think changing social norms/customs is easier than you realize.

Solution 3: I'm actually very much in favor of standardization in education. I think it should be feasible, for example, to create educational videos with amazing lecturers and visual explanations and then try slight variations between the versions which are given to different classrooms and schools. Subsequent test scores could be used to determine if there was a statistically significant benefit in any of the versions. The same could be done with textbooks, homework assignments, and educational games.

With this standardized evidence-based incrementally-improving approach, you could find the teaching methods and audiovisual learning aids which work best for most people. You could also use regression analysis to work out which approaches work best with which demographics and tailor the content to the demographics represented by the school.

I do think good teachers are crucial, but I think their role should be aimed more towards augmenting standardized teaching materials with the ability to answer students' questions and fill in any unexpected gaps in prerequisite knowledge.

Solution 4: Good point regarding having teachers both grade students and teach them. I can see how there's potential for that to cause challenging interpersonal relationships which inhibit learning. It's certainly worth a try to see if splitting up the roles of grading and teaching might improve outcomes.

The only other thing I would add is that I think our testing methodology obviously needs to change substantially to distinguish genuine knowledge and intelligence from good test-preparation. Without more accurate tests, it's challenging to get useful data. Unfortunately, I'm not sure of any good way to do that in a cost-effective way. Any thoughts?

**** Standardization in education works as soon as we can standardize humans. What makes us individuals also makes "one size fits all" solutions suboptimal (for the individual) in many cases.

The ultimate school would have teachers that get to know each pupil and figure out how to stimulate them to perform optimally. The manpower, training and experience needed to achieve that is economically unfeasible until we replace teachers with AIs.

Perhaps a middle road is to give teachers a "toolbag" of standardized teaching and diagnostics methods, and train them to figure out which tools work best for each student.

*** ...Maybe we should do away with the whole conception of a particular place where most of our education takes place, where what we learn is neither determined by necessity nor by interest/curiosity, but instead by authorities who are more interested in making their school look good than in actually teaching well.

Instead of school, maybe we should just make learning a bigger part of everyday life. School teaches kids to think of learning and thinking as boring and difficult. People don't usually go to class because they want to, but rather because they have to. Get rid of school and a lot of kids will probably stop learning to hate learning. Instead of having majors and degrees, just let people learn whatever they want or need to know, and let them keep track of their educational progress by actually demonstrating that they have the knowledge or skills in actual situations like internships or volunteer work or games or whatever. When applying for a job, they could just send their resume without worrying about educational certification because their qualifications will be automatically implied by the stuff on their resume.

I can't see this as a bad thing. It's like saying that you should throw out the practice drills where you run between cones, because running between cones isn't a fundamental part of soccer. The point of learning subjects you're not necessarily interested in is to either train certain mental skills, or to make sure that you do have some basic facts that you might not end up learning anywhere else. If you don't have either school or an educated family that teaches you, how are you going to get far enough in a subject (take math for example) to start seeing the practical uses for it? How are you going to know which subjects are useful to you before studying them? I had no idea that economics would be useful to me until I learned it. Having a curriculum that includes "boring things" helps you avoid the unknown unknowns.

The unfortunate reality is, when left to their own devices most people will just stop learning entirely. From my experience, people think "common sense" is enough to get by on. Why let people get by with the bare minimum of whatever sparks their curiousity? What you've created then is a population that's even /more/ susceptible to harmful pseudo-scientific nonsense.

I think this is somewhat true, but if you really want to learn something, you should always try doing the thing that is closest to the thing you want to learn.

EX: If you want to play good Ultimate Frisbee, play a lot of Ultimate Frisbee. /Then/, if you realize that you need additional distance, practice throwing frisbees for distance. But don't immediately start throwing frisbees for the goal of getting better at playing Ultimate.

****** Hmm... you do make a great point, but working within your analogy I feel like general education is more like lifting weights and fitness training. It's something that isn't as fun as the sport you want to play, but doing it really pays off.

If you take that biology 101 class that you weren't interested in and learn the core principles, then you're not going to think that living things are essentially magic in your daily life and that pays off when you have to make medical and health decisions. If you learn chem 101, you're not going to fall for "spooky scary chemical names" fearmongering, because you know everything's a chemical. Econ 101 teaches opportunity cost, comparative advantage and marginal thinking which no joke changed the way I thought about the world. I know that introductory courses barely scratch the surface of a subject, but they do contain very important ideas.

You might think chem is a garbage course if you're trying to learn computer science, but that's kind of the whole point. You'd never learn chem if left to your own devices, and you'd be a less educated, less informed person because of it. There are big decisions in your daily life that hinge on things you might never bother to learn. Do you support GMO? Vaccinations? How do you choose what to eat if you'd like to be healthy? Do you go with modern or alternative medicine? Should you sign up for cryogenics? Do you support locally produced food? How do you decide whether that weird event that happened was supernatural, or some other factor? There are a million things you have to decide, and if you leave yourself uneducated you're completely flying blind. Your choices are no better than a conglomeration of gut instinct and whatever values your family raised you with. You'll do worse than random chance, and you won't be able to see how your life /could/ have been better if you had invested in yourself by learning "boring things".

Usually general education gives you math, the sciences, social studies, and language arts. I'm not sure you can take away any of those and still come away a well rounded, informed person.

******* I think we don't actually disagree on many points, so I'll just make a few claims and build up from there. You can tell me if I'm assuming things in error.

1) Most people are not super self-motivated to the point where they can go and self-study things on their own.

2) When people self-study something, they tend to get more out of it, be it because of autonomy and other things.

3) Getting to the general level of competence where you need to understand the world may or may not require a broad understanding prior to developing this curiosity about the world.

There also seem to be a few assumptions we're operating off, and I agree with some of them:

1) Because many people aren't good at operating off self-motivation, it's important to set up structures such that they still get some of the benefit of education.

2) If we want people to do well in the world, this requires a general understanding about lots of things in the world.

(Here, I'm unsure if the best place to do this is during compulsory education; most people might not remember it. But if we wait until later on, then it might be too late. Maybe we could find ways to catalyze learners so they become self-motivated earlier?)

Anway, I think this boils down to me trying to make a statement about general learning theory, "To get better at X, you should do lots of X, rather than things merely tangentially related to X,", while you're making a statement about how "Knowing about how lots of things in the world work is necessary to operate well and make good decisions", which i don't disagree with.

Is that roughly about right?

Maybe I should have said useful/necessary instead of just necessary. That would have been more clear.

In any case, are people more likely to learn if you try to force them to? Or will they just regurgitate the teacher's password? How many of the skills or knowledge that you learned in school do you still remember? And of the things you still remember, how much of it is things that were uninteresting or unuseful enough that you did not think it was worth it for you to learn it in the first place?

I bet if there was something you were forced to learn even if you didn't want to, and it wasn't something useful or necessary, then you probably won't remember what it was later. The things you remember are the things you learned willingly or that you still find useful now.

Conceded. To be fair, I /definitely/ don't think the current education system is perfect or even close to perfect. I just think it's better than leaving people to their own devices, because I know too many people that don't value education and would learn absolutely nothing if given the choice. I also will admit that not everything I learned is useful now, and that I've forgotten some of it. However, I do feel like the general principles stuck with me and that they were valuable.

I agree with what you said as an ideal, too. Suppose that we get universal basic income, and every parent is both educated and invested in educating their children in an engaging way. In that case, school would be a horrible idea and you'd have a hard time selling it to anyone. It's just, the situation we have now kind of makes school necessary. Parents have to work, and a lot of them simply aren't educated enough or invested in education enough to help their children become independent learners. So if we got rid of school without changing anything else, we'd be much worse off. That's basically the argument I was making. Also that there is value in learning things you may not be interested in, because you're forced to make a lot of choices in life and being uninformed when you make them leads to having a worse life than you might have otherwise.

I'm all in favor of expanding people's ability to self-teach, but there are limits if you don't have fairly educated people around you to answer questions. There are also safety concerns when it comes to exclusively teaching yourself in order to pick up the skills to do certain jobs. For example, imagine yourself growing up in a household with two parents who never went to college and trying to teach yourself everything you'd need to know to work as a cardiothoracic surgeon, or an aerospace engineer. Considering the prior probability of how unlikely it is that you could succeed at this, there's almost no test we could give you that would give us a high degree of confidence that you've learned enough to avoid killing people in either of those professions.

Even something comparatively simple like learning to become an electrician, or to speak a foreign language can be immensely challenging if you do not have someone to teach you. In general, you can probably learn about 90% of what you might need to know from books and videos alone, but there's still going to be a significant number of gaps where a knowledgeable teacher can spot your mistakes and answer your questions.

With better self-teaching materials, many of these problems may eventually be resolved, but it seems like schools are a necessary evil for now.

*** I can't figure out how to make a medium account on mobile, so I'll put my plan here(I graduated from a private Jewish high school last year,if that helps with my frame of reference) : Two parts: Shrink and specialize. Part 1) Shrink: one of the classic ways to avoid the prisoner's dilemma is to make sure everyone knows what everyone else will do, which allows effective precommitment. Shrinking school and class sizes(as well as taking tests from a curve to a raw system) should change the incentives of students into a PvE rather than PvP contest at least in part. 2: Specialize: Schools, starting from high school onwards, should be more vocational. This solves a lot of the goodhart problem, since much of the reason for the existence of standardized metrics is to let unqualified evaluators evaluate.

** So! I've "finished" my supernatural romance story. (Note: Finished means that there's no new scenes to write, TONs of editing still needs to be done - I'll give it 2 months or so before it's finished for real). Needless to say I'm feeling pretty awesome right now.

I'd like to thank this subreddit and especially [[/u/ccc_037]] for encouraging me to write it and for providing me with so much help and support along the way (even if the support was the ability to shout in the void by posting a comment that never got a reply, it was still very helpful!).

It's at ~50,000 words, 13 chapters over about 110 pages.

Fantasy: Diane Duane's /Young Wizards/ series will make you want to be a better person. Brandon Sanderson is unbelievably prolific and very good with magic systems; plus some free online stuff which is great.

Ursula K LeGuin is probably underappreciated - try /The Dispossessed/, then /A Wizard of EarthSea/ and then /The Left Hand of Darkness/ if you liked it.

*** I'd say give Mark Z. Danielewski a try. His most popular book, by far, is House of Leaves. There's a lot happening in that book, but my best summary of it is that it is a very nontraditional take on a haunted house story.

Danielewski plays with how to arrange text on the page in ways that most authors would never approach, and he is always finding ways to incorporate this into the themes of the book as well as the moods of the scenes. Some find it pretentious and overwrought, but I thought it was an excellent book.

If you have read House of Leaves, give volume 1 of his latest project a shot. It's called the Familiar, and while I'll be honest and say that plot is not a priority in this book in any way, he captures mood like no other.

Even if it's the kind of thing where you read a few chapters of it and end up hating it and never reading it again, Danielewski is someone who should be experienced at least once.

And just to be clear, it has to be in print. Even if he did make his own work available on eReader formats, a LOT would be lost in the translation.

*** I'm currently reading the two-book /A Dirge for Prester John/ series by Catherynne M. Valente. You know the bizarre marginalia that medieval monks would sometimes draw in the margins of illuminated manuscripts? Creatures with faces on their chests and jousting animals, and so on? This series is essentially a novelization of that, with a generous helping of other semi-obscure medieval mythology, and a little bit of Jorge Borges. Good characters and great florid prose, though a bit light on plot.

Speaking of Borges, if you haven't already read his short story collections, I recommend them highly- he told some very clever and surreal stories in a very poetic way.

Italo Calvino also wrote some good experimental stuff, like /Invisible Cities/, which is a travelogue of surreal cities.

If you're in the mood for non-standard sci-fi, one of the most unusual I know of is an obscure author named R. A. Lafferty, who wrote some wildly imaginative and experimental stories with a unique style of prose that reads almost like Mark Twain, or like someone telling Native American folk stories. I'd recommend his anthologies.

Stanislaw Lem also experimented a lot with the genre. /A Perfect Vacuum/, for instance, is a series of reviews of future books.

It's a about a bunch of people who're kind of assholes that rarely learn anything and go on a bunch of gonzo adventures where /anything/ can happen. It's a comedy, first and foremost, but the Myth Arc is actually pretty convoluted and makes a surprising amount of sense.

It's still comfort food entertainment, but there's just so many laughs and insane stories that it has become my my favorite comfort food. Don't expect deep themes or complex characters, expect pure entertainment that consistently delivers on its promise to be "nifty".

** Anyone know something shorter and less move-to-San-Francisco than [[https://www.appacademy.io/][this]] for learning web development? I've probably just about found a new job (finally), but I really do feel like holy shit, I've waaaaay missed out on /most/ of the job market by not learning web.

In related matters, I have to emotionally balance the costs and benefits of my current job options. These are, basically:

- Working in things I like

- Staying in this metro area with my wife

- Industry versus academia

My one standing job offer is a research assistantship, which requires moving away from wife, to do things I really like in academia. I've got an on-site this week with an industrial R&D company I always wanted to work for, but they also require moving even further away. I could get an interview come through for another move-away-for-interesting-work option.

The prospect of actually, physically separating tends to bring both of us to tears and depression. This might be the year to do it, though, since wife is going to be in a new role that will take almost all of her time, in exchange for not enough money.

In related matters, how does someone improve their social skills, specifically reading other people's feelings and feeling "the flow" in groups? Actually, especially that latter one. I'm pretty ok at reading people one-on-one. I'm just worried that my lifelong mal-socialization keeps getting in my way.

Well, the first step is to actually try, and to keep making the effort. Most socially awkward people shoot themselves in the foot by refusing to admit that their social problems are solvable, and by basking in how awesome they are because they don't care about other people's concerns. It sounds like you're pretty okay on that point, though.

As a Bachelor's of Software Engineering student, I'd say the best way to learn web dev or any other form of development is to avoid formal programs and /just do it/ (not that I didn't appreciate/enjoy my program, woo class of 2017!). Pick something to work on and just do it, making sure you look up and learn from resources like Stack Overflow as you run into things you don't understand.

Check out a list like [[https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas][this]] for inspiration.

** Note to self: after seeing /Beauty and the Beast/, I want to know how people would munchkin being the beast. I'll try and remember to post it on the munchkinry thread this week, but because the threads always get posted when I'm asleep I'd love it if anyone would want to post it n my behalf.

*** I'm not sure about munchkining the situation (being the Beast doesn't really give you any obvious advantages), but I know how I'd go about breaking the curse.

The big mistake the Beast made was holing up in his castle. He never went outside, never interacted with anybody. But his "curse" is that he looks different. That's it. Okay, the horns on the live-action version are a little weird, but he isn't deformed. He isn't cursed with coprolalia or bipolar disorder or anything that would affect his social skills as far as I can tell. This is hugely important.

So here's how I'd play it: I'd just show up in town one day and strike up conversations with anybody and everybody. Talk about the weather. Ask how the crops are doing. Make it a point to purchase my food from the market and do my best to make every interaction a positive one. (Which raises the question: where /was/ he getting his food from, anyways?) Act like I have every right to be there in public, /because I do/. Make sure I show up in town at least once a week. Do my best to keep myself from getting distraught when I inevitably fuck up.

Then, once the townspeople have at least a moderately positive impression of me, I'd need to come up with some reason for people to come around to the castle. I suppose that would depend on what needs the village has. I might also want to throw a festival celebrating something or other, but IRL I don't have much experience throwing parties, so I'd probably play that by ear.

Finally, once I have all the groundwork laid, once I'm generally regarded with favor and it's not unusual for people to be seen heading to my castle, I'd probably do my best to sleep with any woman who A) I find attractive, and B) finds me attractive enough to sleep with. IME, it's much easier to transition from a sexual relationship to a romantic/friendly one than it is to transition from friendship to a romantic/sexual relationship. The first steps were just so that the women's social value wouldn't take a hit from being seen associating with me. If it's totally natural to be seen hanging out with me, and lots of people in the village think I'm all right, then there's nothing wrong with heading to my castle so I can show her that cool thing that's totally innocent and not sexual in any way, right?

At this point, I have at least one woman who is into me, who I am into. If I want, I can probably break the curse by just settling down. Or, I could continue /not/ settling down and instead continue with my non-monogamy, though that tends to limit the length of the relationships. It really depends on what I'm after and how I feel. I've got options.

**** It's an excellent strategy, but I think you'd have to avoid the sex part: we're in 1700s France after all, and even if we assume that the average peasant girl wasn't really all about preserving her delicate virginity, you're still a monster. Better to have someone love you for your personality than attempt to get them to bed a beast.

Yuck. Traditional poly relationships are way too much drama for me. I do something I like to call Pickup Artist Polyamory. I don't talk about one woman to another, I don't go on dates with more than one at a time, I don't move in with any of them or share bank accounts or discuss our future, and I change the subject with a wink and a smile if they ask about any other women I see.

EDIT: And yes, that really is less drama than the more traditional approaches. It helps that I'd rather put the relationship on hold and do my own thing than accept verbal attacks from my partner in any way, shape, or form.

Your description sounds more like serial monogamy, but without making certain types of commitments (cohabitation, bank accounts), or perhaps just "dating around". But presumably there's differences that make the moniker you chose feel more appropriate for you. In any event, you do you.

I'm not sure how that's relevant to this conversation. We're talking about what I would do if I were the Beast, not what sex appeal canon-Beast has or doesn't have.

Well it's not monogamy because I'm seeing more than one woman. "Dating around" is pretty close to the truth, actually, although it can imply that eventually I'm looking to settle down (I'm not.) Mostly I chose that term because I identified as a PUA at the time I came up with it.

*** Problem is, it's hard to have evidence for something like that because it's so far outside our experience.

Two schools of thought are essentially:

- A: UFAI will have /super powers/, it will be above us the way we are above ants, you cannot begin to anticipate it

- B: Come on, it'll still be a thing in a box, we can turn it off, we have the button. We are nowhere close to being able to create that super powered AI, we can only make some that are good at Go and are pretty good at telling the difference between a dog and a cat. Like seriously, you are off the deep end to believe what you believe, group A

School of thought B has been likened by the WaitButWhy guy to a spider that says that if its pet human starts getting too big for its britches that they'll starve the human to death by not giving them webs to catch food in, not conceiving that humans might be able to get foods in ways other than webs.

School of thought A is probably likened to the Heaven's Gate cult or something I guess?
