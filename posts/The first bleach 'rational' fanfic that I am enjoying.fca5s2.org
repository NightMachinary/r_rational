just wanted to share.

It's basically a full rewrite of Bleach, characters are similiar but many flaws are fixed, and the story makes a bit more sense that the original.

*Is there anyone else reading it and what is your opinion on that?*


** Does the writing quality increase later on? I'm afraid the first chapter was too jarring for me to get through.

*** Yeah, a lot of typos and grammar problems at first glance. Maybe someone who's reading it could make a list for the author to go over.

The most often repeating one I've seen so far (through the first chapter) is an/a in front of non-silent 'h'. =an hero= -> =a hero=, =an Hollow= -> =a Hollow=, etc.

Edit: also past tense (=didn't went= -> =didn't go=)

**** Also 90% of the time "strength" comes out as "strenght" which is super annoying to me for some reason.

So, it's basically the same story again? I really hate the fanfics where the author insists one going through the "stations of canon", so I guess this one isn't for me.

Not really, no. The characters have the same personality and appearance, but everything else is different, starting with the way Ichigo gains Shinigami powers and moving on from there, to the point that major plot arcs don't happen in the same order; this isn't a "stations of canon" story.
