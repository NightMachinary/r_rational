** I'm honestly surprised there isn't a bot that posts updates...

As always the chapter felt way too short, there was a little bit of the politics of a trained army versus conscripts.

I like the idea of Kato being cut off from his industrial base it might lead to some new discoveries about the nature of magic or a new technology.

*** Yeah, this isn't as popular as the other ones in the sub due to infrequent updates but it's also my favourite.

It strongly reminds me of the early /better/ chapters of Release the Witch, that of rushing up the tech tree to face off against a magically-powerful extinction level threat.
