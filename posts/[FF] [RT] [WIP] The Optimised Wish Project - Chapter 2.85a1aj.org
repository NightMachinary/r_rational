** I'm loving it. I really like how Goku was super impressed with a cloud that could discern morality.

It would be awesome if later he decides that even if the cloud is imbued with knowledge of the objective morality of the universe, that doesn't necessarily mean anything about /human/ morality.

** I literally know the bare minimum about Dragon Ball Z, and yet I still love this story. I especially like how you're managing to portray all the main characters as unique in their own way. I've seen too many 'rational' stories decide that all their characters have to act exactly the same way because they seem to think intelligence correlates with one, and only one, personality type. This story is delightful. I especially like the part where Turtle just straight up told the Old Guy not to play; games are always rigged :)

*** Haha, thanks XD. I guess you risk losing a couple of jokes here and there if you don't know Dragon Ball, but shouldn't be anything game-breaking.

As a personal advice however I'd suggest you try reading the original Dragon Ball manga. Even if you don't like the epic planet-shattering throwdowns of what we know as Dragon Ball Z (the manga is all a single thing, that's an anime denomination), early Dragon Ball is just a delight. The art and composing are amazing and the story is a fun and lighthearted adventure that slowly grows into a darker battle manga. But until aliens and stuff are introduced it stays a rather down-to-Earth story, more of a homage to Hong Kong kung-fu movies than a sci-fi epic, and the conflicts feel more grounded with more realistic stakes because Goku is /not/ the strongest around yet. Battles are decided by tricks and small details, not by who has the newest transformation or screams the loudest.

**** Yeah theres a couple of typos. Since fanfiction.net doesn't allow copying text out the trivial inconvenience of typing them out by hand is rather high - when you start posting on archiveofourown you'll get typo threads.

***** I actually write the stuff down in Typora, using markdown, then export to plain HTML and upload to FF.net. Works like a charm, but for some reason I must have confused my files, probably didn't re-export after fixing the typos or something. Now I tried to fix it on FF.net but they don't update immediately anyway so I need to wait.

** I was delighted by this little bonmot: (emphasis added) “On second thought, realised Bulma, a big tree trunk crashed right in the middle of the *road* as if to purposefully stop any vehicles passing by should have rung all sort of alarms in her head. She realised she really ought to do some work on her *street* smarts.”

That being said I have to wonder: there're a few things that make me think you're a non-native speaker. Word choice (“Lineaments” in particular is a word I'd rarely use in English, but would think of much more readily in my native tongue), turns of phrase (“Lunchtime had come, and passed” instead of “Lunchtime had come and gone”), and the way you insist on /yadda yadda.” said X/, employing the full stop in direct speech even though so [[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/punctuation/punctuation-in-direct-speech][many]] [[http://www.grammaring.com/punctuation-in-direct-speech][style]] [[http://writingwithaesop.blogspot.de/2011/01/punctuation-quoted-speech.html][guides]] handle it differently I'm fairly sure it's an actual rule.

***** Well, not really, it's very powerful and very convenient, true, but it /does/ hit a cap during the Namek arc in the end, and is basically never heard of any more for pureblood Saiyans. Though basically it is used to explain how Cell managed to come back as Perfect after his explosion (but in that case he experienced an extreme degree of regeneration that no Saiyan could).

** I dig it.

I'm not sure about Bulma's trick though. Sure by the rules she would get the ball but she lied when she was explaining the rules(told him that he would get what he wanted during the game) so since Roshi isn't like magically bound he could just refuse.

***** I mean... yeah, I considered it as an option, but I found it a bit iffy to have Bulma be so squeamish about herself, and then basically pimp out other women. She's not the most morally solid character, and it's not like any of that would be technically illegal or unethical as long as the women are paid and consenting (and Roshi keeps his hands to himself), but I guess I imagined her more as wanting to give Roshi a lesson by leaving him with nothing at all. Ultimately, I may have let the Rule of Fun take the precedence there.
