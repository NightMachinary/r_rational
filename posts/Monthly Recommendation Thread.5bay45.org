** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-of-love-and-justice-dka-au-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper.32279/]] Dungeon Keeper of Love and Justice, a recursive fanfic of Dungeon Keeper Ami I've been liking. It isn't anywhere near as far along, but it's well written and creative. Unlike most fics, it has gone so far as to actually break the status quo by loosening up the masquerade, and it doesn't do so in a way that seems forced at all. The characters behave consistently, which is another big bonus.

Definitely in the category of With This Ring, Worm, or Time Braid; something super long that I basically couldn't put down, with plenty of meaty analysis and high powered super-heroics. I did end up watching a few youtube videos about DK so I could visualize things better. Not nearly as dark as Worm or Time Braid, but more so perhaps than WTR (although the idealism of Ami shines through a bit more than with Paul from WTR, who is a decent bloke but has to frame all of this ideals through a self-interest filter).

I also feel like you're conflating the world as viewed by Trissiny, and the world as the author actually builds it. Yes, Trissiny is naive and judgemental for at least the first 10 books.

Obviously I caught the fact that Trissiny is supposed to be "too judgemental". The author isn't actually subtle about any of his points. That doesn't change the fact that the only guy in the whole story who is allowed to be critical of feminism (without suddenly becoming, or having been an evil rapist all along) is the transman (I guess he has enough "oppression points"). The female characters are of course allowed to criticize whatever they want.

Related to the above, the only people who are even allowed to believe that men and women can be different is a cult of the worst strawman "internet misogynists" you could find. They are, of course, proven morally wrong somewhere in +chapter+ book 10.

**** The main character is a young woman who's a Paladin of the deity of justice, war, and feminism. She enrolls in a school led by one of the most powerful, and willfull, adventurer-mages. Together with the rest of the class they go on adventures (sometimes controlled by the professors of the school, sometimes not), and in the meantime you and the characters learn a lot about the surrounding world.

That's the intro, the rest is partially spoilering, partially less about the plot and more about how the events change the world views of the characters and help them grow.

Also, the humour. A couple characters are genuinely funny, in varied ways.

Generally the first chapters are a bit slow (though still enjoyable to me), and the plot really picks up in the second part of book one. So if you're enjoying the setting but want more action in the first 5-6 chapters, you'll probably be satisfied with the rest of the story.

No, it's been only /eleven months/ since [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3vk7ku][the first thread]]. We have to wait for the /thirteenth/ thread before celebrating.

--------------

I found /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72199][Off Armageddon Reef]]/, the first book in [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/58713][the /Safehold/ series]], to be fairly entertaining. The premise is as follows:

#+begin_quote
  For millennia, an alien species has been exterminating every other species that rises to technological prominence in the galaxy. It detects and destroys most of human civilization, but not before the humans manage to establish a hidden colony, named Safehold, with instructions to avoid sending out any radio transmissions for about 400 years, before reaching a technology level high enough to destroy the aliens in one fell swoop. (As far as can be told from outside, the aliens haven't made even a single improvement to their spaceships in literally millennia, so there's no danger of the aliens' outpacing anything that the humans could do.)

  However, there's a snag: The administrators of Safehold turn out to be megalomaniacs. While the colonists are in stasis, the admins brainwash them to think that they've never known anything but a medieval existence, and that the admins are the archangels of a religion whose principles include the avoidance of certain technologies (ones that would attract the aliens' attention with radio signals). Without any knowledge of the aliens, these humans will eventually break the religion's precepts and attract the aliens' attention without actually having grown powerful enough to defeat the aliens--or never break the religion's precepts at all.

  One dissenting admin manages to hide on the planet a robot (that looks perfectly human, but has greatly-improved abilities) that contains a copy of the mind of a friend, along with some supplies. The robot's duty, when it wakes up 750 years later (centuries after the admins have died--and after Safehold /should/ have become technologically-advanced again): To break the hold of the rogue admins' religion on the Safeholdians, and to prepare them for the alien threat.
#+end_quote

Rather irksomely, all the characters' names are spelled weirdly, to represent how the English that all Safeholdians speak has drifted over the centuries--=Erayk= for =Eric=, =Zherald= for =Gerald=, =Haarahld= for =Harold=, etc. Still, the story is fun enough.

  "Around that."

  "How?"

  Daphne frowned. "Yes, how? I mean, when we talked about this before I just accepted it, but it does seem a lot."

  Harry paused in his tapping. "Well, look at it this way. A house elf can do the work of two full adult wizards. A normal adult wizard's salary for menial work of the kind that house elves do is around 15,000 pounds a year, that's about three hundred Galleons. Following?"

  Hermione and Daphne nodded.

  He continued. "And a house elf can work for upwards of fifty years. That means that when you buy a house elf you're buying around one hundred years of labor in advance."

  Hermione frowned. "But wouldn't that mean that a house elf should cost 1.5 million pounds then?"

  "No, because the value of one years worth of labor in fifty years is much less than one years worth of labor now."

  "But, how do you figure that out?"

Like if we lived in a world where you could buy automatic haircut machines, they would drive down the price of human-cut hair until they reached equilibrium with auto-cut hair, which we could then use as information about how much it cost to create the automatic hair cutter (or at least, how much it was being sold for, which in a competitive market should be only slightly higher than the build cost).

In other words, if it cost tuppence to "make" a house elf, menial labor done by a wizard wouldn't be worth 300 galleons a year. (Barring, as you said, a house elf monopoly, regulatory schemes, etc.)

Or, alternatively, having your hair cut by a human would become a status signal and the price would go up (but only rich people would be doing it, and everyone else would be using automatic hair cutting machines). Or humans would stop cutting hair, and change to more rewarding jobs. (probably both).

I guess I'm mostly finding it unlikely that there's still wizards competing with house elves for menial households jobs.
