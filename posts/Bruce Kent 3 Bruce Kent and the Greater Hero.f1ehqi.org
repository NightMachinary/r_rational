That said, "Pyrofessor" and "Inacan" are groan-inducing puns whose existence makes all other puns worse off. Boo! It reminded me of a quote, by you or another rationalist, saying something vaguely along the lines of "This pun is so bad that it will be cursed until the heat death of the universe".

**** ... That's my point.

Mongoose* can stay sane by being Hegadi, who no one actually expects anything from. As far as anyone is concerned, Hegadi is just some guy with a good excuse to always be running off whenever the Mongoose* is needed.

Bruce Kent doesn't have that. There's nowhere he can go to escape from the presumption that he is the Mongoose*. The first story shows that he can't have an honest love life, as, if he tells the truth, people will assume he's lying. The second story shows that he can't have a normal work life: people will try to unmask him, or otherwise treat him as if he's someone he's not. And this third story shows that he can't even run errands without being in the Mongoose's* shadow.

Superman can escape being Superman by becoming Clark Kent. Batman can hang up his cowl and be Bruce Wayne. Mongoose* can put on his thong and just be Hegadi the mediocre.

Bruce Kent has no escape from who people think he is, a presumption so powerful that the person who /really is/ who people think Bruce Kent is calls it a superpower in its own right.

And maybe the commenter who said that Mongoose's* sanity is more important than Bruce Kent's is right. But it's still a shame, if not outright hypocritical, that Mongoose* gets to go home and be unimportant for a while, where "the greater hero" never, /ever/, gets that opportunity.

He does not have the stress of actually having a hidden identity. A conflict of being two things. He can at least be honest with people saying he is who he is. No cognitive dissonance, he does not have to deal with living a double life.

But no. I do not accept his superhero status. Someone doing something heroic does not make him a superhero, and not being immune to bullets makes him a bit less of a superhero, as it is more about the powers, and consistently getting the heroing done.

BW plays the "spoiled rich kid" (a kind of unimportance) all the time. Look at the scene in /Begins/ where the girls on his arm start swimming in a fountain, and he buys the hotel when the concierge asks them to stop.

BK, on the other hand, probably wouldn't be asked to stop, for fear that this is all one of the Mongoose's* plans, and they might disrupt it by intervening.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Look at the scene in the bank. BK /can't/ just be who he honestly is, the billionaire playboy. He has to take into account what people will think of the Mongoose* when choosing how to act. Whereas when BW takes off the cowl, the fact that they won't associate his behaviour with Batman is /entirely the point/.

#+begin_quote
  He can at least be honest with people saying he is who he is. No cognitive dissonance, he does not have to deal with living a double life.
#+end_quote

Yes, he can be honest. And everyone thinks he's a liar for it. They react with "one part sheer incredulity, and two parts also sheer incredulity." If he values honesty as a virtue, then it has to sting that it's a virtue that no one will /ever/ associate with him.

I disagree entirely that he doesn't have a double life. Someone without a double life wouldn't have to disappear whenever the Mongoose* was active, or risk his life to stop someone from getting hurt at a bank robbery.

And it's fair to think that's not superheroism. But I /don't/ think it's fair to say that his identity as "guy who everyone thinks is the Mongoose*" is not causing him the same kind of stress an actual superhero would experience. Especially when there's no one he can go to with his problems who will believe him. And, even if there were, /he still couldn't/ because that would require compromising the secret that he's just a body double for the Mongoose*, which would put Hegadi's identity in danger.

** story idea:

A few years ago a man named Clark Wayne walked into a police station and confessed to being the Feminine Falcon; arch-nemesis of the Mongoose. He plead guilty to all charges, and knew the details of many crimes that could only be known to the Falcon herself. He is now serving a life sentence, avoiding the death penalty only because he turned himself in.

But of course everybody, including Bruce, knows Wayne is innocent. The Falcon must have bribed, threatened, brainwashed, mind-controlled or otherwise convinced Wayne to pose as her, in order to further some byzantine plot. The Falcon must still be out there, biding her time.

Facing public outcry, the president has pardoned Wayne for all the crimes he confessed to. But Wayne does not want to leave prison, and so wishes to confess to more crimes, but he will only speak to Bruce Kent.

Bruce is bent on getting this poor patsy out of prison. Clark wants to stay. A battle of wits ensues.

** Short story idea for #4:

The Setup: Continuing from #1, Bruce Kent is still looking for a date. He's finally found the woman of his dreams - besides whatever else he's looking for in a romantic partner, She seems to truly believe him when he says he isn't the Masculine Mongoose.

The Conflict: ... which is unnerving, because, after all, *everybody knows* that Bruce Kent == Masculine Mongoose. Suddenly Bruce and his date switch roles from #1, as he is put in the position of having to explain to her all the circumstantial evidence, getting increasingly confused why she just doesn't believe him.

The Development: Bruce tries to find out why she so adamantly takes his words at face value (insanity? gullibility? hidden motives?), possibly with some assistance by the Mongoose who after all has a tangential interest in the trustworthiness of Bruce's romantic partners.

The Resolution: The date fails or succeeds, and Bruce ultimately decides whether to continue this relationship - whichever result is preferred by the author.

---

The Optional Twist (if such a thing is even necessary in this short story): In a superhero setting, naturally the romantic interest has a mask identity: she's a villainess, maybe even one who has fought the Masculine Mongoose before.

Her inability to accept staggeringly obvious notions like Bruce Kent == Masculine Mongoose stems from a side effect of her meta powers, for instance an extreme form of empiricism, or because she takes Bayesian inference very seriously but somehow had a prior of 0 for this hypothesis, so no amount of evidence could persuade her.

She could have hidden motives for the date, but the story might work better without any. She's there in her civilian identity, after all.

In the eyes of the public, the robbery unfortunately happened when he was in his civilian non-meta identity. And since the Mongoose follows the mask code so religiously that he'd never reveal his identity, preventing violence in exchange for a promise not to catch the villain was the best he could do.

Of course, in actual fact, the Mongoose wasn't even present and thus couldn't prevent the robbery, but the promise stands.

*** Deliberate, concerted effort on the part of both Bruce and the Goose, no doubt.

I imagine it included, at minimum:

- Bruce Kent vanishes every time the Mongoose needs to be somewhere. (Arranging for a couple of these vanishings to be from very public places - such as large billionaire-style parties - would have been easy, Bruce just needs to party until the Goose calls his watch).
- Every time the Mongoose obtains some monetary reward for stopping some terrible crime, the cash appears in Bruce Kent's bank account. Bruce Kent has no other source of income.
- Bruce Kent might occasionally 'slip up' and mention some things that very few people aside from the Mongoose knows.

So Bruce Kent wouldn't appear to be someone who is Mongoose in a way that you can pinpoint directly (like no other source of income), he'd have a plausible cover story for everything - one that would make him look like Mongoose while nevertheless preserving plausible deniability.

  Why?
#+end_quote

All they did, so far, is consistent with Bruce Kent being a normal person and at the same time with him being secretly Mongoose, rather than it only being consistent with him being secretly Mongoose.

E.g. Bruce Kent wore a bulletproof shirt. He appeared to be in pain from what seemed to be a broken rib. He carefully navigated the conversation with his date in a way that can be interpreted both ways. If someone questioned why he's not leaving in an ambulance, I'm sure there would be a baseline-human-compatible explanation (like Bruce Kent still being in danger). Etc.

This is possibly because Mongoose has a reputation for being intelligent, and if there was an obvious "oversight" like Bruce Kent getting money from nowhere at the same time Mongoose gets money, his intelligent enemies could suspect he's trying to throw off his less intelligent adversaries by creating a false appearance of being Bruce Kent... but that's just my guess.

******* The only reason that everything surrounding Bruce Kent is consistent with Bruce Kent being a normal person is because Bruce Kent /is/ a normal person. He's agreed to - and is being paid to - be the Mongoose's public 'secret' identity, and he does so so convincingly that Professor Pyrofessor would rather believe he can fool her voice analysis software than that he's not the 'Goose, so there must be /some/ incredibly suggestive evidence somewhere.

And I'm sure it's not as blatant as the 'Goose depositing money directly into Bruce's accounts. It probably passes through a bunch of steps to get there, to obscure its source. But every time the 'Goose gets a large amount of money, a week or two later Bruce Kent's bank account gets bigger... sure, Bruce can claim it's "an investment that paid off, just coincidentally at the same time" but who will believe that?

It might be also plausible that the revenue from this investment will be verifiable by a third party (or its unverifiability will have a plausible explanation too).

In reality, what might be going on is that Mongoose helped Bruce to invest intelligently - deliberately just enough to obtain the right about of money, and this is Bruce's payment. Meanwhile, Mongoose kept the money /he/ got and invested into e.g. a better supersuit - but better in a non-obvious way (for which there is nevertheless some "evidence").

(Edit: Or something else.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That's a good point - if there is always plausible deniability, what tipped off everyone in the first place to notice Bruce Kent "is" Mongoose?

I think it's possible the evidence was in public long enough for everyone to notice - and so, when the plausible explanation (that provided Bruce Kent with plausible deniability) finally came to light, it was "too late" - everyone already "knew" he was Mongoose.

(Edit: The explanation being "too late" might itself have an explanation.)

#+begin_quote
  I couldn't go on being a millionaire playboy without the Mongoose's money. But I've saved up enough that I wouldn't need to go back to work.
#+end_quote

So it's clear that there is a direct money flow from the 'Goose to Bruce, and it only makes sense that they'd use that to suggest that Bruce is the 'Goose. (In Part 3, I note that the 'Goose is officially known to pay Hegadi 'standard meta-on-call rates', described as enough that he doesn't need to work but not millionaire playboy levels, which implies that that's all he's keeping. Though, of course, anything invested /as/ the 'Goose, e.g. into a better supersuit, can also be spent from Bruce's share).

And it's very possible that Bruce's only official explanation for where he gets his money from is "none of your business", which is more suggestive evidence that he's the 'Goose.

The payoff, in case of success, isn't merely a successfully executed trick, but

1. Having your identity hidden (if a villain meets you on the street, they not only they won't hurt you because of the code, but also won't know it's you)
2. Being safe from the possibility of investigation (everyone "knows" you're Bruce Kent, so who would even start an investigation into your identity?)

The advantage of pulling this off successfully is enormous, so giving away almost all of his money to achieve this advantage isn't strange.

But maybe there are some reasons why nobody would suspect that.

************* Oh, yes. The payoff /is/ enormous - safety for his family and loved ones.

But the reason why it would take a rare enemy to spot that is because your average supervillain cares a whole lot more about cash than about family. And it takes a rare /person/ to really, carefully consider the consequences of someone else having a completely different utility function; most people find it easy to implicitly assume that everyone else is just like them.
