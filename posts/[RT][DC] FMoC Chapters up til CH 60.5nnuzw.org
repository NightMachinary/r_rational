Strivon, Lancent, and Potato Connoisseur have been translating this daily now! Can't get enough of this awesome story!

[[https://friendshipispower.wordpress.com/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation-chapters/][Link to chapters here]]


** I strongly prefer to not have cryptic abreviations in titles.

Edit: and am thus much less willing to click such a link.

*** Maybe a clever ploy to avoid broadcasting that the title of the story uses "millenniums" instead of "millennia"?

**** Hi SvalbardCaretaker, I can understand your willingness not to click on obscure titles.

Forty Milenniums is a regular feature here, though, and as it's got a fairly long title, it tends to be abbreviated in chapter posts / discussion. I assumed most people had seen prior chapters and did this link on a quick whim; no one's posted the updates to here in a while.

But I also see your general-level point of steering away from abbreviations in general for good communication, which I agree with.

***** Regulars will typically get abreviations, however to attract new readers the full title is much better. Do what you feel is best, just wanted to give feedback.

***** Think you accidentally replied to the wrong comment. I was just making a joke. If you /did/ intend to reply to my comment so as not to break the comment chain, but wanted [[/u/SvalbardCaretaker]] to notice it, make sure you include the "/u/" before the username.

Cheers!
