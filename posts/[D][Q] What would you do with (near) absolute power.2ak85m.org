So I'm currently working on a piece of rational fiction were at the beginning of the story 5 billion people are given the power to transmute energy and matter of any form into any other form. There are two downsides to this though.

1. Should you over commit and use more energy than is currently in your possession the spell will start to draw on your internal energy and mass.
2. You can only move 2.1*10^{15} joules of energy per second and 25% of your starting energy is irreversibly removed from the local system.
3. You can only control/move energy and mass in a 500 meter sphere around yourself.

This is the kind of thing that I feel is right up [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s alley so what would you do with the power?

Become a one man solar panel for the planet alleviating a large amount of our energy consumption needs? End world hunger by directly transmuting fat muscle and all other necessary material for life into people and circumventing bodily needs? Become a dictator by destroying everyone who opposes you by unleashing a death ray with near unstoppable force (who am I kidding this is [[/r/rational]] you'd find an easier and more energy efficient way to rule the world)?

** I'm going to need a whole bunch of clarification on the rules here.

1. What does it mean to say that energy or mass is "in your possession"?
2. Can I convert matter to antimatter?
3. Can I in any other way exceed the joule limit by producing two kinds of matter that react to create more usable energy?
4. How much control do I have over the end result of the mass I create? Could I convincingly create organic matter (like wood, for example)?
5. I kind of suck at physics - what does the energy limit imply about my ability to transmute matter?
6. Is it possible to erect defenses that have a consistent drain on my power limits?
7. How much thought and focus does it take to use my power?

From a story standpoint, I have to wonder why so many - the majority of the population gets this power, which means it's going to be really hard to actually be a dictator, since there are equally powered people that can stop you.

1. The power recognizes you (your body and everything inside of it like food, body heat, nerve electricity, bacteria, and air) as well as anything made of matter by the power, unless you declare that it is outside your possession.
2. Yes you can, though I'm rather curious as to why you would.
3. No you can not.
4. You could create organic matter, but you would have to understand its cellular construction down to the atom.
5. It implies that you can work with one ounce of matter at a time. It also implies that I'm a moron and that the wording needs to be tightened up on the second rule.
6. Yes and its one of the basic spells that is built into the power.
7. Basic speech should be enough to concentrate you mental focus.

And from a story stand point your right, it would be bloody difficult to rule over that many people. But if you did control that many people with that kind of power they might make a pretty good army against a foe that can devourer raw energy and matter to make exact replicas of themselves. Or it might end in everyone dying.

***** I like this, its exactly the kind of thing that I would expect from you guys once you got over the fact that you could accidentally blow up the planet. However I think your over estimating how fast you can think in a clear logical patter.

You have to supply each spell with the exact information on what you want done. You can create "functions", if you will, that are large spells tied to a short word combination, but you would still need to set up a function that is tied to each kind of cell in your body.

If you wanted to brute force the spell and list out the exact molecular placement of each individual molecule of your body, that would take a much longer period of time than if you created a set of functions to create a "generic" of each one of your cells.

Also while you could scan your entire body rather quickly (the spell would probably be as easy as "locate and identify the exact atomic and energy composition of my being with relevant data points being particle locations, amount of energy in joules and relative direction each particle is traveling in.") you would have to store that information somewhere, and I would recommend against uploading it to your brain directly, as I could see that frying your brain in short order.

There are a few other minor things like setting up livable conditions in space, the fact that you can't directly interact with anyone else who has this power since they are in their own possession, nor could you directly interact with their constructs. Most of these are just time limitations and should be easily circumvented with enough thought through.

Lets say that we did have Maxwell's two chambers and demon set up. You then proceed to pull out all the heat energy from the high entropy side but then the system as a whole has lost that energy. The demon could constantly switch out the molecules for ones that now, comparatively, have a higher amount of energy but at the end of the day you would eventually run out of raw energy in the entire system.

I do think you may be conflating some aspects of temperature with some aspects of energy; 'cause you can totally get free energy with this power.

Imagine you find yourself at the heat death of the universe--maximum entropy, no usable energy. The background temperature is like 5 Kelvins or something, I dunno. You make a 500 meter wide shell of heat engines, and stop nearly all molecular motion on the inside of that shell. As long as you keep the inside colder than the outside, the heat gradient will let the machines do work. So, free cooling==free energy.

************* Alright I'm going to break down how I believe a heat engine works and I need you to point out my flaw. If I can figure out a way to get rid of this exploit I will, but if it's inherently going to be a part of the power then I want my characters to abuse the hell out of it. So here we go.

Lets assume we have a heat engine, one that transmutes a system with maximum entropy into usable work energy.

Using the diagram from before we have T^{h} which has 2 heat units and T^{c} which has zero. The engine sends heat energy though, Q^{H} ,and produces 0.05 units of work energy, W. Both sides now have .975 units of heat and we have made 0.05 units of work energy.

Now lets say we pulled out entropy from T^{c} and added it to W, making W= 0.78125 due to the quarter of lost energy. Now since there is an imbalance between T^{h} and T^{c} the engine starts up again and we go through the process once again.

To be overly technical with the terminology, you can't do that. A heat engine only works if you know where to find a heat gradient--and area of higher temperature, and an area of lower temperature. But that system is the one we're both talking about, so it's only a terminology quibble.

Yup, this is it. Without magic, it takes work to create a heat gradient where none previously existed. If you can just magically stop molecules in their tracks, you get free energy.

Looking at it from the old "billiard ball model" of molecular interactions makes it more intuitively accessible than statistical thermodynamics, I think: Put a rigid divider in the middle of a pool table with fast-moving balls on one side, and slow-moving balls on the other side, and you'll be able to extract work from it until the speed of the balls is equalized.

If one side of the table is guaranteed to always have balls moving at /some/ finite speed (like it is, in our universe), and you're able to completely stop the balls on the other side, you'll always be able to extract work from the rigid divider.

*************** Ah okay, but here's the thing. After running the system until there is effectively 0 heat units in T^{h} and T^{c} then W would only be about 1.5 units of energy. We decreased entropy by a significant margin but we lost potential of .5 units. If we were to reconvert, say, one unit of the work energy back into heat to start the process over again then we would lose .25 from our remaining .5 work energy, leaving a potential of 1.25 in the system.

With this system you could create a large amount of actual usable energy, true, but we've still lost heat from the system and thus the potential to create more energy is lost.

But this is called "doing work." Heat--useless molecular movement--is what energy--useful molecular movement--turns into when it's used to do work.

That's why the cooldown is an exploit: You take a .25 tax for creating energy using the power, but not for using things created by the power in a physics-abiding way. The only way you couldn't chain your way up to infinite energy is if you started with your entire environment at absolute zero; in which case you'd also be inconvenienced by being dead.

***************** Alright here is we are disagreeing. Lets instead say that instead of moving the energy from T^{c} into W we moved it back into T^{h} at the end of each cycle.

We would still produce 1.5 units of work energy. This is the same amount of energy that would be produced if you used the power to directly convert the entropy.

Now lets say we used that energy and it returned to an entropic state, useless for any other purpose. If it was all back in T^{h} then we have 1.5 units that would eventually produce 1.125 units of of work energy.

Your assuming that the cooling process is free but you have to use the entropic heat in a spell to move it, even if that spell is simply moving that energy form T^{c} to T^{h} . Meaning that you would eventually hit 0 in T^{c} , T^{h} , and W.

Even if you introduced more heat by dispersing matter into raw entropy, or use it in a spell and then process that again, but eventually

In order for a spell to determine an information based value it must be able to have a way to calculate by moving matter around.

Lets take your purposed question of determining if the number of primes between 1 and 10^{10^{10^{100}}} is even or odd. To determine if a number is prime or not you would have to set up a spell to move particles around to say if a number is prime or not.

So lets say it wants to calculate if seven is prime or not. I would move 7 particles into one specified area. Next it will remove particles in lots of 1 to 7. For example for 2 it would remove two particles at a time until it can't remove two particles at a time.

If for every number of lots the calculation area is not empty then it will add a particle to the group of particles that total the number of primes found.

Once done it will find if the number of remaining particles is even or odd, and move your stone in one direction or another.

  In the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_thermal_and_statistical_physics][philosophy of thermal and statistical physics]], *Maxwell's demon* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment][thought experiment]] created by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist][physicist]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell][James Clerk Maxwell]] to "show that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics][Second Law of Thermodynamics]] has only a statistical certainty". It demonstrates [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell][Maxwell]]'s point by hypothetically describing how to violate the Second Law: a container of gas molecules at equilibrium is divided into two parts by an insulated wall, with a door that can be opened and closed by what came to be called "Maxwell's demon". The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_(thought_experiment)][demon]] opens the door to allow only the faster than average molecules to flow through to a favored side of the chamber, and only the slower than average molecules to the other side, causing the favored side to gradually heat up while the other side cools down, thus decreasing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy][entropy]].

** So I get 23 grams of matter per second, or half a megaton of TNT worth of bang. 30 Hiroshimas per second. With antimatter, I can double that to 60 Hiroshimas per second. Per person. For /5 billion people/. Oh that's not going to end well.

I don't understand the rules. Say I transmute 23 grams of nitrogen in the air into 23 grams of botulinum toxin. What exactly happens? Do I end up with 23 grams? Or 17 grams, after 25% vanishes? Since I'm "using" energy beyond what is "in my possession", do I lose 23 grams of fat? Or 31 grams of fat, 23 vanishing to fuel the transmutation and 25% of that 31 vanishing just because? Or do I lose just 6 grams of fat, 25% of the amount I'm transmuting? Do I get to choose between losing 6 grams of fat or 6 grams of nitrogen? Or do I lose an arm and a leg, 25% of my /total/ starting mass-energy? Does the resulting botulinum toxin count as "mine", able to be transmuted without further losses beyond the 75% efficiency limit?

What's my range? Can I transmute nitrogen on the other side of the planet? North Korea's nitrogen, say? Or Washington DC's? Or your lungs'?

If I dump 4.5*10^{12} joules of kinetic energy into a 1 kg rock, how fast is it going? If it started with 0 and I pushed it to 4.5*10^{12}, then it goes from rest to 0.01c. But from the reference frame where it started at 0.5c, it started with 1.4*10^{16} joules. My push is several significant digits down, and now it's going 0.50007c. That reference frame would say that its initial rest frame now sees it going 0.00009c, not 0.01c. Different reference frames disagree on changes in kinetic energy for the same difference in speed. Do I just always affect things in my own reference frame, or in theirs, and let relativistic observers see me violating the joule limit?

They sure as hell aren't wrong, and I can most defiantly see some well meaning idiot scientist wanting to see just what would happen if they transmute the limit into local heat radiation.

Now then as for the questions:

1. If you were to specify that you wanted to use only 23 grams of nitrogen to create 23 grams of botulinum toxic (an interesting choice in toxic as well) it would use some of your heat energy ( exact number is a bit difficult to calculate, the power tries not to kill you and will only take as much as you can spare) and body fat to create the rest of the 23 grams, so a little less than 6 grams of fat will be lost. And yes now that botulium toxin counts as yours and, unless you give up your possession of it, it can't be affected by another person with this power.

2. Your range is inside a +500 yard+ 500 meters sphere with you in the center. And yes the air in an average person's lungs is fair game, but not one who as the power.

3. The power is personal so it would be affect from your personal frame of reference. It would assume that you wanted to add 0.01c of speed from your frame of reference and it would continue to pull energy until, from your initial rest frame, you see it going .01c. If you weren't holding it still, however, the object would leave your sphere of influence before it was able to build up to to .01c. (Sorry I don't have a strong enough understanding in absolute relativistic frame works to be more accurate. You have given me quite the reading list though so I thank you for that.)

Its removed from the univese and is given to an all consuming self-replicating hive mind, which, if we were to continue to computer coding analogy, is the multiverse's equivalent of garbage collection. Except it glitched and it believes that it needs to de-allocate everything, not just universes in which entropy is increasing too fast.

As for how each command is phrased, there are a few fail-safes. The phrase "Turn all of this into gold" even combined with a pointing gesture is too vague to be executed. Is the user pointing at the ground? A leaf? The air particles below his fingers?

"Turn the ground beneath my feet into gold" is also too vague to work. How far below his feet? Just the immediate layer or all the way to bedrock? Does he mean the entire flat surface within his sphere of influence?

"Turn all matter within my radius that is denser than breathable air into gold" would be one to look out for. The user needs to give the power something they have a firm grasp on, in order for the spell to execute. The words are mostly a focus for the neural net of the brain, words like this and those and these are all very loosely defined in our brain and we wouldn't be able to define it. Or we would have to many vague little thoughts that would interfere with the casting.

Also the power is only able to work with an ounce of matter at a time. Even if your only making minor modifications, like say adding an electron to every atom, the spell can only work with one ounce of matter in a second. Hopefully someone would notice if, where ever someone went, there were golden patches popping up around them and take action.

**** On point 3... that's really problematic once I start applying kinetic energy to myself. The problem is, I am always at rest in my own reference frame, 0 m/s, 0 joules kinetic energy. The equation for classical, non-relativistic kinetic energy K is K = mv^{2}/2, which we can reverse to v = sqrt(2K/m). I'm applying some power P per unit time t, so the equation I'm using is v = sqrt(2Pt/m). For simplicity, let's do everything in arbitrary units; I weigh 1 mass-unit, I'm applying a power of 1 power-unit. I have no idea what units time and velocity are in, but it doesn't matter. In these units, my velocity is v = sqrt(2t). After 1 time-unit, my velocity is sqrt(2) units, ~1.4, measured from my original rest frame.

But I'm not in my original rest frame. In my reference frame, I'm always at rest. I was at rest when I was halfway through accelerating. Let's run those numbers again... At time 0.5, my velocity is 1. In my new reference frame, I do that again, for another 1 velocity. An inertial observer sees both those velocities stacking, for a final velocity of 2 units.

Uh-oh.

You can see the problem if you look at the shape of the graph of my speed, the simple sideways parabola. I will always see myself as getting that first tiny 1/n slice n times in 1 time-unit, and the first infinitesimal slice is /vertical/. An outside observer will see my velocity go to infinity in an instant. In practice, my time step probably can't actually get infinitesimal, so I won't get to infinity, and relativity will limit me to the speed of light. But I'll get really close, instantly.

Whereupon I will slam into the environment with near-infinite relative energy. Kaboom.

******** The problem is that I've told my power to increase my kinetic energy, and no matter how much power it pumps in, I will never see any increase. From my rock example, you said that it will keep going until it looks right to /me/. I see myself use a little energy to accelerate a rock, and a really fast observer sees me use a lot of energy for the same effect. Same thing. I see myself use zero energy, and everyone else sees me use infinite energy.

The correct term is probably "inertial reference frame", and you'd have to put limits on how often I can change frames. If I'm allowed to stop and start every planck time, then bad things are still going to happen. If I can only get a new reference frame by calling a spell manually, that's probably fine. I can still get impressive speeds very quickly. but I won't swallow the universe. (Straight acceleration can get me to 0.02c in one second. Using the incantation "ah" ten times a second to accelerate until the next time I say "ah", which will also cast another instance of the spell, brings that up to 0.08c.)

********** So if I try to apply 10,000 joules of thermal energy to 0.5 kg of soup, I'll fail. Even though I'm only trying to /move/ 10,000 joules, I'm trying to /affect/ more than my limit. Hmm.

In general, there are equal numbers of protons, neutrons, and electrons in an object. The proportion of my mass that is electrons will be about equal to the proportion of the combined mass of those three particles is the electron. Both protons and neutrons are about 1 atomic mass unit, and electrons are about 5.5*10^{-4}, then there's some energy on top of that, let's generously say that adds 1%. So, electrons account for 0.03% of the mass of the object. This means that, as long as you are less than 86 kg, the total mass of your electrons is less than 23 grams.

Now, electrons are what mediate interactions between atoms, mostly. They hold molecules together and the like. By altering the energy of electrons, you can get molecules to hold together even when they have no business doing so. For example, if you launched one atom at a huge speed, and manipulated its electrons so they didn't unbind from other atoms, the rest of the entire object will be dragged by that one atom. The object might be ridiculously stretched, since the force will propagate at the speed of sound, but as long as the electrons don't notice, it'll hold together. It'll even continue chemical reactions as normal.

Oh yes.

Scattering electrons is where most of the energy of any damaging situation will go. As long as you can match the power being applied to you, you can prevent damage. If the power being applied to you is too spread out, then you will just pull yourself together over the course of less than a second. And of course the energy of the attack is equal to the energy of the total defense across all electrons.

For example, if one atom is pulled away with 0.21*10^{15} joules of kinetic energy, then that is how much energy it will take to hold your 23 grams of electrons together, and thus to hold together the rest of you. Only a tiny number of them will be in the shock wave at a time anyway, so you don't need to spend a full second iterating over your whole body - and you can let some of them break as long as you go back and fix them. You've functionally increased your tensile strength. This will distribute that kinetic energy evenly.

I'm pretty far outside my field of expertise now, and several logical leaps from what I know for sure. But if there's a problem, I don't see it. There is still a limit on how fast you can accelerate based on how fast you can pull yourself together, but it should still be pretty astonishing. (Of course, by this point you may be better off using a more classical engine, if you can survive the few hundred thousand newtons you'll get with even a fraction of your power.)

Check the isotopic ratios in a room, or the number of atoms of an element. The isotopic ratios would be easier, you'd just need a small number of samples across the room. If they alter someone used a power (and they will alter if any elements are transmuted). Check the number of a certain type of chemical bond in an area. If they alter too quickly someone likely used a power. You could make some allowance for devices with an electrical or gas supply like cookers or coffee makers. Check for extreme types of kinetic motion, temperature.

What do you think of this idea?

You have a person flying around in a remotely controlled predator drone.

The person uses their powers to scan a 500m circle bubble, checking for any common known symbols of a power being used, and checks for any matter in between them. If a clear line of sight can be found, or a soon predicted line of sight can be found, a signal is sent to the computer detailing the location of the power user and they are melted by a laser. In the event that this fails the user increases the temperature of the air around the enemy of the state 2000C to melt them.

This way a territory can be quickly and efficiently policed by a small number of individuals without the need for any nuclear level powers.

*************** I'm not sure if lasers - or anything, really - could be effective weapons as long as users can have standing effects. Naturally I can stop any non-magical laser up to 2.1*10^{15} watts. Outright negate it, turn it into neutrinos, dump it into the air's elastic energy to turn the air into a pseudo-physical barrier, whatever.

Magic lasers are a bit trickier. The original laser was the other user's (is it still theirs after leaving their sphere?), but it's getting absorbed and re-emitted by /my/ air. (I am absolutely going to make sure to own my air, so nobody else can roast me or suffocate me or something.) Can I have my air just refuse to re-emit overly energetic photons? This shouldn't take any energy on my part, I'm just holding energy that's already there. This is physically equivalent to retransmitting the photon perfectly off-phase, if I can do that. Since any laser more powerful than a lightning strike would have large collateral damage, and lightning strikes are in the terawatt range, my 25% losses would cost me 2.5*10^{11} joules per second, or 0.003 grams of mass. I can handle that long enough to retaliate or escape /then/ retaliate.

I have no idea how you'd catch a fleeing user. If I use a full half of my power on defense and the rest on escaping, then a hundredth of a second is long enough to get to half a million meters per second, in any direction. Blasting air out of the way would cost basically nothing. About the only way to stop a fleeing user would be to try to cage them in matter other users own, but that would take extensive preparation. At top pseudo-acceleration, they'd have to rely on auto-defenses to handle obstacle avoidance, and they might not have a standard plan to /indirectly/ deflect obstacles. But if I'm expecting it, it's not hard to come up with such a plan. If you're lucky, I'll spend a few seconds carving an opening, perhaps with a fempto-blackhole. If you're not lucky, or I'm already going too fast, I'll just hit the obstacle with antimatter and deflect the blast around myself.

If I avoided splattering, I'd be past the moon in 20 seconds, going 0.1 c. And then, since you annoyed me, there would be relativistic kill vehicles in your future. I take it back, relativistic kill vehicles would still be an effective weapon.

There are a few problems with this. First, humans can't keep up with these kind of absurd pseudo-accelerations. I'm talking, moving 500 meters in 3/1000 of a second. Human reaction time is 0.15 seconds, in which time a mage can go from standing right in front of you to 200 kilometers away, receding at 2000 km/s. If your quarry is moving randomly there is just no way for any human to get anywhere close. It doesn't matter how many people you have, one of these mages is simply uncatchable.

You /might/ be able to tail me if you set up your magic field to do so in advance, and I started out within your field... but maybe not, if there's light-speed delay between your magic noticing me moving and reaching back to move you. (And we'd run into all sorts of problems if there is no such delay.) Since I start accelerating first, my velocity is always higher, and I will gradually gain ground until I'm out of your range and your magic can't respond instantly to me. Lightspeed delay is sufficient. If I start 300 meters from you, I'll be moving 5 km/s in 1*10^{-6} second, and I'll escape entirely in ~2050 seconds, a little over half an hour. (At which point we will both be moving 2/3 the speed of light, and will have traveled the full diameter of Earth's orbit.) That would be an exciting half an hour, granted, but the hard part is even getting that much.

Second, this pseudo-acceleration is harmless. It's applied evenly to every quark and electron, so there's no differential force to smash or shear anything. The only problem is slamming into the air, but that's only a problem for the tiny fraction of a second, 1/50 or thereabouts, before I'm in space. Defending against the environment of space is honestly a rounding error. You'd have to be wasteful to even get up to a million joules, let alone the hundred trillion it'd need to be to even register as something to worry about. And all of that would be internal to me, untouchable.

I have no idea how you'd even get close enough to engage a fleeing user. I don't even know how you could /aim/ at one if they're turbo-accelerating randomly.

(Calculated with constant mass. The equation was annoying enough to integrate without factoring in a modified rocket equation. It doesn't matter /that/ much. You gain velocity by the inverse square root of the mass, so small mass differences don't do much at all. Also calculated using 1.05*10^{15} joules/second. I'm not sure what the actual optimum speed/utility ratio is, but 1:1 is reasonable enough. Different ratios don't change the end result much. All of these disclaimers mean that I am /understating/ these numbers.)

I assume that I can tell magic to dump a bunch of kinetic energy into my body, and to set up some automatic effect for anything that enters my range while at speed. There's no reason to think it would help me make decisions or react to events outside of my magical range. OP could say otherwise, but I don't think it makes sense with what we know so far.

Tracking lasers are useless. Mages are too fast for light. Here's the plan: I run away. 0.15 seconds later, your brain has processed the fact that I have run away, and you check your laser to see where I went. At the same time, I randomly change direction. 200,000/300,000,000 seconds later, the light arrives to show you me, 200,000 meters away - but by the time you see that, I could 1.5 km away from where you would predict. You /can't/ know where I am; the information does not exist in your light cone.

Having escaped your lasers, and your eyes, and everything touched by your magic, I can set up a perfect optical cloak and head off in a random direction. If I keep changing every 200,000/300,000,000 seconds, you can't even in principle pin me down except probabilistically in an ever increasing volume, but that's already overkill. There are too many possible pathways to possibly cut me off. It becomes unmanageable instantly. If I have even the barest fraction of a second of a headstart, it is simply impossible to catch me.

This is less useful than you'd think, since you'd be out of your companion's range in a fraction of a second, and if they're keeping pace, then they can't help. But it probably would help enough; If you've managed to get me and two of you all in each other's spheres, both of you set up to give chase instantly, then you've probably got me there. I don't think I could escape. But your friend won't stick around long enough to help with the offensive. If you want to make sure you'll win the fight, you'll have to get me and /three/ of you all each other's spheres, two chasers and one booster. Then I'd be thoroughly screwed.

Only if your automated defenses are set up, though. Otherwise you'll slam into my air-walls at mach bajillion when you fail to push them out of the way directly, before you even realize you're moving. But it's doable. I'd try to avoid ever getting into such a trap.

This is a good idea anyway, for natural disasters and the like, but it's not worth anything against an omnicidal maniac with a relativistic kill vehicle. If I spend hours or days or years feeding kinetic energy into an asteroid, then A) it'll be going so fast you'll only have seconds to realize you need to blow it up, and B) you need more man-hours to stop it than it took to start it, since you can't go for the kinetic energy directly and have to resort to lossier means. Most of which would just vaporize it, leaving you with a relativistic kill plasma cloud, and that's even harder to stop.

Won't do much good if my air-shield can refuse to re-transmit your laser. If it's possible at all, it will stop any laser that makes any consideration for collateral damage. If you're not chasing me, then I just need to juke earlier and more frequently. The speed of light delay will still let me get away in less than a second.

If you are chasing me - which, again, requires a fair bit of set up - then we've got a mage duel with both of us in each other's space. I'm much more interested in avoiding that, since the most likely result is that we kill each other. A laser is still not the best weapon, since it is indirect enough to interact with my matter before it interacts with me, giving me the chance to mess with it. For example, I could make my air reflective, and keep it from getting vaporized by liberally cheating. Then there's whatever defenses I've set up on my skin...

My first thought for a weapon would be a single atom, pumped with an impossibly excessive amount of energy for one atom, shoved at my enemy's head with as much kinetic energy as I can spare. Depending on their defenses, they may or may not be able to stop it, since we can both put out the same amount of kinetic energy, it's just a matter of knowing that they need to. Either way, when it's touching them or inside their brain, I'll stop magically supporting the nuclear orbitals. I may not have a choice, if my enemy takes ownership of it once it's inside their body. Then it explodes in their brain with way more energy than a single atom has any business having. It may release more energy than they could possibly counter, or it may just be the most they could ever produce at a time, depending on whether or not I can prevent it from exploding with less energy than it stores.

Either way, it will kill anyone who doesn't have defenses against that. And anyone with defenses will be busy enough suppressing it that they won't have enough power to spare when I shoot them.

  In your sphere. Once I'm out of your sphere and moving randomly, you cannot react to me, you cannot predict me.
#+end_quote

Someone moving at a significant percentage of the speed of light isn't going to be that hard to track. You can make a spell to track their light. Or hit them in the 500 m range, since you can react as fast as any spell can and lasers are faster than any acceleration.

#+begin_quote
  Won't do much good if my air-shield can refuse to re-transmit your laser. If it's possible at all, it will stop any laser that makes any consideration for collateral damage. If you're not chasing me, then I just need to juke earlier and more frequently. The speed of light delay will still let me get away in less than a second.
#+end_quote

You have a power limit, if someone is firing 100% of their power at you then you can't deflect it without controlling as much power, and you're already expending a lot of power evading pursuit and whatever magical attacks.

#+begin_quote
  For example, I could make my air reflective, and keep it from getting vaporized by liberally cheating. Then there's whatever defenses I've set up on my skin...
#+end_quote

You can't make your air reflective, you can't make things that you don't know how to make. OP covered this, you have to know how to make stuff. Like complex organic molecules.

#+begin_quote
  My first thought for a weapon would be a single atom, pumped with an impossibly excessive amount of energy for one atom, shoved at my enemy's head with as much kinetic energy as I can spare.
#+end_quote

It would likely do negligible damage, like most cosmic rays, and get out of your range long before you could do anything. The speed would make it tricky to control too. The laser is an easier version of this.

#+begin_quote
  Either way, it will kill anyone who doesn't have defenses against that. And anyone with defenses will be busy enough suppressing it that they won't have enough power to spare when I shoot them.
#+end_quote

My earlier suggestion was about a vigilante/police state group that forcefully recruits and brainwashes people and overwhelms individuals with numbers. Numerical advantages are assumed, they have more power than you.

#+end_quote

Er, how do you figure? To my knowledge, that is the opposite of true. If you track my light, you will see at where I /was/. Since I'm accelerating randomly, that gives you very little information about where I /will/ be by the time a laser gets to me. Hitting me in the 500 meter range means you're in my range too, and it's a battle of how prepared we are with set spells.

#+begin_quote
  You have a power limit, if someone is firing 100% of their power at you...
#+end_quote

Then they have just blown up whatever place I'm running away from. The instant their laser gets more than 500 meters from them and touches the air outside their influence, the air is going to explode very violently. There will likely be a fair amount of fusion involved. At the very least it's going to create a massive plasma channel. The power absorbed by the air is power I don't need to fight.

#+begin_quote
  You can't make your air reflective, you can't make things that you don't know how to make.
#+end_quote

I know /exactly/ how to make my air reflective. Transmuting aluminium would be cheating, even if it would be easy since I wouldn't need very much to make a thin flat layer. Instead, I could rearrange the outer electron orbitals of some atoms to /act/ like aluminium. Keep three electrons excited to the p^{1} orbital of any atom, line the atoms up perfectly flat, and presto, instant mirror.

#+begin_quote
  It would likely do negligible damage, like most cosmic rays, and get out of your range long before you could do anything.
#+end_quote

When I said "impossibly excessive", I meant "lots of orders of magnitude above the point where the thing should be blown to its constituent quarks". I'm talking about a single atom weighing multiple grams, with exactly as much bang as antimatter of the same mass but even /less/ stable outside of my control, all wrapped up in a package that is very good at being a very tiny needle. This isn't a cosmic ray, it's an invisible annihilation bomb, so energetic it's just itching to tunnel through anything until I set it off by releasing the dead man's switch.

#+begin_quote

Indeed, that's a problem. Which is why I prefer avoidance to fighting. Given a choice, I'd never be in the same gravity well as them. And as long as I keep my distance, it is virtually impossible to catch me.

Your acceleration is going to be negligible on the timescale it takes for light from you to reach us. You accelerating randomly won't change the fact that we know exactly where you were some tiny fraction of a second ago and we have a preprepared laser firing, unless you are a large distance away.

#+end_quote

That wouldn't really stop this much. Mirrors easily ablate to high powered lasers. They're not perfectly reflective, they absorb a lot of energy. Plus, very thin layers aren't very reflective. You also don't have a good way of predicting where the lasers are coming from. Also, you have 500 meters to react. From my calculations, that gives you time to reshape 0.03818g of material, max (500/light speed*23 grams of matter that you can reshape according to someone's post)

Anyway, if you want, we can just use xrays or gamma rays. They can go through thin metal sheets. We'd probably use those if you had an active defense, like some tungsten you kept orbiting you constantly to deflect attacks.

#+begin_quote
  Instead, I could rearrange the outer electron orbitals of some atoms to act like aluminium. Keep three electrons excited to the p1 orbital of any atom
#+end_quote

Most non aluminium things don't have a comparable p1 orbital, the p1 orbit shape (and energy, and therefore absorbance and reflectivity) is defined by the nucleus. If you excited two electrons to the 3s and one to the 3p orbitals they would be loosely associated electrons that wouldn't behave much like aluminium ones.

Where "large distance" means "3 kilometers, beyond which there is less than a 50% chance of hitting you, which distance you can attain within 0.01 second". If I'm not currently in someone's range, nothing is likely to touch me.

Even if I'm just 100 meters from a readied action laser, that's enough time to accelerate to 3000 m/s before I need to defend myself from it, then I can just coast. You can't really put all of your power into the laser - you still need to keep your own air from exploding, and keep your own sensors up, and protecting yourself from the explosion, and then your laser loses energy to the air it's exploding, and it's likely blooming a whole lot so less is actually hitting me... You'll probably realize we're fighting right around the time I'm more than 500 meters from the laser source. I'm quite sure that, under cover of nuclear fire, I can scrounge up the few hundred joules it would take me to get out of the line of fire in another 0.15 seconds, and then I'm gone.

I'm certainly not going to wait until all your friends also have me in their sights before leaving. One is quite enough to spook me. I likely wouldn't walk away from more than one.

This doesn't seem likely. There's a lot of mass to go around. I could live quite comfortably in the kuiper belt or the oort cloud forever; the energy of going from rock to rock is basically negligible. It wouldn't really cost me much to vacation in Jupiter for a while either. Of course, I don't really plan to ever be within a light-second of any enemies if I can help it, so it's questionable how anyone would deplete my reserves.

#+end_quote

Regardless of your distance, you can only detect attacks from 500ms away, if they are at the speed of light. If we can predict your motions we can hit you.

If you burn too much energy being evasive, incidentally, we can capture you, since we can fly in a straight line towards you and fly faster.

#+begin_quote
  Even if I'm just 100 meters from a readied action laser.
#+end_quote

Our sphere of influence would be a city, and so relatively noisy, and once we were within 500 meters we could summon a readied laser action in your face.

Our program in the magic would be something like...

"Spell to detect unauthorized use of power. Check data bank, is this an authorized usage of power? No, lobotomize/ melt the person's face. Are they escaping? Summon aid, prepare instant kill contingencies."

On you being 100 meters away, if I fire a laser at you from 100 meters away, your sensors will likely relay the signal to you at the same time as the laser hits you due to light speed limits. You'll have 0.0003 seconds to move, which means you'll be able to move one meter, which isn't enough to dodge the kill weapon. If you have a readied action to block it that will likely expend a lot of energy, leaving you open to attack.

This is a question for OP- is scanning magic superluminal?

I can summon the laser 500 meters away, much of that is unnecessary, scanning would be reduced to a reasonable power level and reprioritized upon threat detection.

Air doesn't absorb light that well, I doubt much energy would be lost over such a short distance.

#+begin_quote
  You'll probably realize we're fighting right around the time I'm more than 500 meters from the laser source.
#+end_quote

Per this being a police dictatorship, we're fighting as soon as I detect you using any power, and it's a fight to the death/ mental destruction instantly, with preprogrammed death spells firing.

If we had the numbers then, we could have two magic users floating around together in our city. Depends on how many want to join the police and what area they are policing. Of course, with brain rearrangement, many will be encouraged to join the police. And if we capture you, you can learn to love it too. We'd have to erase your concepts of most of the laws of physics of course, you seem pretty dangerous.

#+end_quote

Binding energy isn't related to absorbance in atoms, it's more an aspect of electromagnetism, nor is any form of it really directly manipulable. Since you don't know the mechanism of how these things work (and physicists in general find it tricky) I'm not sure if you can modify them, and I am uncertain if these sort of things are accessible to our powers.

#+begin_quote
  And then I snap my fingers again and declare that this atom has a preposterous amount of binding energy, then I excite everything in it well beyond sane limits, until it's basically quark degenerate matter more than anything.
#+end_quote

That's not a mechanism, binding energy is an emergent property from gluons and color charges, not some independent property you can vary, and if you create gluons and try to make a super atom the author has no idea what would happen.

If whatever you are doing probably isn't possible within the laws of physics it's not a great suggestion. The author can't really predict what will happen or run any equations, and as such, it's not a useful power.

#+begin_quote
  This doesn't seem likely. There's a lot of mass to go around.

If you stay close to a source of mass you are no longer mobile and are an easy target. Your plan of avoiding enemies is probably safer.

** 2.1*10^{15} joules per second * 5*10^{9} people * 2*10^{7} seconds (approx 7 months) = 2.1*10^{32} Joules, or the gravitational binding energy of the earth.

I'm going to admit I'm laughing a bit at the wording of this, just a bit. It sounds like your saying that computers are more complex than humans, but I digress. Yes you could do the first two, as for fictional things, well, could you build H.G Wells time machine? You can't just say "Create a time machine", you have to understand what goes into what your creating to create it.

I could see you building models of some of the classical steampunk devices however, since the literature is so detailed. Whether or not they work as intended is another matter entirely.

An alternate method for eating jupiter - rather than literally eating it or sending roots through it - one could compress a large portion into neutronium and just stand on it.
