A few years ago, I wrote a prequel/sequel to HPMOR and Significant Digits, called Orders of Magnitude. In honor of the fifth anniversary of HPMOR's ending, I'm looking to release a "director's cut" version with an epilogue and a few additions that were intended to have been included in the original version.

After rereading it though I realize there are a non-trivial number of spelling and grammatical errors that I'd like to clean up, but I don't know that I have the patience or eye for detail needed to really pull that off.

Also, I'm looking to create an EBook version with reasonably decent production value. Which, although I'm sure I could figure out how to do it, I'd rather leverage someone else's expertise.

I'd be willing to pay for both of these services. I don't know if this kind of request is acceptable for this forum; if not I can take it elsewhere but I figured I'd try to financially enrich the [[/r/rational]] community over Reddit at large.

I don't actually know what the going rate would be for these two services but to summarize, I'm looking for grammatical and spelling review of roughly 200k words, along with creating a PDF and Ebook version of the work. If you're interested, let me know what a fair price would be (feel free to do so via PM or in the thread).

Thanks all!
