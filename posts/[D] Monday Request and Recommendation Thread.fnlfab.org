Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I'm going to recommend the book /[[https://www.amazon.com/This-How-You-Lose-Time/dp/1534431004][This is How you Lose the Time War]]/ by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone.

The story is about two rival agents from different utopian(ish) futures fighting across time to make sure their future is the one that actual happens, or arguably is more likely to happen. It focuses on their letters and the relationship they develop over space and time. I'm recommending it for two reasons. One, it's very well written. The prose is some of the most beautiful I've read recently and the imagery is frequently striking. Two, the mechanics of time travel, though never explicitly discussed, are internally consistent and result in a brilliant conclusion that makes everything fall into place in a very satisfying way.

That said, it's not particularly rational in that it focuses more on the characters feel than on what they think. I can think of at least one time when a character makes a blatantly stupid decision, though in their defense they make the choice fully aware of the impending negative outcomes.

It's also fairly short, so if you're looking for something sweet to pass the time, give this one a try!

*** I cannot recommend this highly enough; it's a novella so it won't take you long. The letters from both agents were written by different authors so you get a very strong difference in voice, and the story and writing is excellent. I'd argue that it is rational, though not rationalist- at every point, the characters are thinking about the potential and likely consequences of their choices before they make them, and even the "stupid" choice referenced above is taken with the explicit acknowledgement of the likely consequences for both options and the information they do and don't have about the causes leading to the choice- that emotions heavily play into the choice doesn't make it not a rational decision, in my opinion.

**** To me, it seemed to work like:

#+begin_quote
  all of the strands were different ways that history could go, like different streams of water all making up a river, and both sides were trying to make the river end up combined into a single stream in one of two places- right now it's forked into 2 equally likely possibilities. Each strand was like a probability more than a solid past- that's why they all exist simultaneously. The agents were trying to change strands to flow into another and combine- so if you make it so that strand 1 in 1400AD and strand 2 in 1400AD ended up being the same by 1500AD, then they "crossed". You can't directly revert the actions of another agent - the physical presence of an agent seems to over time make a given stand more "stuck" while they're there, and moreso the more they are 'embedded' in the history of that strand - but just because they crossed doesn't mean that another agent can't find a way to make strand 1 go a different direction instead in 1450AD. Actions can break off into multiple possibilities, so maybe you can't make all of strand 1 go into strand 2, but you can split it into 11 and 12 and have 12 go into strand 2. You can't jump between strands that are too far apart- it's part of why the two sides can't directly attack each other without first going upriver to the past and then back down the major streams/strands leading to the other side. You also don't want to change things too close in time to the endpoints, because it starts to break down the "attractors" of the endpoints and then changes stop being able to be predictable.<

  At the end, Red and Blue decide that, as the best agents of either side, together they can make a 3rd endpoint just for them.<

** I've recently reread a bit of Problem Sleuth, and am again amazed by how it can take completely ridiculous premises and use them to make a consistent and predictable 'magic' system and also a coherent story.

Are there any other stories where the world or its mechanics are weird and whacky but the story and systems are completely coherent? Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett come to mind, though their plots aren't all that consistent either.

Also if you haven't read Dresden Files, they're a pretty good book series too. About a mage who's a private detective who uses magic to solve his cases, but usually gets pulled into larger plots of evil wizards when he starts investigating whatever the novel's plot is.

Although, as the series goes on, there's less of that and more of him immediately being pulled into the plots of evil wizards at the start of the book, as a consequence of something that happened in a previous book.

*** Most of Brandon Sanderson's cosmere stories fit the bill.

/Warbreaker/ is free to read (available on his website). Of the four viewpoint characters I remember (Siri, Vivenna, Vasher, Lightsong) one is a mage from the start, one gets magic midway through the book, one is sort of made of magic but can't use it for much.

The main magic system in /Mistborn/ is "burning" metals for some magical effect, like limited telekinesis or enhanced senses. All protagonists and many side viewpoint characters have access to some form of that magic.

/Stormlight Archive/'s three main viewpoint characters all end up with magic, but only one of them has it from the start (and she doesn't know right away).

/Elantris/ is a bit of an outlier; nobody does any overt magic until the end, unless you count "being a zombie" as magic.

The /Arcanum Unbounded/ is a collection of short stories and novellas. All but two of them (a side story of a few pages, and a slightly longer story) have mage protagonists.

Ethshar is a series of books about magic, from the perspective of a spellcaster, and explore the mechanics of how magic works. 'with a single spell' is an apprentice wizard who shows up in later books. 'the misenchanted sword' is earlier in the timeline. other books cover warlocks, witches, and even sorcerers from the far north with their devices, and demonologists.

** Recommending Peerless Dad. This has been my favorite manga/ manhwa ever since I found it last year.

​

Brief summary: The story follows the life of a powerful martial artist after his wife dies in labor and leaves him with 3 kids and no family support or stable job.

At it's root, it's a martial arts story but it's very different from the norm. The MC isn't a teenager murder hobo causing trouble and picking fights. He's just an adult man, with responsibilities doing the best he thinks he can for his family.

​

Not necessarily rationalistic but likely rational adjacent, the MC is a likable, reasonable and cautious person. It's a different, more mature take on slice of life that's good and enjoyable even though I'm not normally into that genre. There's plenty of action but less than you'd expect in a martial arts story.

​

The pacing is wonderful with time passing, his kids are around 10 yo by chapter 100 and have their own personalities and are proper characters in and off themselves.

​

It's a very feel good story that has become one of the main highlights of my week.

**** You'll not have to worry about that with this one. They are his biological children and the MC isn't a pervert. Even when people are trying to set him up for a new wife he's rationally considering what is the best choice, should he do it? How would it affect the kids? What kind of woman would be appropriate for his situation? That kind of thing..

He's not very 'loving' either, he's a proper asian dad. He works he pays the bills, tells his kids to study, is kind of distant, and expects to be supported by them after they get married and he gets old. So more of a chinese family structure than japanese.

It's korean, not japanese, and that might make it less likely. This is anecdotal but I've never seen any broadly incestuous stories come out of korea, I'm sure they exist but the rate is probably lower.

*** I'm in the Bobiverse-Vorkosigan-Tchaikovsky triangle, so these books should also tickle your fancy as they tickled mine:

A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge

Semiosis by Sue Burke

Lockstep by Karl Schroeder

(Greg Egan has been recommended on this forum so many times, it feels silly to do so again, but here I go anyway)

(I am also trying to reread one of the Uplift books right now and I'm finding it hard going. Those books haven't aged well. Vinge, on the other hand, is even better now)

** So, I just finished a re-read of HPMoR... it'd be interesting to find something in the same vein. I've checked out a few lists of fics, but a lot of them are fanfics based on works I either never read, or didn't really like.

If anybody would care to recommend me something, that'd be great - I'm not extremely into sci-fi (although it isn't a turn-off, either), and I would prefer something "original" (ie not fanfic) though I guess the Harry Potter universe is fine. I'll be taking a look at Significant Digits.

*** Luminosity: yes, it's Twilight fanfic, but I'm mostly unfamiliar with the source material and I gobbled it up. Rational characters acting in their rational interests, you love them, and there's all sorts of cool power stuff that does not exist in the original story AND is really, really well examined and munchkined. I wish it was an original story and not twilight fanfic because I think everyone gets turned away by the twilight aspect and doesn't give it a chance.

*** Which parts of HPMoR are you looking to find more of? Purely the magic aspect, or the quantification of magic itself, or something more like the plotting between characters?

**** The "analysis" was good, but the plotting is where I feel MoR really shines. I'm a sucker for magic in general, though - particularly when the systems are well thought out and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA][Magic A is Magic A]].

I find it really hard explaining exactly what itches MoR scratches, I guess it just feels... mentally stimulating somehow, when it's in its stride?

***** If you are a fan of plotting I would highly recommend A Practical Guide to Evil. If you haven't heard of it, its essentially characters that live in a world where storybook narrative exists, and they seek to use it to further their own goals. For example, why bother trying to slit someone's throat when you can manipulate them into basically wiping thenselves out of existance. Plus it's got treasonous , man-eating tapirs.

***** Pokemon: The Origin Of Species does a lot of what HPMoR does, and I think it does it better. Rational remix of what the Pokemon world is like, journey of three smart people pursuing different goals, with full agency. Strong plotting, well-developed characters, internal consistency, exploration of the mechanics of the world it's in.

Worm is an original superhero story that's strongly plotted, has well-developed characters, does good things with point of view bias, has great prose, and has sharply defined consistent superpowers (but analyzing these is not the point). There's also a great literary analysis podcast dedicated to it.

A Practical Guide To Evil is a medieval fantasy tropes thing that's strongly plotted, incredibly fast-paced, and does cool things with powers and narrative tropes. The prose quality is bad.

Mother Of Learning is a medieval/renaissance fantasy story where a mage gets stuck in a month-long time loop. It's well-paced, internally consistent, has an engaging magic system and world, and has moderately well-developed characters (they have internality, but they're all kind of the same person). Low-stakes though.

Worth The Candle is an original medieval fantasy / game mechanics story with self-consistent and extremely unique magic, strong plotting, well-developed characters, and an extremely well-executed point of view bias. The latter is so well done that it'd probably be better to first read Metropolitan Man, a rational Superman fanfic by the same author, to establish that the author is capable of some of this.

** If you're in the mood for something kinda Good Omens-y, I'll recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25442/doing-gods-work][Doing God's Work]].

I haven't read far enough to see if it's especially rational, but it /does/ seem to have a rationalistic deconstruction of religion along similar lines to Good Omens, but from a more contemporary "hey religion is basically a business these days right? What if Providence was literally a public stock?"

** I'd like to thank [[/u/ViceroyChobani]] for their recommendation of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core][*Blue Core*]]. A very enjoyable dungeon core story, with an especially interesting view of applying modern science to a world of magic. Like some kingdom-building novels (Release That Witch, etc) the main character attempts to integrate technological advancements into the world they have found themselves. However unlike most other characters the dungeon core Blue has godlike control and power within his domain, able to create with a thought.

Because of this the development of technologies within the dungeon are limited solely on Blue's creativity (and access to raw materials.) Personally I find it much more interesting to have the limitation be a cognitive one rather than a material one, especially since the powers are not exclusive to Blue. This allows him to engage in fascinating battles where the parties each throw out new and creative weapons and tactics to adapt to each other.

Besides the magitech, the writing itself is very good, with a wide variety of characters and power levels that all feel fleshed out and have their own personalities. As a fair warning there are some distinctly NSFW scenes in the series, but the chapters are well-marked and the content is, at least at the time of writing, entirely consensual.

Overall, if you enjoy dungeon core stories or stories that combine magic and technology I would definitely recommend checking it out, and even if those things aren't specifically what you are looking for it's still an excellent fantasy story.

*** I like Blue Core a lot, although I should warn people that it's only half rational.

The Protagonist actually has /two/ out of context ability sets. One that is great with his inventing that's mentioned above. But his other is probably an order of magnitude more powerful and doesn't really get maximized at all.

As a result it feels like there's two modes of the story sorta sandwiched together. There's a hard science-fantasy setting trying to apply physics to create paradigms of magic and exploring all combinatorial interactions between spells ... and then there's waifu time where abilities are never explored and some abilities pop up and never show up again in the story.

I like all parts of the story. It's a great read. But be prepared to activate selective rationality filters when you read it.
