D&D is many things, which is one the reasons I've found it to have enduring appeal. It's a set of rules, but it's also the set of worlds that the fluff (descriptions, pictures) and crunch (rules) suggest. Because there are many editions and many optional rulebooks (and rules), and because GMs and players are both free to invent and customize to their heart's content, the set of worlds that people consider to be "D&D" is /enormous/. I've played games set in grim magitek dystopias, 17th century Europe, games with firearms, games in ancient prehistory, or on distant moons.

(I don't think there's anything particularly wonderful about D&D as far as roleplaying games go, except that it was first and therefore set the standards. I've played dozens of roleplaying games and the biggest differences are the amount of crunch available and the conflict resolution mechanisms.)

/Anyway/, this is the companion thread to the weekly challenge, if you've got things you'd want to talk about here, have at it.


** I'm sure plenty of people here are already familiar with it, but there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]], where the main character is a munchkin from the D&D universe who gets brought into Harry Potter's universe through a spell gone wrong.

EDIT: Also, there's [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], which is rational fiction that takes place in a world similar to D&D. The main difference appears to be that the spell system uses mana instead of memorization.

** I normally assume that what we see in a game isn't really what happens, in the same way that when you watch a TV show and see the zipper on the monster costume, the monster doesn't actually have a zipper on it within the context of the shows' reality.

Game mechanics such as experience levels are the equivalent of the zipper. People in the game world cannot start making charts of exactly when they get certain abilities, and determine that they always get them in a specific order and that they have to kill a certain number of monsters between them. Within the game world, all that happens is "character gradually gains abilities"; characters of the same class gain the abilities in the same fixed order because we have chosen not to simulate the game world to the level of detail needed to avoid that. Millions of game world people don't /actually/ all gain abilities in the same order and by killing monsters.

*** It depends... there are some paths of learning that are very obviously more powerful than others -- you can't throw away the rules entirely, they DO describe the world in a profound way -- and some sorts of combat styles or learning make more sense than others. And when in life-or-death situations, the methods that really really don't work tend to cause people to die, and they don't end up being kept. That last part happens historically too, with martial arts styles when they are still being used for actual life or death fighting.

*** I think if you take any joy in building characters or playing a balanced game, you need at least a partial moratorium on using the internet as a resource, at least for those players who are just going to look up the most maximally efficient build for their chosen class. It's not really surprising that the game gets unbalanced when hundreds of thousands of man-hours are spent on unbalancing it. Unlike a videogame though, a company that's printing books doesn't have a great way to fix a problem, or even identify that a problem exists. Margins are also a lot slimmer, which means less playtesting gets done. So I mostly try to stay away from making optimal builds and encourage others to do the same, especially because I end up depriving myself of a fair amount of the fun of character building.

I'd suggest GURPS, but you've already said that you don't like it. All my other favorite systems are for other genres or are less mechanically deep.

**** On the other hand, the internet can help you avoid accidental unbalance. 3.5 in particular is notorious for its newbie traps and wildly unbalanced PHB. A good understanding of all the options and their relative power lets you choose more balanced options if that's what you want to do (in 3.5, the most balanced classes are relatively obscure).

As for what the game designers could have done, they could ensure balance at the expense of versatility by doing what they did in 4e: remove all open ended powers and design all classes using the same, video-game like mechanics. Whether that's a good thing is up for debate: 4e isn't very popular.

****** Mostly, 3.5e classes are roughly stratified into different tiers of power level and versatility and game breaking capacity. There's a 'Tier system for classes' that people put together to rank classes, which you can see [[http://brilliantgameologists.com/boards/index.php?topic=1002.0][here]].

Basically, 'game breakingly powerful' classes include classes like wizard, sorcerer, druid, cleric, artificer, and archivist, and 'laughably underpowered' classes include classes like fighter, monk, healer, swashbuckler, ninja, soulknife, paladin, knight, samurai. If you know anything about D&D 3.5e, this basically means that the single book with the most variance in power level, with the most blatantly overpowered and incredibly underpowered classes and player choices is the Player's Handbook.

This makes sense, because they weren't playtesting each class's capacity to contribute to solving problems, and they weren't playtesting using abilities creatively or anything like that, but they slowly started learning how to write balanced, moderate-power-level classes as time went on. Pathfinder is functioning under the same learning curve as well.

****** Here's a good start. [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?266559-Tier-System-for-Classes-(Rescued-from-MinMax)]]

The general principle of 3.5 is that spellcasting >> all else. Also, a lot of people who haven't read the internet much assume that Core only is the most balanced and that it's adding in random splatbooks which causes problems, but it's actually the opposite. The Players Handbook is the most unbalanced book in the game, containing 3 of the 6* Tier 1 classes in the entire game, combined with a bunch of Tier 4 and Tier 5 classes, including the infamous Monk. It also contains the majority of broken spells. By contrast, the last book printed, Tome of Battle, is generally considered well balanced (though in serious need of editing and errata).

This is mainly a combination of WOTC not knowing what they were doing early on since they didn't have any experience with the new system yet and their playtesters were idiots (rumor says that the Druid playtester didn't actually use any of its class features, hence why it ended up so ridiculous), and getting a better understanding as time went on. Also, a lot of broken stuff in 3.5 was ported from earlier editions.

Note that despite the claims of Pathfinder to improve balance, the 3.5 tiers are largely unchanged. Spellcasting is still far better than mundanes, they just tinkered a bit around the edges.

*7 if you include Spirit Shaman, which is debated. Also note that one of the other 6 (StP Erudite) is an online variant of a variant of a class. If you count classes that are tier 1 as originally designed, then the total is just 5 or 6. Also, note that every single Tier 1 class outside the PHB gets access to the spell list of Wizard, Cleric, or Druid.

******* Ah, okay. Yeah, I was familiar with the tier system, I was just wondering what you thought the balanced classes were.

Spirit Shaman is a weird one. In the right circumstances, such as a campaign set in my Draugar War, it would be possibly the most broken thing there was. In most...very much not.

******** Well it really depends on your particular preference, since balance between different PCs is the most important part. But tier 3-4 is often considered the sweet spot, and that's most common in later books.

********* Yep. Although, personally, my preference is just to have the whole party play Tier 1. The DM can always scale the threats to the party so it just matters that the PCs are balanced to one another, and I get sad if I can't play a wizard.

********** I usually play a Wizard or Cleric and do the "God Wizard" play style. Other players tend to just focus on who's doing a lot of damage, so if you focus on battlefield control, buffing, and utility, you can overpowered without looking like it and let the Fighter types have their fun too.

it is frickin' amazing as an improv game and the mechanics are stellar. my favorite piece is that you gain XP from FAILURE -- which means that characters either play up their weaknesses to a level of a stereotype/trope for laughs and XP or the grouchy guy that keeps rolling (6-) ends up surprisingly more powerful for the final boss fight.

** I should probably mention [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?222007-The-Definitive-Guide-to-the-Tippyverse-By-Emperor-Tippy][the Tippyverse]] as one example of someone taking the rules-as-intended and trying to make a setting that takes into account some of the things possible. I don't really agree with some of Tippy's starting assumptions (namely the ease with which people can get XP and using traps for beneficial spells) but it's an interesting exploration of the consequences of the rules nonetheless, without totally dipping into the insanity that comes from uncharitable application of RAW.

** I've never understood the appeal of munchkinning d&d. Its very obviously not designed with the intention of creating a consistent universe but to make games work, with the DM altering them as needed. Can anyone explain the appeal?

*** You'd need to define what you mean by munchkining.

If you mean it in the sense of what /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/ or /The Two Year Emperor/ do, or the more abstract exercises on the character optimization boards, then I think most of the appeal is in seeing just how far the system can be stretched. It's the same impulse that leads people to send jet-powered cars hurtling across the salt flats in order to reach a new top speed. There's a particular joy in optimizing within a bounded system, and in laying out a proof of concept. It's also a thought exercise that offer low-hanging fruit and easy optimizations that don't resemble actual intellectual work as much as is required in systems or settings less ripe for abuse.

If you mean /in game/, then I think that's mostly about "winning". D&D doesn't have to be a power fantasy, but it often is, so people want to accumulate as much power as possible.

**** It's not just a matter of making numbers bigger - a lot of the fun in theoretical optimization is uncovering poorly worded rules and coming up with crazy tricks that noone has ever thought of before. After all, anyone can make Pun-pun, but there's still gems left to be discovered. Heck, even if a trick is completely useless, it can still be fun if it does something unique.

I like to think that I was the first person to discover the utility of illiterate Wizards or how the obscure spell Infallible Servant has completely unintended uses.

** So I wrote some handbooks on doing some of the sorts of things that you see in post-scarcity fiction and in post-cyberpunk and things like that in D&D 3.5e. These might be useful for people. First, I wrote a guide on making transhumans using D&D 3.5e rules [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9NJIs751Af3i0IEIJwCkIp9H9YFiZYZ7u-wmYVaheI/edit][here]]. Next, I wrote a thing about making airships and powerful robots and sentient constructs [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zilT4WGOyHM0AfpG4-GmD2FkgDg1HZ9HC1cTleQHds/edit][here]]. And finally, I wrote a writeup of how to basically make a whole post-scarcity society using D&D 3.5e rules [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aG4P3dU6WP3pq8mW9l1qztFeNfqQHyI22oJe09i8KWw/edit][here]].

** One thing you should think about is how the rules of the game affect the behavior of players and how that is useful to a gaming experience. You seems to think that the difference between rpgs is basically just how much attention you want to pay to rules but there are lots of differences that all make for a different experience. Does the game reward you for specific actions? In Adnd (the second version of first edition) Gygax states specifically that the reason that you are rewarded for accumulating treasure is because that is what the game is about, clearly the best way to learn things isn't violencing underground beings until you have enough money to buy a fucking castle, but that is the game he was making so that is how the reward system is set up.

There are games that reward you for rich detailed descriptions of actions, some that encourage inter-player interaction, some that punish intellectual laziness. There are also systems that give you opportunities to find specific kinds of moments. Whether it is paranoia leading the players to creating complicated webs of betrayal or one last heist letting you becoming secretly the best at something at a story vital moment or headspace having you weeping over a lost ally you never knew because you wanted to use a skill you didn't have.
