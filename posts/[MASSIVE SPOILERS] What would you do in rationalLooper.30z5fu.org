** Stay away from any form of time travel whatsoever. I've seen a quote somewhere which describes this perfectly:

#+begin_quote
  Time travel in the context of Looper is time travel that /hates/ you and wants you /dead/.

** [EDIT: link to the chart is acting weird; you have to click through from Drive if you want to view the text, apparently.]

Since the universal response of the internet to this film, including mine, was to simultaneously love it and yell at the screen "but that makes no /sense/!" So, naturally, I started literally making a diagram to try and figure out what happened and if it was a paradox or the authors just forgot how time travel worked or what.

/But/, on trying to write out a diagram, it actually seems like the rules are perfectly self-consistent ... if you assume a surprisingly large amount of "free will" (or random chance) such that people's actions are inherently unpredictable (and thus never catch up to their future selves with any certainty until it's too late.) It's merely the character's /actions/ that seem to be a tad nonsensical, and even that can be chalked up to regular old irrationality on their part.

So ... what /would/ you do, on finding yourself in the world of Looper at the beginning of the film?

*** I think the main problem the "time travel" rules had was that it was entirely contained within the individual, and selectively at that. Why would you need to capture the future self of someone whose past self you've already captured? Because they might, potentially, get free later, and thus their future self is still running around?

Then why if my future self is running away from you, and you cut my present self's legs off, does my future self suddenly fall down without legs? That's just bananas. How did I GET there without legs? There's no potentiality for respawning legs. Unless the moment you cut my past self's legs off I suddenly have robot legs, spontaneous leg removal isn't an effect of time travel, it's voodoo witchcraft.

I get why the film makers did it, it made for some very compelling in-the-moment suspense and visceral horror, but it's a type of time travel that barely makes sense to be called that. It's not just nonsensical as a mechanic, like you say the characters are constantly holding the idiot ball: there's no explanation as to why they don't just kill the past self, since as we see later, it makes the future self suddenly disappear.

As such, I'm not really sure what I would do in the Looper world, because it's just an inherently nonsensical set of rules. If I just had to accept "that's how reality is," I'm not sure it would change much. What would I do if I could go back in time and have my fate linked to whatever new things happened to my past self? Maybe put them in a coma and hook them up to life support so nothing bad happens to any of their limbs, since apparently nothing short of that or death would actually affect me in any way.

**** No, see, there are two kinds of "time travel" in Looper.

The first is when you get in a time machine, go back, and change something. This "rewinds" the universe to the point you went back to, which then runs forward again in real time. There /are/ at least some butterflies here, which can affect the Loopers' job prospects; one such change is responsible for the Rainmaker suddenly laying off the entire workforce. (This is why they try not to kill them - they're worried it might be too large a change, and might affect their bosses in the future. They actually mention this. They can totally kill your past self if they need to.)

The second happens once you /get/ to the past. For, um, reasons (I blame /Back to the Future/) your existence in the past is now tied to the probability of your existence in the future. If that changes, then the universe will adjust you to fit the new most-likely-version of the future. But the /past/ never changes.

This isn't recomputing the entire history of the world to be self-consistent; just altering the time-traveller, personally, at the moment the timeline changes. (It's not clear how memories they formed after arriving in the past work; do they remember having arrived with legs?)

Other changes /can/ affect you; there's a scene around halfway through where future!Joe's memories change, and he remembers having had a kid in the future; and a later one where his memories start switching back and forth between different possible wives, briefly incapacitating him. (Of course, I'd bet you could coma yourself as long as there was a decent chance you'd be woken up and some point.)

***** But isn't that still a strange sort of "time bubble" where the Eye Of The Universe is basically centered on whoever happens to be time traveling at that moment? Like, what happens if two people go back in time at once? Does the person who went farther back in time have priority?

Or for example, if Person A and Person B both plan to go into the past and kill each other's past self, and Person B goes back first, does time basically stop for Person A until Person B finishes whatever he was doing? Or can A go into the past himself while B is still mucking around there and, say, fight each other?

****** I'd be inclined to say that as soon as B goes back, A ceases to exist - they're merely a "possibility" that informs B's motivations and memories.

So yes, B has as much time as they like to kill A "before" A has a chance to travel back and stop him.

(If you think this is horrifying, incidentally, you are of course right. That's why time travel is always declared /massively illegal/ as soon as it's invented.)

I'm pretty sure anything else would be incompatible with the film's plot, actually; Old Joe never has to worry about the Rainmaker or any of those future gangsters coming back to stop him, /Terminator/-style.

If you cut off the legs of their past self, what exactly counts as the legs of their future self? Quite a lot of their legs have been replaced in the meantime. The blood in the legs of the future self isn't just not the same as the blood in their past self, most of it is different blood than was in their legs five minutes ago.

****** There's a causal link between your future-legs and your past-legs. The same way there's a causal link between actions that "change the future" and your memories of future events, even though you may not have been physically present for most of that causal chain.

By the way, I haven't seen Looper. Do his legs sever, vanish leaving bleeding stumps, or vanish leaving healed stumps?

It's not modelling the past here, just modelling the future (and badly) up to the point a version of you would travel back, and then adjusting you to fit in realtime.
