Some one over at [[/r/suggestmeabook][r/suggestmeabook]] said i should ask this question here. If this isnt the right sub, tell me and ill delete this post.

So far my absolute favourite books/web series/book series are: - Harry Potter And The Methods Of Rationality - Mother Of Learning - Skullduggery Pleasant - Sufficiently Advanced Magic - The Gam3 (less so than the others)

Can anyone reccommend me a book based of these. I know they're quite obscure, so if you've only read 1 or 2 of them, thats fine.

[[/u/Veedrac]] is right, you'll like most anything that this sub likes. I feel obligated to recommend Worm, as it's one of my favorite books of all time, even though it's not thematically related to the other ones you posted. [[http://www.parahumans.net][www.parahumans.net]]

***** Well let's run with the example of power munckinism. If a story doesn't even try to do coherent things there, as with most casual things in this genre, I don't particularly care how good they are at it: it's not the point of the story, so I'm not going to dwell on it. But Worm is putting nominal effort in, which makes me feel it's legitimate to think about these things─and that goes horribly wrong because Worm is really bad at using powers remotely intelligently. You can't have a story /about/ creative uses of abilities without it feeling like a problem when people miss extremely obvious things.

****** That's kind of missing the whole point of Worm though; its characters put thought into how they use their powers, but they're irrational in the same way people are irrational- not in the "hurr durr not everything has to be rational it's a story guyz" way, but like, in real life people make sub-optimal decisions all the time, but not necessarily arbitrary ones.

To use an example, if a character withholds information from someone who could help them, for no reason other than to drive the plot, that's bad writing. If a character withholds information from someone who could help, because they are mistrustful of authority figures, and they're mistrustful of authority figures because they've been frequently mistreated and ignored by people in power in the past, and those people in power weren't comic book villans, but realistic depictions of people with human biases goals, and flaws... then yes, it's probably irrational for a character to be cagey to a character wanting to help, but it's irrational in a way that is realistic. That's what worm is, the characters aren't always rational, but it's never arbitrary.

********** I'm wondering what your specific criticism of that fight is, because I thought it made a hell of a lot of sense considering the forces involved and the opponent they were up against. As far as the Wards go, I can point to a whole host of situations where people get paid FAR less than what their actually contribution to society represents, despite everyone agreeing it's wrong. Teachers, people in the military, etc etc etc. Add to that the fact that they are kids, and the significant societal inertia that entails. I can easily imagine a town meeting/ballot question/etc where the salary is getting set, and people arguing "what could they possibly need the money for, they're in high school." And if you want to use your powers non-illegally and you disagree with the pay, it's not like you can just go somewhere else. Your options are "suck it up," "become a criminal," or "attempt to use your powers for financial gain in a purely non-violent manner" which has the side effect of being deemed suspicious by society, as well as other problems for spoilery reasons.

************ The government certainly funds the Protectorate where it matters. Dragon, for instance, receives loads of money to build her suits, and Armsmaster gets enough that he's never been seen worrying about it.

A big chunk of the problem is that giving Ward Tinkers more funding wouldn't substantially improve the outcome of Endbringer fights. As you've seen, most capes aren't powerful enough to do anything but land a few hits that do barely any damage before getting taken out. The same applies to most Tinkers. Armsmaster and Dragon, the only Tinkers we saw who did something useful against Leviathan, are two of the best heroic Tinkers in the world. Dragon is /the/ best. Armsmaster has been working on his prediction algorithm and nanothorns for years, and that's with him being a workaholic with a strong power on top of that. What they can accomplish is not representative of what the average Ward can accomplish; look at Kid Win for a better example of that. (Did insignificant damage with his Alternator Canon and then got KOed.)

Furthermore, there aren't very many Ward Tinkers showing up to Endbringer fights. Out of maybe 250 capes in total, maybe 20 of them are Tinkers, of whom most are adults. I don't have any hard numbers, but I'd guess that maybe five (at most 10) of the defending capes were underage Tinkers. Not enough to really affect the outcome, even with funding.

Now, your point that the government should just pay villains not to be evil is a fair one. There's a couple of problems, though. One is that good, well-balanced people in general are not the sort of people who tend to undergo trigger events. Money is far from the only reason capes go villain. Another is that crime /does/ pay, really well if you're a powerful cape that can interfere with an Endbringer. It would be hard for the Protectorate to justify handing out seven-figure salaries right and left, especially when most of the recipients of said salaries woudnt actually show up to the fights. That brings us to another problem. Attendance at Endbringer fights is voluntary; someone who only joins the Protectorate for the money isn't going to want to stick their neck out against a city-destroying monster that kills at least a quarter of the defenders on average.

************* I'd assumed Tinkers already weren't resource limited. My point wasn't really about that and I'm going to skip the point about the effectiveness of the average Tinker here for brevity.

The incentive problem is much more where I was pointing. My "7+ digit salaries" comment was for those who are relevant in significant events like Endbringer attacks. Their jobs would be more specialized towards those things that law enforcement with guns would be unable to do, especially for the non-bulletproof ones, and their level of income would be conditional on showing up.

My impression so far is that a very significant fraction of the villains would be swayed by resources including reasonable pay, support for their particular circumstances, or being better treated by the law. You'd see a lot more dead Wards if most supervillains really were so irredeemable that a good legal path wouldn't interest them. 7 figures may sound like a huge amount, but it's really not that large; it's not uncommon for Google to give total compensation for new graduates in the ~$170k range, and they neither have superpowers nor do they fight the Endbringers.

************** You have a good point about villains getting paid enough to prevent them from becoming criminals. Wildbow hasn't really addressed this anywhere, AFAIK, and even though there are quite a lot of capes who wouldn't care about the money (the Fallen, Butcher, probably Bakuda, Kaiser, etc.), higher salaries would probably help to an extent.

The tricky thing is that incentivizing new recruits to do something /useful/--i.e. volunteering against class-S threats--is significantly more difficult. If a quarter of the defenders die in each Endbringer fight, their odds of survival aren't great if they attend them regularly and don't have Triumvirate-tier powers. The average cape knows this, and even though the Protectorate does pay people extra if they help against the class-S threats, it still wouldn't be enough to substantially increase Endbringer fight attendance, especially since someone willing to consider becoming a villain isn't going to feel morally obligated to help.

- Lois McMaster Bujold, and in particular "Falling Free", with its heroic engineers working together to build themselves a future
- Graydon Saunders's "Commonweal" series, beginning with the military fantasy The March North and continuing with the sorcery school A Succession Of Bad Days; this is either a civil engineering manual lost in a fantasy or the other way around, not sure which.
- Rick Cook's "The Wiz Biz" series is trashy pulp, but it's delicious trashy pulp with computer engineers figuring out a magic system. Well, I thought it was delicious. Note that I'm not saying it was /good/.

** Lots of good recommendations here, so I'll add a couple of easy reading fantasy options. Both got references from HPMOR, either in-story or in an author's note.

Lawrence Watt-Evans' /Legends of Ethshar/ series dips in and out of rational fantasy territory, and they're quite good. None of the characters are hyper-rational, but their behavior is believably within the spectrum of normal humans, irrespective of their role in the plot. Narrative is unpredictable; sometimes there's a hint of deus ex machina but just as often the plots go off the rails in unexpected directions. As with Watt-Evans' other series, the world-building is excellent with well-defined political and magic systems.

Patricia C. Wrede's /Enchanted Forest Chronicles/ are not so much rational as comic fantasy deconstruction. Set in a standard high fantasy universe, with witches, wizards, dragons, magic swords, et c., but similar in tone to Discworld. Main characters tend to be normal-ish people in a world populated largely by overblown caricatures of standard fantasy archetypes.
