Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Solid objects temporarily stop existing while they are directly above you, with the exception of living animals.

Buildings, underground bunkers, aeroplanes flying above? Doesn't matter. There is always a cylinder tunnel of free space with you at the bottom.

How do you munchkin this, and how do you deal with rain?

*** Termite extermination. Walk under a building and all the termites above you fall out. You couldn't get them if they were in the walls, depending on how much larger the cylinder is than you are, but you would have a good chance of killing a majority of the nest.

Geology could be interesting, because if you walked through a tunnel in a mountain people could look at rock strata without having to dig. Same with finding veins or ore.

You become a moving no-fly zone, as any plane directly above you either dumps passengers or fuel in midair. Neither of which is particularly useful. You are similarly prohibited from travel by submarine. Dams don't want you anywhere near them.

You're probably never going to want to walk in a building taller than 1 story because you might walk under a waste line, a gas pipe, or a water pipe. Hot water heaters kept in attics might accidentally kill you even then.

***** Yeah it would be pretty gross, but luckily termite poop isn't living matter.

Oh, just thought of a better use: hospitals. Anybody who has a foreign object in them, like if they swallowed something they shouldn't have or have a bullet in them or whatever, could just be passed above your head. If the power works how I'm thinking it does, the object would then fall out of the person and be revealed whenever you moved, but the main thing is it could be removed from someone painlessly and without surgery.

This could possibly be extended to instant tattoo removal.

I'm assuming, mostly for convenience, that any bacteria or viruses would be considered as part of the host for the purposes of this power. If not, you could sterilize people very easily, which might be bad for digestive purposes but could also cure someone of any biological or viral disease.

******* Yeah, it could accidentally kill someone if done wrong. But you could do things like remove the bits of gravel that stick in people when they get severe road rash, or if someone swallows something like a needle it wouldn't be much of a problem. Children swallow stuff that they shouldn't all the time. People also get things stuck in their butt, which usually requires surgery, but now could be simple to remove. Broken glass is probably a big problem to remove from someone currently as well.

Also, I edited the above comment with two additional things that might work.

*** I think the capability to separate solids from liquids would have lucrative applications in various industrial processes. Off the top of my head I can think of sifting gold (probably not effective nowadays) or removing solids in a water treatment plant.

You have clarified that the solid objects continue to exist, and can in fact interact with other solid objects outside the tube (the no falling overhang rule), so I guess the space of the tube above you would eventually be invisibly filled with the solids coming pouring in with the liquid and would block new solids from flowing in, until a plug formed outside the tube stopping the water flowing as well. Then you would have to move to a new spot. No, wait you could remove the solids with a piston or whatever, it would exist for the solids even in the tube, so it would work normally.

Oh, I got it! The solids in the tube would experience a perfect vacuum. High-tech clean room manufactories would probably pay better than water treatment plants.

***** So nonliving solids are in the background tube; living solids, gas, liquids and light are in the foreground tube. The foreground tube moves with you, but the background doesn't. A bottle or airplane would spill its liquid/living contents.

You might be useful in search and rescue, moving through a collapsed building without collapsing it further, and carrying out buried people.

It sounds unhealthy if a person is sitting on the boundary of the tube and then I move, shunting a solid object into them.

*** Step 1: Massively increase the size of the cylinder directly above you by massively increasing your horizontal size with skin grafts.

Step 2: Make public arrangements to stand on your head at a certain time, causing a large chunk of the Earth to temporarily stop existing, significantly reducing the gravity of the Earth, and allowing for really really cheap rocket launches.

Step 3: Repeat until humanity becomes a space faring civilization.

EDIT: Depending on whether the non-existent solids stay attached to their vehicle, there may be an easier way to launch rockets: just point your head at large chunks of the rockets themselves, so their weight is significantly reduced. Then once they leave the cylinder directly above you all the solids reappear in space.

***** You wouldn't hit the magma directly. You'd be pushed down into the tube by air pressure and gravity, accelerating thru a vacuum while being burned on the sides by magma and probably being crushed by the pressure on the sides, until you shoot out the other end into space, there to probably go into orbit until some day that you burn up in re-entry.

The magma wouldn't be shot out anywhere as it would disappear when it enters the column as well.

Take a robot arm that holds a solid log of wood over your head. The wood and connecting part of the arm is in vanish-space. Then take a few hundred pounds of drugs packed into a cylindrical bag of slightly smaller diameter, and bring over your head so that, in vanish-space, it is completely overlapped by the log. When you walk away, what happens? Does the bag, being placed in vanish-space later, overwrite the log? Do the two materials interact within vanish-space, preventing them from overlapping? Or will there be some atomic fusion going on?

****** Ah, I get ya. Solid objects still interact with each other as normal while they are in the â€˜background â€˜ so you can't overlap them any more than you normally can. You can still get overlap to happen but it would need to be with something living, and something solid.

In earlier discussion the power settled on being essentially two overlapping layers of reality.

I don't know what the result would be. But we'd have to assume on a physics level that with the amount of interactions it goes through just by moving, that it's not likely to cause any explosions or anything else that would have been quickly devastating and should have reasonably occurred by now if it was going to happen.

**** This would not work. It was clarified that an overhang would not fall, so solid matter in the tube interacts with solid matter outside the tube, so the weight distribution of the wheel would be unaffected, as it's entirely solid. But you are onto something here. You just need to use a combination of liquids and solids. For example, put the flywheel underwater and stand under one side. Then that side won't experience buoyancy, while the other will and you get your free power.

Does glass count as a solid, or as an exceptionally slow-flowing liquid? If the second, I could use a glass umbrella.

Imagine this situation: A robot arm holds a steel bar (vertically) underwater. I swim under the bar. Bar vanishes, water flows into the gap. I swim away.

I then have a steel bar molecularly bonded to an equivalent volume of water. What uses does this new metamaterial have? (Aside from dunking me the /next/ time I walk under it?)

What happens to the electric charge on vanished solids?

Say there's a lightning rod, and a thunderstorm. The rod builds up a charge, and I walk directly under it /just before/ a bolt of lightning would strike it. Does the lightning still strike? If so, where?

Or I walk under a large electromagnet, vanishing it. Are things still attracted to the non-existent magnet?

Does the cylinder stay a perfect cylinder at all times? If so, you now have a method of communicating that's faster than light. Might not be simple to implement but if you have someone lightyears away from you, and they can detect where holes are appearing, you can communicate one way with them. Assuming you can accurately point at their planet, that is.

** You are a Kitsune: an intelligent, talking fox with two tails. You possess the power to shapeshift into any human you have ever seen. You can also perfectly imitate the sound of anyone's voice, though you will need to study people's mannerisms if you wish to imitate them perfectly. Your power does not grant you any knowledge of other languages, besides the ones you already know.

This power is purely a magical disguise. It will not make you any stronger or fitter than an average human of your disguise's supposed age. It will also limit your senses to those of a human, so you cannot use your fox hearing or sense of smell while in disguise. It does make you taller, give you the strength of an average human (of the appropriate age), and give you opposable thumbs, but those are the only extras it grants.

Your shapeshifting does not affect any clothing you wear. You need to find clothes if you turn human, and stash your possessions somewhere safe if you become a fox.

If anyone directly, verbally accuses you of being a fox, you will instantly transform back into a fox against your will. You can change back into a human right away, but never fast enough to keep your vulpine nature a secret. This effect can be invoked as many times as a person likes -- anyone who knows your secret can out you at any time.

You cannot cannot hide your tails. When you are a fox, your two tails are always visible. When you are a human, at least one of your tails is always visible, extending out of your disguise's tail-bone. You must conceal your tail inside your clothing, or possibly leave it out and invent some lie to justify it (hunting trophy, part of a costume, etc.).

Any footprints you leave always take the form of fox paw-prints.

Your shadow always bears some visibly vulpine features (ears, a snout, fur, etc.) no matter who you shift into.

All dogs can see through your disguise, no matter what. How they respond to the presence of a human-shaped fox may vary, but most will react with hostility.

You are living in a pre-industrial, medieval society. There are things you wish to do within human society, but many humans fear and distrust Kitsunes, and will not tolerate you if they find out your true nature. What are some good ways to keep your nature a secret, while still having a good degree of freedom to move among humans unnoticed?
