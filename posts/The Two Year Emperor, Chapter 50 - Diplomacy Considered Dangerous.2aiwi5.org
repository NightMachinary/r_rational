*** Pro: He's affected by magic.

Con: RAW specifically states that Diplomacy doesn't work on PCs.

*** I don't think so. He breaks enough rules that he should be affected as if by earth-physics.

**** By 'breaks enough rules' do you mean 'exploits enough loopholes' or 'game rules do not apply to him'? If it's the first, godly intervention might mess him up, but if it's the second, I don't see how it's a problem.

Wait, I just thought of a second point. Does he count as a PC or NPC? [[#s][Explanation]]

Edit: I misread your reply so mine looks like a counterargument for the side you're arguing against, but I believe that my point still stands.

***** The game rules do not apply to him. For example, he treats command words for magic items as words (not a 6 second action), so it's likely that he treats words coming from a diplomacy attempt as merely words.

Also, he's probably a player character (and therefore immune) and might not even have D&D attitudes towards people.

****** The intelligence upgrade works, and the mind rewrite also worked, so it seems like magic by others does still affect him. I'm not sure of PC's are /de jure/ affected by diplomacy/bluff/etc. rolls, but we did play it like that in the few games I've been in.

Those are all explicitly magic though. Diplomacy is a mundane skill, so I'd put it in the same category as people passing through each other while moving, or him running out of stamina.

I don't think they are. Diplomacy checks are explicitly for NPCs.
