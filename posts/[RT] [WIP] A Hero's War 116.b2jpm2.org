** It's always interesting in technological revolution stories to find that the enemy is also adapting to new technologies. Refreshing to see the extinction-level enemy being a hive mind of zombies, though.

Wondering if the zombies would've grown this much if Cato's revolution never happened?

*** Chapter 120 on FinctionPress is the same as chapter 116 on RoyalRoad. Maybe the author merged some chapters?
