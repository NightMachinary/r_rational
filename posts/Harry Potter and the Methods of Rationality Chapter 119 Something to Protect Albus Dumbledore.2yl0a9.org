** No Hermione, 0/10

In all seriousness, it's good to be back in Harry's skull. I'll never fathom why EY thinks it's a good idea to hide the hero's most significant thoughts from the audience; that causes anxiety, not interest.

** Well, it looks like the truth has out afterall.

Edit: On a related note, [[http://my.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2yd1ye/chapter_harry_potter_and_the_methods_of/cp9carc][Called Harry being master of the Elder Wand]], but in retrospect that was pretty obviously going to factor in. Hoping he finds the Resurrection Stone and figures out what was up with the Peverell's graves somehow in the next three chapters, but without a timeskip, I'm not hopeful.

***** Well, they still think that Monroe is a hero, and this one is not an obvious deduction. And then there's the end of the world prophecies (this one is much more reasonable to keep quiet, I'll grant him that).

But really, my main issue is not with the extent of this revelation, but with the coverage. The general populace still has nothing, but fairy tales and fake heroes to worship (but Harry still gets all the material prizes from the victory). Especially objectionable with Hermione, whose true achievement of killing off the Dementors (if she really does that) would be totally overshadowed by Harry's fake.

******* I'll agree that keeping as much of this as possible secret has pragmatic advantages, no question about that (except maybe a risk of blackmail in the future, but we know this won't happen, because this is the end of the story already). But is it the /right thing to do/ for a hero? For a /rationalist/ hero? Keeping everything secret as much as possible because it's convenient, and you know what's better for everybody anyway? You can't even spin the usual tale about dangerous knowledge in this case. It's just /personally inconvenient/ for Harry and his goals if the true story sees the light.

Edit: It's strange to say that, but Canon!Harry did a better job from my point of view after the graveyard. He sticked to the truth even if it was politically damaging for him.

So why contrive a situation to sorta kinda justify the hero doing a thing that you probably shouldn't do it the real life, and present it as the right thing to do? Seems questionable to me.

Second, Harry has the Line of Merlin, the Stone, Hogwarts, the Order and almost-immortal Hermione at his disposal. He doesn't necessarily need to be a lying bastard to follow through with his "Philosopher's Hospital" plan.

********** The problem is that revealing the truth would introduce some significant risk to his plans. Satisfaction of telling the truth is just not worth it. A rationalist hero has to do what he thinks will lead to the best expected outcome, even if this entails sacrificing his personal integrity. One reason this is a bad idea in the real world is that human hardware is treacherous. Systematic reasoning along the lines of "minor evil is worth it, because the good I will achieve with this political power will outweigh it" is especially vulnerable to subversion. At the same time, some ends really do justify the means. There is no easy rule you can use to actually achieve optimal outcomes. In this particular case, I think lying is an obviously right choice.

Personally, I have a great aversion to information warfare (lying, restricting access to information, propoganda, etc.). At the same time, I acknowledge the fact that sometimes pretty much everyone is better off if the truth stays hidden. In these cases I consider the decision to lie/obfuscate a moral one even if it feels evil to me.

** Next up: Leadership. Harry Potter figures out that the world not having blown up was due to total incompetence in teaching Muggle Studies. Muggle science is ruthlessly suppressed to keep anyone from transfiguring anything that would end the world or everyone capable of magic is forced to take the "I must not destroy the world" unbreakable vow in a sweep of well meaning totalitarianism.

Also Harry now has the tool to cripple or even destroy modern capitalism. The gold standard can be made worthless at any given moment. It's still handy to keep around to have access to carrots and sticks, but the end of money is within sight. When you can transfigure anything physical objects no longer can serve as money. Adoption of the reputation economy to follow.

Death from old age is pretty much over now as a thing for wizards and as has been demonstrated on Hermione, death from anything save for avada kedavra or fiend fyre is now impossible. Death is no longer permanent as long as you have an in-tact brain. The whole needing an in-tact brain thing will probably be solved at some point too.

Other advancements will rapidly follow as Harry gets his PHD's or their equivalent. This will probably happen rather rapidly as he magically bootstraps himself into godhood. It'll just take some sort of tipping point that will cause him to learn things faster. We'll save that for year two.

Welcome to the magical singularity.

No /modern/ capitalist economy after 1969 ever even followed any kind of gold standard. Not if they weren't blatantly on crazy-stupid pills.

Besides which, any kind of economy based on being able to conjure or copy /all mere commodities/ (as Transfiguration is explicitly noted to be able to do: multiplying food and such) is already an economy where marginal cost = marginal labor input, which is /radically/ different from recognizable capitalism.

*** Of course, the use of the Philosopher's Stone for trivial purposes like wiping out the world's economy or flying to Jupiter comes at a price.

It can be used 369 times per day, which is way below the world death rate. If we disregard Muggles, then given standard fanon estimates of the world population and death rates of wizards, house-elves, centaurs, and goblins, it could /barely/ keep up. Adding the families of Muggleborns and half-bloods pushes it over the limit.

Every use of the Stone of Permanency comes at the opportunity cost of one sentient life. Plan accordingly.

**** Well, sort of.

It actually should be plenty for wizards, after the first few months.

Think about it for a minute - it restores you to perfect health and youth. So, even with the risk of violent or accidental death, a single person should not need to go through the process more than once every 30 years at least on average.

So, if it can be used 369 times a day, it can be used 134,685 times a year.

That's more than 40 million times in 30 years, which should be plenty to deal with the entire wizarding population even taking into account accidents and violence (which can be reduced by having as an added punishment for violent crime the denial of Stone treatment).

The only real problem is the triage at the beginning, in deciding who gets the first set of treatments. After all wizards have gone through at least once, there will be plenty of usages left not needed for upkeep.

Nah, they'll just move to the goblin standard - each coin will henceforth be stamped with goblin magic (if they're not already), Gringotts will stop accepting gold for currency (except at market rates, which the Philosopher's Stone will destroy), and everything will continue on mostly as it was before. Because the Stone shouldn't let you counterfeit the magic attached to the coins, the economy is safe to keep on running.

**** That's putting the cart before the horse. You're talking about counterfeit protection, not value. Coins are valuable because you can use them to purchase stuff. The coins themselves aren't inherently valuable. People need to have a sort of faith in them that they're worth something. Originally coins were made of particular mixes of precious metals. Then they were backed by precious metals. The US moved to a faith based economy. Just throwing coins out there doesn't really mean a lot unless the goblins have something that is universally desired, like gold. People need to buy into the idea that the coins are worth something.

In short, money is valuable because it can be used to purchase many other valuable things. If there is nothing to back the money then those coins won't be worth much.

Also goblins don't do magic. They do superior goblin forging, which is their particular shtick.
