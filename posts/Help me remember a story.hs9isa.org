It's an isekai LitRPG about a world with Lavi instead of air. The main character is a woman. Right at the beginning her eye is removed and replaced with a crystal that has an AI in it. She develops very high poison resistance and this becomes a major plot point later when she needs to hunt through a toxic area to find a special flower so that she and her friends can level up.

Anyone know the story?

*** I am very pleased to know that this is on royalroad instead of the author's own (quite badly formatted) website.

**** In general, I despise the centralization of content onto a few big sites. In this case, the original website was slow and annoying enough that It's less egregious.

***** Yep! My ideal preference would be that the author's website be good and that I get to use than instead of RoyalRoad, but in this case the website working right is more important than spiting the ad servers.
