** Is it my impression or the author have no fucking clue about what is behind the wall and is trying to stretch the time as much as he can?

*** Wasn't already showed when the mother communicated with the aliens? It should have just a radio station plus all the children dossiers.

**** I think [[/u/hoja_nasredin]] is referring to the wall that surounds the orphanage/farm, not the hidden room.

They're implying that the author doesn't really know what the kids are going to do after they escape, so they're stalling for time by stretching out the escape as long as possible.

*** Well, in this chapter Emma said there's a field followed by a possible forest. The binoculars should help figure out what's immediately outside the wall. For the world, apparently they're going to use secret messenges from that author to figure out what to do.

So I assume with these things being mentioned this chapter, the author has some idea of where the story is going to go after they escape.

*** I don't really see it, but the cover page probably took a ton of time and effort. So the rest of the art might've suffered for it.

** I keep going to check the latest edition of Jump magazine, which is available in every conbini around where I live, and I can never see any sign of this manga. Where are they coming from?? To be fair, I can't read Japanese very well, and there do seem to be about 20 different titles in each edition, so I might just be missing it.
