**** I was really not expecting to get such a heartwarming scene between Marco and Jake (Edit: and not only the care in the first scene, but the trust at the end! Perfect!) or Tobias and Garrett, this late in the story, and thought there was pretty much no chance you'd wrap up Tobias' conflict about identity and death.

*Edit:* I just realized that if the holograms transmit thought-speak, Maninho could have quietly morphed into a tardigrade and talked privately with Terra. Maybe he sent them something like the /delest/, to carry his final thoughts back to the sharing. He could have also asked the ship to scan him and store a backup before he morphed (the only reason individual yeerks can't be morph-resurrected is that Seerow's tech tries to extrapolate from DNA when it scans an incomplete organism, but Good Ship + Quat's lab tech wouldn't have that limitation).

and the idea was that Cassie was going to just grab onto, like, /an entire Bug fighter/ and take it into her morph so that her time limit was like 3sec and then she'd die and be Rachel and the Chee ship could burn away the tissue

and that was Dope and Rad until I remembered that morphing would totally let Crayak know what was up, under some pretty reasonable assumptions, so instead of having Cassie sac herself I went with what you see above

but anyway long story short is, you can just morph with a boulder and hey, presto, very very short time limit.

Fenrir's also correct that you could just burn away the control tissue, but that feels more ... violently unpleasant, or something.

** In Roman mythology, Jupiter was the child-- the "joint creation" if you will-- of Saturn and another titan. Saturn tried to eat Jupiter when he was a baby, and was tricked by the other titan into eating a rock instead. He believed Jupiter was dead. Saturn was later defeated by Jupiter, who reigned over the new age of gods as God of the Sky.

In this chapter, a bolt of fire the size of Jupiter is flung at a titan the size of Saturn, who is consuming a very large rock. As best as I can discern, this chapter takes place sometime around Halloween in the late twenties, meaning the Earth and Saturn are aligned.

The Fury of Jupiter will destroy them both, before hurtling onward into the void.

Years later, if alien beings come to the solar system to see where it all began, they might search the skies for the receding blaze of glory, exploding in slow motion due to time dilation as it carries away the age of titans, and marks the dawn of the age of gods.

They can find it in the constellation of Aries.

** This chapter was great. Answered a lot of questions but, of course, raised plenty of others too.

One thing is that I'm super curious about what's really going on with Crayak right now. On the one hand it's possible that it really /did/ spend its initiative down so low that the best it could do was mobilize the remaining Howlers and also launch a few whatever-weapons-they-were from the not-really-Earth-anymore's surface. But on the other hand, maybe it didn't and it's holding its initiative in reserve for... something. But if that's the case, what kind of /something/ is worth risking the hypercomputer that it currently lives in? I don't feel like getting Marco and Jake to sacrifice themselves is itself enough of a reward for that kind of risk, if it could kill them off and more in some easier way.

And of course the other thing is what's the deal with all the unanswered alternate universe/alternate timeline shenanigans, and how will that play into the endgame? Is something going to happen soon that's the actual cause of those shenanigans? It's been claimed that time travel is impossible in this universe, but do we really /know/ that? Maybe self-consistent loops are possible à la HPMOR, and we've just seen the weird effects of some future cause radiating backwards in time. Or maybe there's a DBZ-style immutable but branching timelines thing going on, and the current universe is the result of intervention from another timeline. But if that's the case, who intervened and when? All in all, I still have no idea what to make of it and I guess we'll have to see what the next chapters bring us.

There's also the question of what part the Visser has to play in the remaining chapters, if any. Does he have backups that would have survived the quantum virus? If not, then he's presumably still backed up inside the hypercomptuer several times over like every other morpher. Would Crayak have a reason to bring him back after wiping him off the game board? Would /Rachel/ have a reason to bring him back?

not sure how confident I am in that line of thinking, but it could be a thing. especially since there were two separate attempts to destroy the arbiter, and Crayak seems pretty content with sitting there and letting the second one happen after the first one foiled itself.

I have a question: Regarding everyone generally avoiding morphing before the arranged countdown-end time so as not to give anything away...

And regarding Tobias and Garrett acquiring one another shortly before the arranged countdown-end time...

Does the acquiring process itself not access the hypercomputer, and the characters know that it doesn't? Unless this was explained or discovered at some point that I missed, I would have thought that it does, the same way that morphing does, to upload and process the acquired pattern so that it can be used later.

** Reactions:

What a way to go, ramming the sun. The sheer spectacle is dimmed only slightly by the fact that presumably everyone has backups of everyone else, and even one survivor means everyone lives.

Wonder what's going to happen with Vasco. Probably we'll get to see what V3's quantum virus contingencies are from his POV.

What would Cassie want to do with a shelf of quantum viruses? Was this part of the plan?

Tobias gets it... finally. Took him long enough.

I see the original plan for 1 narrator per chapter (as described in Ch. 44's notes) has gone out the window. Probably for the best, and I'd likely have done the same. It doesn't set off my OCD as it's limited to the final and suitably epic arc.

Only 2 chapters to not only resolve the present crisis, but explain and deal with the canon-discrepancy stuff, as well as the narratively mandated return of V3. Those are going to be tightly packed no matter how you dice them (I'm hoping for more 30k word chapters personally). But however it turns out, there HAVE to be only 2 chapters left, by hook or by crook, to make the total 54. If I was writing and really needed the chapter space, I'd relabel Ch. 48 into an interlude, freeing 1 more Chapter number. Very clever to pad out/hold in reserve a flexible number for the crucial chapter count.

Questions I'd like to clear up:

- Was Rachel the one responsible for taking down the z space rift? She had to because they were all outside it at the start and Cassie had to make it to Mars ASAP, am I right?

** Tobias is going to the Pemalite homeworld 11 days away; it's the only other place that even might have technology that could be a threat to Crayak.

The only other move I can think of that even /might/ force Crayak to respond would be going to Leera, abducting a bunch of Leerans, and dropping them into the middle of every gathering of sentient minds he could find, anywhere.

I predict that this:

#+begin_quote
  A billion simulations began, then, as the player checked and re-checked and re-re-checked its assumptions, making sure that it had not missed anything of import. A billion Vissers crawled through the simulations, encountering the information under a billion slightly varied sets of circumstances, reacting to it in a billion slightly different ways, creating a billion branching futures.
#+end_quote

will end up having been a bad idea, or at least an interesting one. The halting problem implies you can't make an absolutely perfect virus-checker, right? So as soon as Visser 3 realized he was being studied and modeled, he would have started trying to make a program that models his behavior a virus that takes over the Arbiter. And he would obviously base the exact strategy on the subtlest quantum randomness, to ensure that all billion copies throws something different. And even if no copies succeed, some copies might come close enough to warrant further investigation by Crayak (copying himself, for example), thereby spawning more copies of the Visser. This is exactly what Toomin did to Father: as a simulation, take over the platform. I wonder if the trap Toomin set with Rachel is intended to distract Crayak from this, and to incentivize it to consider low-probability events, such as being taken over by copies of one of your simulations.

#+begin_quote
  In computability theory, the halting problem is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running, or continue to run forever. Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist.

  For any program f that might determine if programs halt, a "pathological" program g, called with some input, can pass its own source and its input to f and then specifically do the opposite of what f predicts g will do. No f can exist that handles this case. A key part of the proof is a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which is known as a Turing machine; the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines. It is one of the first cases of decision problems proven to be unsolvable. This proof is significant to practical computing efforts, defining a class of applications which no programming invention can possibly perform perfectly.
#+end_quote

In other words, one of the "this must be true or else we are irredeemably fucked anyway" assumptions the kids can probably make is that not even Crayak could make a platform that can be absolutely certain a given simulation is safe to run. I'm wondering if Toomin incorporated this into his strategy when planting his "ghosts in the machine".

Unfortunately:

- The halting problem means it's not /always/ possible to determine what a given program does, if that program can do an unlimited amount of computation.\\
  *But* that doesn't apply if you say "well, computing for more than a billion years is suspicious as /heck/, I'll treat that as a virus".
- The halting problem refers to all possible programs. "Programs we want to run", or "programs simulating people", may be enormously simpler to analyse.
- The halting problem /does not/ rule out perfectly secure "sandboxes". If Crayak is simulating a program or person, /there need not be any way "out" of the simulation/.\\
  (not even LARPing the malign universal prior, which is sad in this hypothetical but very good news IRL)

TLDR, Crayak could in fact start running programs in an inescapable sandbox, and terminate them if they looked suspicious without needing ultracomputational powers.

There's something thematically relevant, there, but I'm still trying to process the last scene and comment simultaneously, so I'm not sure how to phrase it better than <3 <3 <3 .

So I think the idea here is that Crayak put too much of himself into the Arbitor, that's the megastructure that showed up around Earth, and their plan was to distract Crayak so they could do as much damage to the physical structure as possible, possibly while blowing up the Sun and/or Earth, in whole or in part, whichever works. Something went wrong. Feels like the Howlers leaving a contengency deadman's switch type thing, more than direct action from Crayak, but that last scenehappened so fast I'll have to reread.

In my headcanon, she was /aaaaalmost/ not self-aware, in the way that you can kind of sneakily let yourself do something you know you shouldn't do, while humming innocently to yourself/distracting yourself/not thinking about it too closely.

So she stuck to the plan, in a fashion that would be visibly hard to distinguish if somehow anybody checked, in a way that would allow her to truthfully say things like "yep, I've told him to morph at the appropriate time, I've told him to launch at the appropriate time, we're all set."

But she slipped a couple of digits---enough to ensure that he'd come out of hyperspace /not/ in the middle of the sun.

BTW his morphing was part of the bluff---he was meant to morph so that Crayak would /see/ that they were alive, that they were coming, that the sun was going to get rammed. But if Crayak did in fact see, Crayak would have noticed that the course /wouldn't/ take the ship into the sun, so I wonder how Crayak would have reacted/how Crayak would have interpreted this weird bit of data...

*** On that note I kinda have been wondering what drove the Ellimist to play along after he got backed into the corner by Crayak. The only move he could make was to use all the initiative he had to eliminate the Chee, but wouldn't he also know that doing so would cause him to forfeit the game? If his choice was between losing the game by inaction and losing the game by action, it seems like he could have thrown up his hands and been like "You wanted unlocked Chee, Crayak? Okay, hope you have fun with them!"

I'm guessing that the Ellimist must have had /some/ hope that he could wipe the Chee out while keeping the game going, or else he wouldn't have given it a try. Or maybe his actions didn't /directly/ lead to a forfeit according to the rules of the game, but still left him open to some kind of direct attack from Crayak that he didn't anticipate. But I'm not really sure how that works since we don't know the exact rules of the game.

Does it allow the players to directly attack each other if they accumulate sufficient advantage, or does one of them have to break a rule to be open to attack? And is it the opposing player that has to do the kill, or does the arbiter do that automatically? It /seems/ like Crayak is the one who did the Ellimist in, and seemingly in a way that the Ellimist didn't predict in advance. But it's still hard to tell from an outside perspective.

Eliminating the Chee requires actions that violate the rules of the game (bringing out the hypercomputer and using it to zap them away), which leaves it vulnerable to a killing blow by Crayak or the arbiter itself or whatever. Not eliminating them means letting them run rampant and free since Crayak purposefully rendered itself helpless to intervene. Eventually they'll figure out how to get into the arbiter, take out the Ellimist and Crayak both, then continue doing whatever they want with the universe uncontested.

** If Jake and Marco morph before impact Rachel could save them. May not be worth it, though

** As excited as I am to see how this ends, I'm so bummed out to think about it ending. One of my favorite stories of all time. I wish this wasn't fanfiction so that physical copies of this great work could be produced, I would definitely buy them

I was wondering if physically attacking the computer itself was a viable option, glad to see the characters thought of that as well. Although I have to say, I don't really want the earth to be destroyed and for Jake and Marco to die...but we will see

*** I have some plans for physical copies in the works; basically the way it'd have to work is there would be a printer who would have the files, and people could pay the printer directly to whip up a personal copy. Like, as far as I can tell it's fine as long as I'm not profiting off of it and it's just individuals asking the printer for their own personal vanity copy, and paying strictly for the printing/binding/shipping.

**** Amazing. I wonder how big the book would be, probably quite a tome. I self published a book on Amazon and set it to where I would get no profit and the price was incredibly cheap (like $3) but it was significantly smaller than this. If you're going to do that you should probably just call it “The Reckoning”

****** I remember this cover project from way back, but I didn't know any of them ever actually got finished. I kind of assumed it had been abandoned. This one looks great! For some reason, the tardigrade is a hilarious choice for a cover morph, but one that totally works. Also why is that kid instantly recognizable as Garrett, even though Garrett's face literally does not exist?

******* The project is stalled on sufficiently realistic Andalite design, unfortunately. I got all the covers that don't involve an Andalite (Tobias should be morphing into Elfangor, and Ax should be morphing into something).

**** I would be interested in a copy also, but we'll have to see how much it costs (with shipping to Australia!).

Do you also plan to have a "definitive edition" in ePub format (or similar)?
