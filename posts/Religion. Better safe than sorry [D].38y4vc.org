Ok. This post is mostly a question for the athiests among us. Based on what I've seen, the rational community is overwhelmingly athiest (as am I)

I just wanted to bring up a point, for the sake of discussion, and getting others' opinion on the subject.

While, rationally, it does appear that we live in a universe where there is no involved creator(whereas quite a few major religions insist there is a deity constantly influencing our day-to-day existence) what if we are incorrect? I'm not saying whether we are or aren't, but what if there is a creator?

For the sake of the example, let's take the Christian faith. By their beliefs, you need to believe in Jesus and accept him into your life honestly, and boom, free ticket to heaven. Eternal afterlife of joy, happiness, etc. whereas, if you don't, eternal afterlife of burning and torment.

Considering your finite earth life (let's optimistically say you can hit 150, assuming for advances in medicine) compared to an infinite afterlife, doesn't the math suggest it's best you take the super small chance of believing in a religion, because the tradeoff is of infinite length?

Some obvious counterarguments are "how do you choose which one to believe in?" and "the religion's beliefs go against my current beliefs too heavily". For the first one, I agree, but having none at all isn't exactly a soultion there. For the second, I would say just pick one that closely aligned. Most religions (outside of cults) won't have you doing anything too outrageous.

Again, this is just a discussion point. I'm curious to hear what you guys have to say.


** This is better known as Pascal's Wager, and it's essentially been argued to death. Dawkins has a far better overview of the arguments in chapter 3 of /The God Delusion/ than anyone will probably give you here:

#+begin_quote
  The great French mathematician Blaise Pascal reckoned that, however long the odds against God's existence might be, there is an even larger asymmetry in the penalty for guessing wrong. You'd better believe in God, because if you are right you stand to gain eternal bliss and if you are wrong it won't make any difference anyway. On the other hand, if you don't believe in God and you turn out to be wrong you get eternal damnation, whereas if you are right it makes no difference. On the face of it the decision is a no-brainer. Believe in God.

  There is something distinctly odd about the argument, however. Believing is not something you can decide to do as a matter of policy. At least, it is not something I can decide to do as an act of will. I can decide to go to church and I can decide to recite the Nicene Creed, and I can decide to swear on a stack of bibles that I believe every word inside them. But none of that can make me actually believe it if I don't. Pascal's wager could only ever be an argument for feigning belief in God. And the God that you claim to believe in had better not be of the omniscient kind or he'd see through the deception. The ludicrous idea that believing is something you can decide to do is deliciously mocked by Douglas Adams in Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, where we meet the robotic Electric Monk, a labour-saving device that you buy 'to do your believing for you'. The de luxe model is advertised as 'Capable of believing things they wouldn't believe in Salt Lake City'.

  But why, in any case, do we so readily accept the idea that the one thing you must do if you want to please God is believe in him? What's so special about believing? Isn't it just as likely that God would reward kindness, or generosity, or humility? Or sincerity? What if God is a scientist who regards honest seeking after truth as the supreme virtue? Indeed, wouldn't the designer of the universe have to be a scientist? Bertrand Russell was asked what he would say if he died and found himself confronted by God, demanding to know why Russell had not believed in him. 'Not enough evidence, God, not enough evidence,' was Russell's (I almost said immortal) reply. Mightn't God respect Russell for his courageous scepticism (let alone for the courageous pacifism that landed him in prison in the First World War) far more than he would respect Pascal for his cowardly bet-hedging? And, while we cannot know which way God would jump, we don't need to know in order to refute Pascal's Wager. We are talking about a bet, remember, and Pascal wasn't claiming that his wager enjoyed anything but very long odds. Would you bet on God's valuing dishonestly faked belief (or even honest belief) over honest scepticism?

  Then again, suppose the god who confronts you when you die turns out to be Baal, and suppose Baal is just as jealous as his old rival Yahweh was said to be. Mightn't Pascal have been better off wagering on no god at all rather than on the wrong god? Indeed, doesn't the sheer number of potential gods and goddesses on whom one might bet vitiate Pascal's whole logic? Pascal was probably joking when he promoted his wager, just as I am joking in my dismissal of it. But I have encountered people, for example in the question session after a lecture, who have seriously advanced Pascal's Wager as an argument in favour of believing in God, so it was right to give it a brief airing here.

  Is it possible, finally, to argue for a sort of anti-Pascal wager? Suppose we grant that there is indeed some small chance that God exists. Nevertheless, it could be said that you will lead a better, fuller life if you bet on his not existing, than if you bet on his existing and therefore squander your precious time on worshipping him, sacrificing to him, fighting and dying for him, etc. I won't pursue the question here, but readers might like to bear it in mind when we come to later chapters on the evil consequences that can flow from religious belief and observance.

*** Pascal did address these things.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager]]

He noted that other religions were obviously false and explained it and gave what he saw as proofs and suggested that you ask for advice from others on how to learn how to believe and follow their path.

#+begin_quote
  However, as noted above, nowhere in the establishment of the wager does Pascal appeal to feigned belief; God, being omniscient, would not succumb to such trickery and unwittingly reward the disingenuous. Rather, in the passage following the establishment of the wager, Pascal addresses a hypothetical person who has already weighed the rationality of believing in God through the wager and is convinced by it, but remains unable to sincerely believe. Again, as noted above, Pascal offers this person a way to escape the irrational sentiment that compels him to withhold belief in God after the validity of the wager has been rationally conceded. This way consists of applying oneself to spiritual discipline, study, and community.
#+end_quote

He was a highly intelligent philosopher and scientist. He's not going to make the sort of silly mistakes Dawkins mentioned. He explained what he saw as rational reasons for believing in god, and then used his wager as a little push to help people overcome their own irrationality.

He wrote an entire book. People should actually read it before criticizing it. This is a big reason why I dislike Dawkins. He's great on evolution, but intellectually both very talkative and very lazy outside his field. Views on everything, but he does little research.

**** Overall Pascal did not actually address those things. His brisk and routine dismissal of, say, other religions and concepts of God as "obviously false" shows the exact weakness in his wager that Dawkins is referring to.

In other words, the fact that Pascal thought he his wager was correct because Christianity was correct, or that he considered the criticism itself "weak" because he believed anyone who studies it would be convinced by it, both established on demonstrably faulty reasoning, does not negate the criticism that the wager presupposes the nonexistence of other Gods. If anything it confirms it as an obviously flawed bit of apologetics from an obviously biased man.

You take the most flattering possible interpretation of Dawkin's arguments while taking the least flattering interpretation of Pascal's.

Pascal's wager doesn't presuppose the non existence of other gods, it says that an in depth analysis would show them false, which is fairly normal for arguments, they say that if you look at the matter closely then you'll see they're right and have other writings on the matter. Dawkins certainly could have riffed off this point, perhaps with something like 'He looks at all those religions and sees falsehood and deception. I agree with that. I just add one more religion to my list.' Or something like that. But he didn't make any effort to do that as he didn't actually know what Pascal said. He targeted a weakness that the argument didn't actually have.

#+begin_quote

Here, you do the sort of thing Pascal does. You presuppose you're right based on other writings. This is a normal thing in arguments. You have to take a really uncharitable interpretation to see it as unusual. Almost everyone does it. "I know I'm right, do some more reading."

It's fairly normal for arguments, and it's hypocritical from someone whose own beliefs do not fit the standard he has set others to. Unless you are asserting that Pascal literally never met a non-Christian who he considered intelligent enough to have reasons for their disbelief? I suppose he might not have been intellectually dishonest, just very isolated or bigoted.

No, this is false equivocation of the worst sort. I don't take for granted that I'm right in the same way that he does: he used what amount to literal double standards and hypocrisy to assert his own religion's truth and dismiss others'. That is intellectual dishonesty and bias that is very transparent to those who recognize it and have lived that particular double-think.

I used to be religious. I studied every religion when I started doubting mine. I don't base my dismissal of religions I disagree with on standards that my own beliefs can't meet, as Pascal does. If you can point to some hypocrisy or double standard my beliefs have, by all means attempt to do so, but the idea that Pascal's blatant bias for what he took for granted as true should be excused among rational people is ridiculous.

******* To be more precise...

Your or his studying of religion, I don't actually know much about them. I don't actually know much about why you're atheistic or agnostic or whatever you are. You haven't really explained much. Likewise with Pascal, he doesn't talk much about it in that particular segment.

What you learnt from your research is what I'd use to evaluate any conclusions either of you drew. You both have turns of phrases indicating your correctness and not much substance.

I don't know the actual quality of your research. You didn't study every religion for a start, many of them are regional and you wouldn't be able to find much online. You studied some subsection of them, likely major ones that were popularly available. So I know you're exaggerating about your studying.

I don't know how good you are at researching. Did you actually read the religious texts of the varying religions? Did you consult scholars? Did you consult scholarly texts? Did you try to get a balanced perspective? Did you check archaeology to see how well their claims were substantiated?

I don't know how good your reasoning is. Do you adhere to [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/axn/6_tips_for_productive_arguments/]] basic argument etiquette? From what I remember of you from CMV you mostly don't.

Here where you try to convince people that we should transplant an inflammatory phrase to another unrelated situation, another wordplay heavy argument.

I'm not really convinced from what little I know that your reason and evidence is so strong I should trust you just based off your word. You seem to focus more off trapping someone in some wordplay argument than focusing on the facts and the evidence. So your statement that whatever research you did was better than Pascal's doesn't feel convincing to me, as you haven't proven you have done any good research or given me evidence of such.

Good evidence and facts are what matters, and as is normal for a casual conversation neither you nor Pascal drew that many in.

I want to make this clear incase you lack the self awareness that what you did is engage in ad hominem, perhaps the lowest form of argument available.

I won't return the favor, because despite your accusations and misrepresentation of me, I try to hold myself to a higher standard than that. I just want you to know incase you have the self awareness and humility to recognize that if you're losing an argument, going into a person's past and finding other things about them to discredit their words does not meet, as you referenced, basic argument ediquette, and perhaps will apologize.

I studied every religion and many of the subsects available through online research and two classes in aboriginal theology. When I said "every religion" I assumed it would be taken for granted that I didn't mean every single religion and spiritual belief throughout history and across the planet, but rather the major ones that are most commonly referred to and discussed.

Same as above. Many of the claims were obviously not falsifiable, but of the major religions that have huge incentives to discover evidence of their religious beliefs' history and accuracy, such as the expeditions to uncover evidence of the Jewish Exodus from Egypt, or Noah's Flood, there has been none found.

From what I remember of you, you did not post in any of the CMVs you linked to, though I could be wrong: you never engaged in argument with me directly, simply responding to reports based on people who ran the gamut of offensive and insulting, so I'm happy to correct whatever false light that might have cast me in.

Yes, as that was the entire point of the mostly tongue-and-cheek CMV.

Let me correct you there: Here I ask for evidence that a group I find annoying is actually not worth my disregard and worth respecting, based on clearly set standards and very specific evidence that failed to materialize. I then moved the goal posts very deliberately toward my opponents to make their job easier, and they still failed to land a single one, instead resorting to ad hominem, special pleading, and as is usual with many MRA advocates, shifting all the blame to feminism despite me pointing out in the original post why I would not find such arguments convincing.

No, I stated that Pascal's perspective on one religion being evidently more true to the person who tries to believe it has very obvious double standards in his approach to religious superiority that my perspective on a specific religion as /not/ clearly truer than any others does not have.

#+begin_quote
  On the combativeness- if you want I feel no real need to challenge you on hypocrisy and double standards, just, you said to do so. You challenging me to prove your beliefs have two negative characteristics is inevitably going to lead to issues and I am not sure why you did it if you didn't want this sort of thing.
#+end_quote

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt here and assume you really think this was an appropriate response to what I said, as it might have been unclear:

I asked you to feel free to point out double standards or hypocrisy in my religious beliefs, or rather lack of them, as we were specifically talking about religion. I thought this was obvious in the context of the discussion.

If you extend that to mean "find any hypocritical or double standard belief I have anywhere," then that's basically the textbook definition of ad hominem, because you are then using my potential wrongness in one area to extend to my wrongness in another. All of which is besides the fact that you didn't actually find any hypocrisy or double standard: just posts that you characterized as "pointless semantics" or "wordplay."

Sorry if I wasn't clear or gave any offense.

*********** The length of this is causing me to stop caring enough to respond.

My short responses.

- You made a claim about doing religious research that showed that your standards were better than whatever research Pascal did. CMV is a common research place, and how you go about it shows your general approach to learning things and changing your view on topics. Any double standards of Pascal or you depend on the skill of your research.

- What you left out was the actual names of the religions you studied or any hint of what you looked for. Some argument like "I have studied Christianity, catholicism, protestantism, islam, sunni and shiite, many varieties of hinduism, buddhism, aboriginal beliefs and all of them showed a lack of any convincing miracles" is the sort of actual research that would show some a clear definable standard. That was what was left out, some of the actual names or details of the argument.

- On definitions, we'll have to agree to disagree since I can't actually see you do any definitions of prejudice in the opening post, and your first post is arguing about the definition of prejudice.

- Saying a group of people are bad in some way is a common trolly action. Regardless of your intentions many trolls use that tactic because it predictably results in negative emotions. If you use that tactic you'll get the same result.

The entire point of the subreddit is to have your view changed on something. There is no way to assert that you want a negative view of a group of people to be made positive without making it obvious that you don't have a positive view of them. To say this is a "trolly action" or it's a "tactic" is pretty disingenuous: it would classify everything from "I find the WBC to be evil, CMV" to "Palestinians don't deserve their own state, CMV" to be "troll tactics," even though they are simply stating their opinion in a forum for opinion changing. Actual, specific troll tactics and actions include, but are not limited to, ignoring opposing arguments to repeat their points, deliberately insulting personal attacks, and sweeping generalization that are not treated as negatives or asserted as absolute facts.

  I used to be religious. I studied every religion when I started doubting mine. I don't base my dismissal of religions I disagree with on standards that my own beliefs can't meet, as Pascal does.

You could easily have just said "CMV, MRAs have no major accomplishments or feats." which would have been factual and non emotional.

"CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they're annoying and I don't respect them." is a rather bad post that I would suspect was trolling.

"CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they have no legal right to it" is better, though deserve is a complex term whose meaning should be unpacked.

The standards of belief are completely independent from the research: I just mentioned the fact that I started religious and had researched other religions to say that it I'm not judging his double standard from the perspective of someone who never believed.

Then your ignorance is what needs correcting: google a list of the most populated religions and you'll get much more than just Christianity (including Catholicism) and Islam and Judaism. I also studied Hinduism (mostly Vaishnavism and Shaivism) and Buddhism (Zen, Theravada and Mahayana) as well as Zoroastrianism and Jainism and others.

But again, all of this is beside the point and ultimately doesn't matter: there is no tipping point where I can list enough religions I'm familiar with and you'd go "Oh, okay then, well you're definitely more knowledgeable about religion than Pascal was, so your criticism of him is fine." *Nor should you*, because it just *doesn't matter.* My criticism stands on its own whether it's made by me or anyone else. The only reason we're discussing this at all is that you made a false equivocation that forced me to bring up my own beliefs, and then presented a semantic error as me exaggerating my claims to undermine the arguments. The entire concept of one's level of religious research doesn't tie in any way to my criticism of Pascal's biased and hypocritical beliefs, unless the defense of him is literally that he simply was unaware of other religions in depth enough to be judged for his irrationality.

Maybe your emotions and opinions on things are based solely on such arbitrary factors, but without speaking for others, I can and have had my opinions on things changed by argumentation before, and see no reason why CMV wouldn't be fit for that. Of course I'm free to feel what I want, I'm also free to think what I want, but I want what I think and what I feel to be as based on logic and evidence as possible, which is why I ask people who disagree with me to explain why.

#+begin_quote

You're right, I could have put it that way, and it probably would have gotten slightly less inundated with irate and toxic responses. Maybe one out of every ten posts that took it as a personal attack on their beliefs wouldn't have done so. But that wasn't the thing I wanted my mind changed on: I wanted my mind changed on the *potential unfairness of my negative judgement.* Just asking for the accomplishments excludes the possibility that other arguments I had not thought of or could not predict might surface that would change the root problem I was there to have solved.

Similarly, this:

#+begin_quote
  "CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they're annoying and I don't respect them." is a rather bad post that I would suspect was trolling.
#+end_quote

Very much sounds like trolling, yeah, because you've constructed a strawman. But "CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they support terrorism" is far less obvious whether it's a troll. It's inflammatory either way. And as for these two:

#+begin_quote
  "CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they have no legal right to it" is better, though deserve is a complex term whose meaning should be unpacked.

  "CMV, Israels shouldn't feel guilty about not giving Palestinians a state because Palestinians have no legal right to it" is even better.
#+end_quote

Now you've changed the entire belief that the person has completely in order to make it less offensive. But that doesn't change the fact that people have negative opinions of Palestinians for reasons other than these, and that those people can and should be able to bring such feelings up and ask for them to be changed if they recognize they might be unfair and genuinely want other perspectives.

You're pigeonholing everyone into either looking for factual arguments that they could essentially debate elsewhere, like AskHistorians, or being a troll who asks emotional questions that you seem to believe can't be handled by logical argument or intellectual discourse. I'm happy to say that such restrictions don't actually exist on the complexity of the mind.

Anyway, since I still don't really know what you researched much, beyond a few names, and I'm not really sure what you were saying back then anymore or why Pascal was supposedly hypocritical or had double standards this is getting rather pointless.

Just as I am sure the many posters who post "CMV: Black people are stupid" want their mind changed on the potential unfairness of their negative judgement.

People get annoyed when you have a statement that makes a vague hateful comment towards a group they're a member of. It's a prejudice, a prejudgement about a group, where you're judging an entire group by the actions of the few you know about. It is a predictable end result that doing this to a major group will result in bad debates. You can make some justification but the predictable end result is flame wars and bad debates. If you cared about other's feelings and wanted to change your irrationally rude feelings you'd probably do so in a polite non in your face manner like "CMV, I have irrationally rude feelings about MRA." People should be polite to others and avoid antagonizing them for minimal reason.

If you mention a particular criteria of the group that you disagree on that lessens it. People are happy to prove a statement like "Palestinians are terrorists" wrong. You can't prove an emotion wrong.

In a world where he did that research or a world where he didn't, the final results are irrelevant because he still asserted demonstrably untrue things that he apparently took as truth, such as that people who accept the logic of his wager but can't force themselves to believe should just study and immerse themselves in Christianity, or even any religion, and its truth will reveal itself to them. If he was simply ignorant then he was ignorant, and if he was not then this was evidence of a clear bias and irrationality in him.

Which is fine. No one's perfect. He made a mistake. I'm not sure if you just hate Dawkins so much that you decided to plant your flag on Pascal and defend it to the bitter end, but even if you genuinely admire and agree with the man on many things, as he was fairly brilliant in many ways, it's okay to admit that he made mistakes, even if they're not the same mistakes Dawkins charged him with.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

For the seventh time at least, he was hypocritical because he dismissed other religions who could say the same of theirs, and had a double standard because he made the assertion that one could immerse themselves in Christianity and its truth would be revealed. This is /only/ excusable by someone who styles themself an intellectual or rationalist if the person saying it is /fundamentally ignorant/ of other religions or the views of other religious believers. People who say it in today's age are no less hypocritical or ignorant, and Pascal shares their burden. To speak with such supposed authority on theology and rational skepticism, and yet hold forth such conclusions, is the mark of a seriously biased or fundamentally ignorant mind.

The former of which is potentially understandable if you want to go into issues of his near brush with death, "religious vision," and subsequent conversion. But those things do not make his words less wrong or his wager less flawed.

Please don't try and play the victim now, we were doing so well.

I didn't note what makes the two traits indistinguishable, I described the bedrock that links both, and in fact mentioned the distinguishing variable.

You can argue this issue on your own if you want, I won't indulge you in whatever point you think you're proving by dredging up a post from almost a year ago and criticizing it for not meeting your standards for debate or research. Here, another concession for you: you're absolutely right. It was a poorly worded post. Mea culpa.

Now what? You declare victory and sweep the board clean? I'm afraid not. You're so far afield in this criticism that I honestly don't know what you think you're accomplishing: I don't care in the least what you think of my "research skills" or ability to semantically define arguments. If you can't counter my arguments, you can talk till you're blue in the face about how poorly I worded my definition of prejudice in a tongue in cheek post 8 months ago, and my arguments about Pascal will still stand, and yours will still fail. Give it up.

That's why it's a fine line, really: "CMV: Palestinians don't deserve their own state because they support terrorists," is more useful than "CMV, Palestinians don't deserve their own state," but asking someone to admit "CMV: I have potentially irrational views on Palestinians deserving their own state" presupposes that they have reason to believe it's irrational. Emotions are not always irrational, even if the beliefs they're based on are incorrect.

********* My point was that Pascal didn't believe better safe than sorry in the way OP noted, he believed in various arguments of reason and evidence that eliminate other options first. In particular.

"What say [the unbelievers] then? "Do we not see," say they, "that the brutes live and die like men, and Turks like Christians? They have their ceremonies, their prophets, their doctors, their saints, their monks, like us," etc. If you care but little to know the truth, that is enough to leave you in repose. *But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail.* That would be sufficient for a question in philosophy; but not here, where everything is at stake. And yet, after a superficial reflection of this kind, we go to amuse ourselves, etc. Let us inquire of this same religion whether it does not give a reason for this obscurity; perhaps it will teach it to us."

You may well draw a different conclusion from Pascal if you examine the options due to different reasoning and evidence, but he did advise those who truly cared about the issue to study it further.

I think the father of this argument arguing that you should study the issue more lends some weight to it being a foolhardy decision to believe in whatever just because of the bet. The learned philosopher didn't, why should you?

Edit. Also, his argument was something like "If through whatever methods you've reduced the existence or non existence of the Christian god to a coin flip chance, go with whichever one makes you happier." I can see some flaws in that sort of reasoning- it's probably not going to be a coin flip, if you throw your weight behind one option you'll be invested and therefore biased on other things, you should probably just instead have a probabilistic belief- but it's not a wholey bad reasoning of what to do. Most atheists aren't going to have coinflip probabilities in their beliefs so it won't apply to them, with lots of beliefs going with whatever makes you happier is fine. It's a belief I hold for shipping for example, shipping characters together.

Once you've spent enough time learning about Christianity and arguing against apologetics, for religion in general as well, you'll start to pick up the thread of their arguments and predict what they'll be. While it's technically possible that in all the years I've spent being religious, studying religions, and arguing with the religious that Pascal has some silver standard that invalidates other religins while upholding Christianity's truth, I find it very, very, very, very unlikely that I would not have encountered it by now, whether by other religious apologetics or by fellow non-believers.

So yes, it's technically possible that by reading every word the man wrote I might find such an argument, but my priors make it about as unlikely as there existing another continent on the planet earth that I've just never heard of or heard anyone else speak about.

Very personally, since he didn't say that. He said that, once you've convinced yourself rationally you can learn to believe by talking to people and such "But at least learn your inability to believe, since reason brings you to this, and yet you cannot believe." So how to deal once you rationally know Christianity is true but still don't believe. With other religions he didn't actually assume any conclusion. He just said " But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail."

He likely assumed that the result would be that people would come to believe but he didn't predict it.

  While it's technically possible that in all the years I've spent being religious, studying religions, and arguing with the religious that Pascal has some silver standard that invalidates other religins while upholding Christianity's truth, I find it very, very, very, very unlikely that I would not have encountered it by now, whether by other religious apologetics or by fellow non-believers.
#+end_quote

I was never really arguing for the truthfulness of pascal, more for the falseness of Dawkins and people not reading arguments. I'm interested in old literature and in various arguments.

And there are no sides, Pascal being right or wrong about something isn't actually evidence that he's right about something else.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not really sure what his standards were.
#+end_quote

The very thing you quoted and emphasized elsewhere showed it: that the study of the religion and immersion in it would make the truth of it reveal itself. This is something that every religion believes about itself.

#+begin_quote
  You seem to be taking this very personally, which is rather useless for me since I don't live inside your mind. Whatever random experiences you've had don't really mean much for people who have no idea what they are.
#+end_quote

I'm not actually taking this personally at all, and making the statement that I am is a rather underhanded form of ad hominem. Your other post which I just responded to did that enough please, let's keep this one straightforward: if you don't know what I mean and describe them as "random experiences," please ask me to elaborate and I will happily do so: I thought it was obvious within the context of the conversation, but was clearly mistaken, for which I apologize.

#+begin_quote
  Very personally, since he didn't say that. He said that, once you've convinced yourself rationally you can learn to believe by talking to people and such "But at least learn your inability to believe, since reason brings you to this, and yet you cannot believe." So how to deal once you rationally know Christianity is true but still don't believe.
#+end_quote

No, I'm sorry, you are literally ignoring the exact lines that contradict you that you yourself quoted: "Rather, in the passage following the establishment of the wager, Pascal addresses a hypothetical person who has already weighed the *rationality of believing in God through the wager* and is convinced by it, but *remains unable to sincerely believe.*"

That is not dealing with rationally knowing Christianity is true but don't believe, at all. It is dealing with rationally knowing the *wager* is the *safe bet,* but being unable to believe. Those are two very, very different things.

#+begin_quote
  With other religions he didn't actually assume any conclusion. He just said " But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail."
#+end_quote

The context of this was very specifically referring to the difference between Christianity and other religions, as you yourself quoted, again:

#+begin_quote
  "Do we not see," say they, "that the brutes live and die like men, and Turks like Christians? They have their ceremonies, their prophets, their doctors, their saints, their monks, like us," etc. If you care but little to know the truth, that is enough to leave you in repose. But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail. That would be sufficient for a question in philosophy; but not here, where everything is at stake. And yet, after a superficial reflection of this kind, we go to amuse ourselves, etc. Let us inquire of this same religion whether it does not give a reason for this obscurity; perhaps it will teach it to us."
#+end_quote

This is a very clear remonstration against the idea of judging Christianity as like other religions because of superficial similarities, and is calling it a mistake, and asking people to dig deeper. Which is commendable, but still reflection of an obvious bias, and assumes that anyone who has done such deeper reading wouldn't still disagree with his assessment.

#+begin_quote
  He likely assumed that the result would be that people would come to believe but he didn't predict it.
#+end_quote

Please do not accuse me of playing semantic wordgames when you throw yourself into it so enthusiastically.

#+begin_quote
  This isn't really convincing me of your rationality in choosing religion, especially since you're making up a quote for Pascal. You're not distinguishing between reality and things you just made up seconds ago.
#+end_quote

Says the person who literally misunderstood or ignored parts of their own quote? You've become wholly insulting and combative in this post, and I've tried very hard not to take it personally, as you say, but telling me I'm "not distinguishing between reality and things you made up seconds ago" is incredibly inflammatory and not worthy of a CMV mod.

#+begin_quote
  It does read like you're doing that, you're not actually reading what people say, you're using some sort of prediction matrix in your mind to predict their views.
#+end_quote

A prediction matrix based on previous data from what other religious apologetic have said and the responses.

#+begin_quote
  Someone in the past who was religious seemed to think x and said y to me therefore pascal who is religious must believe x and y.
#+end_quote

Incorrect; "Millions of people have put their minds toward arguing their religious beliefs, and the arguments have been distilled and debated over the generations until the best and most intractable have emerged, therefor Pascal probably uses arguments I've heard before in other forms despite not knowing that he specifically might have said or agreed with."

****** [[/u/Nepene]], I respect your position in taking all evidence into account before arriving at an appropriate decision.

Here's two phrases you may adopt to help us think similarly in this matter. (keep in mind that I'm simply doing a word replacement from HPMOR.)

#+begin_quote
  Litany of Tarski. It changes every time you use it. On this occasion it runs like so: If Pascal's version of God exists, I want to believe in God. If Pascal's version of God does not exist, I want not to believe in this God. Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.

  If we're living in a world where God exists, that's what we have to believe, we have to know what's coming, so we can go to Heaven, or in the very worst case, be prepared to do what we can in the time we have left. Not believing it won't stop it from happening. So the only question we have to ask is whether God exists, and if that's the world we live in then that's what we want to believe.

  Litany of Gendlin: What's true is already so, owning up to it doesn't make it worse.
#+end_quote

Okay. Now, change the Litany of Tarski to Yahweh. Okay. Now change the Litany of Tarski to Buddha. Okay. Now change the Litany of Tarki to Zeus/Jupiter and the (Greek/Roman) pantheon.

After doing this for all religions, you will be on the first step toward critiquing them based on their merits and relinquishing the beliefs you have that do not fit your version of reality (using an Interpretivist Paradigm.)

Now, regarding Pascal's wager: if I died and met The maker/creator/ruler/recorder/judge/etc. of What is True, it would feel like the scene of "the Mummy" if I approached this being with a lot of religious symbols around my neck, showing it each one until I found the one that 'worked' to prevent my damnation. Keep in mind, in this scene, the character shows Imhotep the Star of David and he is mistaken for a member of the servile slave race (the Jews) and is stopped on completely different principles rather than the intent of brandishing a holy symbol of faith with enough religious zeal,that it turns the undead.

Similarly, my personal feelings on the merit of an argument of something like Pascal's wager is that, if the Litany of Tarski v1.0 were True, it doesn't necessarily mean that my faith is required to fulfill the requirements of entrance into heaven and/or exemption from hell.

Perhaps my personal quest of seeking virtue as an ethical member of society and decreasing the morbidity and mortality of our community will be the mark that is needed to be deemed deserving.

  If we're living in a world where Pascal wager is good, that's what we have to believe, we have to know what's coming, so we can choose what book to read next, or in the very worst case, choose what audiobook to listen to.

** The answer to your question is mu.

The argument you are referencing supposes a great deal many things for which there is no evidence, or even contradictory evidence. To single this idea out in conceptspace is privileging the hypothesis on an absurd level. One must discount an outcome by its probability, and by any reasonable standard, the probabilities in question are so small as to not warrant consideration. The only reason this idea has been thought, and why it is consuming your attention rather than some other harmful meme, is due to the particular defects of the system which generates the idea.

Even if that were not so, one must realise the sheer magnitude of competing, mutually exclusive possibilities (and I am reluctant to use the word "possibilities" here, as it presupposes these sorts of ideas are coherent). For every benevolent god who would grant you eternal bliss conditional your belief, there is a malevolent god -- identical in all respects, but who would reverse the outcomes; belief gets you eternal damnation, whereas disbelief gets you admittence to heaven. Even presupposing the possibility of existence for such beings and the validity of such scenarios, there is no optimal criteria for decision.

Do not worry overmuch; modern reductionism has done all the work for us. You can be about as certain in the falsity of supernatural claims as it is possible to be.

** One could imagine an infinite amount of gods, each with their own rules for reward/punishment. Maybe god punishes you for unjustified beliefs, and accepting Pascal's wager actually sends you to hell forever.

The math doesn't support Pascal's wager once you consider more possibilities. Some Christians think that unbelief results in endless time spent in pain and misery. Well, suppose Religion X threatens a fractal super-hell, where every uncountably divisible moment of time produces a new timeline with a new, recursive fractal hell contained within it. Religion X's hell is not only worse than Christian hell, it is infinitely worse, in a higher order of infinity.

So, gambling with expectation values doesn't work, unless you think you can assign a zero probability to every imaginable high-consequence religion besides those that are currently popular. Pascal evidently thought you could, but that seems presumptuous to me. It would reduce the wager to, "If you already think Religion Y is your best shot, you should go with it," which isn't saying much.

Why should you respect a being who holds Himself back and refuses to interact in the common, causal fashion of two living beings, Who instead sits "outside" the universe of cause and effect, and demands that you pervert your thought processes away from what is useful /in all other circumstances/ just for /His/ sake? Why should you cripple yourself for the sake of Someone who won't reach out His hand to help you as a few people /claim/ He did for a group of a million Jewish slaves -- a deed for which He, /of course/, left no evidence!

What an ego this God of yours has!

Sure, you can go the "philosopher of religion" route, and start whittling down your God to be unable to do much anything other than provide a philosophical foundation. That /does/ get you away from the nasty old issue of evidence. Then, however, you've got a philosophical foundation based on nothing you can think about, talk to, or handle in any way -- a God every bit as impersonal and uncaring as the atheist's empty space, but with more philosophy-of-religion books. What good is that?

Besides which, His eternity is cheap and shabby. You wouldn't like it very much.

** There's not much point in discussing Pascal's wager unless you're /already/ a believer. A quick look at the argument reveals that it's not really about whether you should believe. It just lays out the possible consequences of particular beliefs. But that does sod-all for changing anyone's mind. People can't really choose what they believe -- various pieces go into your brain, it does its thing, and then you're either convinced or not. You have some control over it, but by and large belief is sorta involuntary, and certainly not as simple as deciding to believe in god one fine day.

Telling an atheist about Pascal's wager is a waste of time -- if they didn't believe in god earlier, they won't believe in god after the argument. If they accept it, the most they'll do is go through the motions of believing in god, something that any omniscient being will immediately see through. So what use is Pascal's wager anyway?

It's for religious people to tell other religious people.

There's an important unspoken filter you must run all religious arguments through -- namely, who is the audience? With a handful of exceptions, all religious arguments are directed by believers at fellow believers. They're preaching to the choir, because it's a community ritual that everyone gains from. The person who makes the argument seems pious and knowledgeable about their religion, and the people listening affirm their religiosity by nodding and agreeing. They can also get bonus brownie points by quibbling over tiny details while still agreeing overall. Everybody wins.

It's not even an uncommon pattern. As far as I can tell it's just some sort of naturally occurring ingroup dynamic where people almost ritually say certain things they all agree with. Reddit knows this pattern well. I believe the technical term is 'circlejerk'. :P

For such things, I always try to remember that humans beings are deeply political creatures, but they're not quite consciously aware of this. Politics is basically the art of advancing a personal agenda under the guise of a public one. You make things look a certain way (because that form is socially acceptable) even though it is something quite different. But such trickery goes /really/ deep into our brains, to the point that we think we're making a rational argument, even though we're really just setting up a circlejerk. You think your allegiance is to truth and reason, but your brain is more interested in advancing the cause of social cohesion and scoring you tribal brownie points.

*Tl;dr:* Pascal's wager is fine if you're a religious person who wants to reaffirm their belief or strengthen a religious community's social bonds. If you're an atheist, it's a complete waste of your time. Unless you're pretending to be religious or starting a cult or something.

** Speaking as an actual Christian - yes, we exist on [[/r/rational]] - we /don't/ believe that Christianity is a "free ticket to heaven".

There are a few ways of wording this, and it comes at different strengths, but pretty much everyone agrees that you have to lead a good life to count - as, obviously, anyone who actually believed Jesus was the Son of God /would/ rationally do. Quite a lot of people also agree that, if you're good regardless, you'll still get in.

So why believe at all? Well, firstly, 'cos it's true. But more in line with the OP, Christianity has had a bunch of thought put into ways to /be more virtuous/ - which, obviously, is useful for fulfilling human values as long as you believe human values exist, regardless of their origin. (For example, the Catholic Church was very good at predicting slavery would ... not be looked on kindly by anyone outside that particular cluster****.)

Oh, and I'm planning to live a lot more than 150 years, obviously ;) And then I'm gonna do it again, God willing.

Anyway - this comment is a little rambling, but I get the impression most religions consider roughly-similar codes of ethical behavior to be necessary, if not sufficient, for salvation. Believing helps with that, but I wouldn't consider it necessary.

Could you explain this please? The Catholic Church has been behind some major, egregiously harmful movements, behaviors and beliefs, not the least of which currently is the teaching that contraception is so sinful that not even people living in a country with epidemic HIV/AIDS should use it.

They waver pretty heavily on that, actually. But yeah.

The contraception thing ... well, I don't agree with the metaethical justification behind it, but I can't deny that their predictions regarding the effects it was going to have on society seem to have panned out.

Other than that, it's hard to think of other examples. Probably the Inquisition, although that's substantially misrepresented in popular culture. Maybe the crusades. But both of those are heavily characterized by the Church being influenced by society/politics around it, rather than the other way around.

And ... I'm sorry, but secular-humanist ethical thought seems exceptionally prone to taking a massive simplification of ethics and running with it so far that millions of people die. I'm a humanist myself (albeit not particularly secular), but there's nothing there with a track record anywhere near that of any major religion.

Oh, that. Well yeah, that's not really a prediction so much as a recognition of human nature, not to mention history. They're the ones that, by and large, made up these rules and imposed them on society (not often through force, but definitely a type of soft coercion/manipulation). Of course once those rules stop being seen as sacrosanct people revert back to how they acted before.

By predictions I thought you meant the ones that matter to those who don't already share their religious values, such as that society would descend into loveless anarchy and abandoned children would litter the streets. I'm being hyperbolic, but not terribly so: the idea that contraception is actually /harmful/ to people, that it reduces their standard of living, increases pain, reduces pleasure, reduces safety, increases dysfunction... none of THOSE predictions panned out, and in fact we can see many of the opposite occur.

No, just a bit of absurdity to counter the idea that the Church is a better ethicist than "your local atheist," as if comparing an individual's ethics to an organization's codified rules makes any sense.

** From the wikipedia article on pascal's wager.

#+begin_quote
  However, as noted above, nowhere in the establishment of the wager does Pascal appeal to feigned belief; God, being omniscient, would not succumb to such trickery and unwittingly reward the disingenuous. Rather, in the passage following the establishment of the wager, Pascal addresses a hypothetical person who has already weighed the rationality of believing in God through the wager and is convinced by it, but remains unable to sincerely believe. Again, as noted above, Pascal offers this person a way to escape the irrational sentiment that compels him to withhold belief in God after the validity of the wager has been rationally conceded. This way consists of applying oneself to spiritual discipline, study, and community.
#+end_quote

If you rationally believe that god doesn't exist then you have minimal reason for accepting the wager, and Pascal would agree with that. Pascal first sought to disprove other religions and prove his own religion. This argument was just the final capping stone to his ideas.
