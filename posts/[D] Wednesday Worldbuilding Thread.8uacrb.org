Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** What are some political systems that are /only/ possible in the realm of speculative fiction? Some examples:

- Rule by a supreme diety
- Rule by a hivemind
- Rule by a representative who exists as the coherent extrapolated volition of the citizens
- Rule of the living by the dead
- Rule through chained geas
- Rule of the past by the future

Ultimately, some of these will devolve down to simple autocracy, democracy, or some other real-world system with some extra steps, I'm just thinking in terms of getting weird with how a society is governed.

*** Damn it, I keep thinking about different political systems you could write around magic rules, and then I go "No, wait, he already wrote a story about that."

In general, I'd go for exotic means of communications between citizens:

- Some people have mind-reading powers.

- People can communicate telepathically when they sleep.

- The government can rewrite people's memories, but not their beliefs.

More exotic ideas:

- Having political power makes you more charismatic and convincing (though not necessarily well-liked). Large kingdoms have a tendency to collapse because extremely powerful monarch are so convincing that their advisors are literally unable to disagree with them even when they have terrible ideas.

- The people are lead by a democracy, but in dire circumstances, they turn to dictatorship. The dictator wears the hat equivalent of the Heavenly Sword: a crown that gives them mind-related power (telepathy, telekinesis, enhanced learning), but they can't take it off and it kills them after a while.

- The people worship separate deities with conflicting ideologies, with a priest caste making most earthly decisions. The deities are well-meaning, but shortsighted and impulsive. The wisest of them are the ones who learned how to find competent, trustworthy high priests to compensate for their own shortcomings. The job of a high priest is to curb your god's excesses and counter-productive impulses (eg "I know You were gravely slighted, but we /really/ shouldn't go to war with this other country right now") while still convincing them that you're trying to serve them and advance their ideology.

*** Having some weird form of fate might make any form of political decisions meaningless.

People just wait and see what's coming, going with the flow of history. Leaders are unnecessary as any conflict already has a predefined winner, and any civilizational development will happen regardless of what the humans plan for.

I guess this is similar to having a supreme deity, but more obscure.

*** "Only possible" in a physical sense? There are probably also many ideas one could come up with that are unrealistic due to e.g. human nature. I guess Communism or some idealized bastardization of it or something would be an example, though we can come up with more far-fetched ideas. Rule by cultural mythical figures ("we all know what Robin Hood would do in this situation.")?

e: Maybe it would be useful to categorize these ideas into groups that are approximately isomorphic within each group?

I wrote a story where that happened! On the other hand, the mob only forced the folk hero into office to keep any actually-living politician from getting the office, and things pretty quickly devolved into anarchy for a few months till some foreign political activists came and reestablished government.

*** In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Clover][Black Clover]] almost every human has magical abilities. The supreme ruler is the 'Wizard King', the person with the most magical might. He commands squads of knights, which are magicians of greater-than-average magical power. Who actually gets to be Wizard King would probably depend on politics more than pure skill. Also, the knights are mostly royal families with tryouts to occasionally recruit the worthy from the common folk. (Warning: the anime isn't about politics.)

What about a system where disagreements are settled by non-fatal duels, where the loser faces a magical compulsion? (I'm thinking something similar to the spellcard system in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project][Touhou]]) That would be a kind of chained geas, I suppose. The basic idea is just that if you want something, you fight--and if you want it badly enough to win many contests of will, people will help you obtain it after losing to you. The most willful becomes the ruler.

That's a cool idea, but it's hard to explore if you want to go deeper than "And then the king forces everyone to lose duels to him and he enslaves everybody".

That's true, if the compulsions are permanent and free to maintain. Suppose instead that a compulsion wears off as a function of how unnatural it is to the person being compelled. Further suppose that inflicting a compulsion isn't free--it costs willpower, say, or maybe just mana.

The king's challenge is finding and keeping minions that are aligned to his goals with the minimum expenditure of will, and using half of his subjects to keep the other half in line. A king that is better liked--that is, whose goals align better with his minions--will be able to make his willpower go further. That doesn't mean the King won't enslave everyone. In that case, resistances can form of people pretending to be compelled (when in actuality their compulsions have worn off) and a group of rebels can stage a 'duel coup' to wear down the king.

Also, one can imagine a parliament where any individual member seeking too much power can be slapped down by the others. If your will isn't enough to overwhelm everyone else in the parliament, maybe it could be stable.

** People start being born with their 'souls' outside their bodies. They manifest as animals, mostly mammalian or avian, and their appearance dictates how moral you are. If you're capital-g Good, your 'soul' is blue or white, and tends to be an animal more associated with Goodness (dogs, birds of prey, stags, etc). If you're capital-e Evil, your 'soul' is black or red, and has some obvious physical corruption, like fissures in their skin, or cancerous growths. Assume the moral system is just 'whatever's commonly agreed upon,' the basic societal standards.

What are the world-level ramifications of this? I've already considered some- politicians with Good 'souls' win out over Evil 'souls' almost every time, and jurors in court cases have to be blindfolded to enforce impartiality. Your thoughts?

*** I'm picturing something a little His Dark Materials-esque. For the results of the whole animal thing, I suppose look there. The other aspect is then just the capacity to see straight away exactly how good a person is, along with all the ramifications of such a thing being determinable from birth. Politics, business, parenting, law, relationships of all kinds really now are sorta dominated by those with the pure souls who people trust.

I suppose eventually you'd end up with whole circles of people who are just all evil who can only really find any sort of business or community with their evil brethren. This, naturally, is fundamentally unstable. Presumably, eventually, these would be isolated from the goody-goods, because no one really wants these people in society.

*** I think the setting is inherently flawed because the 'Good' and 'Evil',cannot be defined for the whole of humanity. If you select a certain moral framework, that might be something that many people ascribe to but not everyone. Different societies and cultures have different moral frameworks even more so in different time periods and different circumstances. Murder is seen as morally evil, but killing in war?, death penalty?, self defence?. What about lying, lying for a good cause, lying for fun or playing a joke?

And an important factor that you're not considering is that 99% of people are not morally evil. They do something evil due to circumstances. Everyone is not 'Evil' 24/7, even if they are evil a lot, they can't be evil always. What if someone changes? What if someone you believe is evil, doesn't think what they're doing is evil?

Good and Evil is the most irrational thing ever.

*** There are a couple serious conceptual problems with absolute morality being embedded in a world like that, but most important is the question what process decides what it means to be capital-g Good? Is it a kind of average of what everyone on earth believes or is it some kind of fundamental set of ethics independent of what anyone believes?

In the former case, you run into problems with people that are ahead their times with regards to various ethical issues. In the latter case you have to think about what happens if societies view on ethics clashes with the morality that is embedded in nature.

Also, the same thing applies here that applies to HPMOR phoenixes, there are a lot of people with a vested interest in having nobody believe that soul-animal colour coincides with actual goodness, so (depending on how successful those people are) it might not be considered something you should even take into account when judging someone.
