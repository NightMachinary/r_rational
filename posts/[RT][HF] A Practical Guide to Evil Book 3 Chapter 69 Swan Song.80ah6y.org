That's just one hypothesis by Black. He noticed that Bard's existence meant that the Gods Below had a comparable "F U Card" in their hand. He then wondered if they squandered it on Triumphant (who achieved nothing on the long term) or the Dead King (who's ultimately a contained threat).

One commenter on EE's website wondered if they had kept that ace in reserve and blew it on Catherine's existence. While improbable, it's not impossible considering that Cat had a couple moments that felt like divine providence. Most notably in Liesse the first time (Chider should have killed her) and the second time (a post-transition Heiress really shouldn't have lost to the Squire).

*** I think it was pretty much a win-win situation for bard though.

If the weapon stays, it's hero bait, just like black said. More heroes = more opportunities for bard to influence the narrative.

The weapon getting destroyed by Black means he's lost Malicia's trust and could end up with him either getting killed or going rogue or something else unpredictable, but in most cases his power and influence is reduced.

In terms of overall victory I feel like this is a lesser win for the bard, but in terms of crushing black it's certainly an overwhelming victory.

I am honesty not convinced this isn't the best strategy here? I mean, I'm biased, as I'm unironically rooting for the Principate, but higher taxes and less genocide seems like a good deal. And the whole ‘a fresh new principate' bit I feel is weak because the prinicipates are not a homogenous culture. If Callow can have separate cultures to the extent it did, despite decades (centuries?) of the unifying force of a common enemy, I think the principates of new Procer could maintain a lot of their identity.

**** I mean, this is assuming that Praes won't employ a "burn it all down" policy as soon as Callow breaks away. Praes still has Legions, Warlock and a whole host of potentially devastating rituals. In comparison, Callow has no real army, a lot of Cat's power base has strong ties to the Empire and it's occupied by enemy forces.

So in theory it might be the right move but in practice Praes would make a graveyard out of Callow before the crusade arrived. That wasn't stated in the text but I assume there is always an undercurrent of "or else" in any deals Cat makes with Malicia. They are the bad guys after all.

***** As I pointed out below, that's not so clear-cut. The Legions, as pointed out in-chapter, may not be so willing to take orders from The Tower, especially if Cat promises the High Lord's heads on a pike. Warlock is a big threat, but Augar, plus Cat's mobility, Hierophant, and Archer mean the threat is reduced somewhat. And rituals are the same deal.

This is, of course, dependant on good cooperation with Procer, but Cordelia seems reasonable enough. I'd love a Malicia/Amadeus relationship between Cordelia and Cat, for instance.

*** I think the biggest issue is the fact that doing so would cause callow to have a neigh unfixable war problem. As of now cat thinks she can at least keep callow relatively at peace given enough time but under the procer that would not be possible due to two things. First is that procer is always either in a civil war or on the verge of one which means that callow would almost certainly be drawn into more conflicts. Invasions by praes would also start up again which she really wants to avoid. Combine these with the fact that it has been said that it would take generations for callow to recover from procer invading and you get a future where callow is basically stuck in a hole as a poverty stricken nation unless something really unexpected happens.

Look at the map of Calernia. Everytime Procer takes arms against The Empire they undoubtedly came through the Red Vales and met the Empire on Callowan ground and the large majority of the casualties in that exchange were always Callowans, a population notorious for their grudges.

There is no way she or her people can accept Callow being ruled by the First Prince as a vassal state. So peaceful integration is not a viable solution because as you said yourself, the Principate is notorious for it's civil wars.

*** Even more than that; it's not as if Procer hasn't occupied Callow in the past. Once the crusade is over, it stops being about Good vs Evil, and then nothing prevents new heroes like the Lone Swordsmen from rising up and kicking Procer out. Malicia's only real objection was that there's no longer any nobles left, but that is a temporary state of affairs, especially considering that ruling Callow generally grants you a Name.

**** 1) Can it? Who does it have that can pull that out? The legions, as Cat pointed out, would probably side with her, at least enough of them that they can't burn everything down, a lot of Black loyalists are dead. Cat can probably stalemate Black, and the Woe can probably stalemate the Calamities, at least for long enough for the Princely legions to arrive. Warlock will be addressed in 4)

2) Assuming Cat goes semi-legitimate and works out a deal with Procer, those fantassins will be under very tight supervision. The Reforms will likely spread to the Principalities, and well, a lot of them will be dead anyway thanks to the crusade.

3) Now, Callow has, hypothetically, the might of the Principate behind it. Sure, now it's The Principalities of Summerholm, Liesse, and Daoine, or whatever they end up being called, and when the dead king attacks or the Chain of Hunger expands, hypothetically, the principate comes to its aid. Now, the Dread Empire will be another of the same.

4) Warlock. A fair point. His threat, however, is fairly mitigated. -a) He doesn't really care about the temporal conflict. Sure, he'll follow Black, but Hierophant is following Cat, so he'd be not so eager to break out the big stuff. -b) A lot of those doomsday protocols are too powerful, take too much setup, or are fairly obscure. And now that Cat's working with the light, she has access to a whole lot more counters. -c) Augar. Any attempt that Warlock has to come up with something big will be countered, as Augar will be on the lookout. And with Cat, Hierophant, and Archer, they can probably defuse these before they get out of hand.

Hell,if you get the thing that allows you to map all of the hells and Arcadia you could hide the bloody thing any place. Shit you could probably orchestrate a randomized rotation shift every 3 days or so. Heroes can't destroy it if they can't get to it.

Absolutely. Keep in mind what happened regarding the Still Water project previously. From chapter 47:

  “Everyone involved was killed and their souls bound to prevent necromancy. Uncle said if it ever got out we could do that there would be a Crusade mobilized within the month.”

Amadeus literally murdered and stole the souls of everyone who worked on the project so word of it could never get out. And then he found out Malicia was like "Nah, let's totally get news of AN EVEN WORSE PROJECT out in public. That'll be a deterrent!"

For 20 years Black has opposed even acknowledging any of the Dark Day Protocol projects. Malicia's known this, and went ahead with a plan to announce she has /two/ of them at her beck and call.

Ranger is an old monster allied to evil (Black) and the Dead King has existed since the early days of sorcery. To me this implies you have people like White Knight (assuming his pre-life visions are as broken as Ranger's aspects) or an Elminster or Gandalf (wandering age of wonders wizard who is more eldrich incarnation of magical good than human) out there. In that light Black's argument that Liesse isn't just hero bait, but bait for boring invincible +plumbers+ hero's who will break the empire seems as plain sense as Quirrell's do not provoke powerful and vicious opponents.

** Oof. I'm having a really tough time deciding which option was the smarter one here.

Keep the array: You gain a MAD deterrent that may frighten enough countries into pulling out of a Crusade. On the other hand, it may do the exact opposite - Good is sure to want to counter such an Evil device, which at the very least means Heroes rise from all over. If you're lucky, you can use the array as a beacon and slaughter them as they come. But Heaven is usually the lucky one, and Black's seen that the Calamities are starting to have trouble with Hero bands even before Good is boosting their power. And if Praes is /really/ unlucky, a Crusade might take place anyway if Good sends an angel to inspire it. And that's not even counting the issues at home; Daione would likely revolt (or at least pull out completely) as the souls of their Gestalt is taken over by Villains full time. And the rest of Callow isn't going to be super happy with Cat's actions; she's somewhat liked (and plenty feared) right now, but her siding with the Tower and endorsing the use of a superweapon built on the corpses of 100,000 Callowans and powered by millions of Deoraithe souls is probably enough to turn the country against her, even if it /did/ mean preventing a Crusade. At the very least the Order of the Broken Bells would likely desert.

Destroy the array: The obvious problem is that without a deterrent a Crusade is going to happen, almost for certain. Not due to ideological reasons ("We must fight to destroy this superweapon!") but for practical ones ("Lulz, let's invade because Praes has never been weaker"). The Crusade will be weaker without Good acting to counter the array, and Heroes will be fewer, but almost half the Legions are gone and Callow's already bleeding dry. Daione might still rebel or pull support entirely, depending on what happened when the array was destroyed. Callow will likely remain more pro-Cat, but they're still in no shape to fend off an invasion. The biggest reason I think this might be the worse option though is because /Bard seems to have wanted this to happen./ That's... not good. As a general rule of thumb, I think any time Bard's plan is working means it's bad news for our protagonist.

That said, it feels to me like the second option was the better one. Black's been influenced by Bard, sure, but Malicia's definitely been straying from their original plan. These kinds of superweapons were researched before by the Calamities and then sealed away because they knew they weren't worth the cost to even complete them. Malicia unilaterally decided to go back on that plan. The problem is that with Black now in rebellion (and Cat on Malicia's side), odds are that Praes is going to default back to old school villainy, which is how Malicia's been sliding for years. Black was the one pushing to destroy the narrative of Praes and Callow, while Malicia's been bogged down in politics. Without Black keeping her in check, I think she's going to go the way of most Dread Empresses... and Cat's willing to follow along, because she was only about breaking the narrative if it benefitted Callow and (erroneously, in my mind) thinks that following Malicia will do that best. Dang.

Edit: More random thinking... I wonder if Bard messed up here? She succeeded in breaking apart Black and Malicia, but in doing so she threw the traditional narrative out the window. Usually a Dread Empress gets a superweapon, Heroes get called, the Villain gets defeated, and the cycle resets. Now things continue on as they have been; a Crusade gets called, but it's more of a traditional conflict than a Named one. And Praes, even divided, still has an advantage in Names. A Crusade will be hard to repel, but it doesn't necessarily end with the Villains losing. The biggest issue is that after, Malicia gets to keep ruling (if she wins). She can still proceed with the Reforms and her and Black's original dream. That is, if she isn't backsliding like Black suspects. Still, I think Black acting as he did at least gives his vision a /chance/ of victory eventually, whereas Malicia's plan would eventually /guarantee/ defeat.

It's implied it was her idea in the first place. She has said multiple times that there is a reason trying to take over the continent with a superweapon failed, because it's written in Creation. Yes, it's realistic to think "maybe just this once" - but she's been consistent with the position for /40 years/ against all other hardship and even the last time Cat talked to her drove home making the empire futureproof and stable. Magic nuclear deterrent does not stability make.

Seriously. This feels completely out of character to her. "Taking over the continent with an army of invisible tigers will never work also here is our flying city that can open permanent hell portals powered by the nascent god made of ten thousand dead souls we stole".

I think you've connected two things that don't necessarily connect. A lot of people think that MAD is a bad doctrine IRL.

And whatever protections you might be able to place around existing MAD weapon systems - which, given the propensity of humans for mistakes, aren't great even in relatively stable places like the US: United_States_military_nuclear_incident_terminology - the story will conjure up heroes and villains that could repurpose it.

***** Not really MAD if you're opponent ts have no such weapon of their own.

That being said, I think that whole "Angel of Contrition" thing is the "good" opposite of the Hellgate Maker.

*** I saw it more as Malicia not wanting to throw away a potential tool. It's also, as Black said, a massive beacon for Heroes. As we saw at Marchford, knowing where your enemy will strike gives you a great advantage.

Keeping it is a bad idea, but Malicia's logic is sound enough to me.

*** I'm annoyed by it too, but I don't agree it's out of left field. Malicia and Black being on the outs because she keeps moving away from their original goal and closer to being like an old school villain has been a recurring theme in their interactions. Up until now Black has allowed it despite his reservations. Now she reveals that she planned to acquire a doomsday device, but not to use it, and for Black it was a bridge too far (especially since they had stopped research on these kinds of things before because they agreed even having them was too dangerous).

Granted, Black was manipulated by Bard to make this the pivot; but I don't think he was wrong. Malicia's way would almost certainly fall into the old school villain narrative of acquiring a super weapon and being taken down by Good. Giving into narrative to acquire power is not the way you break a narrative.

** Men I don't really like the black queen name, did bard just played back himself? Did the lost of the captain hurt him so bad that it moved to do such a mistake, or is black the only sane person of the 3? This story is so good I'll buy the books as soon as he start publishing.
