I am guessing author is trying to synchronise the moment when the two plot lines (Aranea's revelation v.s. Ultimate stand down) will blow up in Zorian's face, and the timelines ended up a bit more mismatched than originally intended.

I feel this way as well. In chapter 48 he decides to go to Cyoria because "he didn't need to set aside an entire restart to [attack aranea and learn to read memory packets]".

Uh yeah, he kind of does! Time is limited and every minute counts!

***** Yes. This is incredibly dumb on Zorian's part.

Stretching his timeline out into something linear, he has a deadline in 3 months, and some things he wants to get done in the next year.

Not only does he neglect the nearest deadline for a further one, but he does it in a way that may result in him "losing" weeks of time due to an early reset.

How many updates have we been putting off the memory packet for now?

****** Has it been confirmed that it works this way? I mean, if Zorian dies after one week, would the mind packet degrade by a full month anyway, or would it only degrade by that one week?

Does his soul get sent back immediately (and concurrently from the souls of Zach and Red Robe and any other potential time stragglers because of time shenanigans), or does it remain floating around somewhere for the entire duration of the restart, with the mind packet continuously degrading, for the entire month until the restart?

******* I agree with you that from what we know of soul/memory mechanics it seems somewhat unlikely that the packet would decay while dead, and highly unlikely that it would decay further by "switching" a reset (which is Zorian's preferred response to a bad situation). Recall that Memory of Sublime Glories gave the initial time limit as 3 months, which has nothing to do with number of restarts.

Indeed, if there are a limited amount of "low hanging" aranean minds to experiment on, a strategy to optimize "(memory research)/(time limit used)" would be to force a restart every time he begins to exhaust these easy prey (of course this would alert red robe, and speed the distant degrading of the time loop, but would be a potential last resort)

However, I'm unsure whether either Zorian or nobody103 agree with this line of thought: the wording from the latest chapter of "2 restarts left" instead of "2 months left" mildly suggests they do not.

******** I thought that the reason Zorian usually didn't go twice after the same web was because after reading their minds once, he saw no value in doing so again, as he had already gone through them. Maybe he thought that there were no longer any secrets hidden in that particular aranea, or that if he had done it once, that he would be able to do so again effortlessly and thus it would be useless to him in gaining more skills?

They never really specified, so it's hard to tell whether or not that method you suggested would truly help.

*** While the memory packet is useful, he is pissing off red cloak to get the same info that the Aranea acquired. She investigated the invaders with the full resources of her nation, he's investigating it with the full force of Eldemar. It's useful, but it's hardly obvious that it's more useful than a proper investigation being an alien mind package from someone with little proper under. Furthermore, it's not like he's had a general policy of completely avoiding risks up to this point. He fought Aranea with mind magic and attacked the invaders and invaded the manor before.

If he lets Red Cloak enact his scheme then he may return at any time (and he expects him to return soon) with some gamechanging plan that ruins him. The army is there to act as a huge bullet soak. The army pisses off red cloak and the church, and to get to him Red has to fight through the army and the church, forces which already have shown they can defeat the lich who is superior to Red.

  Grey hunters had known weaknesses. First of all, they were purely melee opponents -- if you could keep them at distance, there was nothing they could do to you. The trouble was that they were really, really good at closing in on their target. Secondly, they were ultimately just magical animals so they could be lured into prepared traps and kill zones fairly easily. The problem here was that they were fast and tough enough to probably survive such a blunder. The magic sense the grey hunter demonstrated in Zorian's first encounter with it probably also helped it avoid the most blatant of such traps.

  He could think of a several ways to trap it, but most of them required knowledge of spells that he didn't have. If he knew how to make a simulacrum and open portals, he could simply send in his simulacrum as bait and then open a portal leading to wherever he set the trap up. Hell, simply knowing how to make a simulacrum would make things a million times easier since he could make test his ideas without endangering himself. If he knew large terrain alteration spells he could simply seal it off in its lair and wait for it to suffocate. If he knew the spells to manipulate large amounts of water he might be able to drown it. And so on, and so on...
#+end_quote

It's already confirmed that at one point in time Red Robe was a simulacrum, so that is evidence (though fairly weak) for your theory. If simulacrums are "sufficiently real that some people have argued the use of the spell is inherently unethical", then it seems possible that a simulacrum has sufficient agency to make different decisions than its progenitor. Alternatively, as a creation by soul magic, perhaps it might be possible for a hostile necromancer to forcibly create a simulacrum of a targeted individual and twist its purpose to their will; could Red Robe have been created by Quatach-Ichl when he attacked Zach and then have persisted separately in the time loop through Zach's soul mark?

Red Robe's simulacrum was killed by the aranea, then he ambushed and "soul-killed" the aranea, then he defeated Zorian and he hasn't turned up since. If Red-Robe-as-a-simulacrum could create a simulacrum of himself, that would be consistent with his ambush of the aranea.

Red Robe's disappearance could be elegantly explained if it was a consequence of the destruction of his simulacrum, however I don't see a particularly plausible set of circumstances and events that would be consistent with this. Perhaps the destruction of the simulacrum somehow confused the time loop sufficiently that it failed to loop him. If the time loop was built by people, programmed in soul magic, then it almost certainly has bugs. The destruction of a simulacrum of a simulacrum of the targeted entity might just hit a corner case.

It is also possible that Red Robe is some sort of soul construct, similar to but more "real" than a simulacrum, created by Quatach-Ichl from Zach. This might make it more credible that Red Robe could create his own simulacrum. Importantly, it means that if we learn more about the limitations of simulacrums and they are inconsistent with Red Robe's actions or being looped, it wouldn't necessarily contradict this theory.

I can't speak for the rest, but we know that this explanation cannot be right. The restart in which Red Robe confronted Zorian was the one after his simulacrum had been defeated. Therefore, we can confirm that he has already looped at least once since this event.

Furthermore, he seems to have a much better understanding of the time loop's characteristics and limitations than anyone else. If anyone would be aware of such an obvious problem with his own existence and the time loop itself, it would be him. Therefore, I strongly doubt that he would have used one of the only spells that could permanently disable himself. He's never shown himself to be this foolish.

***** Without Red Robe's influence, the invasion would never be as successful. (Without the summoned demons, anyways.) We've seen this ever since the aranea have been killed, since the invaders no longer have the knowledge to take over the wards around the Academy, or to know where the most effective places to land artillery strikes are located. With Red Robe's knowledge, they are fully capable of doing these things. We've often seen the invasion play through with success even without Zach's presence before the aranea were killed, even when he had taken on Tesen.

So that cannot be it. It does not completely remove the possibility that Tesen himself is Red Robe, but it does disprove the theory that Zach dueling Tesen removes Red Robe from the entire equation.

**** I don't think that the process by which red robe survives a reset has been teased yet. My theory is that the simulacrum came about as a result of the whole situation revealed regarding Zac's family and inheritance in the last chapter. Kind of like a wonky "dark side" thing HPMOR had going on with Harry. This additional mention of simulacrums is meant to remind the reader of this previously established, unfired chekov's gun.

What I think will happen is that the upcoming end of arc 2 will reveal the identity of Red Robe at the climax, leaving the exact details as a cliffhanger. Zorian will be confronted on his distrust of Zac in some way, perhaps causing him to change his mind on it, and then he will be vindicated when Zac unwittingly betrays him, and Red Robe is revealed.

** Zorian finally achieves his goal of levitating his little sister at the beginning of the loop. I think he entirely skipped the small animal portion of that training, (the last living thing I remember him levitating was a praying mantis) so Xvim's lessons must have been pretty damn useful.

I agree with the other poster that going after Sudomir instead of focusing on the memory packet wasn't entirely sensible, but at least Zorian made an attempt to explain his actions and things spiraled out of his control pretty quickly once Alanic decided he needed to be involved. I feel like the major factor is still plot reasons though. The information in the packet would either alter his later decisions too much and/or it would be more dramatic to reveal it after this particular storyline.

Feels like that early bit of discussion with Barak is some supporting evidence for the time loop being alternate universes, because of the whole "copies of people" thing.

The basic theory I'm running on at this point:

1. From the original timeline at the start of the planar alignment, a few hours before Zorian wakes up, a copy is made of the nearby physical universe.

2. Copies of souls are added. For time loopers, it uses the soul that existed at the end of the last loop. For "soulkilled" beings, it doesn't make copies at all.

3. This splinter universe and people in it carry out their lives for a month, at which point the planar alignment reaches its peak and the splinter universe ceases to exist, any "time-looper" souls tagged by the master spell are then inserted into their new bodies in another newly created universe. This can be triggered early with the death of the prime time-looper (Zach) or activation of the switch on Zach and Zorian's souls.

4. Rinse and Repeat several thousand times. The timeloop spell runs out of charge.

5. Loop ends, the time-looper souls are reinserted into their original bodies at the start of the "loop". "Soulkilled" beings are once again present.

And then we'll have the final story arc, with no second chances at that point. Interference from demonic/divine planes will once again be on the table, as will predicting the future after the planar alignment's peak.

** That chapter name is promising. Yep, registering multiple substance impacts on the fan.

When Alanic said the soul well was tugging on his souls... Is it a typo or does he really have multiple souls?

And... as long as we're talking of plurals, I'm fairly certain plural of vortex is vortices. (don't hate me)

So, Zorian made a huge splash. It is possible that the gateway to Ibasa is already functioning and invaders will be sending backup in the next chapter, meaning even further escalation of conflict. Not that they have a chance against Military forces, but they could wipe Zorian's party, since it's not a full-blown army and then stall, maybe. Somehow.

The bigger problem is that this should alert Red Robe in the next restart to see if Zorian would repeat the assault on Sudomir. Zorian should really try to lay low and focus on that memory packet. The clock is still ticking.

** I love the world building that nobody103 is currently doing. However i have a few questions and speculations particularly on the politics of Altazia that i wish for clarification.

NOTE: I highly suggest people View the map and READ all of the comments below the Map

1.) Where did The Weeping originated from?

The Weeping, in my opinion, is the most interesting point in telling history of Altiazia. It acts a major catalyst for the whole story. The Weeping wipeout 1/5 of a country population. Sapping the vitality of major nations and their ability to wage wars, due to the reduced productivity & loss of population. This break in turn allows lots of micro-nations to continue to exist after the Splinter wars.(More in Details later) The Ulquuan Ibasa seizes the opportunity to launch an invasion. (Which seems to be extremely ineffective in the terms geopolitics and more like to terrorism). The only clue given on the origin of Weeping is that it originated from Eldemar. The logical Conclusion i have is that the Weeping is naturally born from the war during the splinter wars. Diseases such as thyroid, INFLUENZA /wink/, Syphilis, cholera could traces their existence in Major Wars/ Warring period. (source below) I like this idea as it adds depth into the World Building by showing that the world built is dynamic and the events are interrelated somehow, a sense of realism to the world.

source: [[http://urbanrim.org.uk/diseases.htm]]

2.) The reason Behind The Great Push. Colonizing and cultivating new lands is extremely costly in terms of money, resource & Manpower. Historically, the colonization of Americas boils down to 2 points, 1. The hope of finding gold 2. Escape from European religious and feudal war. It makes no sense for Eldemar to devote its resources into cultivating new lands when

1. No mention of precious mental or resources throughout the story in the Great Northern Forest.

2. Weak, fertile/developed micro-States neighbors ripe for the taking. Developed lands are way easier, cheaper and profitable than cultivating new ones.

3. Strong rivals that are either Extremely Wealthy/Technologically Advance or have Powerful Military. The rival Nations may threaten Eldemar if it focus too much resources into cultivating & colonizing new land, neglecting its military or technology.

4. Decentralizes the government. Larger area = harder to maintain = more power to governor/merchant/church/Mage Guild/(/Impt). A big No-No to any monarchy constitution.

I speculate that Eldemar are diplomatically isolated by her rivals and neighbor states. Meaning, all of them wants Eldemar to fuck off. This could be due to the fact that Eldemar is the direct successor to the old alliance and a lot of historic grievance towards Eldemar due to The Splinter Wars. This provide powerful incentives for other major power to form a coalition to wipe out Eldemar. Couple with the fact that Eldemar is located in Altiazia Central valley, which infers that Eldemar sits on a large spread of fertile plains that geographically speaking extremely easy to invade.

Eldemar might had taken the Russian approach and colonize large swath of land as buffer zones. (For more information into Russian reasons for colonizing Siberia the /Video Link/ below provides a great summary into the subject) might plan and using the Great Winter Mountains as a geography barrier thats much easier to defend. (Look at map 2)

4.) Is the Lich, Quatach-Ichl the de-facto Leader/King of Uquaan Ibasa? Is the Lich a Rational Actor in the story or is he mad and dangerous.

The Lich is my favourite character in the story for 1. the most OP character inside the story. 2. Seems to be highly intelligent/rational, given that his the most powerful mage in existence for a thousand years or something. The personality of the Lich is very important as to the next question.

1. What is even the purpose of Cyoria invasion for the Ibasans.

The Invasion itself seems to me to be utterly meaningless. Why would a country sent its finest army and general to commit seemingly meaningless terrorism?!? Even trying to summon a primordial demon just to wreak meaningless havoc! Even Real life terrorist have their own agenda in carrying out terrorism. It would make zero sense for a country to spend so much resources (Eg. Loot-crates filled with expensive potions and Cash) They even use up tamed Trolls which i guess cost a fucking bomb to breed and train. Sure its mentioned that the Ibasan felt left out by the rest of the continent and wanting to stay relevant like a suburban dad with his teenage son, but this invasion seems to be a utter waste of time and resources for such a poor country. They simply do not have the logistics and resource available in maintaining rule even after conquering it.First will be the army, than rebellion, followed opportunist neighboring countries invasion. The campaign was doomed to fail! Summoning the primordial rampaging around the continent is practically asking for it. Countries might group up and attack the Ibasan island as they view them to be a very serious threat. The same way america felt after 911 for this invasion. The invasion might be a rally point for a full blown invasion with full public support. Hell, even Zorian himself also said so that the government will act instead of idle around if the invasion succeeded. I hated this as it portrays the Ibasans as the same villain you will find in cartoons that find joy in creating meaningless trouble. The enemy suddenly feel very shallow and exist purely for the sake of the plot.

I feel that this invasion should serve as a act in a grander geopolitical strategy. For example, to become the 4th Force in the Altazia Central valley. The Ibasan have been looking for ways to get back into Altazia ever since the Necromancy Wars. However, as the old alliance stands, they do not have much chance against a singular powerful force that could crush any chance of invasion. So, they waited for any opportunity that arises and that first opportunity arises from the ashes of Splinter wars. The Old Alliance have finally been broken apart, however being isolated for the continent for a long time, their military was simply unmatched for the more technological advance militaries of the central continent nations. However, The Weeping which wiped out nearly 1/5 of the population on central continent had greatly reduced military power and influence of the bigger nation such as Eldemar and Sulamnon. The Ibasan view this as an opportunity to re-enter Altazia politics. The first thing they need to do is to be "relevant", to do so they decided invade Cyoria. I mean what better way to say your powerful and scary than to suddenly invade the second biggest city filled with powerful mage with a freaking huge as army that have mutant trolls and ironbeaks and ending off with summoning a huge as primordial beast in the middle of the said city. The Ibasan prolly plan for the primordial to rampage around the countryside of Eldemar for a day or two before it running out of juice. They then prolly "mysteriously" disappeared back in Cyoria.

Once the invasion is proclaimed successful, they could start reaching out towards all the smaller states who are sick of the three major powers. I mean between your neighbor enemy who prolly will annex you the next few years or an potentially strong ally who demonstrated the ability to raze a fucking city with an army of beast and able to summon a huge ass powerful beast to destroy you, theres really not much of a competition. Beside the Ibasans Mainland is so far away from the altazia continent. The huge distance could provide the smaller states relief as if they ever go to war with the Ibasans, they will have trouble maintaining the huge logistics and supply line for a prolonged war.

The end goal of the Ibasans is to establish itself as the 4th power by creating a new alliance of smaller noble nations, encircling the major power (REFER TO THE MAP BELOW) and acting as the center pillar of the alliance.

I hope that i have not missed out any minor details in the story and feel free to correct me if theres any flaws in my theory and pleas provide me with your opinion and your take on the political situation in Altazia. I Hated stories that perceive history and politics as a single chain of events. It should be dynamic as many factors are always connected with each other; cause(s) and effect(s).

You don't have to speculate this - this is exactly what Eldemar's diplomatic situation is about. I implied so pretty heavily in the story, and directly said so on DeviantArt. The problem is that Eldemar's leadership is really arrogant and pushy in their diplomacy. They hate to compromise on anything and are pretty open about wanting to reabsorb all the other splinter states under rather unfavorable terms. They're the only legitimate successor of the Old Alliance, dammit, why are all these little statelets demanding that Eldemar treat them as legitimate sovereign nations!?

And, of course, if they attack any one of those little states they're basically plunging the continent right back into another round of Splinter Wars... which they can't afford to do at the moment.

**** Edit: It is nice to have the author to reply :)

Good Worldbuilding is very hard to write. Many great stories simply ignores the Economics of their world.(E.g. Harry Potter's bullshit currency exchange rate) I don't think theres in a need for an in-depth worldbuilding for the story cos it will takes up a large part of the story focus. Adding in snippets and commentaries will be more than enough.

Mother of Learning have very few plotholes in the stories, most of the political motivations could be explained/covered/traced back to the effects of splinter wars & The weeping.(A few comments by best girl tinami or old history teacher will do) Which makes it easy to explain without adding alot more unnecessary information.(Too much info might hurt the focus & enjoyment of the story)

--------------

I feel the need to address this cos it might cause major plot holes in the future. Especially:

1.)The motive for Great North Push

2.)The motive for Ibasans Invasion (I have another explaination for the motivation other than the above, however its much more complex than the one above.)

3.)The unfeasible relationship between the crown and mage guild.(Harder to explain due to complex relationship between the Nature of Power & Politics)

However all this could easily be explain with less than half of a chapter. Other than this the story have a wonderful world thats extremely well built and thought out, which really impresses me alot for a writing as a hobby!

--------------

I just wanted to point out that to write a good world-building:

1.)Geopolitics is VERY important.(Determines all of a country political strategies)

2.) All political actors MUST* be Rational thinkers(Unless they are mad like Sudomir.)

3.) Politics/history should be dynamic and Interelated*. (Chain(s) of Events/ Cause & Effects)

4.) All action taken by actors should be feasible. (Economically and Logically)

--------------

P.s Half of my motivation of writing this essay is me hoping for a sequel more in-depth into the world:D.(A huge waste for such a well built world to end.) Especially a good one that explain about how the existence of magic might affect the Politics, Economy & Production. (E.g. Crystalised mana powered train) Its an itch that no story ever addressed before.

P.P.s I shuld really start explaining on the crown and mage guild.

Hope he can eventually start throwing around the kinds of spells we see Alanic use in this chapter, as I'm getting tired of him being only a mind-magic specialist. Steel war golems would also be cool to add to his arsenal, as were those fire vortexes (although he would have to team up with Zach to supply mana). Also, I have a feverant hope he can steal those Dragon bones. Hopefully he can use them somehow.

** (Repost from the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/4d8aso/en_mother_of_learning_chapter_51/][noveltranslations thread]])

Two things that stood out to me in this chapter were that we learned (even if we had to suspect it to some extent) why best-girl-Tinami was interested in Zorian's lineage, being from a witch family and probably sharing their interest in bloodlines. It's likely that knowing that Zorian had witch blood in his veins was enough for her to consider him a good prospect for marriage or reproduction with her or another member of her family.

Second thing that I thought was interesting was this line by Alanic (emphasis mine):

#+begin_quote
  "There is no need," Alanic said calmly. "I can feel the spiritual sinkhole tugging at my *souls* easily enough."
#+end_quote

Either this was a typo, either Alanic has somehow gained multiple souls through his soul magic ventures, or either he has given us another hint on the true nature of souls, that they are not single and integral entities, but rather a combination of many distinct parts. As long as the explanation is not the first I mentioned, this is very interesting.

Edit: Alanic's line has been confirmed to be no more than a typo.

**** Something to consider though is that Zorian himself gave Tinami no indication whatsoever that he was psychic in that restart. And since she has made no mention of him being open in that restart and any other, and since she requires spells to be able to use mind magic, we know that she isn't open herself, and therefore wouldn't be able to find that out about Zorian without him telling her.

So although I am sure that she suspected that it was possible that Zorian had some bloodline power from his witch grandmother, she had no way of confirming whether such a power was ever in his family, or whether his bloodline power (if any) would be related to psychic abilities, or whether she could somehow inherit it herself rather than her own children inheriting it.

So it definitely opens up a potential path for Zorian becoming close to the Aope family in the future, but with the limited amount of information Tinami held in that restart, she had no way to know that he was related to any psychic abilities. Unless she is aware of things we aren't, and all witches are psychics to some degree. Or unless her excitement was because the possibility existed that his family used to be psychic, and she was looking forward to investigating the possibility herself for any potential heirs Zorian might have.

****** Unfortunately, whatever it was, we won't know for quite a while. The restart in which she gained access to his genealogical tree is already over. All that we know is that she seemed excited for some reason, that Zorian wasn't even curious enough to learn the reason why that would be to try to read her surface thoughts (or that the thought never crossed his mind, but that seems odd to me), and that witches tended to place a lot of importance in bloodlines (as per the priest's words in chapter 51).

I still see very little importance in caring about bloodlines, if not to try to get it to cross with your own to improve it. Unless she was interested in his witch heritage because she intended to take a blood sample from him in order to use it in some ritual or spell.

The marriage aspect seems much more tame to me.

** Very nice chapter, I hope the story keeps surprising me, but the longer it gets the easier it will be to foresee what will happen.

I believe the aranea memory pack will have very limited use to Zorian, he'll discover something really important but it will take several restarts to do something with/about it. There probably will be things he dismisses/overlooks that are important, though. There always are.

What I'm most excited about however is how far can he get with Xvim properly instructing him. What worries me is the fact that the loop is "deteriorating", we don't really know what that means yet, right? I hope the story doesn't simply end without the loop ending, or when the loop ends, but that it keeps going for some time. It'll be fun to have Zorian get used to being mortal and having no time again.

As for Red Robe, the simulacrum idea makes a bit of sense, but I really doubt that he is Zach's, because if he truly is then wouldn't killing Zach also end Red Robe? Why would the simulacrum have to mind read Zach? He might be something else, maybe when the Lich used the spell that brought Zorian into the loop, he also mangled Zach's soul enough that it created another being entirely? Zach went missing for several loops after that and came back with his memories all screwed up, he likely hasn't gotten them back yet, so Red Robe might be a "soul twin" with part of Zach's memories or such.

TL;DR Story is developing nicely, can't wait till Zorian can be strong enough to deal with surprises. I seriously hope it happens, the fact that he could get in trouble if a dozen owls attack him by surprise is kind of pathetic. I also wish he did more life-risking things, like going after the grey hunter. Ending restarts by the time limit is boring.

Zorian says that Daimen used it on him for practice back when Daimen was in second year, so around 14. Since Zorian remembers it so vividly, he had to be at least 6 years old, probably more. It still gives a maximum age difference of around 8 years. My initial guess when reading was around Zorian being 9-10 years old at the time. Of course, this is entirely speculation.

With the assumption that it only took about 2½ years after graduation to become a successful enough archaeologist to be the hero of a lot of people, then accounting for the 18 months or so minimum to account for two younger brothers, would make the minimum difference between the two to be around 4 years.

So although this is still purely speculation based simply on the timing of that animation spell, I'd say that it's unlikely that Daimen is not in the range of 4-8 years older than Zorian.

****** I was also frustrated with the animation spell recall scene because of how vague it was... But based on soft clues, I'd agree that 4-8 is a pretty likely range.

Speaking of animation spell practice (which was basically light torture), this means if it is Daimen, for him to have gained soul sight he must have performed one of those murder necromantic rites Kael describes, btw.

******* Unless there are other methods of obtaining soul sight which we are not yet aware of.

I would be interested if in some restart, Zorian showed up at Sudomir's doorstep at Iasku Manor and asked for an apprenticeship. No idea how it would turn out, but if he agreed after Zorian showed his knowledge of Sudomir's actions, it's certain that Zorian would be able to learn a lot about necromancy.

Similar results might be obtainable if Zorian went farther trying to court Tinami and get closer to the Aope family. They are known for mind magic and necromancy, after all. Or maybe Alanic will be willing to teach him a few things after the events of this restart, what with killing an undead dragon and searching through the rubbles of Sudomir's soul trap and all.

Although Zorian stated clearly in the last chapter that he has no intentions of learning necromancy or gaining soul sight for the moment, I'm still hoping that he changes his mind at some point. Soul magic seems to be intrinsically linked to the origin of the time loop, after all. So if he wants to really learn about it, it seems inevitable that he'll need to get some more knowledge in that domain.

** I was re-reading the last chapter in preparation for today's (hopeful) release when I realized that no one had commented on the discovery of another possible mechanism for Red Robe's "soulkill"-

#+begin_quote
  If he remembered correctly, life force was simply a special type of personal mana that wasn't part of a mage's mana pool and was used exclusively by the body to keep itself living and resist foreign magics. Since the amount of life force rarely varied much between humans, and couldn't be used to power spells, the academy instructors hadn't spoken much about it.</p><p>Wait. That was it, wasn't it? Life force was something every living being had and depended on to stay alive. And it was basically just an exotic form of mana. And the outer portion of the soul -- the part that can get warped and mutilated -- was the one in charge of regulating a person's mana flow. If a person's soul was damaged, that would cause their very life-giving energies to spin out of control...
#+end_quote

So by disrupting someone's personal mana from the outer shell, Red Robe would be able to disrupt the part of them that allows life. I think this is significant because it's different than the mechanism I've been assuming up until now of just excluding someone's soul from the time loop so that at its conclusion they return. If this is true, they'd never return, unless the soul damage was repaired (and since they're dead, this is unlikely).
