** For some reason it's funny to see Rain worried about mind reading. I really doubt he knows the finer points of uranium refinement and all the required processing to make nuclear weapons. Besides that, is there really dangerous information he could possibly have that wouldn't inevitably be figured out from the other information he plans to introduce anyway?

It's wild how useful that ring is. I forgot why Tallheart made him it; I wonder if he'll ever get a better one.

He doesn't need to know the finer points of uranium refining, that's what Tallheart's filters are for. As for going from pure U235 to a bomb, it doesn't sound /that/ hard if you aren't picky about the yield.

******* I doubt any of us are unaware of the difference between isotopes and chemicals. It's not a complicated topic.

What's more difficult to understand is why you think this difference is relevant here? Because real filters operate on chemistry? These are magical filters that obviously do not operate on the same mechanics. They are explained as becoming permeable to some materials but not others.

  "It's silly to assume there are arbitrary limitations on magical filtration that would prevent teleporting"
#+end_quote

I can see that you are trying to paint my statement as silly, but it really just looks like you're clumsily plugging the relevant words into the form of an argument you've seen before. And honestly, we don't have a reason to assume it's impossible to have some kind of teleportation-based filtration system that teleports only certain materials.

#+begin_quote
  "More importantly, it would be silly for Rain to assume teleporting is impossible given the magnitude of the consequences if he is wrong and the knowledge gets out.
#+end_quote

Perhaps I was not clear in what I was trying to say here, because you clearly didn't understand. If magical isotope-separation IS possible, and Rain assumes it ISN'T, then he might be less careful with nuclear secrets and accidentally give his enemies nukes. If Rain behaves as though it IS possible, or at least that it MIGHT BE possible, the he will be more careful than is necessary with nuclear secrets. This doesn't have negative consequences except that it might be a bit inconvenient.

#+begin_quote
  What's really silly is assuming new properties which haven't been demonstrated.
#+end_quote

You seem to have a fundamental inability to understand the difference between "assuming something is possible" and "refusing to assume something is impossible."

You are making an assumption that a certain thing is impossible by assuming that a fictional magic system is limited in its ability to separate materials by atomic weight (for some reason). I am not assuming it's possible, I'm just not ruling it out.

I think the problem is that you're literally the only person I've seen who thinks that Tallheart's filters work on a "chemical" basis and not an "intent" one.

If they work like Purify, they work on what he /thinks/ it should separate. And if it works like that, then it should be able to separate materials based on any sufficiently imaginable characteristic.

EDIT: Also, because it needs saying

#+begin_quote
  Could Tallheart build a filter for U235?

It's right there in the chapter. /Rain/ believes that it might work like that. Argue with it all you want, but you need to take it up with the author, not just the people who've read the actual chapter.

No. There's a critical mistake in this line of thinking. It should be "If they *COULD* work like Purify..."

Does Rain have any reason to believe Tallheart's filters couldn't separate U-235 and U-238? He doesn't need to prove they can. Without proof they can't, it's too big of a risk to take.

********* There is already magic that works on intent in this world. (Purify)

You are the one assuming it isn't possible for reasons that have no evidence to back it up.

"Filters, no matter how magic they are, would do absolutely nothing to seperate 2 isotopes and he would very much need to know the reactions needed to do it the actual way."

"Filters works because different chemicals have different chemical properties. Isotopes have none."

What is your evidence that the magic filters work like chemical reaction filters?

If they work by chemical reactions there would be chemicals being spent, like something bonding with tin and not iron. Where is the stuff that tin is bonding to? Show us the evidence.

Also not all filters work by chemical reactions, they can work by particle size, or mass (like how U235 has a different mass then U238) also you wouldn't want to drink heavy water, because it has different chemical properties then regular water, so you are wrong about isotopes not effecting chemistry.

"Just don't assume it is possible until proven so, like the initial comment i answered to."

Then why is it ok for you to assumes things you hypocrite? No excuses. Uranium can be enriched useing lasers because the different isotopes have different properties in interacting with light.

Where. You are obviously dodging the question.

"I said chemical properties, so not necessarily reactions.

As for "Where is the stuff that tin is bonding to?" well i dunno, the filter maybe ? Tallheart needing to change his filters seems to indicate it."

No because he was able to get pure tin, so it wasn't bonded to anything.

"I'm aware and it is an exception. If i say humans have 10 fingers, are you going to screech that a tiny tiny tiny percentage has more/less and thus that i'm wrong or do you understand that the very vast majority has 10 ?"

It isn't an exception, many enrichment processes uses the different chemistry between isotopes filter.

"Which is a physical property. There's a reason i said chemical property.

Please read before replying the next time :/"

That is irelavent you still haven't shown me any evidence that the magic filters work by chemical processes. I wonder why....

******* > Filters works because different chemicals have different chemical properties.

Umm... this is definitely not a universal property of filters. For example, I have a filter in my email, that puts messages with certain words in the title to a certain folder. There are no chemical properties involved. There is no reason to believe that the properties of a magical filter are any more closely related to a chemical filter, than they are to a programmatic one. The word "filter" only implies the capability to let something through and not something else.

If I had a machine that lets only one isotope through by, say a magnetic and electric field, it would be entirely fair to call it an isotope filter. And I think such a machine could also separate iron from ore. So how do you know that's not the principle inside Tallheart's filter? (Personally, I think programming metaphors are more fruitful, though.)

In the real world, that is the case as there is nothing else to differentiate the materials with, but we're talking about a world where that isn't necessarily the case. Tallheart's filters demonstrably aren't like coffee filters which only let small particles through.

Both are basically the same argument, just worded differently. You've decided on a point where the filters start following the laws of physics we know, but the issue is that that point is not backed by the canon material.

As for Tallheart's filters, I really don't know what to tell you. He can filter out rock which is incredibly vague for a "chemical," so I don't understand what would be so fundamentally different about separating "strange metal" from "strange metal that is slightly heavier." The fact that he hasn't mentioned isotopes doesn't mean much, so you're taking absence of evidence as a confirmation that such a thing is impossible.

If you're curious why I'm ignoring your fifth point, I do that because I have no interest in expanding upon a snide potshot which will just lead to a quote stack tangent that goes fifteen comments deep and achieves exactly nothing.

What the heck is your argument here, how are things breaking less in your idea, what the heck dose coffee have to do with isotopes? You are really hard to understand and you are suffering from the Dunning Kruger effect because you think isotopes have the same chemical properties, but they don't have the same properties many enchment processes use the differences to filter, it's not the 40s anymore centrifuges are not the only process.

He seems to be under the illusion that Chemistry is completely divorced from isotopes, which is a profoundly limited understanding.\\
Even 'pure' 'less broken' 'SuperiorCursedLight' chemical filters can be used to separate certain isotopes.

The entire argument is predicated on an arbitrary line drawn in the sand. Do you know what Tallhearts filters can filter? Whatever the author goddam likes. Even the distance certain abilities propagate has been shown to be effected by the users internalized measurement metrics, which is a pretty strong argument for the 'magic as intent' proposition.

This will benefit them too because now they will have 2 months worth of comments they can interact with (which will include the entire Delve audience, not just the freebies). Since there will be an 8 chapter discrepancy at the start, until the threads for the freebies catch up to where the first patreon threads started, we'll have double posts, so that eventually, every chapter will have a thread. And every thread will have a link to the patreon, so SS will benefit, I think. But also, every thread will have a link to the royal road when it eventually goes up there, too.

******** Ah, that makes more sense. Two concerns about it though.

First, author's been a bit antsy about access to reading ahead. I haven't checked in a while, but if i remember right, patreon chapter discussion on the discord was locked to supporters only. Also there was a time when the chapters were getting put up on yiff party (patreon leaking site) occasionally that he specifically requested be stopped. I tend much more towards pro-piracy stuff and haven't been in his shoes, so I don't know exactly how he'll feel about the idea of a discussion thread for patreon chapters going up.

Second concern is about relevance to the sub. Sure it's a more-or-less rational work, but given the paywall that cuts off a lot of people interested in the thread. We don't know how many lurkers drop into threads on established work being posted anyway. Two solutions for that would be asking mods to set up a generic "current rational updates" weekly thread (which actually seems a really good idea to me, Practical Guide saw semi-regular chapter postings here for a while but they weren't very active and eventually stopped). Other option is just making a pure Delve subreddit and making both free and patreon update threads, but then you have the problem of generating interest, as well as attracting too many "numbers go up" types, as well as splitting the already small readerbase community if the subreddit catches on.

***** Yeah the RR comments are filled with that crowd, thank god for [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. The patreon discord is a bit of a mix.

*** That speech of his reminded me of a question regarding healers. I know Amelia had to tear off Carten and I think Rain's armor to be able to heal them when they went Delving together. How would a specialized healer get past the armor of their own party members when they get injured. Do you think there's specialized skills that can somehow bypass armor? Getting past your ally's defenses sounds especially important for the ranged heals Rain mentioned. If there is, sounds like a great way to fight in PvP if it can be used offensively, especially at range.

**** I imagine there are high tier class abilities to bypass armour for the purpose of healing, things Amelia couldn't access because she only gets skills not class abilities, so she had to use the stopgap of just ripping the armour off. Amelia's class lends itself to this dynamic of being able to be almost anything she needs, but running into additional hurdles like this that pure classes can bypass.
