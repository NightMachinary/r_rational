** I've heard lots of good things about this story but never picked it up. The fact that it's now complete gives me significantly more incentive to do so.

My thanks to the author in advance :)

*** It's not perfect, and at one point the audience managed to convince the author to rewrite a chapter for less stupid plotting, but it's still the best treatment of a reverse portal fantasy story I seen.

In the end, it even manages to briefly become a sci-fi military thriller complete with geopolitics and Russian tank army, though not with a war.
