Umm. Why is Rain pushing for a democracy, again? He wants to be in charge as a lord. The society expects lords to be in charge.

Even if he's committed to "democracy = good", at the very least he should wait a few weeks until the company is running smoothly. 8-person parties and helping each other kill blues is already a major change for the society. Let that settle down, then start stepping away from being a lord and towards sharing power in a democracy.

*** Cultural brainwashing from birth, also called "grooming". The concept of a liberal democracy is a useful structure for obscuring the horrors of power structures, both for the ruling class and the public. Rain, having a hold of some power, doesn't wish to feel like he's a "bad person".

These days, Worth the Candle looks like it's exploring the problem of consent of those with no power.

I'm not certain if the author is going the "flawed protagonist" angle (and is deliberately showing that Rain is starting to go down the "tyrant" route), or if this is just a facet of writing that could be improved with some editing.

** Rain is clearly going to infect the entire company with the strange plague of Numbers. At least if things turn out how he wants, anyway. They're also clearly not ready for it, except maybe for Staavo. But at this rate they're going to have to learn just to figure out their compensation and benefits. I wonder if he's going to have to invent the abacus or if there's a local version he can promote, just so people can do the math.

Are there any fiat currencies in this setting so far? I don't recall for sure whether there's money that isn't formed out of an equivalent value of a precious metal. And it sounds like he's going even beyond that and making the company "credits" abstract entries in a ledger, without any physical currency! I guess that'll be fine as long as all the transactions go through the company. They'd have to "cash out" in the form of some company assets to trade with anyone else.

EDIT: Ah, I missed this the first time through:

*** That's rather ingenious. Motivate people to learn math by making the math be about their money.

This sort of education could be revolutionary. It is a shame the story progresses time so slowly we are unlikely to see the ramifications. That's one downside of the current trend of character-driven stories: there aren't many that encompass large swathes of time. Even a Dickens-style entire lifetime narrative can do things that just aren't possible in stories about just a couple of weeks or years.

** Damn, he is bad at this. Sorry, not trying to poke at it, but the first thing he should have "structured" was not the proceedings of the vote itself, but the proceedings of a meeting. The way it went, Rain explained three times what was needed, everyone else got one third of what they needed to vote, concerns were not addressed, almost no one got to clarify anything and the vote was held anyway. Thankfully, he had some good things passed there, even if a little forced. The rules as they are now will probably contribute to calling things back into question and smoothing things out later.

Now, the system he proposed is almost point per point the system used by pirates back then with a bit of extra complexity, so it should work well enough. I suspect giving people the chance to take non fighting classes and still being a viable "career" within the group will pay dividends later, the same way Tallheart does. Also math is a extremely good idea. Having people being able to do the math and check the books will dissuade anyone from pointing fingers blindly. Not sure if it's worth teaching a whole new set of numbers and measures just because he prefers it, but that's his free time to use.

I just wonder how he will set credit values for tasks. "Shares" worked well for pirates, since there was not that much of a power gap between crewmates, there was one task giving dividends (plundering) that everyone joined for and the reward was one massive treasure to be shared. Everyone did the same work, the only ones getting more were the ones doing extra work (captain, quartermaster, surgeon, carpenter, etc) and it was a simple ratio.

Here on the other hand, there are several tasks "worth of credits" that not everyone will participate. This means people with specific talents like fighting, healing or even different power levels will claim their contributions should be worth more credits. Not everyone is gonna be as selfless as Ameliah is, and since there is strategy and luck in bidding for a blue, the power gap will not smooth out easily. More than that, it will take one monster dropping a rare item worth a load of credits on one guy's lap to throw the whole credit system on it's head.

** So, this is the chapter that made me drop my Patreon subscription, if I'm keeping my timelines straight. Reading about Rain trying - badly - to implement democracy while appealing to (but not actually explaining) some sort of half remembered Robert's Rules of Order was not interesting.

In fact, it made me feel rather bilked by the Patreon model. Not for the first time, and it's not the author's fault, per se, but I remember thinking: /Am I really paying a subscription for this guy to slowly worldbuild his way to something approaching a story?/

That puts me now in the unfortunate spot where I have to wait a month or two (had paid for September's advanced stuff too) before I can access new content in a story that already suffers for its serial format. Maybe I'll just pick it back up in half a year. Like other posters have said, I think Delve really does do better when you can consume it in bigger chunks.

This is why I think the "pay for advance chapters" concept is flawed. After the first blast of chapters you are no longer paying for a benefit (as chapters still come out at the same frequency) but are now merely doling out money to avoid suffering a detriment (have to wait a month without chapters).

**** That's more of an issue on the author's part than the Patreon model.

The Wandering Inn? 1 advanced chapter for $5. You don't have to 'drop' the story for a month when you drop Patreon.

Delve? 8 advanced chapters for $2.50. If you drop the Patreon, you're out of the story for 2 months.

Both stories are doing /very/ well. But they have very different implementations of the same Patreon model. And frankly, with Delve's pacing, I would rarely pay for 1 advanced chapter, so the author has probably made a good decision here.

** Finally caught up with this. At literally any point I would have liked Rain to try and abuse Overmana. In this chapter we get a few throwaway lines about Winter “helping” the classes that night. A few weeks gave a horse semi-intelligence. These people do not understand the concept of 0 yet he is trying to install some sort of representative (?) democracy. They should have just camped close to the city and gotten used to the “fake” cold of winter, taking his classes and shit, before they moved on.

I would have MUCH preferred if he said “hey guys, we're gonna travel into the ranked zone for a bit, if we find some lower level region we'll drop roots there. If not we build a camp somewhere and work on finding lairs for our unawakened to farm. After we get everyone awakened, we move south for more ascension.”

This semi-guild shit is so... odd for me. It's like, 10 chapters ago he was just trying to lower the barrier. Then he just... gives up control for nothing to the watch? Why not use Fel Sandis to fund ascension if that's his goal? Why not USE the city in an impenetrable barrier??????

I really got sucked into this a few days ago, pretty GREAT system exploration and the lair stuff, shit I would say this was 10/10 scratched some CRAZY itches I didn't even know I HAD with regards to LitRPG up until the bubble shows up. Basically forcing myself to read the last 30 or so chapters.

ALSO: at this point I've forgotten why it has taken him so long to upgrade mana manipulation. How the fuck is a normal person to get that to 10/10??????? And no matter HOW it happens, with a group of unawakened and Ameliah, his next blue is always gonna feel gifted/weak/Mary sue'd. There were opportunities (lavarro, bring me a lvl 27 blue and I will add your name to the list, or leveraging the Citizen.) to raise his cap in satisfying ways but at this point... just bleh.

One thing that WOULD be cool is if he got Ameliah to try out theorycrafted builds. It's gonna take ALOT of trust from her because he'll know everything about her at that point, but if he can make her “builds” more specialized that'd be great to see.

Or perhaps he creates “Ascension” builds. Like the secret builds of the Watch. The first is Passivist.

Ah at this point I'm just kinda ranting sorry lol. I still liked this, 7/10 for me. Just a disappointing end

He couldn't wait for weeks or go delving because he's on a rescue and evac mission. He was never going to do what you wanted there.

He couldn't have fought the watch. They're stronger than him. Besides if he did somehow incapacitate them, he could never leave the barrier limits to go delving or he'd be attacked.

The consensus in readers is that normal people max mana manipulation over many many years if ever.

Bringing a silver blue to a rank 11 zone, the blue would've probably died before it arrived. Implication of velika taking him elsewhere for a blue if they ever escaped the barrier were there but then she was attacked and had a mental breakdown.

Not sure I understand your next blue gifted thing. His entire end goal is to gift blues to everyone in the world. And his working theory is monsters in general need to be fought with a party of 8. He's just following his theory.

Ameliah already told him she can swap skills. Looking forward to her trying the builds. Passivist is going to be cool. And secrecy of builds is smart at least until they're a very powerful organisation.

*** Re: Mana Manipulation

Easy. Normal items have like 50% efficency as we see when Rain recharges the hotplates. I have little doubt that actual training items have something like 100% efficiency (many of them probably even allow you to just siphon most of the mana off so you can use it in a charging loop) and thus the fact that they only have like 1% of the mana regen doesn't actually make them level up in the skill slower then Rain.

The fact that Rain hasn't spent a hour picking up a normal charging item at the store and then the next day just training his skill up to 10 is honestly pretty appaling.

So Rain's background from a world where way more resources were devoted to that learning and that is hundreds of years past an intellectual awakening, is way ahead.

Only people like Staavo, who began as adventurers and gained enough levels that other people won't ignore their ideas, then got crippled, then rather than give up become a researcher. Only that kind of person has any hope of influencing their society, in much the same way Rain would be just another nobody if he hadn't been awakened.\\

Every advance made has been slow, barely methodic and mostly random. Because math is not intuitive for most people without 10 years of education to beat it into them, and it takes a rare genius to pioneer a new field of math first. All those geniuses are scooped up into far more 'important' fields in this world than fiddeling around with meaningless number hobbies that won't have any effect on the world.

Except Math can, enter Rain. Who is not smart, but he is standing on top of several centuries of incredible men and women's minds and ideas.

edit: So the highest levels of math Rain is using in this story would be compounding percentages. Which I would expect most grade 9 students to solidly grasp. So... natives to a world without mandatory schooling because they haven't even had an industrial revolution yet (and probably never will, because magic solves the low hanging fruit problems that inspired ours much more easily), yeah, they've got no chance.
