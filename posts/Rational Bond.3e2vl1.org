Anyone done a rational take on Bond that leaves the role intact?

Closest I can think of is /The Jennifer Morgue/ which is more a delicious abuse of the trope.


** /The Jennifer Morgue/ is definitely one I'd recommend. Also check out [[http://qntm.org/mcadamis][/Ryan McAdamis Saves the World/]], a short story that is sort of a play on Bondian tropes.

**** I really enjoyed the idea of "30 First Drafts" for National Novel Writing Month, and most of them are quite good.

*** That makes a ha-ha-only-serious one-pager parody (like the rational horror movie video). /The Jennifer Morgue/ does a better job of deconstructing it.
