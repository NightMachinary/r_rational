** Yay, update!

Is this

#+begin_quote
  The boulders of its body are twice the height of a tall man
#+end_quote

consistent with this?

#+begin_quote
  The onix's head is about as big as he is
#+end_quote

Is its head boulder half the size of it's body boulders? A [[https://www.google.com/search?q=onyx&safe=off&rlz=1CAACAG_enUS613US613&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=7vobVe6JJcG1ggSrsISgDw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1366&bih=677#safe=off&tbm=isch&q=onix+pokemon][google image search]] seems to indicate no, but maybe it's different in this fic.

Also:

#+begin_quote
  A year ago, Brock fought a fully grown tyranitar that had come down from Mount Silver. four stories tall, each of its feet the size of a car, able to topple a building with a sweep of its tail.

**** Did you see the sentence fragment / un-capitalized "four" in the last quotation? The sentence can be fixed by just adding an "It was" to the beginning. (If you changed it, it hasn't updated yet.)

** Nice chapter. Was interesting to see the viewpoint of a Gym Leader in this world, as well as the creation myths each town may have as legends, not to mention what might be the commonly accepted one in the region overall. I really liked how you portrayed Brock's Onix - a great sense of age and power could be felt as you described it.

*** Thanks, I've always wanted to mess with the idea that each region only has the legends about pokemon we as gamers already know about, or that all legends would only be the one-of-a-kind type of species rather than special "normal" ones. Some games played with the idea a bit, especially the Red Gyarados at Lake Rage, and I always thought it made the world feel more immersive :) Glad you liked it!

** I am once more impressed about your ideas on how trainers convey orders to the types of pokemon of the world. The metal tipped gloves for Rock types, it just fits, like a glove(Snerk). But really, I enjoy seeing the ways you have come up with how that is handled.

** Hey everyone, welcome back! Sorry for the deadline update, I've been spending some time this month going back and doing some significant edits to chapter one, which has not been updated to reflect them yet. I'll be sure to let you know when it's finished, for those of you interested in going back and reading a (hopefully) spruced up and more compelling first chapter!

Additionally, this one was going to be longer, but I decided to cut a portion of it near the end for not being up to my standards. Hopefully I'll have time to work at it soon and maybe edit it back in: it's nothing immediately plot relevant, so isn't important for the immediate future, and again, I'll be sure to inform in a later update if I get around to adding it in.

As usual, I'll go through this one multiple times for minor edits and tweaks at various points tomorrow and the day after, so all feedback welcome!

** Typos/Tense Inconsistencies I found:

He wasted no time sending out support teams to different parts of the forest based on the Ranger requests, only retaining five groups of five to ride with him toward the biggest fire, where the most help would be needed. A few peeled off to assist Rangers they passed by, and one from each group had formed an escort unit for a group of injured trainers.

Brock body is high up enough to avoid most of the brambles and bushes that survive his pokemon's passage, the rest scratching harmlessly at his armored leggings.

*** Fixed some of them, thanks! The rest are actually intended to be like that: since the story is in present tense, describing past tense doesn't normally need the double qualifier like "he has wasted" or "had formed." The exceptions to this would be within flashbacks, which are themselves set in past tense.

I see no problem with this one - if it was "with the rest scratching harmlessly", it would be fine, and I'm fairly sure that dropping the "with" is also acceptable.

**** I apologize in advance if I've worded this aggressively. The intention of this comment is to better understand what position you are taking here; but I have a bad habit of being abrasively direct.

I don't understand the point you're trying to make.

I felt that the the original muddied my understanding of the tense; so I made a suggestion. It's DSE's decision whether or not to change what he wrote based on the opinion of some guy on the internet, and he's clearly a capable writer. If both compositions are equal, why not leave it to him to make a decision?

I can understand if you think the way it was written originally is clearer or more pleasant; but that doesn't seem to be what you're saying.

***** Worry not when it comes to tone; I may be unusual in this but I think I prefer "abrasively direct" over "refuses to say what they mean for fear of someone taking offence".

Occasionally I've seen authors, being perhaps not entirely confident in their own grammatical abilities, make changes on the assurances of readers that they're fixing a problem; just wanted to provide a counterpoint to say that it wasn't necessarily an error.

It wasn't a point I was trying to make at the time, but on reflection I think I do prefer the way it was originally written. "Scratch" vs "scratching" is a small difference, but the latter has just a slightly greater sense of it being an ongoing condition, rather than something that happens as a single event.
