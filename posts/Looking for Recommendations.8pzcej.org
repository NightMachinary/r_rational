I'm looking for story with Territory building elements as the main focus. I have tried a couple Chinese translated novels but I just couldn't get into them, I read like 20+ chapters of The World Online before giving up and I don't think I'll find my fix from translated novels. Korean novels might work but I haven't found one yet other than Legendary Moonlight Sculptor where its just a minor element,and Seoul Station's Necromancer which was honestly had a great idea but the territory building aspect was sidelined completely.

I also like pokemon type taming or summoning type novels, so if there is a novel which has these elements as a focus, I'd love to know. Long Live Summons is the only novel that I have read.

I'm asking here because whatever reviews I read are negative so I don't know if a novel will be good


** You might like Jim Butcher's Codex Alera series; the Furies in that series have been explicitly described as being inspired by Pokemon.

**** Its a very fun series but may not actually have the explicit territory-building you are interested it. However, I think it is an absolutely FUN read with great action, magic/powers, politics, and characterbuilding.

** You might try Cast Under an Alien Sun, about an engineer who finds himself on an alien world. Winds up starting an industrial revolution, running a town, getting involved in politics, etc.

** Not quite what you're asking for, but one of the side PoV characters in *The Wandering Inn* has territory elements to his thing. If you're a fan of rational works though you may find TWI annoying to read, as the two main PoV characters are frequently not terribly rational, to put it mildly.

They don't really react like people should, either. They're from earth, get transferred to a fantasy world, yet have zero interest in magic? That's like a medieval peasant being transported to modern New York, and being totally blas√© about skyscrapers and cars.

The constant emotional (and often actual) torture of the protagonists is what really puts me off the work though. There's putting characters through adversity, and then there's actual sadism.

It's in the same vein as "The Warded Man", "Worm", "Prequel adventure", and "Tales of MU", so if you didn't have a problem with those, you may like "The Wandering Inn."

Nope. I stopped reading after the author went on a rant about Trump winning, saying that he would then make the series even more dark and depressing. It was too dark for me before that, so I gave up. Was it after that?

I do remember the innkeeper character getting several chances to learn magic (for free, or close enough.) She refused, saying she had no interest in magic.

The runner character had even less interest.

****** Are you sure you're talking about the Wandering Inn? What I remember is that while Ryoka has ignored the leveling system, she's been very keen to learn magic when the opportunity has come up. There have been chapters where this is the main focus. And Erin was very disappointed to learn she doesn't have any innate magical talent. Maybe my memory sucks, but I don't really remember Erin just rejecting chances to learn magic because she didn't care.

******* So, I found the test you were talking about, which happened a few chapters after I stopped reading (two years ago, approximately.) I distinctly remember Pisces owing her quite a bit, and offering to teach her magic, and her saying magic is useless, but my memory must be wrong, because I can't find it.

The closest I could find was him offering his services (and potentially knowledge) to her to escape justice, and her quite naturally refusing to harbor a fugitive. Not quite the same thing.

She does have a mage owing her money for several chapters, and fails to ask for lessons, but I guess that was addressed after I gave up.

Thanks for the correction--I see I've been spreading misinformation.

** Hmmm, I know the sort of thing you mean, but I'm struggling to think of any stories that fit the bill...

Have you tried reading Quests? A look through [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/tags/ck2/][SV's CK2 tag]] will show +all+ *EDIT: most* of the quests using the CK2 system (which basically borrow the stats of Crusader Kings 2 and tend to use similar mechanics) might scratch your itch. Some are of course hot garbage, but a lot are very high quality writing in their own right.

I'll take a look through the threads I'm watching and see if I can make a list of good ones.

**** Here's the list. But first, here's a shorter list of disclaimers:

- Not all of these use the CK2 system - I went for anything that involves building an Empire, or I thought was likely to have the same "feel" to it.
- This is not an exhaustive list of all such threads on SV, and doesn't even touch those on SB (Spacebattles.com).
- The list is roughly ordered to group sequels and threads inspired by others together, but no great effort has been made.
- Only a few of these are completed. Most are incomplete, and most of those are sadly dead - QMing a Quest is apparently quite hard work.
- I've tried to trim away all the quests that only lasted for a few updates, but I may have missed a few.
- Quality is likely to vary between Top-Tier and Just-About-Good-Enough-I-Decided-To-Watch. As a vague indicator of quality, threads with many pages or sequels are likely to be above-average, as that indicates a larger/more active playerbase.
