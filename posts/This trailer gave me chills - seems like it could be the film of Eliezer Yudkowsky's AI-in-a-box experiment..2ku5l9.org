*** On the one hand, making it turn out he was the real person the whole time was kinda a cop-out. On the other hand, his acting and character were so fucking wooden I believed he was a robot long before they stuck electrodes to his dying head.

*** Is this a Hollywood film? Because what happens in /those/ is that they start out trying to make a genuine statement, and then just end up switching to an uberfascist Nazi cult that hates freedom.

** Hey, one more source of similar frisson is in this hard sci-fi book Echopraxia, by Peter Watts (author of the side-quel Blindsight).

Interesting trailer!

  The "dramatic" text at the start of the trailer is just silly. The rest is okay, but they could have done without the start. If you merge organics and machines, you don't get something godly, you get a down-grade. Organics are superior, but humanity is only about 0.01% of organic life's potential. People who assume we're the maximum potential also assume the only way to get more powerful is to use cybermods, but we're not anywhere near organic life's maximum. We still have 99.99% of the way to go on that front. I predict that cybermods will be very useful for a period of about 50 years, but then genemods will make cybermods and AI as obsolete as an abacus.

Why do I keep reading youtube comments. Please, someone put me out of my misery.

** If the video isn't availible in your country, search 'Ex Machina Trailer' and watch the item of your choice.

As for the film itself, I'm more excited than I was for /Transendence/.

** wow looks cool! I hope it comes to my country. I've got a few nitpicks with the premise though. why the need to put a super AI in an android body is it a Turing+ test? its both dangerous and unconformable to look at. if you need to, why give it enhanced mechanical strength instead of a weak body in case it needs to be restrained?
