** Great to see an update!

The real plan was a surprise to me and now I'm eager to find out how you resolve it. Keep up the good work.

** Just discovered this and read it in two days. More please. I think you're really good at provoking an emotional reaction, conveying things to the reader in between what's actually being said. I also like the analysis of the techniques and hope it produces some novel uses of simple techniques. That was always Naruto's true genius in combat, improvising

** Hi all. Long delay since the last chapter - Mae Culpa. I'll blame the shortage of interesting and exciting reviews here on reddit for my lack of inspiration :-p

It's a more explicitly rational chapter this time around, which I know some of you have been asking for, so I hope you guys like it. I totally forgot to mention this last time, but the story is intended to be a solvable mystery in the same way as HPMOR, so it should have been possible to figure out Zabuza and Haku's real plan. Did you see it coming, or was it a huge surprise? Was the reveal satisfying? Let me know in the comments!
