A fan translation of a story published in 1976 about a computer that starts to predict the text it's processing. Gave me strong GPT-2 vibes.


** An interesting, creepy story. Lem is a great author, one of my all-time favourites. The man had surprising insights.

** On the topic of Lem and natural language processing AIs... there's [[https://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Art/tensor.html][this]] hilarious poem that he has a computer compose in one of his stories when someone tries to trip it up by asking it write poetry on "love and tensor algebra".
