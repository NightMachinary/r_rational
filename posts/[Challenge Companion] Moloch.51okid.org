*tl;dr: This is the challenge companion thread, post recommendations, ideas, commentary, etc. below.*

First, read [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Meditations on Moloch]]. It's long and wide-ranging, but I always imagined the central thrust to be that many of the problems within any large organization (such as society) are caused by individual agents which are self-interested to the detriment of that larger organization. There's a lot more in there about counterbalancing forces to Moloch and how it might be defeated once and for all, and of course there have been a number of reaction pieces written in response to the article.

Personally, when I think of Moloch I think of the large corporations that I once worked for. For a period of about seven years, I was a contract software engineer, and I got to see inside a lot of enormous corporations with tens of thousands of employees. Some people have a tendency to view corporations as sleek, efficient machines which exist solely to maximize profit, but my view of them was eventually that of enormous, lurching creations which flail about inefficiently /even with rigorous controls to keep them from doing that/. While the corporation itself might exist to increase share value, the individuals within the corporation are largely unconcerned with that; they care about their performance reviews, or not getting yelled at by their boss, or gaining status with their co-workers, or displaying dominance, or a hundred other things that at best only serve as loose proxies for increasing share value and at worst are actively detrimental to the survival of the company. (For what it's worth, the few government projects I worked on were much the same.)

The best teams that I ever worked on were incredibly small ones where everyone was focused on the task at hand, and focused on the task for its own sake - but you can't actually run companies like that.


** I have a different take on the /Meditations/--I saw Moloch as the inexorable pressure on individuals to give up incrementally more of their terminal goals in exchange for instrumental advantages--because, as much as we'd like it to be otherwise, defecting in a zero-sum game often is the rational, superrational, or otherwise advisable real-world move.

*** This is my understanding also. Even in the context of Moloch as the evil personification of coordination problems, there wouldn't be a coordination problem in the first place if not for the exchange of terminal values for instrumental values. And because the exchange is even more difficult to reverse than to avoid in the first place, I'm reminded of the line from James Lowell via Unsong:

"They enslave their children's children who make compromise with sin."

[edit: line is from James Lowell, not William Blake.]

** Firstly, that article for sure deserves its own post. First time I've seen it on this subreddit and I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=moloch&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][searched for Moloch]] without seeing a previous post. Since it doesn't I do want to comment somewhat on it.

Secondly, and I can't figure out how to comment on the article and it's going to bug my if I don't say it anywhere, the article spells Britain as Britan.

Thirdly the conclusion of the article seems to be to fight Moloch you need a) in a world where singularities do exist and happen to create one that perfectly fits "Elua" or b) switch back to absolute monarchies with random citizen inherit rules such that random chance will hopefully stop us ending in the sea (which all other routes seem to lead).

Fourthly, behavioural economics (and all of micro economics really), this subreddit really needs to read into it. So much stuff from the nonsense balisisk (incredible threat) mentioned in this post to basically the entire rest of the content, be it the free rider or tragedy of the commons.

Fifthly, I'm very curious as to how people will actually write a prompt for this as a description of human history (imagined into the future) sure sounds like it would be apt. While you mention that your company experience is the prime example now that I know the name for this Pareto inefficiency it seems like Moloch is everywhere and that knowledge is nigh useless in relevancy.

Sixthly, kind of weird in the article that they named names and seemed to expect the reader to be aware of who they were. As well as including tweets and similar things, kind of struck me as odd. Perhaps the article could be made more clean, more readily shareable if the author had paraphrased or entirely built up the other viewpoints without specifying people. Maybe that's just my preference though.

*** Despite the fact that Moloch is one of his most popular articles, I'm not sure that Scott Alexander intended for it to be the first SSC article that you share with someone. At least to myself, it feels like part of a dialogue (which feeling might be heightened by knowing that there are other posts out there that were written explicitly in response to Moloch).

Certainly, most if not all of his audience would be familiar with e.g. Nick Land to some degree, and I wouldn't be surprised if Scott had been writing for his present audience first and for a hypothetical unfamiliar-with-his-works audience second.

********* I think democracy is frankly retarded; all standard arguments of medain voters, bystander effect and rational ignorence etc.

but lets focus on a nonstandard one, what if democracy enabled total war? I know the standard narrative but here an alternative one; the great experiment in democracy first move was to bring back the full ulgyness of slavery to a western culture, its 2nd move was to cling desperately to it when the super power in the world(i.e. Britain) looked at it and was like "fuck that" and made it not profitable in the hopes it would mostly end what had been already dying out for century's

Then north wanted something or other /but/ not the end of slavery(otherwise they wouldn't have been delivering runaways back for decades, you don't suddenly go form -100 to 100) it really doesn't matter what cause it, but something caused the first prototype of total war (13 separate nations in two loose allegiances with the majority of a content picking a side) and democracy still was only extending voting to white men at this point

After this wild success Europe wanted in and we then get into arguably the stupidest war ever, because one guy got assassinated a domino effect caused 38 million to die and an unfair treaty get signed

That treaty lead directly to the stupidest war ever part 2 the 60 million.

America unhappy that it only got one bombing looked around for the next big fight and happily found russia and they kept upping their dick measurement contest till they both almost killed all of humanity, but before that happened russia luckly had a heart attack

So with the current situation today is america keeps on the lookout for someone even bigger to fight but luckly again the only guy bigger is china and they seem very happy with peace. But that won't keep america down they need new conflicts so they because the world biggest arms dealer and keeps selling to "freedom fighters" in the hopes a few win their battles and become dictators

Can you name something worse then slavery and total/nuclear war that monarchy's do cause I can't?

********** You don't need to remind me of the standard arguments against democracy (median voter, rational ignorance, etc.); I largely agree with them, and I'm desperately searching for any better system of government. But, what about the standard arguments against monarchy - what if the king's a fool, what if the king's a greedy fool, what if the king's a naive idealist, etc.?

Or what if the king (or his advisors) is jealous of his neighbors and wants a total war? Wasn't that essentially what happened with Germany and Russia in WWI? You can blame it on the greed and pride of monarchs at least as readily as on democracy. I'd be willing to hear an argument blaming democracy (specifically the French Revolution) for starting the trend toward total war, but now that it's been loosed upon the world, even monarchs need to take it by the horns or be destroyed.

*********** Oh I'm an an-cap(far to the "left" of the standard an-cap position though); I don't think we need rigid government, a decentralized contracting system should work nicely(criminality is rare and cops don't exactly show up in time, that whole fear of "anarchy is chaos" should be thrown out) <insert the standard an-cap rant and links here>

What I think we really need is "Agorism" a culture of when you dislike a system, to just ignore it and start your own. You find new "molock"s in every new one sure but in theory so long as we can change systems we should always be able to move forward, killing molocks as we go

************ Sorry; I was assuming you were some sort of reactionary!

I'd love anarcho-capitalism if it worked... but I'm afraid it won't without much more social cohesion than we have in the modern West. A village or even town as a whole can do the job of the police, but hired protection agencies can't be relied on because /[insert the standard statist arguments here]/. And individual criminality - against your in-group - is probably rare, but what about crimes against other groups in society? With society essentially breaking down around us - as both conservatives and progressives agree, though the latter are more likely to call it "breaking down the walls of privilege" - can we rely on inter-group violence to remain rare? Sure, each group can hire its own protection agencies, but that's civil war.

Yes, I agree that people need to be much more free to try their own mini-societies. Let a thousand systems blossom; let the fundamentalist Mormons have their compound next to the fundamentalist SJW's and fundamentalist Yarvin-Landists in Scott's Archipelago, and let each tend their own vine and fig tree in their own manner. But is it not easier to do this with an overarching police to keep each from going to war against each other?

What exactly do you think the state does? The fed prints money so the banks con the middle class, the poor ask for hand out that come out of taxes, the rich write thick legalese to undermine anything close to sensible law to socialize neg externalities and capture pos, and the middle class write insane labor laws to prevent the poor from competing, all the while war is a thing that goes directly on the youngs debt sheet.

I don't have time to really get into this, but no, it wasn't. Some wars can be blamed on greed or jealousy. The partitioning of Poland is a decent example of this, from what I know. And if, as a non-historian, I'm wrong about that particular one, there are others. WWI isn't really close to being one of them, though.

**** Well I don't really like either of those options. With singularities you have to rush to make the first one otherwise you rely on someone else, but rushing makes yours less likely to be perfect.

For the monarchy I actually like the idea of Saudi Arabia. From a western point of view they seem pretty shit but for satisfying Elua of Muslims how are they doing? It seems to me that apart from failing to export their values enough Saudi Arabia is as great as it can be. Of course in a world with Western cultural dominance it may be completely unsustainable.

I also think the owg with a single government doesn't work as soon as other intelligences exist as then it's back to having two countries and one not spending on military

** That's a very insightful and thought-provoking article.

I particularly liked the point that the system /actively stifles/punishes/outcompetes individuals who want to change the rules/. The whole, "Be the change you want to see in the world" is a noble idea - but expect the world to push back.

I was a little disappointed by its treatment of religion, which was mostly spoken about in the context of encouraging its members to have more children. Consider this angle instead: religions typically encourage their members to value others' wellbeing, thus working against Moloch at the grassroots level, and Abrahamic religions anticipate a future perfect monarch, which would defeat Moloch completely (just as a secular humanist might anticipate a future perfect AI).
