I wonder what the Ice Assafins were trying to do with the ritual, given that they're on the side of the fleshbags. Why would they need power over Herun, what would/will they do with it that fleshies wouldn't?

Anyway, neat chapter.

** Yay, I called part of it!

I was expecting them to take a bit longer to learn that Loki was working with Afi, but dramatic irony on that scale is hard to get right.

They have to apply the /permanency/ before the bond wears off, right? It lasts 10 minutes per caster level, so... yeah it's probably gonna be up for a few days or something ridiculous like that. Still, the Gods will know about the Bond if they see Jake permanencing it, won't they?

The only workaround I can see is to try and slip the trigger words naturally into conversation. "We really need un-eavesdroppable communication with our soldiers in the field. How many /Permanencio Telepathic Bond/s can we rustle up?" Or just say it really quietly; if the scrying port is far away from Jake's mouth, they won't hear him if he whispers, right?

** Given the prospect of an unbreakable telepathic bond with this creature, I'd be trying to flip his alignment with a certain cursed piece of headgear ASAP. My guess is Thomas would at least want to try this. Could win him points with Shailos if it works. Especially if the rest of the remaining Ice Assassins (whose interests Herrún would be inclined towards) could be flipped as well.

I wonder how the commands to serve Original Afi's interests, etc. would interact with the alignment change? Would they be reinterpreted to be as Good as possible, or are they part of the alignment, such that they would be inverted?

Can Programmed Amnesia be used to alter Bone-Clone directives, as a headache cure etc? Seems a little too easy (I'd think Afi would have tried, using mindscrape to get rid of the kill-Afi bit if he could), but worth a thought.

Can promises not to kill Original Afi (subject to reasonable conditions) and help free him from avatar-ism, etc. be used to manipulate the Icefi's into highly advantageous things they wouldn't otherwise go for, like volunteering for an alignment flip? (Even with Afi being Evil himself, a Neutral Herrún sounds more in his interests to serve than Nekos, and Afissassins seem like they would be willing to put up with a lot to try and achieve that.)

Since opposite alignment is technically a curse, would Herrún's gratitude make her want to free the originally-Evil victims, or would she see it as good-for-them (as they see it, afterward)?

I'm also curious how Jake would be affected by Helm of Opposite Alignment... Evil deontologist? :-)

The Unreadable Library is so obviously up Herrún's alley that I could see it becoming her temple -- I figured chessmaster Loki did this on purpose, all the more to get on her good side (and serve his own amusement at the same time). The books are basically holy items for her right off the bat, being packed with secret information like that. On the other hand, the library also might be a good living space for the people, albeit a little cramped. Could work as both, especially if we decide to have millions of clerics. (There's no limit, right?) And Herrún should be able to manifest and do miracles there since it is her temple.

The book shelves are conveniently big enough for bunk beds. There is electricity. Since it's a library, I'm thinking there is air conditioning / humidity control as well. Tricks like the commoner railgun and the shops aren't magic, so they probably work inside. Can shops work for waste disposal?

I'm curious as to whether Improved Shrink Item would work on the altars without disrupting the ritual. Maybe connect them with beams and shrink as one object if the proportional distance is what matters.

Do shrunk items expand the moment they enter a magic-free zone? If so, the anti-magic spell might be kind of hazardous around shrunk items. If not, I wonder if the shrink spell can be canceled inside such a zone / undoing magic still works.

Compressed gas can certainly exist without magic, and can be created by magic easily, so if an air supply is needed in the library, it can be done. Hopefully, intelligent!Jake is up to the engineering needed for safety. Probably the hardest thing in the long run is security against accidental and deliberate bombs and other nonmagical threats that can wipe out a city. Divine protection from Herrún might help, since miracle (I guess, as long as it isn't "divine magic") isn't magical. Also, skills and stats can work without magic, so maybe we can have ultra-lucky/wise/prescient guards or something.

Can these books become magic items when a deity blesses them? Just being immune /to/ magic doesn't mean they can't themselves /be/ magical, right? So if Herrún wants the books to become holy armor or something (when used outside templebrarytown where magic is okay), she could change their nature to a magic one (assuming Loki isn't too insistent to the contrary -- I'm betting he won't want to let them be made stretchy/big/readable). An item that makes you insanely good at guessing knowledge or concealing information would be a good thing to try and get Herrún to create, domain-wise. (Maybe a concealment effect could get double bonus from Loki and Herrún, him being a deceiver.) Tome of Secrecy?

Oh, just thought of something kind of important. Isaac the wizard knows how to make antimatter. That should be wiped for safety ASAP. Hopefully the dark gods didn't read it off him.

Can we use PAO to make a condensed summary or larger print copy /of/ the Loki books? Seems like that avoids using magic /on/ the books, without making the PAO refer to arbitrarily generated information. (I'm guessing this is still in "paper containing the phylactery location" territory -- PAO cannot generate secret information. Or maybe it's an indirect use of magic on the books?)

Oh hey, what about using PAO to make a /planet/ to teleport people to? For safety and Herrún favor points, put it on the opposite side of the sun so no one knows about it. Since e.g cities can't work with PAO, it could be a featureless world (big rock) at first, but magic could terraform it pretty fast.

Maybe consecrate the whole thing as a holy site to a Good deity, say Arros, and fill the oceans with holy water and such (cover it with holy symbols maybe) to prevent the undead from ever colonizing... Then get to work on universal resurrection, with opposite alignment curses ready for any evil people...

As always, thanks for a great story and endless munchkinly amusement :)

In order for that to be a worthwhile bargaining chip, there would have to be a plausible scenario whereby Our Heroes could kill Afi. There currently isn't; the only one that might even possibly have worked (Jake's 'Take off and nuke em from orbit' plan) got sacrificed to Herrún so he can't think of it.

Heh. That would be a sight to see, wouldn't it?

No, Jake stands outside the alignment and XP system. He has no alignment, cannot earn XP, etc. This is why he can't be resurrected by normal means, and why he will never gain a character level.

Hm. Well, I will point out that Jake had a Shrink Item'd cannon sewed into his trenchcoat when they were fighting their way through the sea of undead. Shortly after he threw it, the Landguard put up antimagic. If Jake had had any /other/ Shrink Item'd stuff in his coat, it didn't grow. Of course, it wasn't stated that he did have any other shrunken stuff....

** I've been wondering...

In the opening chapters you described that in Flobovia (still a stupid name) there are quite a many different sentient races.

#+begin_quote
  People of what seemed like a hundred races went past, just going about their business. Many of them were races I was familiar with---elves, dwarves, halflings, some half-breeds---but many were completely unfamiliar; eight-foot bipedal scaly types with huge yellow snake eyes and four-inch talons on hands and feet, furry five-foot-high starfish creatures who were so shaggy it was hard to make out any details, two-torsoed centauroids, the torsoes facing in opposite directions but each with an excessively long, flexible neck that would allow them to turn to face each other, and dozens of other species.
#+end_quote

But that was the first and last time, I think, you mentioned the diversity of population. Since they didn't seem to be on each other's throats all the time I assume the different kinds of people live intermingled or next door to each, with a fair bit of tolerance and respect for each other.

But your narration makes it seem as if Flobovia is a human saturated state, not a mention of other kinds of people in any position of power or public life whatsoever. That may be a case of Jake being an unreliable narrator, but, well... it seems odd. It could also be the case that positions of power /are/ only for humans and all the other people are there for flavouring the Stupidworld.

*** Yeah, this is something I haven't really gotten into -- too focused on other parts of the plot. Suffice to say, race relations in Flobovia are complicated. There's a bunch of history behind it but it hasn't been relevant to what was happening onscreen.

Part of the problem is that Jake has interacted with very few people, honestly, and most of them high officials. Flobovia still runs on a feudal structure, meaning there's relatively little turnover among the ruling families, and it's hard for newcomers to break into the upper ranks. Flobovia was originally founded by refugees from one part of southern Ainaalacar when it splintered apart during the last Zombocalypse. The refugees were led by a human; she needed to build a government quickly, and she needed people she trusted to fill the government slots. Predictably, she mostly chose family and close friends. As in the real world, most peoples' closest friends are members of their own race, meaning that the initial government of the fledging nation was primarily human.

Over the next few decades / centuries, plenty of other refugees showed up, of all races. They slotted into the society with greater or lesser degrees of comfort and many of them became significant members of society...but the top ranks were still almost entirely human.

And it's not just the officials themselves -- even many of their servants are hereditary positions that can trace their origins back to the founding of the nation. Remember that Suze grew up in the castle; she's actually related to most of the people who live there, including many of the nobles. (Making the whole "call the servant to your room" thing even squickier.)

There is no law against other races holding high office, but it just doesn't happen that much. It's something of a glass ceiling -- no one necessarily intends to do it, it just happens as a result of nearly invisible social conditioning and expectations.

I never said that Flobovia was perfect...or even a nice place.

*** Albrecht made it look like he was using a Wish to transport them all home. Wish is the most powerful arcane spell there is, and it costs 5000 XP to cast. With such a high cost, using it for mere transportation is utterly wasteful -- it would be like take an Apache helicopter to travel a few blocks. The only reason you would do that would be if the cost was so small compared to your resources that you couldn't be bothered using something more efficient. In other words, it was a subtle demonstration of enormous power.

It was also a complete scam. He didn't actually use a Wish -- they had a Teleportation Circle prepared and, when he pretended to cast the Wish, everyone simply stepped backwards into the Circle, thereby being transported back to base. Teleportation Circle is a dismissible spell so, once they were at their destination, the wizard who created the Circle turned it off so that no Flobovians would accidentally wander into it and give the game away. What Jake found in the cobblestones was the powdered amber that is the material component of the spell.

Apparently that was not as clear as I had thought. Sorry about that.
