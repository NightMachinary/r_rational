** That scene with Uriel and Moses may be my new favorite scene in the story. I'm not sure it quite manages to beat out Aaron and Ana's first meeting, but it's at least close.

(Also, this is Chapter 17, not 16.)

** According to Uriel, frogs never help. Was there some previous problem for which frogs were tried unsuccessfully?

** Sohu confirmed as the Comet King's daughter (Cometspawn is a strange name for them). We know that she's the youngest, but is she the most recently born? She has been eight years old for about ten years at this point, and it was written that she's youngest /by virtue of/ her agelessness.

For reference, most of this takes place one month before the discovery of the Vital Name. Sohu's part was almost six months after she was made immortal.

** Okay, I think this chapter sets it: the world we're being shown is a simulation. Uriel is an admin for this world, though it was created by someone else ("God"). All the programming terms Uriel is using are funny, and I may be able to laugh them off if it turns out to not be a simulation, but by this point it just makes more sense.

*** "A simulation" implies there's a reality that is being approximated. I think this is just a computational world that happens to be configurable at a low level.

If this is a simulation, then the territory is a map of itself.

That is very kabbalistically appropriate, then. The entire cosmic architecture, self-referential through the form of Adam Kadmon.
