** This is a romance story about a WW2 deserter and a high-status vampire; there's (hopefully) very thorough and detailed worldbuilding in this story, and don't worry, there's not a quivering member to be seen.

This is a longer chapter than the last one that gives a bit more worldbuilding and character development. Let us know what you think!

Another interlude is on track to be released in two week's time; we're about to start final edits on Chapter 3 to be released the first weekend of May.

*** Still enjoying the story.

I don't mean to be too presumptuous, but I noticed a couple of things if you're interested.

#+begin_quote
  "But this one is excellent.” He said, silently closing the chest.
#+end_quote

That should probably be

#+begin_quote
  "But this one is excellent," he said, etcetera.
#+end_quote

And

#+begin_quote
  "I don't think my work is not worth quite so much, sir.”
#+end_quote

The "not" seems to be out of place here.

If you'll tolerate a more abstract criticism:

#+begin_quote
  And now, after working in her hotel for three months and seeing how perfectly suited this young woman seemed to be to running it, he'd become etcetera.
#+end_quote

That sentence feels just a bit clunky. If I might be so bold, I'd recommend something more like "after working in her hotel for three months and seeing how perfectly suited to running it this young woman seemed to be, he'd etcetera." The sentence as you've written it is probably grammatically correct, it just feels /off/.

Those three things probably only caught my eye because of how well the rest of it is written, and the last of the three is probably subjective (though I really do feel like it's breaking a "rule" that I don't know the name of, something to do with the subject of the sentence being the hotel). I'm definitely looking forward to more.

**** If I were going to rewrite the sentence about Paola's skill running the hotel, I'd probably go with something like "And now, after working in her hotel for three months and seeing how perfectly suited she was to running it..." I see how your suggested alternative fixes the "to...to", but I think Paola herself should take center stage in the syntax, rather than the hotel. Though I guess it's the authors' preference that matters, not mine!

#+end_quote

Absolutely, but I feel like there's nothing wrong with the hotel being the subject of the sentence in the first place. It just seems ambiguous whether "how suited she seemed to be to running it" is "correct" grammatically, and "how suited to running it she seemed to be" seems unambiguously "correct" grammatically, and whether or not that grammatical structure is a matter of preference also seems ambiguous.

#+end_quote

The only thing worse than having your flaws pointed out is having your flaws not be pointed out and allowed to continue existing, or something! So we'll always and forever be interested in feedback.

#+begin_quote
  grammar on quotations
#+end_quote

Yeah, I've always struggled with this. I know the convention in English /seems/ to be that you just put a ',' at the end of quotations all the time, but I feel like if the text in the quotation is a finished sentence, it should end with a full stop?

We have an "editor" (read: my partner who goes through every chapter with a red pen before it's posted), and he highlights every time we do that without fail. I've not made those edits because I have this stubborn opinion as above, but I'm open to changing it (I've started using emdashes now, for example). Is there something I'm missing? Why did you flag the comma on that particular passage and none of the others?

#+begin_quote
  The "not" seems to be out of place here.
#+end_quote

Cheers, that was a typo that we missed! Fixed.

#+begin_quote
  That sentence feels just a bit clunky.
#+end_quote

Thanks! Inside baseball: that scene was actually written and added in the last week (while one of us had the flu, no less), so it hadn't been edited as thoroughly as the others had and I think it shows in a lot of places as you noticed...

I like [[/u/ceruleantresses]] suggested edit and I've put that in. The sentence (passage, really) is about Paola rather than the hotel. It does de-emphasise the fact that Red is surprised that someone with the qualities {young,woman} is a good hotelier, but that's not completely forgotten.

Thanks for your feedback and especially thanks for the kind words!

#+end_quote

I wholeheartedly agree. I'd personally rather know than not know, and I think a lot of people feel the same. I feel like it's a bad sign when a creator takes personal offense to having legitimate errors pointed out.

#+begin_quote
  I feel like if the text in the quotation is a finished sentence, it should end with a full stop?
#+end_quote

Not if it's dialogue. Even if it ends in a question mark, the "he" is still part of the same sentence and should never be capitalized. "He said, silently closing the chest" isn't a full sentence, it's connected to the previous dialogue.

#+begin_quote
  "This is a finished sentence," he said.
#+end_quote

And not

#+begin_quote
  "This is a finished sentence." He said.
#+end_quote

The dialogue tag is never not included in the same sentence as the dialogue.

****** Then we've made that error all through the chapter, correct? You just only quoted one example?

Some examples:

#+begin_quote
  “Shouldn't be a problem.” He hesitated. “Sir.” He added, still not feeling right speaking so casually to a guest.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  “I would like a quite fine trunk if you see one, and I would hate you not to be able to purchase it.” He said, simply.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  “Thank you.” Red finally said. He carefully placed the wad of money into his pocket, etc
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  “Maybe.” Red didn't know how to begin deciding.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  “Glad you like it.” Red said, trying not to smile.
#+end_quote

I won't keep quoting them, but you get the idea: you reckon I should edit all of the above to have commas instead?

I always thought that 'logically' it should be:

"The thing is, there's a lot of times I start to say something and," I paused, trying to remember the next part of my sentence. "It always seems like I forget how I want to finish."

and:

"It would be great if I could have a jar of olives." I asked, grinning eagerly. "Oh, and how did your job interview go last week?"

It this just a case of 'grammar is weird, you put commas everywhere for /reasons/', or is there something I'm missing?

******* It's mostly "you put commas everywhere /for reasons/," except "/for reasons/" implies it's arbitrary and it really boils down to

#+begin_quote
  "Red finally said."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "He said, simply."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "Red said, trying not to smile."
#+end_quote

aren't actually sentences, they're fragments unless you use a comma to connect them to the dialogue they follow.

I didn't notice most of the other ones. However, the first one and the fourth one aren't errors. "He hesitated" isn't a dialogue tag, it's an action beat. It functions on its own as a complete sentence.

******** I think I understand now! I was mostly confused why you only brought up one of the mistakes, but if they're (almost) all mistakes then that makes sense and finally someone's explained it in a way I understand.

I'll try and fix them up for next chapter for sure, and I might go through and fix these ones when I have time.

Thanks again!

** Of the two, I find William's POV more fun to read, but I'm also enjoying the way Red's parts showcase how bizarre William's courtship is from a mortal perspective.

Also fairly certain the side of the trunk with the man throwing the disqus is fake somehow. Maybe the actual image is sensitive somehow and had to be covered up, or maybe the false side hides a hidden compartment or something? The dread Red felt before opening it is interesting too--magic, or maybe some kind of mortal-specific "basilisk" embedded in the design? I'm pretty curious about this trunk.

*** I think the "fear aura" is part of a test. It's not the chest itself, but the shopkeeper exerting some of her vampiric influence on Red. She's been around long enough to know the styles of the various vampires who live there and knows her products well enough to immediately know which is the highest quality.

The test is not just whether he will pick out the highest quality one that matches his master's tastes, but whether he is willing and able to act in his master's interests when being influenced by outside sources. Once he opened the chest, he had "passed", so there was no need to continue the effect.

** Is that space-warping magic I'm seeing mentioned +twice+ thrice now? And perception-altering magics as well? I'm interested in where magic in this story is going!

Obviously-a-Vampire-place is obvious, but cool! I'm wondering why William brought him there originally, only to have him go back without him the next day to buy him a trunk. Couldn't he have just got it there that day? Seems rather strange to not have Red comment on it, or is this more common than I realize? Perhaps William was showing Red off?

Also, Red is adorable. I'm wondering why William is doing his fancy a-lot-more-than-flower-code at him. Habit? Hoping he'll pick it up? Probably habit.

Can't wait for the next interlude!

#+end_quote

I'm glad to hear that! Do note that it's primarily a romance story, so the magic is going to be in the backdrop. But there's a lot of very interesting stuff in there for you to notice, if you're looking for it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

There's a few reasons that could be relevant:

- The shop isn't open at night / the shopkeeper doesn't like serving vampires

- William wants to mark Red as his "property", and taking him out where other vampires will presumably see him is one way of doing that

- William wants the chest he buys to be 'secret', so sends an unknown agent of his to do the purchasing

- William wants to see if Red is any good at shopping

- William wants to test Red's mettle: so to see if Red gets freaked out by relatively large-scale supernatural things (e.g. the music/weird people) and/or if he's intimidated by weird shopkeepers

- Buying stuff is /low status/; what vampire of William's age would debase themself so?

I'll leave it to you to pick which of those you like best/believe, or to come up with others.

As to why Red doesn't find it odd: he's spent the last 2-3 months working in a hotel that caters more-or-less exclusively to vampires. His definition of "odd" when it comes to eccentric rich people is different from most.

#+begin_quote
  Also, Red is adorable.
#+end_quote

He is! He is so pure. Come June and/or July you'll get a good dose of more adorableness / potentially we will reach 'peak adorable'.

#+begin_quote
  Can't wait for the next interlude!
#+end_quote

Hope it lives up to your expectations! It's edited so we'll post it on the 14th or the 21st, and Chapter 3 on the 5th of May as long as we get it edited in time. *nervous chittering*
