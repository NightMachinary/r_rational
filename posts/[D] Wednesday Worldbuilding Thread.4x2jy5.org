Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}

** Radiohumans. Humanity evolved with the ability to communicate radio signals with each other, generating radio traffic and such.

I don't have even rudimentary knowledge of radio physics, but I imagined that it will have profound effect on civilization.

Human beings will have to organize and solve problem regarding radio interference in a town, for example.

Ancient warfare also involved electronic warfare, with radio screamers disrupting communication on the other side. Combat is much more fluid with real-time coordination being done by radio.

Technology will advance faster simply due to more communication.

Some humans will figure out how to communicate using the ionosphere, creating a global communication network even before the age of sail.

*** I think the effect might not be as profound as you think. It's just ordinary talking, except "louder" - you can be radio-heard at longer ranges.

Radio waves are not unlike sound waves. They decay following the inverse-square law, and are also naturally deflected or absorbed by certain materials. Waves pass through one another, interfering but not interacting. Probably the biggest difference is that radio is effectively instantaneous while sound is limited to ~300m/s.

I said radio was longer-range than sound, but that really depends on how "loud" it is and how sensitive your "hearing" is. Depending on exactly how it works, the effective range could be, well, anything. For all I know it could be shorter-range than talking. Longer-range isn't necessarily better, either - as you know, if a large crowd all tries to talk at once then you'll be drowned out at more than a few centimetres. That effect would be much worse if your hearing was good enough to pick up noise from an entire city.

Another question is how wide the bandwidth that people can perceive, and how well they can distinguish between similar frequencies. The more sounds you can distinguish, the better you can pick out one person's voice from a crowd.

I don't think we'd see electronic warfare or battlefield-wide coordination, at least no more or less than we do in reality. Screaming at the enemy is not known to disrupt their conversation.

At least there aren't many natural sources of radio waves. I think it's just lightning bolts. No need for "ear protection" when doing, say, construction work.

*** Ouch. Some first impressions:

- Human bodies are equipped with some magical HAM radios? You have to pick the scope of the power before doing anything else.

  - Do you basically just want to write a story where all humans are telepathic without saying telepathy?
  - Radio technology is mostly used to transmit sound. If we had the ability to communicate on the radio since birth (or before), would our languages even use sound? Seems unlikely, depending on how the magic works.
  - If humans have this ability, did we evolve it? Were we granted it through divine intervention (or aliens)? If we evolved it, to what extent can other animals use this? How does that affect animal-human relations?
  - Even though we knew about radios and how they work, it took us a lot of time and theoretical plasma physics research to even attempt to use the ionosphere as a reflector for sending messages across the horizon. Even if we discovered it through trial and error, what makes you think any human body could produce the kind of transmitting/receiving power necessary to make this work?
  - Lastly, even though humans can currently hear more than one conversation at a time, we have a very hard time actually interpreting them and carrying out two conversations simultaneously. The sort of mass communication/coordination in battle that you're thinking of would be very hard to achieve through magic telepathy. In the middle of a pitched battle between two armies, the only difference between the light and sound is how easily light can propagate through it. Even then, if you put a bunch of radio transceivers in one place and have them all try to communicate with each other at the same time, you get the same problems than if you have a bunch of people in a room (or a battlefield) together and have them yell at the same time.

In conclusion: how would you make this different than having super-hearing, and how would you get around human processing power limitations?

**** From the conversation on the discord server, I can answer some of these.

There was discussion about the possible non-development of audible language. There wasn't a conclusion, that I saw anyway. Personally, I think the development of audible language is still probable, but I may be misjudging it.

While the reason why humans develop radio-hearing is magical (Or at least, we haven't figured out how or why humans would evolve it. There was some mention of this being on another planet with more metal-rich surface soil, but it was still supposed to be about humans? So I don't know.), exactly how we radio-hear is not. I believe the general consensus was that humans have four antennae embed in their humeri and radii bones, with a couple bundles of electroceptive neurons in the elbow, and stacks of current-generating muscles in the upper torso.

I don't know the science behind how much energy it would take, being filtered through the human metabolic process, to generate a particular amplitude or frequency of radio waves. Abstractly, I assume the maximum amplitudes and frequency would be subject to improvement through training, under the model of the it being powered by muscular action.

The ability to disrupt other people's communication (and in particular, only /other/ people's) is probably fantastical, yes. But does mean that, in the future when radio technology external to the human body arises, it becomes another thing that could be disrupted, along with audio-hearing and sight.

***** This is really interesting.

I was thinking about how difficult it would be to biologically produce currents complicated enough to encode audio information in, but then realized that I was comig at this from the wrong angle. The problem isn't "let's make an organism that can support a literal radio," it's "given an organism that can power two arm antennae and transmit through them: can it develop an effective language?" I think the answer is... /"Maybe?"/

Firstly, I think the sensitivity functions for humans would be highly variable, depending on arm length (pending a radio expert to confirm this is how antennae work), and may even homogenize height in successful civilizations. Depending on how sharply peaked (i.e. limited to a certain range of frequencies) the sensitivity functions are, you may get isolated settlements being unable to really radiotalk to each other. That would be like finding a group of people who speak in ultrasound!

Second, if we have dynamically rearrangeable antennae as transceivers... I don't really know enough about radio communication to say anything, but I can imagine you'd get some interesting things happening. I /think/ that having frequency modulation happen via arm movement would be the easiest way to get a simple biocircuit to be able to transmit enough information to have a meaningful language.

A fun point to think about, if speaking/listening require us to rearrange our antennae, the phrase "body language" takes on a whole new meaning.

Maybe some improvement on an individual's loudness and frequency range can be made through practice, but we can only do that with our voices because the system is so deliciously complicated. I fear that an implementation of the current-generating muscles that is complicated enough to work like human voices would be unrealistic to the point of being indistinguishable from a black box. As an aside, I'm under the impression that most researchers are baffled by the cochlea and would love to have a radio equivalent.

I'm still geeking out over this and I hate it.

Writing in multiversal 'everything including the kitchen sink' settings are a lot like writing original settings - a setting where anything can happen and anyone can turn up, basically contains the same complete absence of information as a featureless void. You have to make the same decisions of what you include, what you don't include, etc. that you would if you were just straight up writing original fiction. Having everything in a setting means your setting is very poorly defined.

Another setting that does the same sort of thing (multiversal setting that includes everything and has basically no fanfiction) is the Chronicles of Amber (where literally all imaginable worlds exist, including Alice in Wonderland and Arthurian Myth).

** I've been thinking about my vampires a lot this week, though I've never shared anything in a worldbuilding thread before. They're part of a roleplaying universe I co-created, so it's not rational per sae but I like to make it 'as rational as possible'.

The vampires are pretty typical, burning in the sun, needing to be invited into human dwellings, etc. They can also create ghouls by feeding them vampire blood, and humans who are fed upon become addicted to the rush of being eaten from, so many vampires keep a 'herd' of humans who are so addicted.

I've been thinking about their society. I definitely want them to have very rigid customs and social norms, with huge symbolism (e.g. the exact shade of red of the shirt you wear to a meeting has a very particular meaning). They also have a gift-giving culture, where you give gifts to your superiors and inferiors, again with heavy symbolism. For example, a vampire character incorrectly thought someone else was a vampire and gave her a suite of gifts. She didn't accept an ancient warhammer that had belonged to his grandson because she thought it was too extravagant a gift; naturally, the vampire took the refusal of the gift as an indication that she rejects his lineage and does not believe he is able to fight with his own two hands.

Also, vampires, being better than humans in strength, speed, etc I feel are also naturally better at thinking. They get stronger the older they are, and so I think they should get smarter the older they are.

With that background, here's my notes on vampire society in general. I'd love any criticism, input, expansions, or corollaries you guys might be able to input. In particular, given how intelligent vampires are, I can't figure out why they haven't just scienced the shit out of everything centuries ago and now we live in a post-singularity world.

- As vampires are naturally quite vicious and ruthless, prehistoric vampire society was kill or be killed, vicious.

- As time went on, society became more rigid. Enforced rules of politeness and restraint allowed vampires to function without killing each other.

- These rules became more and more complicated due to a vampire's high cognitive capacity, with different shades of meaning encoded in gifts, letters, handwriting, clothing, etc.

- Part of their dispute resolution process does involve combat. This is because they are stubborn and proud. Usually, the threat of death is enough to make one of the vampires reneg; in fact, that's generally how these things go.

- They tend to have a meritocracy/gerontocracy where the oldest and therefore wisest run the show. As a result, everyone likes to imply that they are older than they are.

- The rules and mores of vampire society spread easily, as vampires live a long time and have long memories.

- Vampires have art and music, far beyond anything a mortal can comprehend. One of the most famous vampire-composed operas goes for two straight weeks, and has over a hundred characters. There are shades of foreshadowing and meaning that slowly crystallise together, mostly by the viewer's own intuition; everything is implied very loosely and delicately.

- Some vampires are also interested in science; most modern scientific and technological advances were made by vampires, ghouls working on behalf of vampires, or were “accidentally discovered” (penicillin) because of vampires.

They're ancient and mostly set in their ways. With their long lifespans, they don't much /like/ change and tend to nostalgically yearn for the "good old days" before all this pollution and overpopulation and other negative consequences of civilisation. While some of them do scientific research, and tend to discover things first, they are reluctant to share these things with mortals (on the basis that mortals already took the internal combustion engine and wrecked the countryside with it).

Also, humans dramatically outnumber them. A vampire may create an elegant design that works brilliantly and build (say) his own personal supercomputer - but their tendency to secrecy means that he'll only build one, for his own use; he won't build ten thousand and sell them (and hence vampires would never invent the internet). And he'll likely treat it as a mere curiousity, and not share the design with the other vampires (perhaps thinking they'll have more fun figuring out how it was done than if he tells them). Net result? A couple of hundred human scientists communicating and sharing results will outpace any amount of vampires, given long enough. (However, the vampires also get to read the humans' communication, so their technology is consistently about a decade more advanced than what anyone else has got - two decades when it comes to environmental friendliness).

******** [[/itsnotmyblood][]] Fortunately, My Vampires Are Different - turning someone into a vampire can't happen by accident. You have to basically open their chest, vomit a weird blood-like paste into their heart, and leave them out of the sun for a day or two in order for it to work. So very few new ones get made, thankfully. It's mostly young ones wanting to create peers so they can hunt in packs for protection from their elders, or vampires who want to keep a friend or lover with them.

The other big problem I'm having with my vampires is they have three distinct food sources:

1) People they hunt and kill in the traditional vampirey way

2) What we've named jannisaries, who are addicted to the experience of being fed on, since it releases endorphins, adreneline, etc in humans. Typical sort of addict personality. They usually continue to live their own lives and just seek the vampire out for scheduled feedings. Some vampires will eat from them unsustainably, but the wisest ones know roughly how much they can get away with taking, though this still shortens the jannisaries life span.

3) Ghouls, humans who have been fed vampire blood and gain up to a max of, say, 10% of the vampire's strength/healing ability over the course of several months before reaching a plateau. The vampire blood makes them completely subservient to the vampire. Vampires can feed from ghouls, and though they require a few drops of blood every day or so, canonically, at least, in my mind, a vampire can feed from a ghoul more than often enough to counteract this modest loss.

What I'm trying to figure out is - why would a vampire not just make a herd of ghouls, keep them in a basement somewhere, and feed from them? Why have jannisaries at all? Jannisarries are uncontrolled, often unpredictable, and have been known to attack vampires to force them to feed. They are a security breach. And yet, vampires for some reason seem to have a lot of them. Ghouls are better in every way.

Should I just retcon it and say having a ghoul is a net loss of blood, because the amount they must drink to sustain themselves? Or is the logistics of keeping ghouls prohibitive, since you have to bring them human food, dispose of their bodily waste, etc (except, being slaves, you can just order them to do that for themselves)? Does keeping ghouls under control require the use of mental focus that means keeping more than 1 for every 500 years of age you have just takes too much of your brain so you wouldn't be able to control them effectively?

I tend to lean towards the 'ghouls use psychic energy' school of thought, but it still bugs me.

They just become very suggestible, think of a stage hypnotist, and fiercely loyal. It's more like someone who is unconditionally in love with a vampire, than a zombie that has lost its entire personality.

I love the idea of the vampire blood altering the taste of the ghoul's blood to make it less palatable, but it's still likely going to be better to have a journalist as a ghoul than as a jannisary.

Then again..... a ghoul can be un-ghouled by keeping them away from the vampire for about a week, and they might be disgusted by what they did and turn on the vampire. A jannisary will still be looking for that next high, and while they might sell a vampire out for another vampire's services, there's very little else that would make them want to do so. So, while a jannisary can't be ordered to keep you secret, it's in their interest. On the other hand, a ghoul is bound to you at her very core - until they aren't, and then they are likely to be your biggest enemy. So you would only want to create ghouls you will have complete control over....

******************************************************** [[/ajbigeye][]] Has it made me suggestible too, because I'm totally about to start telling you how to /kill me/ and I don't have any second thoughts whatsoever.

There's really only three ways to kill a vampire, if you're doing it violently. Decapitation, setting them on fire, and of course sunlight.

Decapitation - the brain and the heart are the only important organs in a vampire body. The brain still does all the thinking. Unlike in the former human body, the heart doesn't work as a lowly pump - it's just... a magic nexus or something. Anyway, it's the source of the magic that keeps the course alive, so decapitation seperates the two. It's not enough just to sever all the veins and arteries; the capilliaries and even the interstitial fluid can transmit the 'life energy' from the heart to the brain. So a 'nearly headless nick' situation would be healable for a vampire. Once that last bit of skin is severed, though, brain death is assured.

Fire - For some reason, when a vampire is burned its natural healing abilities do not make short work of the injury. Injuries caused to a vampire by fire will take a long time to heal - longer, even than the same burn would take for a human to heal.

Sunlight - For their first six months or so of undeath, a vampire slowly loses her ability to be in the sun; their first day of unlife will only result in a sensation like a mild sunburn, but progressively they can stand less and less time in the sun. Many a person who can be found staring into the sun is a new vampire with a good mentor, who has told them to treasure the small amount of sunshine they will see over the coming months, because it will be their last. A ten year old vampire can survive in the sun for about two or three minutes; for an ancient vampire, a reflected ray of sunshine would kill them almost instantly. The physical symptoms are of burns but without fire.

Finally, if you're not being violent, they can also starve to death after a fashion - if they're not fed enough, they become mindless automatons searching only for their next meal. This invariably leads to them either getting a snack and returning to normal, or, well, following a rat out into the sun. Usually the latter.

First, you mention decapitation - that is, severing the heart-brain connection. But there are other ways to mess with those two organs. What about a bullet through the brain, or the ever popular wooden stake through the heart?

On that matter, what exactly happens to a headless vampire? The magic nexus of the heart is still going, albeit undirected by any form of intelligence. Does the remaining body merely grow a new head (complete with blank, infantile brain) and go on a mindless rampage until it runs into sunlight and burns up?

Second, fire. Does it have to be /flame/, or will any source of heat do? Could one (in theory) kill a vampire with a kettle full of boiling water? (Or several kettlesful?) What about an infrared laser? Molten lava?

Third, sunlight. What is it about sunlight in particular that kills vampires? Ultraviolet light, some magical property, the sun's heat? Whatever it is, can it be blocked by a sufficiently thick layer of sunblock?

Fourthly, let's consider the starving vampire. Is it possible for a vampire to still move, even taking in no new energy? Can I exploit this by chaining up a starving vampire in my basement, putting him in a giant hamster wheel, and dangling a rat in front of him (but out of reach) to get an infinite source of (environmentally-friendly) energy with which to power my lab?

A stake through the heart paralyses the vampire, world of darkness style. This means that you can behead them at your leisure - or, if you're feeling particularly sadistic, leave them in an open area and wait for sunrise.

As for the bullet to the brain - it depends. If the bullet breaks the physical structure of the skull, head, etc and causes part of the brain to become... detached, then the vampire might heal 'around' it - perhaps giving you a sort of lobotomy, or simply a brain-dead vampire.

Flame, I'd say. Boiling water and lasers are no problem.

#+end_quote

The magic, 'spirit', whatever you want to call it of the sun. In my head it's Sol in particular; a vampire can watch the sunrise on Alpha Centauri with no ill effects, though a particularly ancient vampire would have to consult her star charts to ensure that Sol is not visible that night.

#+begin_quote
  Whatever it is, can it be blocked by a sufficiently thick layer of sunblock?
#+end_quote

Yes; if vampires can stay indoors and not get burned, there's no reason that sufficiently thick sunblock could not allay the effects. However, for practical purposes, the sunblock would only be useful for very, very young vampires. A vampire that would die after 5 minutes could put SPF 50+ and get maybe 5 minutes and 2 seconds. Sunblock doesn't even block all the types of UV rays, let alone any of the visible light, so the effects would be far more modest than what the SPF would have you believe.

The canon document actually specifies that a starved vampire can be awake for 60 seconds at a time in pursuit of prey it senses nearby. Obviously somewhere deep down I was thinking of this; probably I wrote that in because the magical justification would be that the bloodless vamp isn't going to go on an epic quest for a rat, it's going to give up if it's too hard.

Also, it lets us perhaps get away without breaking TOO much thermodynamics, maybe. Perhaps the heart-brain system, which uses human blood as a primary fuel, is also able to use a secondary backup fuel source more or less indefinitely? Or perhaps we shouldn't think too deep about vampires...

Good point. No, I don't. I'm behind this; they can even be the zombie equivalents of this canon, as I can imagine that the link between vampires and zombiepires is not obvious to people inhabiting the universe. Here's some new canon that this has given me:

- A stake in the torso will freeze them until the stake is removed. It also has the effect of preventing any healing from occurring. It effectively puts them into a state of suspended animation; they will not require food. Some particularly desperate hungry vampires have been known to self-stake.
- Vampire limbs grow back when they're severed; the magic comes from the heart, and there are risks of starfish-like duplication if the heart is merely cut into pieces instead of burned. (Don't worry TOO much; if the heart is still inside the torso, it will join back together. But if your bullet to the chest splatters heart matter throughout the room? You'd better burn that shit down or in a few months you'll have zombie vampires on the loose.)

  - An arm will grow back over two or three nights.
  - Another huge concern is that a vampire body, after being beheaded, can actually grow an entire new head. The new head starts out bald but will have a decent head of hair after a night or two. The brain is blank, having only the most basic instincts - move towards and eat anything that is full of blood, and avoid bright lights.

- Slayers are advised to behead, stake, and drag vampires into the open to avoid this.

I look at it from the other way: what are the odds that a /completely different/ star, with different spectral properties, a different relationship with the planet vampires evolved on, would be able kill them? The thing that's special about this sun is that vampires evolved on a planet that orbits it. I'm not tied to this idea, but I think that if someone was able to make something that exactly imitated all the properties of sunlight, it would not burn the vampire. I'm iffy on mirrors too, but I think that if it can burn through glass or even just /the atmosphere/ then mirrors can't be excluded. The danger is something to do with the 'spiritual nature' of the sun, whatever that means.

I'm also keen to hear your thoughts on this, in case I'm missing something awesome. I never thought that if a vampire could regrow a limb, then a vampire can regrow a /blank head/, and that's badass.

Things generally don't evolve /vulnerabilities/. Dependencies, yes - if vampires required an hour or so of sunlight every day, this argument would be a lot more compelling - but not vulnerabilities.

So. My thoughts. At the moment, you have vampires that can only be permanently stopped by two things; sunlight and fire. Now, a common feature of magic in fiction is the idea that a small thing can somehow hold the essence of a related big thing; Harry Dresden can scry on a model of Chicago; Harry Potter has the Marauder's Map. So it's possible that these two things are in fact one thing; that fire only burns vampires because it has a sympathetic link with the Sun.

So. You have an immortal, near totally invulnerable predator with but a /single/ weakness. Unlike, say, a lion, which can be killed in any of a thousand ways. Vampires did /not/ evolve naturally; they're too far advanced beyond anything else. No, vampires were almost certainly /created/, by some lost but magically powerful civilisation, as the magical equivalent of a nuke. (Let's call it Atlantis). Way, way back, Atlantis had magicians whose knowledge of magic has been all but lost in modern times, and they had a war; some remnants of their weapons survive to this day, though Atlantis itself does not (the war turned out to be apocalyptic and destroyed pretty much the entire civilisation, possibly even literally wiping it from history).

Perhaps vampires were originally created without the sunlight weakness by one faction; and another faction literally /enchanted the Sun/ into being deadly for these vampires as a defensive move. Or perhaps they were engineered with their solar weakness as a control measure. (Either way, this would imply that a suitably knowledgeable magical practitioner could work out a vampire-killing spell that used no sunlight or fire if he tried. Presumably actual magical practitioners are rare enough to make this a fairly negligible threat to the average vampire - though particularly paranoid ones might go so far as to deliberately hunt down and kill mages just to keep this threat level negligible).

Bearing in mind that (a) a glacier doesn't just require cold, it requires a whole lot of water and (b) the north and south poles each have close on /six months/ of complete sunlessness (and vampires presumably don't feel the cold) so they're probably vampire holiday homes (and vampires probably sponser arctic and antarctic research stations - or, as they refer to them, "snack boxes").

************************************************************** You make some great points! I do love the idea of bringing vampires down into having a single weakness (namely fire).

I like the war story, the sun literally being enchanted as a weapon.

As for existing canon: mages exist, on a spectrum. What you'd think of when you imagine a wizard - casting spells with great acuity - is one in a hundred million and requires a combination of genes and appropriate schooling. Something more along the lines of a magician - able to cast a dozen or so spells to a decent skill level through practise and research, thanks to genes and schooling - is one in a million. One in a thousand are people with small quirks - predictive abilities, the sort you see on Hollywood psychics. One in a hundred are people are people who just seem 'above average', perhaps with really good reflexes, an astonishing memory, or an affinity for mathematics.

The above figures give about 70 top tier mages in the world today, which is not unreasonable IMO. Atlantis could have had better schools and a deeper mage gene pool (breeding programs, maybe? or just founder effect - perhaps it was founded by a few exiled wizards)

*************************************************************** Hmmmm. Alright, let's briefly consider magic. Using it offers considerable advantages to the user; we can therefore expect that those with better access to magic will, on average, have more descendants than those that do not. Even at the "small quirk" or "above average" level, that's enough to produce a slight evolutionary pressure in the direction of being more magical.

This would imply that a number of animals would evolve magical abilities (mostly at the "small quirk" or "above average" level). We're not talking dragons here; more along the lines of supernaturally fast [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackalope][jackalopes]] or a large Himalayan ape with the ability to turn invisible.

--------------

Now, the "ancient war" idea relies on Atlantis having had some serious magic. Up to the point where comparing an Atlantean mage to a modern mage is like comparing Richard Feynman to Plato; they definitely fit in the same category, but one is an accomplished professional with a thorough education while the other is making a few steps in the direction of developing the beginnings of that education. I'm thinking Atlantis was probably ruled by a few families of magic users (or possibly even one family that had an internal feud at the end) - they somehow made magic their /exclusive/ property, tied to their family bloodline and not available to those not related to them. (This means that the "magic genes", so to speak, imply that one is descended from one of these Atlantean mage-kings). This leaves open the possibility of finding the occasional, very very rare, exceedingly powerful Atlantean magical artifact, which cannot be replicated without a thorough understanding of the magic that went into the artifact's creation... which doesn't come with instructions and may or may not have limited charges...

Ooo! I should say that one of the small quirk type guys experiences awful headaches and frequent nose bleeds in conjunction with his powers (accurate prediction of the future that's somewhat random, sometimes can be the entire strategy for an enemy attorney, sometimes is just the desire to buy a particular type of tea so that way, two weeks later when someone asks for it, he doesn't need to leave the office to get any for her). So.... there's probably trade offs.

The magician doesn't seem worse off for her powers, though.

Another character is at the 'above average reflexes' level, from a family of Chinese kung fu masters that are assisted by this magic, which might make the 'descendants of atlantis' theory less tenable (actually - he's the cousin of the magician, so atlantis could easily have been in ancient china....). The powers are passed down the male line, though they're not exclusive to men - a woman with the powers will have the augmented abilities, but will not pass them down to her sons, while a man will pass them down to his sons and daughters. So it's not just simply y-linked, it's somehow more complicated than that.

A lot of skill is related to teaching, though, so Atlantis wouldn't need to keep control of the genes - they could just seek control of the teaching. I think it's implied that someone could 'jump up a tier' just by having better access to teachers. Love the ideas of artefacts and lost knowledge, though!

Magic not spreading hugely through the gene pool is a huge problem. Easy way out is to say the genes also have a negative effect on fertility.

Hmmm. The Atlantean mages would have liked vision-of-the-future, but not the side effects. This implies that perhaps his genetics are not /quite/ perfect - he is, in effect, unlocking one function of magic but doing it wrong. (Like holding a broken torch that shocks you when you turn it on - you push the switch, and get light /and/ a shock. But someone with a properly working torch would just get the light.)

I'm thinking the ancient Atlantean mage-kings would have had /all/ of the magical talents and /none/ of the negative effects. (Yes, yes, massively overpowered, but you can do that in the distant past.) Presumably even some control over what part of the future they see (or at least an understanding over what parts they could or could not see - that ancient war probably involved both sides seeing and then trying to steer the future to their advantage).

Nah, Atlantis was way, way, /way/ back. Before humanity left Africa at all. /Way/ before the Chinese got to China. Descendants of their mage-kings can be found in of pretty near all ethnic groups at this point (though the genes are massively watered down, further reducing available magical power), because they predate humanity's division into current ethnic groups.

It might be worthwhile to simply ignore this question entirely. Most readers won't ask it, and those few that do will note it down to suspension of disbelief. (The other strategy that can work is for the characters to ask the question, but be unable to find an answer, simply a consistent set of facts).

Nice and has no annoying racial consequences (either the 'magical black person' trope, which with the whole chinese thing and martial arts is pretty problematic), plus puts it even further back. Maybe the population bottleneck had something to do with the Atlantis war - though Lake Toba is about as far from Africa as it's possible to get.

I kind of like the idea of the vampire weapons taking over following the war, whittling the humans down to the 30,000 range through over-hunting, realising that this is going to result in their demise, finally deciding to farm them more sustainably and then feral populations of humans result. You could even say the lake toba volcano was set off by someone in the service of vampires, in order to obscure the sun somewhat.

I can only /imagine/ what a 70,000 YO vampire would be like though, if one survived to the present day to tell the tale of the ancient war. One character is about 5,000 YO and is considered to be at the very tippy top of vampire aged-ness (not the oldest, but top 5 or 10), another character is about 1,500 YO and and is somewhere in the world's top 100. Canon has rumours of vampires potentially being able to completely pass for human (down to sunlight and eating food instead of blood) after a certain period of time, but I'm not sure if those are just rumours or not.

Not if the magic gene also reduces your fertility; if your sister has the magic gene, she's got reduced fertility. If she doesn't, she's just as fertile as anyone else but she's just as non-magical as anyone else, too, so you don't gain much.

I can imagine magic powers being a drawback if you're untrained or not expecting it; someone with random visions of the future might just think they get prophetic dreams, cassandra complex, etc.

I agree that we don't /need/ to explain why after, say, 70,000 years the world isn't full of magical people, but it would be nice. We have idle dreams of publishing the stories and becoming fabulously wealthy on the proceeds, but that's probably not going to happen. I just like things to make sense in my own head.

Good thought, but I always worry about anything that puts magic genes further in the past and thus having even more time to propagate. I suppose at the end of the day the exact timing doesn't matter, though I do like the imagery of humans being chattel that ultimately went feral. It kind of fits in thematically, too. In our universe, the world is pretty much a vegan society (in the background rather than a plot point, just like in Kung Fu Panda), so having humans in the position of farm animals kind of tickles me in that way.

True. I think for magic to work, having it require a constellation of genes that play off each other constructively AND also have appropriate teaching (I can imagine a child with huge magic potential accidentally killing themselves or their parents/etc because they can't control it - like at the beginning of Frozen to an extent).

So a family with a good history of magic discipline would have worked out how to appropriately channel this: the kung fu masters who have slight prescience to predict an opponent in combat's next move probably teach their children from a young age how to move with it, trust their instincts, etc; if that same child was adopted by a family without a magical tradition might result in the child being anxious because s/he always has this weird feeling something's about to happen but can never be sure how to interpret it, or feel jumpy. I can imagine this would ultimately manifest in some quite debilitating anxiety symptoms - OCD or the like.

#+end_quote

Hmmm. I'm going to guess that they somehow gather some sort of energy (probably magical) from blood, which helps to sustain them. And perhaps powers some of their more supernatural abilities.

I'd guess that if the vampire's doing the same stuff, he'll need the same amount of blood. But will he be doing the same stuff? An older vampire might know lost Atlantean magic, which requires a certain amount of blood-energy to use; on the other hand, he would be able to better predict when and how to use his magic to best effect, getting the same result as a junior vampire but with less effort.

So the 70 000 year old vampire might use either more or less blood than a two-year-old vampire. But his physical age has nothing to do with it.

That looks like it would work well. Someone might be lucky enough to stumble onto training (and there might actually be genes /for/ luck, I've seen that used very well before) but that would certainly limit the propagation a lot.

********************************************************************** Thanks for all that, you've really helped me out! My roleplaying partner in particular is super into the idea of blank vampire heads. We like trying to differentiate our vampires from the mainstream and... yeah, it's just badass. I'm so excited to see how it shakes out.

[[/crain-r][]][[/hahaha][]][[/ohhi][]] I wonder if, for example, a vampire gets shot in the heart, and he heals himself up so he keeps his brain - do his zombie clones still grow? I assume they'd have to, the heart matter doesn't know it doesn't need to regenerate, otherwise starfish vampires wouldn't happen. So, could a vampire with some need for blank, easy-to-predict clones of itself create them? I suppose how useful are such clones, really? Maybe as a body double, but no-one will be fooled by that for long, but still, self-surgery, get a little bit of your heart out, put it in a secure cage, lock it, and let it grow in case you need it. Wow. I'm totally having a newly turned vampire find his mentor's double. That's creepy AF.

[[/freebooze-in][]] So! Invitations. That's another weakness vampires have. They need to be invited into buildings. It's related to the magic of a human sleeping - I guess the atlanteans wanted to avoid collateral damage when they made these weapons, so didn't want vampires to attack people in their homes?

- Vampires have to be invited into a residence. This is due to a type of magic ward that is formed by the mere fact of a human sleeping in it. The more regularly and soundly a human sleeps in the residence, the stronger the ward is. Same with an emotional connection.

  - Invitations can be revoked; doing so gives the vampire an intense desire to leave the house/room. Depending on the strength of the human's connection to the dwelling and the strength with which the invitation is revoked, the vampire might immediately walk out, or may have several minutes.
  - An invitation must be freely given (so no hypnotising to get the invitation)

- Examples of different “strengths” of effect:

  - A farmhouse that has been in the family for centuries will require a vampire receive a written invitation and that the vampire adhere to any terms on the invitation (e.g. “you are welcome at my house this evening from 7pm - 7:30pm”)
  - A normal suburban home will require a normal, but clearly stated invitation. “come on in”
  - A vampire with an invitation to enter a multi-person dwelling must get separate invitations to enter the bedrooms of each inhabitant, except for the one who invited her in to start with.
  - A hotel room will not require an invitation to enter, but the human can ask the vampire to leave and that will be required. This only works if the human has slept in the room.
  - Only humans are able to give permission, though it doesn't matter if they are a ghoul, werewolf, witch, etc.
  - A guest cannot give a vampire permission to enter a home unless they have been sleeping there for a solid month.
  - A landlord cannot invite a vampire into her tenant's house, because she does not sleep there.
  - In other words, the legal owner of the house is irrelevant to the magic; in fact, if a vampire leaves his own house for a few weeks, and a human squats there, the vampire is no longer able to enter without permission.
  - If a human has slept in a house for ten or more years, and later leaves, she retains some ability to give/revoke invitations.

Potential problems: what exactly counts as a house, among other things.

Yes, provided they kill everyone who has slept there recently enough for the spell to have an effect. So, you could shoot Dad, but if Mum and the kids are out at the doctor's then the vampire can't enter the house without their permission, or, well, over their dead bodies.

I agree that with the vampires being created as weapons of war it logically follows without any trouble that the group creating the vampires would put a couple of limits, and when you're talking about war, prohibitions against entering a person's usual sleeping-place is a pretty good safeguard. I imagine the vampires came from human volunteers, who would have been screened for loyalty/etc, which also ensures they attack the enemy and don't go rogue (probably the mages have another killswitch for vampires in case they did, perhaps a spell lost to time)

Oh dear. No. No, that does not follow at all. First of all, that assumes that the Atlantean concept of war vaguely matches the modern one (i.e. it is reserved for soldiers only). Historically, you'll find /plenty/ of examples which show that the idea of leaving civilians out of any actual war is a pretty recent innovation - through a fair chunk of history, civilians on the losing side of war had a /really/ bad time.

Secondly, it's only when someone is winning the war that they have the luxury of being able to take the time to finish the safety precautions; when they're losing, and it's a choice between releasing the dangerous superweapon /now/ or facing annhilation tomorrow, what do you think they'd choose?

Shit, that's a good thought. Really gets down into 'what is a house, anyway' territory. If you have people sleeping in a cave, is that a house for purposes of the invitation? If so, at which point is the 'threshold' past which the vampire needs an invitation.

I suppose 'house' in the context of this would be a structure /created by humans/ that is currently used for sleeping.

On one hand I don't want vampires to be bulldozing houses to get to the creamy human inside; on the other hand, if a vampire is willing to bulldoze a house that he can't get an invitation into, that's already taking a huge, probably out-of-proportion risk so they are unlikely to be doing it routinely. So, yeah, a vampire could bulldoze a house to get past the invitation if necessary.

That IS a problem. The canonical vampire hunters live in a big house together and don't seem to do anything to keep it a secret. One of them is a skilled magic user who has set up 'wards', so I guess that handwaves it well enough.

A vampire can't enter the sleeping bag, that much is obvious.

If a vampire can use a bulldozer to destroy a house with a human sleeping inside, can a vampire also use her super strength to destroy the house brick by brick?

I wonder if a sleeping bag fits more into the category of clothing (like pyjamas - it makes no sense for a vampire to be stopped by pyjamas), but then you can turn the sleeping bag into a tent and it's getting interesting - does the ward fail to establish, does it move with the tent, or is it made by the earth itself getting involved in the magic somehow? Like, is the system causing the magic ground>structure>human, or just structure>human?

I feel like I err on the side of ground>structure>human system causing the magic. I kind of like putting a precedent for the ground being involved in the magic of everything, since I like the idea of vampires not being able to cross running water as well (though.... ground water basically kills this concept).

Other fun fact: some particularly old vampires can change into bats. Well, in my headcanon they're not /bat/ bats, they're just small, furry, winged creatures that look enough like bats that it seems like a sensible name for them. I think that's less weird than them being able to turn into an actual species of flying mammal.

The magic system is very unexplored, especially vis-a-vis the actual mechanics; not sure how much of that is because it's unexplored or how much of that is just in my RP partner's headcanon (I don't have any magic using characters). The witch has a staff, which she casts spells using and stores spells in, but beyond that I can't really say. Here's what we've got written in the canon document:

- Magic is something that is genetically inborn, and somewhat rare. There are mild psychics, people with good luck, etc, who make up the bulk of people containing the magic genes. People who can actually learn and wield magic successfully are in the top 10%.
- Magic is also different depending on genetic skill, and who it is learned from. As a result, no two magic users will cast spells the same way.
- People can learn magic from demons, from friendly spirits, passed down through the family, be self taught, from the Earth, certain churches, and from certain animals.
- Some people who show magic abilities (such as Kung Fu Family or Prescient Guy With Nosebleeds) could probably be better with it, but aren't as they have not had real teachers and have had to rely on natural ability.
- Magic can develop in people who have no genetic predisposition through possession.

Don't see why not, it seems like the most logical way for them to do it - have people not know the house is there, but not find it weird that they don't know a house is there. Would be a bother for receiving mail but that's why god invented PO boxes.

#+begin_quote
  There are demons and spirits? Hmmmm. What's known about them?
#+end_quote

Spirits have very little explanation; demons are reasonably well fleshed out and my god are they complicated. Short form: basically every folklore demon, creature, cryptid etc exists in an underground world (or plane-shifted world; one demon character says it's under the surface of the moon, though in-universe it's mentioned he's wrong because of the gravity not being different). It can be teleported between by using teleportation booths. There are thousands of 'pure' demon species (e.g. centaurs, gargoyles, sirens, kelpies), and they generally live in this 'underground' world in their own version of society.

They can interbreed with each other, though it's rare (on par with getting pregnant from precum). If e.g. a centaur and a gargoyle have a baby, the baby is mostly human in appearance with maybe a horse tail and funky teeth and some claws. This is because the human state is considered to be the "base", "impure" state of all living things, and the individual demon bloodlines are "perfect", and this perfection fades away with interbreeding. A lot of mostly-human creatures from folklore are actually these half-breeds. Legend has it that humans were created when half breeds kept on interbreeding until the supernatural essence was almost lost. Regardless, demons and half breeds can breed with humans, which is where a lot of the 'magic genes' originated. (Two of the major characters are a half-breed and his dad, which is why there's so much detail here)

Demons ignore humans for the most part, though many keep them as pets, eat them, and the like - generally they're from stock that stays on the demon plane rather than from kidnapping from 'our world'. That said, many demons take humans who are in abusive homes on as pets, improving their lot. Still others fall in love with humans and keep them as "pets" because it's not socially acceptable to be in a relationship with a human. Still others have human "pets" and the humans are into it as a BDSM thing.

Racism against humans and half breeds runs deep in the demon world, too. Humans are /literally/ seen as on par with animals, and half-breeds are not considered all that much better (though half-breeds have all the rights a full demon has).

Also, demons have the sorts of powers you'd expect: a gorgon will turn you into stone, for example, and a dragon can breathe fire.

If the posessing spirit can access and delete its host's memories, then it can /definitely/ go unnoticed.

Now I'm thinking of a cult in tentative control of a spirit. New initiates are possessed by the spirit at a certain point, giving them access to a small set of magical abilities, which are left behind when the spirit leaves; perhaps to do with direct mental manipulation, mind control, memory alteration, that sort of thing. (If you're wondering how they maintain control of the spirit, note that this is a spirit that specialises in /mind control/ - they /think/ they have it imprisoned, but it thinks it is slowly building up an army of slaves for its own use...)

Fascinating. So there's an entire alternate world out there.

Right. Let's first consider these teleportation booths. Assume I step in a booth in the Shadow World, and step out of a booth here. Now I move this booth one kilometre to the north, and go back to the Shadow World. Do I go back to the same place, or do I turn up north of where I last was in the Shadow World?

The fact that the demons have easy access to magic has a /lot/ of implications for Atlantean society; first of all, it implies massive self-modification among the Atlantean ruling class.

The booths correspond with their 'partner' like a Stargate; so each Earth booth has a corresponding Underground booth, so moving the booths makes the entrances/exits (they're two way) work.

Setting up a booth isn't trivial, by the way, though I'm not sure exactly how it's done. I assume most booths are bought and sold as-is rather than created anew. A city of 2 million has about 10 or 20 booths in it, say.

A character has a booth hidden in an ordinary-looking Earth shop which he charges a toll to enter. I'd say in terms of luxury, having one would be on par with having a sailboat; possible for some but most people couldn't hope to afford one unless they made it a personal priority.

#+begin_quote

It could be. The Shadow World (Demon World or Underground as we refer to it) is definitely smaller in size than Earth, because the 'wild' humans who one meets there are from a diverse set of countries and cultures. But maybe the Shadow World is as large as Earth and most of the portals simply go to the megacity / NYC equivalent of that world, and out in the sticks there are cliffs where Sirens and Harpies catch fish or something.

#+end_quote

Atlantis? Pre-technological? No. Atlantis had /all/ the technology. Atlantis considered fusion power merely a single small step above fire, and one thy had passed beyond so long ago that no-one used it for anything anymore.

Arthur C. Clarke famously remarked that sufficiently powerful technology is indistinguishable from magic. The Atlanteans had passed /that/ point centuries ago. At the height of Atlantis, they had it /all/. Their empire spread through millions upon billions upon trillions of shadow worlds, and the shadow they cast on those worlds was vast indeed. Nothing and no-one could hope to stand up to the technomagical might of Atlantis.

And then the civil war came. Vast and powerful were the weapons wielded in that war - the self-replicating killer now known as a vampire was the minor weapon of a minor terrorist faction, brushed aside and ignored by the more powerful families. Families of medium power waged their wars in the past, sending back history eraser bombs the remove their greatest foes from the pages of history itself; the most powerful families, protected in arcane and powerful ways from such devices, used even more esoteric weapons (fictionalization bombs, defictionalisation bombs, and weirder fare).

What worlds shook and shattered under the might of their war we will never know; what we do know is that, of the trillions of worlds Atlantis had stretched over, there are but two still accessible; one of which contains many demons, descendants of the ancient Atlantean families who changes and twisted their own genes in their eternal search for perfection (and self-sustaining magical technology implants were always popular) and the other, which was probably a nature park or someone's back garden or something, ended up with a bunch of original-genome humans and virtually no demons. It's quite probable that the only reason these two worlds escaped the War largely unscathed was because no-one thought they were important enough to bother with.

There are also gods who exist and are worshiped by demons, but they are more in the vein of pantheon gods - different demons worship different gods, some of the gods are race exclusive, and they don't have anything like omniscience or omnipotence, so they can quite easily slot in as the 'upper middle class' to the demons' middle-class - just much more powerful spell-casters, maybe even remnants of the original atlantis.

Absolutely. This has a problem though, you could break the light speed limit, and thus time travel, couldn't you? But light travels so fast maybe it doesn't matter. Let's work it out:

#+begin_example
  circumference of the earth = 40,000km 
  => about 20,000 km between places at worst
  Time light takes to travel 20,000km is 67 milliseconds
#+end_example

So giving each portal an almost-imperceptible half-second delay means that we don't have time travel. Not sure whether the demon world is literally a parallel universe or if it's underground, but if it's a parallel universe physics can just kind of shrug at that and if it's underground then the laws of physics are still not getting broken.

#+begin_quote

I just take it as given that immortals have effectively infinite income, but it won't be as simple as opening a bank account 300 years ago and collecting interest because, well, it's kind of pesky to "die" and will it to yourself every fifty years or so. You hear a lot about them doing things like selling antiques, old books and the like, but would a vampire really want to keep a huge stockpile of random crap like a hoarder in the hope it becomes valuable some day? They probably have a very different perception of time, so maybe it's like stockpiling all your high-end soap during the year and then selling it around Mother's Day to maximise your profits, but they don't know whether people are buying their mum soap this year or whether they'd rather buy her a day spa voucher or brunch, and then all of a sudden you end up with 400 different things you need to stockpile.

I guess vampires, having the ability to mind control people, can simply steal money, embezzle donations, and all that fun stuff. But say an immortal with no powers beyond immortality - what would be the optimal thing to do?

So. An immortal can basically make money in one of two ways. Either by developing some skill (world's best chess player? He certainly has the time to learn) or selling some antique (hmmm... time to clean out the attic again...)

Both have downsides, The skill might become obsolete, either because no-one's interested anymore (watch the Human Calculator multiply two three-digit numbers in his head!) or because it's just generally useless (dodo breeder). The antique is no more likely to be valuable than the contents of your grandmother's attic (sure, there might be something there, but unless deliberate effort is made...) Worse, forms of wealth can change from time to time; what's worth a lot now can be worthless in fifty years' time. (A successful immortal, than, needs to change, and change often, to avoid simply becomig that grumpy old guy telling octogenerians to get off his lawn).

Another thought struck me recently. This alternate world; does it have a sun? And is that sun Sol? If not, then it strikes me that a 70 000 year old vampire could easily have survived to that age by simply staying hidden in the alternate world, where sunlight can't touch him...

Well... that question made me think: if vampires were created on Atlantis, why are they vulnerable to Sol, of all things? Maybe a small offshoot of Atlanteans ran to Earth, scared and alone, and enchanted Sol to protect them from vampires, the hitherto almost unstoppable force. Probably this resulted in them mostly being exterminated by non-vampire members of the enemy faction, leaving the world today?

To answer your question: canonically, everything that has occurred in the alternate world has happened underground. It could still easily simply be a huge cavern on earth. I'm now imagining something like The Matrix, where nuclear winter or similar has rendered the surface uninhabitable so all the residents have gone underground.

Regardless, everything being underground in one city that's easily accessible from Earth means that a vampire could easily live there. I'm wondering whether vampires just don't tend to live down there, though - they're kind of like humans, and there's all that fantasy racism happening - but then again, vampires are damn powerful, much more intelligent than humans, have a /very good reason/ to live underground, and presumably can kick a centaur's arse if it comes to it.

Perhaps the underground realm has an anti-vampire measure that's more powerful than the sun? And our world and the underground realm are the only two places that are not knee-deep in vampires?

Which means that, not only do you have to keep learning stuff, you also have to keep /unlearning/ stuff. You have to learn about continental drift and unlearn that the continents are static and eternal; so on and so forth. (And a lot of scientific paradigm shifts happened not because people came to accept the new theory, but rather because the adherents of the old theory all died with time...)

So it would either have to be something that's an inherently limited field (like chess - no-one's going to suddenly "discover" that a King can move like a knight) or something that retains its usefulness even in the face of new discoveries (writing novels, picking pockets, stage magicianship, Atlantean magic).

Of course, it's possible for the immortal to turn this around - to take an antique and /make/ it valuable.

Growing a garden, or, ever since the days of mendel, breeding a line of animals that pleases you is far more rewarding. That russian guy and his foxes? I've heard of a great vampire who has bred a species of miniature giraffe for his menagerie.

And, well, those expensive cats - not the ones that are some tiny part serval, the ones you've heard about only the wealthiest having, the ones that they say are just more serval than their peers, but they look a lot more like leopards than servals? Let's just say that a vampire with a breeding project of her own was running a bit short of money and realised that rich people will buy anything.

YES. Especially on stamps. "Oh? Misprinted stamps are valuable? Guess I'm becoming a stamp-printer's apprentice, a poor one at that, and then my 'great-great nephew' is going to find a trove of stamps in +my+ his attic."

I'm also imagining modern vampires getting the first printings of everything they can get their hands on. Some might be good calls - like pokemon cards. Others, not so much.

They're really going to turn out to be hoarders, aren't they?

Speculation: many hoarders are merely vampire's ghouls or jannisaries who have been /convinced/ to keep /everything/ because their vampire master might need it some day. That way vampires get to keep a bunch of crap, and not have to worry about storing it themselves.

So.... you're talking about the God of the vampires? He lives in the part of town inhabited by many of the other gods, you see. Powerful enough to be on the level of any one of them. Not that many vampires worship him - some don't view him as a god so much as a boogeyman - but unlike most other gods he doesn't have big ceremonies where his worshippers gather. No. Each worshipper has one day every century or so where they can visit the god (bringing an appropriate gift, and you know how vampires are with gifts! No fewer than three jannisaries will do along with the usual works of art, rare animals, interestingly shaped gords and the rest of it - unsurprisingly this Vampire God has a herd of quagga that he obtained from his various gifts).

Of course, the vampire god's central tenant is that vampires are not allowed to settle underground. He's probably got some doctrine, like they need to be near the natural humans, the constant threat of the sun is character building, whatever. But he's the only one who lives there, and if someone spends more than a couple of days, well, there's a reason some vampires think of him as a sort of bogeyman. Many of his worshippers just give the tribute because they think it will endear them to him.

I don't know about that so much. There's a lot of mores about stories; for example, when we were learning about Hamlet we were taught that because of the moral attitudes of the time, any characters who committed a sin above a certain level would have to die by the end of the play, which is why it is such a famously bloody tale. That said, Hamlet still affected me a lot when I read it such that when I'm feeling down I like to read the "Too Too Solid Flesh" soliloquy, so maybe it is a bit more universal that I give it credit for.

Then again, a vampire writing literature for humans (or singing a ballad, etc) would probably result in a bit of a "generation gap" issue - I'm thinking of when big brands try to use memes on twitter and end up being cringeworthy, or the time my grandfather tried to write a young adult book series in one of his many get rich quick schemes.

It requires a lot of immersion in the culture to be successful, and when you're a vampire are you likely to keep yourself deeply immersed in human culture? Are you likely to know that people were worried about mutually assured destruction 50 years ago, and now everyone's worried about global warming? I'm imagining a vampire putting an anti-semetic novel into circulation because he was vaguely aware that humans are not fond of that one race of people right now, not realising he's behind the times.

Better to make this generation's JK Rowling or Walt Disney your ghoul, then there's no need to worry about actually writing for /humans/. You can write for vampires instead.

Yeah, I'm wondering what the Underground bloodline of humans would be like. I'm imagining calm. I'm also wondering if they'd know language - foxP2 or whatever need not be conserved, after all, as they're being artificially selected. And you might end up with a situation like Genie, where the baby humans don't learn a language and never can. So I guess the Underground humans wouldn't have any sort of language, though they'd still be just as intelligent, and if you kidnapped a baby you'd probably be able to teach it.

Demons have their own language, with a spectacularly complicated writing system, and just hearing or seeing the language can give humans headaches or vertigo, so I don't imagine that livestock level humans would be picking /that/ up.

I can see it now: he did something to offend one of the more major vampires in his region, and it was a really serious gaffe (more serious even than drinking from the cups in the wrong order during a formal blood service!). Traditionally, the appropriate gift are three female quagga within a certain age range, who are the daughters of three sisters who each was bred with a different nephew of theirs. Of course, in the interest of practicality and much like with many bygone species from before, vampires have started giving and receiving zebras instead. However, the offended vampire is so old, and so traditional that the minor vampire doesn't want to take chances; and, hey, perhaps instead of merely being an /appropriate/ gift, the elder will consider it an /extravagant/ gift, and his reciprocation may include a particularly desirable little swath of territory...

Oh, I didn't mean story /writing/. I meant story /telling/. Standing up in front of an audience, reading their reactions, tailoring the story towards what keeps their attention... and by setting it in a time the vampire is more familiar with, he can avoid a lot or cultural problems...

You're right about story /writing/. There are universal aspects to it, but a vampire would be tripped up by the more modern stylistic elements; elements that are much harder to notice in a spoken performance, especially when the vampire is able to read the audience and tailor the tale to match their expectations and reactions.

(Even in a written work, a good editor will be able to deal with most of the problems - if a vampire could swallow his pride enough to listen to one).

I've actually never thought about it too closely. Even if you can't ghoul a ghoul, you can wait a week for the ghoul to become unghouled and then ghoul the ghoul. But can you ghoul an ex-ghoul of someone else, or must the ghouls you ghoul be previously your ghouls or never ghouled?

I kind of like the idea of a ghoul not being able to be ghouled by another vampire, even after the ghouling wears off; it keeps vampires from making moves on one another's ghouls, and as the connection is almost vaguely romantic it makes sense as something that would include some "loyalty". I do know that trying to take someone else's jannisary is considered VERY rude.

#+begin_quote

Indeed. That's probably the way of these things; a vampire gets money, gold bullion, etc and when they run low they just ghoul one of the local humans and get a source.

The city in the setting is run by a 1500 YO vampire, has a population of about 2 million, and about four or five other vampires live there - all under the age of about 300. But the entireity of Australia is probably split amongst about 3 major vampires - west, north east, south east. Somewhere like China, India or the USA would be split more finely due to the high population, though I'd imagine for example that California would be split three ways and some of the sparser states would all be under the control of one major vampire.

The first human clone was done 50 years ago, simply because an Eritrean vampire lord had been given a specimen from an extremely rare line, and said specimen was beginning to get a bit old. And, well, the lord didn't want to be without his fantastically rare treat.

Now, all that stuff people are saying about monsanto - terminator genes, infertile offspring, all the rest of it? That was started by a vampire trying to protect her bloodline. It works, too. You clone them or breed them with IVF and the children have the most noxious blood. Ugh.

--------------

More stuff to ponder: can vampires gain and lose weight? Can they train to have buff muscles? Does their hair continue to grow? On the face of it you'd think not, because they're magically animated corpses, but if the magic is strong enough to grow a new arm and brand new muscles that go with it, then surely it'd be strong enough to make an existing muscle more buff.

I can see a vampire having control over whether e.g. their hair grows or they gain weight, since they don't have to breathe but can pretend to. But if a vampire gluts on blood, where does that extra mass go?

Actually, canonically I believe vampires don't poop. Does that mean that vampires are just choc full of haemoglobin that they've accumulated over decades of blood meals? I suppose the cleanest way is for it to come out in their breath, but they don't need to breathe. Do they sweat it out? Or does their blood just become more and more treacle-like over time? That's kind of a cool thought.

The mythological vampire is unchanging, frozen at the apparent appearance and age they were when turned. (This allows for the creepy little girl vampire as well).

Canonically, the vampire's digestive system fills with a horrible, dark, stinky slurry that is inserted into a freshly dead human's heart to reanimate them - I would assume the un-eaten blood would be used partially for that, though that's not very elegant.

Probably the most elegant solution is that as a vampire feeds, she releases her waste products into the jannisary or victim's blood in kind. Depending on how exactly a vampire physically processes her victims' blood, it could spread diseases, cause haemolitic disease if the blood types aren't compatible (suddenly AB+ janissaries are looking good!), or it could simply be excreted in short order by the human's kidneys.

It also has the pleasing side effect of a vampire who is not able to feed "naturally" getting sick, wasting away, and so on. Would explain why something like True Blood hasn't been invented - but I suppose a vampire could easily enough just excrete the nasties by effectively spitting or vomiting them out... but it's less gross than crying.

I don't know. Even if we let vampires fly, I can see the pseudo-sciency handwavey part being that they stop the higgs field from interacting with the molecules that make up their body, so they're not affected by gravity like a normal person is.

To grow an /entire vampire/ from a scrap of a heart, assuming the vampire body looks like a human body on the inside, you're going to need carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and all kinds of trace elements. These can't be created from nothing, at least not easily. The fact the growth would be very slow is a bit of an out at least, because you can have it happen as raw materials become available. Looking around my house, there's wood, which would be a source of carbon, and probably dead cockroaches which would be a source of carbon and nitrogen both, and hydrogen's easy.

... actually, carbon dioxide and nitrogen are both plentiful in the air, as is water vapour. I'd assume the magic of the heart would work on the CO^{2,} H^{2}O N^{2} in the air, using that as raw material. So if you kept a vampire heart in a vacuum or nitrogen atmosphere you'd be safe from it regenerating, but in real life such controlled conditions don't exist.

Actually, that raises a point - if a vampire bites an athlete before a major race, and that athlete is then selected for a random drug screening, does the athlete get disqualified?

  When a vampire turns into a bat - or bat-like mammal - where does the extra mass go?
#+end_quote

I was thinking that when I was talking about it and I don't have a satisfactory answer. The obvious thing is for the "gravity has less effect on them" explanation, but I'm not sure I like that as there's more transformation in the canon that isn't so easily explained and in fact canonically has additional weight or disappearing weight.

For example, there's a gargoyle. In his natural form, he's fifteen feet tall, with an additional fifteen feet of tail, and weighs about 3 tons (he's made of sandstone after all). However, he can change into a human form, where he looks like a standard 7 foot tall human but is really a 7 foot tall sandstone golem with a thin veneer of human skin on the outside, weighing about 260kg. This naturally causes issues if he transforms in places that can't handle the weight of a giraffe.

Also, he doesn't need to eat, but can choose to, and he regenerates, too, but far, far slower than a vampire. Presumably he can get the extra mass from the air, too, but he's made of rarer minerals (potassium, sodium, aluminium and so on), so he's probably getting them from a combination of the air and, like, doing stuff like making voids in his body. He eats rocks quite a lot, so after losing a limb or something he probably will just eat even more rocks to regain the mass.

Oh, and some more fun facts in case you want a thread to pick on - he's magically bound to protect a certain vampire, through a spell that has to be refreshed every ten years or so. He's pretty chill about this, as he was basically created to protect whoever owns him at the time. Finally, a few hundred years ago, a vandal carved his name ("Julias"[sic]) into the pedestal that the gargoyle sits on, and ever since the gargoyle and everyone known to the gargoyle - including his wife - has only been able to refer to him by that name, and have forgotten what, if anything, he used to be called.

So yes, to go back to the original point - transformation and additional mass is a glaring problem in this universe as it stands. Instant transformation can't be explained away as easily as regeneration. I think I might ask that at the upcoming world-building thread, if you don't have any ideas?

#+begin_quote
  [vampire spit being waste] ties in nicely with the whole jannissary idea - the waste products themselves are addictive
#+end_quote

Yeah, it explains how the effect lasts, because there's no reason they can't persist in the blood. Adding this to canon.

#+begin_quote
  Actually, that raises a point - if a vampire bites an athlete before a major race, and that athlete is then selected for a random drug screening, does the athlete get disqualified?
#+end_quote

Not unless the vampire spit has been identified as a PED, which, hey, maybe it has and we don't know it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

#+end_quote

Hell yes!

#+begin_quote
  Actually, could a vampire on the Space Station deliberately use this in order to asphyxiate the entire human crew?
#+end_quote

Yep, but I think once a vampire gets onto the ISS, waiting weeks for arms to grow back without being detected is probably a bit of a hassle - better off just killing them the old fashioned way.

That said, if you really want to assassinate the astronauts and making Challenger/Columbia happen a third time isn't doing it for you, sneak a little sliver of vampire heart into a tool box somewhere.

Then again - oxygen isn't a very abundant in the body - oh wait no, I was wrong, it is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_the_human_body][most abundant element in the body by mass]] and the second most by atomic percent. Ohh, because the body's mostly water. Silly me!

Damnit, I was about to say that because of the high amount of hydrogen, the ISS would do well to have a tiny piece of vampire heart in a tiny vacuum chamber for "in case of hydrogen gas leak break glass". I was also going to propose it as an alternative CO2 scrubber, but it would just remove CO2 from the air and the oxygen would be lost because the ratio of C to O in the body is 1:2. How annoying, but still, it remains potentially useful.

  transformation and additional mass is a glaring problem in this universe as it stands.
#+end_quote

...okay.

Try this, then. Imagine, for a moment, a two-dimensional universe. Like a flat, vertical membrane, on which two-dimensional creatures live and move. (Something like Flatland). Along with this, imagine a carrot. A normal, three-dimensional carrot. The carrot is poking sideways into the 2D universe.

Now, from the perspective of the 2D universe's inhabitants, the carrot is a circle. But the carrot can do one thing that the 2D universe's inhabitants /can't/ do, which is move in the third dimension. And whenever the carrot moves in the third dimension, as far as the 2D universe's inhabitants can tell, it either shrinks or grows.

Let's assume that the 2D universe's version of gravity only works in two dimensions. Then it only affects the part of the carrot that intersects with the 2D universe. As far as the 2D inhabitants can see, the carrot can grow (up to a maximum size) or shrink as well, changing its mass in the process.

Moreover, if someone cuts off a bit of the carrot at maximum size, it can shrink, and in the process it seems to instantly repair itself; though it still feels the pain, and if it returns to its old size, its injury becomes visible again.

--------------

Now imagine that vampires (and gargoyles) are kind of four-dimensional creatures. Your average vampire is a reanimated corpse on the one end of the 'carrot', and a bat on the other. (Notably, this means he's always the /same/ bat; if a conversationist puts a radio tag on a vampire in bat form, then the vampire becomes human and goes back to bat form, he'll still have the radio tag as a bat - despite not having it stuck to his ear as a human, and quite possibly not having it interact with the normal universe while he's in human form).

So, where does all this extra carrot-matter come from? Simple; vampires already regenerate from air, now they just need a bit more air to regenerate from.

Same idea goes for the gargoyle; though there, one end of the 'carrot' is a three-ton creature and the small end is at least human shaped.

Of course, this only works for a shapeshifter who's limited to two forms (and presumably any intermediate form, though that might be as difficult to maintain as balancing a ball on the tip of a pen instead of letting it fall to one or the other side). A multi-form shape shifter would either be some sort of caterpillar-like thing in four dimensions (a vampire who can shift to bat or wolf but has to pass through human form if moving from one to the other, for example) or something a good deal more complicated. It also means that shifting can give the /appearance/ of instant healing, but the original body remains injured and must heal (or regenerate) in its own time.

It also implies that shape shifters can interact with each other /outside/ the normal plane of the universe (e.g. two vampires in bat form meet each other; the outside-the-universe human form of one vampire can punch the outside-the-universe human form of the other vampire. To an external observer, the two bats approach each other, then one is suddenly, forcefully repelled away from the other for no apparent reason. This also makes the gargoyle a great anti-vampire guard - he can instant recognise shape shifters and even when he's in human form, he's still able to bring three tons of muscle down in a place that most shape shifters do not expect to be punched).

********************************************************************************************************** Before anything else I just want to say the extra dimension idea was AMAZING, it was in fact RIDICULOUSLY GOOD, it was in fact SO RIDICULOUSLY GOOD I wanted to express my appreciation. I considered reddit gold and then thought the more rational thing to do would be to buy some malaria bed nets, so I bought 5 malaria nets in your honour by way of thanks:

[[https://www.againstmalaria.com/MyNets.aspx?DonationID=205449]]

(If you're not actually /at all/ interested in effective altruism, then I'd be happy to buy you gold by way of apology, but a month of reddit gold is approximately the same price as a malaria bed net, so...)

But, yes, not only have I read Flatterland (highly recommend it, btw), but my husband is a mathematician who participates in something he calls "recreational mathematics" of higher dimensional spheres, so he was all too happy for me to pick his brain about vampires, transformation, and conservation of mass. I guess that is why I was so very, extremely, inexorably impressed by the idea.

So, this is what he helped me work out. I use Flatland metaphors a lot, because it's the only way I can get my head around 4 dimensional geometry.

- the 4th dimension is not really a part of our universe except when it is used by magical beings in some way or another. In other words, if the universe is flatland, there is void "above" and "below" flatland except where vampires, gargoyles, werewolves etc "stick out" - no physics/etc to speak of

- things can only stick into the 4th dimension as a result of magic; possibly, magic was invented in a 4 dimensional universe

- things are only able to be "at right angles" to our universe. This prevents creatures from looking "distorted" by being askew

- transformations look pretty much how we'd expect them to look, with slowly changing from one to the other. However, things like wings and tails can suddenly appear as free-floating spheres and then slowly become thicker and thicker until they "join" to the main body, which is just freaky cool: [[http://imgur.com/a/cxCD9]]

- transformations happen the same way every single time.

- this whole thing has some interesting connotations for how werewolves might work, since I have a whole werewolf concept based on menstruation but I'm very protective of it and I don't want to share it in a public forum, even buried deep in a month-old worldbuilding wednesday thread

- vampires and werewolves, being human-based, lack intuition for the 4-dimensional world. Their bat, wolf and human eyes just do not see through the 4th dimension; after all, there are no photons there.

- a "native" of the 4 dimensions, such as a gargoyle, has eyes that are capable of seeing other "projections" into the 4th dimension. This makes such creatures great guards, as they can see the projections of vampires and werewolves and many other transforming creatures in the 4th dimension at all times.

- The gargoyle has three forms: stone gargoyle at one end, gargoyle in the center, and human at the other end. During the day, /because of plot at the moment, but probably for a legitimate reason when I think of one/, the stone form is in our world with the other two forms "up" in the fourth dimension. Possibly it's where he goes to take a break, possibly it's how he actually 'eats', possibly his stone form has the most heightened senses for his guard duties, who knows???

OK, that's probably enough higher dimensional stuff. Thanks again for the idea. It's excellent.

Oh no, you have just a tiny sliver of heart. It'll slowly regenerate, but once it's about the size of an orange you take another sliver, put it in a vacuum box, and throw the rest out of the airlock.

*********************************************************************************************************** Wow. This is the first time anyone's ever bought malaria nets on my behalf.

I think it's a great idea!

I've also read Flatterland. It's a great book. (I particularly liked the negatively-curved 'Platterland' section).

So. On to the 4D vampires. Most of your bullet points are either perfectly logical extensions of the idea, or straightforward simplifications that make it easier to deal with. On a couple, though, I have a few further comments:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It is!

But now imagine your gargoyle, in human form, is trapped in - say, a broom closet. A room just big enough to hold his human form and not big enough for the full thing. He starts to shift, and his tail appears as an apparently disconnected sphere /outside/ the room. It extends towards the door, and... what happens when it hits?

The actual force does not come from the part of the tail in out 3D universe. It comes from the part of the tail trying to push /into/ our universe, trying to displace the door. So the direction of the force is from somewhere outside the normal three dimensions - it's trying to push the door in the opposite direction, i.e. to shove it outside the universe, in a way that the door, being a non-magical substance, cannot move.

(Of course, there's a whole range of possible doors to consider here - from flimsy wooden ones to thick steel safe doors...)

#+end_quote

Sensible. But just because they can's /see/ doesn't mean they can't /act/. A vampire (bat form) could still try to use his human form to punch the human form of another vampire (bat form), even if he has to guess exactly where to aim his punches. (This /does/ mean that he could get confused by a genuine bat that just looks like a bat-form vampire for some reason).

Hmmmmm. He's sounding a lot like some form of artificial life to me. A robot made by hyper-advanced technology. Which means that the same hyper-advanced technology might have inserted any number of forced behavioural routines (think Asimov's three laws of robotics - not the /same/ laws, of course, but something along those lines).

This leads to a few options:

- Perhaps he was intended specifically as a vampire killer. Since vampires are killed by sunlight and active at night, he only needs to be active at night.

- Perhaps he is (partially) solar powered, and his stone form is covered in hyper-advanced solar cells; he's programmed to return to it every day in order to remain powered up.

Even in stone form, he can still seriously inconvenience passing vampires - if his (human, currently extra-dimensional) form grabs the bat form of a passing human-form vampire, then what can the vampire do? He can't see what's got him, he can't walk away, he can't change shape, and ooooh, how long until the sunlight coming in through that window gets here...

************************************************************************************************************ Glad you enjoy the bed nets. I was worried I might be committing a reddit faux-pas, but I really am very appreciative of this conversation!

In re-writing a transformation scene, I realised something else: clothing. The second you start transforming, your clothes disappear. For modesty's sake, my husband and I worked out a system a 4D being could use to get what amounts to a morphsuit on their entire "length", which they could then cut holes in the head/etc for appearances, but it seemed so complicated that the average 4D being would prefer to either just have clothes on its two 'end forms', or buy the number of outfits necessary to fill out most of the intermediate forms, leading to an odd sort of transformation that might resemble a "one photo a day" transition timeline or something.

(Hubs also told me that 4D beings would weigh 10^{13} times their 'earth mass' unless they protruded only, say, 1nm into the 4th dimension, so I've decided to keep them 'short', which means that they wouldn't need too many outfits).

#+end_quote

A twenty minute conversation with my resident higher-dimensions expert. We've worked out that it would be a 3D analog of what happens if you punch a hole in a painting and then press it back into 2 dimensions. Your tail is going to push the door until it breaks (a 4D creature has a huge mass as discussed before, so you have plenty of momentum to do this; also explains a vampire's super strength, that momentum, actually). The door is going to break like a karate board; the ends of it that your tail is pushing are still going to be joined in the 3D world. When you are no longer pushing the door into the 4th dimension, it's going to spring back. The end result will be, like I said, [[http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/08/23E2F95E00000578-2865984-image-a-2_1418076655078.jpg][the 3D equivilent of a picture that's had a hole punched in it]] and then made flat again - so it'll look /mostly/ OK, but there will be some broken parts, and some jagged voids maybe in the inside of the door, uneven surface, etc.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, he's a golem now I really think about it rather than a gargoyle. Canonically, he was carved in ancient egypt as a temple guardian or something; it's all vague enough that it can be modified. But he would absolutely work under some behavioral laws, and be 'programmed' not to mind them. They're obviously not /too/ rigid as he's had time for a family and hobbies and whatnot, but hey, who cares if the help have hobbies as long as they're there when the vampire hunters come, right?

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps he was intended specifically as a vampire killer. Since vampires are killed by sunlight and active at night, he only needs to be active at night.
#+end_quote

Probably a good idea; he was at one point the guardian of a large cathedral, and the resident vampire took a liking to him, 'reprogrammed' him by casting the right spell at the right time, and, well, the rest is history as they say.

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps he is (partially) solar powered, and his stone form is covered in hyper-advanced solar cells; he's programmed to return to it every day in order to remain powered up.

Probably the best idea. His power requirements can be so great that he really needs the full amount of daylight to be sufficiently charged, but in an emergency he can change with no problem. That said, he /is/ made of sandstone, and I'm not sure there's a universe in which solar cells could look identical to sandstone? (I guess in a universe where sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic?)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is probably one of the 'features' of him having a human form at all, which I still haven't got a super good explanation for. He's white and 7 feet tall - maybe I should give him a race lift, too many of my characters are white anyway, but his height is something I don't want to change and it would be damn conspicuous 5,000 years ago when he was supposedly created (maybe his 'creator' just wiped all his memories from the past 70,000 years so he'd work better? Maybe this guy has a wife from the demon world who he was with for 60,000 years who has been hunting him down for the last 5,000 and finally has found him today??? that's a worry)

#+begin_quote
  Right up until some idiot DEA cop breaks into the basement, thinks they're humans, and starts cutting them loose...
#+end_quote

I am getting so, so many plot hooks. VOMBIE INVASION.

#+begin_quote
  Also, I must admit, I was thinking faster regeneration.
#+end_quote

How fast would it be? Hmm. An arm weighs about 4kg, and takes two days to regenerate, so a, say, 80kg vampire can regenerate 2kg of arm a day. That's 0.025% of body weight per day, assuming the respiration/magic comes from the body as a whole. If the magic comes from the heart alone, that's a ~300g heart generating 2kg of flesh, so a heart can appropriately enough generate 666% of its mass in flesh per day - that's probably where we'd go.

So, let's say you have a 1g heart sliver becoming an 80kg vampire:

| Day | Heart Weight | Total Weight |
|-----+--------------+--------------|
| 1   | 1g           | 1g           |
| 2   | 7g           | 7g           |
| 3   | 44g          | 44g          |
| 4   | ~300g        | ~300g        |

So after 4 days you've got a full heart, and after 40 more days you've got an 80kg vampire. So yes, the regeneration is fast if you're already a full size vampire - 2kg of flesh a day is heaps - but if you're growing a vombie from a sliver of heart, it's going to take more than a month. It'll take 2-3 days for a beheaded vampire to grow a new head, though.

--------------

Also here's the transformation scene I wrote up real quick:

/And so, he begins to change. First, his clothes disappear, him standing naked in the middle of the room, seemingly unperturbed by this. Slowly, each part of him grows larger and minutely more beige in colour. Small hovering blobs appear behind his shoulders and near the floor, beginning to grow little tendrils, corresponding to ones in neighbouring blobs and on his body, as they get bigger, undulating ever so slightly before joining together to form a solid mass of wings and a tail./

/Naturally, he grows heavier; the floorboards creak as the weight that is on them changes; he holds his tail and hands on the ground in an attempt to distribute his weight evenly, but there's a soft crack as one of the weaker floorboards yields to his mass./

/He crouches on the floor, holding his head close to the floor so he doesn't hit himself on the roof. When standing straight, he must be fully 15 feet tall, not including the tail, which adds an additional fifteen feet to his total length. His fingers and toes are both tipped in wicked, curved claws; he doesn't have feet but a second set of dextrous ‘hands'. He's a pale, sandy colour with some orange flourishes; the colour of sandstone. Folded at his back are a pair of batlike wings, each three times the size of his torso in area when fully stretched. His long tail snakes out from behind him./

and back:

/He begins transforming back; all his limbs shortening, his wings and tails turning back into spindly, floating sausages before disappearing, and his body becoming a more human shade. When he finishes his transformation, at the very last second, his clothes reappear, somehow unharmed by the whole process./

#+end_quote

Why? They're not glued to your body.

Clothing - normal, mundane clothing - consists basically of a series of tubes of cloth, which rest on your body and follow its movement in the normal three dimensions.

As per your earlier bullet points, a non-magical item (such as a shirt) does not normally move in the fourth dimensions. This implies that it somehow 'sticks' to the three-dimensional surface of our world - and the occupant of those clothes, sliding four-dimensionally through them, is not going to provide anything like the force necessary to overcome that stickiness. Rather, the clothes will 'fall' around the three-dimensional body.

When a vampire changes to a bat, this results in the clothes crumpling around him; when the gargoyle shifts out of his human form, this results in seams ripping and tearing and his trousers getting thoroughly ruined by his tail (so he, at least, probably wants to get undressed first, just to keep the cost of continually buying more clothes manageable).

#+end_quote

This isn't going to fly. I'll trust his calculations, but if the mass of a 4D being is the mass of the /entire/ 4D being and not just the current 3D slice, then the bat-form vampire is going to weigh exactly the same as the human-form vampire. And whichever way round you handle that, it just isn't going to work.

I recommend going with the claim that there are no Higgs bosons in 4D space if anyone asks, and just treat the creature as if it were the mass of the slice currently in the 3D universe.

(Also, looking at your transformation scene, I notice you have the gargoyle's mass increasing as he shifts).

(And even if the door is strong enough to resist having a gargoyle's tail slamming into it - I'm thinking a bank vault door or similar - he can still use the apparently disconnected end of his tail to feel for and pull the handle on the far side. Which also means that if the bank vault can be opened from the inside, then he can open it from the outside...).

#+begin_quote
  Very few doors are going to give something with a 4D creature's mass any problem, but it is feasible, especially if a mage were to build a magic, 4D door.
#+end_quote

A 4D door isn't going to stop an intelligent gargoyle for long, unless the room it's securing also has nice, strong 4D walls...

Come to think of it, a suitably knowledgeable mage (or an Atlantean) could create a corridor with 4D walls just a fraction outside the universe on both sides. Done correctly, a normal, 3D human can stroll down there no problem, but no shapeshifter can squeeze in... and it's going to annoy vampires and werewolves like anything, because they can't see /why/ they can't squeeze in. (I imagine it'll feel like some kind of invisible anti-vampire wall...)

#+begin_quote
  But he would absolutely work under some behavioral laws, and be 'programmed' not to mind them. They're obviously not /too/ rigid as he's had time for a family and hobbies and whatnot, but hey, who cares if the help have hobbies as long as they're there when the vampire hunters come, right?
#+end_quote

Sounds sensible. Plus, having hobbies gives him something more to fight for.

#+begin_quote
  Probably a good idea; he was at one point the guardian of a large cathedral, and the resident vampire took a liking to him, 'reprogrammed' him by casting the right spell at the right time, and, well, the rest is history as they say.
#+end_quote

The right spell being the Atlantean equivalent of "login: root password: ******** command: Protect me, maximum priority" or something along those lines, I take it.

What happens if some of his programmed desires conflict? Such as, for example, if he has to protect a vampire but also has a lower-level compulsion to kill vampires? Does he take up hunting other vampires as a hobby?

#+begin_quote
  Probably the best idea. His power requirements can be so great that he really needs the full amount of daylight to be sufficiently charged, but in an emergency he can change with no problem. That said, he is made of sandstone, and I'm not sure there's a universe in which solar cells could look identical to sandstone? (I guess in a universe where sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic?)
#+end_quote

Yeah, these are definitely going to have to be "sufficiently advanced" solar cells.

#+begin_quote
  This is probably one of the 'features' of him having a human form at all, which I still haven't got a super good explanation for.
#+end_quote

- He was intended as a protector for his builder's daughter. Like all little girls, she loved dressing up dolls, so the builder made sure he had a humanoid form, suitable for being dressed up.

- His builder expected that he would occasionally be required to wear a tuxedo (or equivalently formal outfit) and serve drinks.

- He was built with the expectation that he would be occasionally tracking down humans. His builder didn't want people to be able to escape him by running into an eight-foot tunnel.

- Most weapons and equipment are designed to be wielded by human-shaped limbs. His builder wanted to make sure he could use such items if necessary. (It's a pain to pull a trigger with a wicked, curved claw, after all).

(Note that none of this requires him to be anywhere near average human height... and as a security guard, being /huge/ is better for intimidation in any case).

#+begin_quote
  maybe his 'creator' just wiped all his memories from the past 70,000 years so he'd work better?
#+end_quote

Huh. Now, /that's/ quite a plot hook.

#+begin_quote
  How fast would it be? Hmm. An arm weighs about 4kg, and takes two days to regenerate
#+end_quote

************************************************************************************************************** OK, the shirt thing is complicated, and we worked out there were two ways you could do it: you could invent a physics explanation, involving transforming beings creating a localised "4D field" for wont of a better word, and that would result in the clothes tearing as you described. Or, without the particular physics explanation my husband thought was cool, you end up with what I described.

#+begin_quote
  This implies that it somehow 'sticks' to the three-dimensional surface of our world - and the occupant of those clothes, sliding four-dimensionally through them, is not going to provide anything like the force necessary to overcome that stickiness. Rather, the clothes will 'fall' around the three-dimensional body.
#+end_quote

Basically, the analogy we had was imagine if you were visiting Flatland and you were using your finger as your Flatland avatar. You buy a piece of flatlander clothing to put around your finger, wrapping it around your finger and clipping it in place. Then if you move so much as a micron up or down, your clothing 'disappears', but it remains clipped to that part of your finger. Think of a rubber band.

If you wanted to have your finger stay in Flatland a lot and didn't want to go to the trouble of holding it exactly at the correct angle, you could grab a glove from the 3D world and put it on, so it would look like you were wearing a piece of flatlander clothing all the time. You could also ask a tailor in Flatland to make you a big piece of circular cloth with a slit cut in it, walk your finger into the center of it, and then repair the slit so your finger is "stuck" inside a disc of cloth. Then you pull your finger up and the cloth drapes around you, clipping it into place, to sort of make a "white sheet ghost costume" style piece of clothing for your finger. The 3D analog to this would be creating a sphere (out of something like diamond, probably) with a hole in it, climbing inside it, closing the hole in it around your body, and then moving in the fourth dimension so the sphere covers each 3D 'cross section' of your 4D body, morphsuit-style. You could then have someone paint each 3D 'frame' of the 'morphsuit' so it looks 'clothing-like' and cut holes in the head/hands/feet so it looks more socially acceptable, if you wanted to spend time on that.

If your tail appearing through a wooden door can push the door into the 4th dimension and then when the tail disappears again, the door 'snaps back', then moving 'up' in 4D space will push your clothing into the 4th dimension since it's fastened to you. Don't forget, a 4D being has so much mass that they have the momentum to do this.

It also means that you can kill someone by pushing them into the 4th dimension, or by having your tail go through them, etc. It also means that if you transform, anyone who is hugging you might asphyxiate.

#+begin_quote
  I'll trust his calculations, but if the mass of a 4D being is the mass of the entire 4D being and not just the current 3D slice, then the bat-form vampire is going to weigh exactly the same as the human-form vampire. And whichever way round you handle that, it just isn't going to work.

  I recommend going with the claim that there are no Higgs bosons in 4D space if anyone asks, and just treat the creature as if it were the mass of the slice currently in the 3D universe.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I should have been clearer; this was always the plan. You can have a 4D 10^{13} -human-mass vampire/bat hybrid, but "in real life" they only weigh the amount that their 3D slice weighs - so basically exactly what you'd expect. It would mean, though, that when moving in the 4th dimension they have a lot of momentum.

Possibly. I'd look at it as basically one of Asimov's classic robot stories; lots of room for interpretation. However, the gargoyle has free will, a family, etc. At one point, his master was about to eat his girlfriend (who was snooping around his master's quarters), and he attacked his master to save her - though canonically this happened right before the binding spell was due to be strengthened, so he was probably at an unusually high "free will" level.

  You buy a piece of flatlander clothing to put around your finger ... Think of a rubber band.
#+end_quote

Huh. I didn't look at it like that.

But there's still something else to consider. What you describe there is /tight/ clothing. Now, consider /loose/ clothing; a loop of Flatland cloth that encircles your finger but does not hold tightly to it. It follows your finger around, because as you push your finger back and forth you drag it along; but because it's not tight, it stays in Flatland when you move your finger up and down.

Considering these two analogies, it would seem to me that /tight/ clothing moves with the shape as you described, while /loose/ clothing is left in the normal 3D world. This has a few consequences:

- The gargoyle's clothing never tears. If he wears loose clothing and shifts, then the clothing stays in the normal 3D world as he grows inside it, /until/ it is sufficiently tight; then he drags it away with him. (This would presumably mean that different articles of clothing disappear at different times). On shifting back to human, the various articles of clothing are briefly visible at the points along the transformation that they are stuck on. (He can, with care, take them off and them put them on again in his human form)

- Vampires, who turn to much smaller bats, tend to leave loose clothing behind. Consider a vampire, dressed in a tight swimming costume, and over that wearing a loose robe with a hood. When he turns into a bat, the swimming costume will stay on his human form; while the robe will collapse theatrically around him. He can then crawl out of the robe and fly away; when he turns back, he'll still be wearing the swimming costume.

- If the vampire from the last bullet point turns into a bat, then crawls up the sleeve of the robe, then turns back, then at some point during his transformation the sleeve will count as "tight" and he'll pull the robe out of normal 3D space. Unlike the gargoyle, he's going to have a lot of trouble getting the robe back, because he's /not/ a native 4D creature... (Actually, come to think of it, he'll pull the /sleeve/ out, but if he's only pulling it a few nanometres out of the universe, then he'll only drag a little of the robe out of the universe with him; he's going to have half a robe following him everywhere...)

#+begin_quote

If he has to protect them both, by his rules, then he /can/ attack the Master at any stage - free will or no - as long as he uses minimum necessary force to prevent the Master from damaging something he has to protect. (Asimov's robots could do the same - they could not /harm/ a human, but if Stabby Mcstabberton the murderer is trying to stab someone, they could certainly grab his wrist and take his knife away, even if this led to his wrist being lightly bruised, because preventing a stabbing is worth a light bruising).

I'll provisionally accept this, though I think tight encompasses anything that is securely fastened to the body. For example, a pair of pants with the belt tightly cinched around the waist. In Flatland, imagine them 'nailing' a loose-fitting coat to one side of your finger - it would stay, though it might flop around weirdly as you describe with bats.

Combines theatrical with practical, perfect for vampires (and now I have another transformation scene to retouch, probably). I agree that something like a robe that is 'draped' on the body rather than 'fastened' to it would be a concern. For vampires, who transform to bats rarely, they probably don't base their clothing choices around it. A gargoyle might though, preferring clothing that is tight and stretchy; kind of like the Hulk's magic pants.

Also, my husband raised the possibility that rather than being a 'line', beings with transformations exist in a 'torus', so someone with 3 forms can go between any of them at will. I'm quite fond of this, and it means that e.g. you could keep a cop's outfit 1nm "up" and a business suit 1nm "down" and have access to lots of quick disguises.

OMG. What a disaster! On a practical point of view though, the vampire stuck in his robe sleeve will transform back into human form and then cut the robe off his body, and then whatever bit he doesn't want to cut to (and hey, he could just cut a 1cm slice of his, say, butt off to make sure he's done with it).

Also going to have big problems with reality looking weird to normies, though werewolves are rare enough (shit, let's think. The incidence is something like 0.005% of the general population, but only ~25% of those are going to know that they're werewolves).

And if /that's/ not bad enough, every time that gargoyle sees him, the stupid gargoyle starts laughing! What on earth does he find so /funny?/

Nano is, what 10^{-9?} And let's say ten seconds for the transformation, and a 1nm transform thickness. Then you're talking 0.1nm/s velocity, thus [ 10^{13} * 10^{-10} ] or a momentum difference by a factor of 10^{3} or around 1000.

...okay, so it still works out to a huge difference. (But by juggling 4D thickness and transformation time, you can pretty much set that momentum to any value you want; put the 4D thickness in femtometers and you'll have a shapeshifting momentum that's horrible tiny)

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't have to protect his girlfriend - he just /wants/ to.
#+end_quote

Fair enough. If his preprogrammed rules just say "No harm may come to the Master" then he can still attack at any time, as long as he doesn't actually cause any harm - deliberate or not.

And yes, that justification works.

I don't know if you're familiar with a webcomic called Freefall? There are a number of characters (including robots and at least one genetically engineered wolf) who are constrained by Asimov's three laws. At one point, said wolf saw a human threaten a non-human friend of hers with a knife (a rubber knife, but she didn't know that) and promptly restrained the attacker because "running with knives is dangerous, you could do yourself an injury".

(At another point, she asks "I'm supposed to save any human in imminent danger of death, right? No matter how they got there? So... is it normal for me to fantasise about breaking into Death Row and freeing all the prisoners there?")

I'm imagining the gargoyle's hand would not need to vanish for this to happen. If you were interacting with a flatlander in a similar situation using your left index finger as your avatar, you could use your right hand to pick the piece of flatlander fabric off their projection in 3D space, and then throw it onto Flatland in front of your finger, say. So the gargoyle could use one of his other projections (e.g. the 'cross-section' that's 'parallel' to the sleeved-bat) to grab the sleeve, and pass it 'down' the conga line of his projections into the 3D universe, which would result in the vampire feeling the odd tug, and a piece of torn fabric appearing out of thin air bit by bit.

That sounds really cool - I should check it out. It's been a long time since I've read a new webcomic.

Also, we have a new character concept now: you know eldritch horrors, how they're meant to be indescribable and make you go mad? They're clearly a 4D creature with a lot of forms that just doesn't stay still, the same way that if we stuck our finger in flatland we would have a really hard time holding it level and our finger would seem to change texture and size quite unnervingly to a native flatlander.

So the gargoyle's long-lost wife is such a creature, going looking for her husband. She has thousands or millions of forms with no, or very very thin, intermediate slices, including many of the biblical "angel" forms that are quite terrifying (one is apparently a [[https://www.google.com.au/search?q=ophanim&safe=off][wheel of eyes]]?), relatively normal creatures, human forms, demon forms, inanimate objects, etc. But none of it has any structure because she's moving between them too quickly to tell.

You can see the sort of things that would happen:

"Oh my god what the hell is that thing"

"I'm sorry, I forget your people can only see a fraction of my true form. Let me hold still."

(her form stops undulating and she becomes a perfectly normal looking box of petunias)

  That's really cool, I'm trying to picture it - the monster is undulating, changing around, parts appearing and disappearing and his pants are amongst them.

Thinking about it, if he's only pulling the belted part of his pants a few nanometres away from our normal 3D universe, then most of the legs are going to stay there anywhere, surely?

  Ah, my headcanon is that vampires can't turn into bats until they're more than 1000 years old,
#+end_quote

Oh. Yeah, that /does/ reduce the odds of going joyflying. Not necessarily because they're too dignified (you get some /very/ undignified eighty-year-olds), but because they're far more set in their ways and trying to be careful not to be caught out by a surprise dawn.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. Hmmm. I wonder what you'd need to fabricate in order to have pants that keep you modest. I doubt a 5,000 year old gargoyle cares much who sees his dingus though, so he's unlikely to go to trouble.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. The first thought I have is a "bedsheet ghost" type costume.

Refining that slightly, I thought of a poncho - too big on his human form, barely modest on his gargoyle form.

Then I thought some kind of robe, with straps and belts, which takes several minutes to put on in his human form - but pull the right cord, and it unfolds almost instantly into a gargoyle-sized poncho.

[[/notfabulous][]] Certainly a challenge for any clothing designer, but perhaps not /entirely/ insurmountable.

#+end_quote

Fair enough. (Or perhaps it's just for formal occasions).

#+begin_quote
  So the gargoyle could use one of his other projections (e.g. the 'cross-section' that's 'parallel' to the sleeved-bat) to grab the sleeve, and pass it 'down' the conga line of his projections into the 3D universe, which would result in the vampire feeling the odd tug, and a piece of torn fabric appearing out of thin air bit by bit.
#+end_quote

It's not a conga line. It's the same hand, it's just a lot more complex in shape than a human hand. But you're right, he doesn't need to take the visible part of his hand out of the universe to reach the fabric. (He might need to in order to move it 'around' the vampire's human shape to get at the fabric... or he might not).

#+begin_quote
  That sounds really cool - I should check it out. It's been a long time since I've read a new webcomic.

#+begin_quote
  Also, we have a new character concept now
#+end_quote

Hmmm. A simple 4D multishifter would be a string - would need to always take the shapes in the same order (geraniums come /between/ whale and giant eagle with glowing eyes).

So I think she'd work better as a /complex/ multishifter. Something with a lot of moving parts that shift and adjust - and because they do so in four dimensions, she can change her mass as well. Perhaps even a cloud of near-molecular nanomachines that hold firmly to each other but can flow like a liquid - including in the 4D directions - and change colour. (She might even be the /origin/ of a lot of mythology). Designed to be able to look like anything - perhaps originally intended as a perfect spy or something...

The gargoyle's son has been known to wear ridiculous outfits to hide his own wings and bat ears, notably including an 80s businesswoman style suit with padded shoulders and a top hat, a Queen's Guard uniform, and yes, a poncho and sombrero so a poncho sounds excellent.

Going further, he probably has some sort of "formal outfit" that is produced by designers in the Demon World (who are likely 4D creatures themselves) that, when put on his 4D form, makes each of his cross-sections look like it's in a tuxedo, say. These would be rare and expensive and only for formal occaisions because can you imagine the dry cleaning bills, especially when you're around blood????

#+begin_quote

Is it really? If we use the "finger in flatland" example, each cross section of my finger is part of the same finger, but, say, the ridges in my fingerprint in one cross section are different ridges to the ridges further down, even though they're part of the same part of my 3D body and perform the same function.

#+begin_quote
  So I think she'd work better as a /complex/ multishifter.
#+end_quote

Thanks for that - not limiting her to a "spoke" 4D creature is an interesting idea. I even like the idea of letting her be at oblique angles. Can you imagine a human, but at a /slight/ 4D angle, so the proportions seem off somehow, but you can't quite put your finger on it? Or a human who is on such a severe 4D angle that they're barely recognisable as a human and seem to have, say, a huge gash showing the inside of their neck.

Not only that, your dry cleaner needs to be able to handle four dimensions as well (so that they can handle that stain sitting just outside the 3D universe). Which implies that either he does his own dry-cleaning, or (more likely) there is exactly /one/ native 4D drycleaner in the Demon World, who charges whatever he wants because he has /absolutely/ no competition.

When I poke my finger into Flatland, the Flatland natives see only a slice of it. They call that slice my finger, but it is not - it is a /slice/ of my finger.

When we see the gargoyle's hand, we're only seeing a /slice/ of the real thing, which we call his hand. Whether he calls the whole 4D organ a 'hand' or a - I don't know - 'meta-hand' or something else, it's still the same thing.

#+begin_quote
  I even like the idea of letting her be at oblique angles. Can you imagine a human, but at a slight 4D angle, so the proportions seem off somehow, but you can't quite put your finger on it?
#+end_quote

...yes, I can. You can check up on the math with your resident expert; but the result should be (assuming she remains "flat", just at a constant angle) a human shape which is stretched out in some arbitrary direction.

Let's say, for sake of example, that she's stretched out vertically. You can find her new height with the good old Pythagorean theorem; her untilted height (let's say two metres) is one of the legs of the triangle, the distance that the head that should correspond with {the feet that are in the 3D universe} is from the 3D universe is the other leg of the triangle (um... a few nanometres). Take the squares of both of these, add them together, and take the square root to find her stretched height...

I am seeing a distinct disadvantage here to having the shifters all only a few nanometres thick. The height distortion caused be her not being flat on the 3D universe seems to be limited to "too small to see".

(The /shape/ distortion, on the other hand - if her feet are "black female" and her head is "white male", then the body between will presumably gradually fade from the one to the other, getting slowly paler with height. With a very little amount of effort, she can presumably use this to mix-and-match parts from various shapes, so you could get a human with half a phoenix wing (disconnected, several centimetres from her back) and three-quarters of a lion's leg or something like that quite easily)

--------------

I thought up a (brief) scene while thinking about this character...

"How small can you get?"

"Um, give me a moment..." /shrinks down to a single eyeball, which drops to the ground/ "How's that?"

"Great! Now -"

"Just a moment, I can't keep my balance like this. Here -" /three more disconnected eyeballs appear, the four forming the points of a tetrahedron a metre on each side/ "- much better."

"Um. I was going to try to hide you in my pocket, but I don't have pockets that far apart..."

Doesn't mean that the hand in the normal 3D universe is doing the same thing as the hand a little off to the side is (but that could be handy, since you can then describe what he's doing that can be seen in a way that allows an alert and knowledgeable reader to work out what he's doing that can't be seen, e.g. when writing from the perspective of someone else).

************************************************************************************************************************ So, I had another thought: the fact a gargoyle is 4D and therefore has x-ray vision beyond even what I think superman can hope for is kind of overpowered.

For example, we're starting the scene where the gargoyle and his friend stumble across the Main Vampire's coffin containing his vombie double while searching through his giant hoard of crap for a macguffin. The problem is, the gargoyle should be able to see the vombie in the coffin that looks just like his master just as clearly as we can see anything on a piece of paper.

The obvious way to limit this would be to say that he's got a limited range and acuity with his 4D vision in the 3D world. After all, if you open the average paperback at your feet you can see the pages but you can't really make out the text. So giving his x-ray vision a practical radius of a few metres, and an absolute radius of maybe 10 metres before it's all too fuzzy, seems like a good workaround. But does it make sense? Something to ponder.

And, how does a creature the weight of a giraffe fly, and also be able to carry a few hundred kilos in payload? He has big wings, but I doubt they're big enough. Can we just say it's magic, or is there a 4D reason it could work? Had a brief discussion with my husband about it last night but it didn't go anywhere.

#+begin_quote

Some drabble from the MacGuffin Quest, should it interest you:

/William has a very important letter to write. When he has to write these important letters, he'll seal himself off for up to a week and end up producing a handwritten document the size of War and Peace, written on vellum, naturally, complete with decorations in the margins. The reason was mentioned only briefly - it sounded as though a pair of rare birds he gifted the Marquess Conyngham a hundred years earlier produced only sterile offspring - but it was an infraction that was apparently worthy of such a letter, and so it was. This happened every year or two, and could not be rushed./

/In the meantime, Red and the gargoyle had been tasked with searching William's extremely large storage room - it is about the size of a football field - for an appropriate gift to accompany the letter./

  The obvious way to limit this would be to say that he's got a limited range and acuity with his 4D vision in the 3D world.
#+end_quote

I'd suggest making it some kind of active radar instead of passive vision. That is, there are no photons outside 3D space - in order to see anything, then, he has to 'ping' in the required direction with some sort of 4D radar. Normally, he's doing this all the time, just in case (but he can turn it off if he wants). This has a few consequences:

- There will be a limited range. (You can pretty much set this where you want). This range can be extended with a brighter 'ping'.
- Anything else that's pinging in 4D space is visible even when he's /not/ pinging, and it's visible at at least twice the normal range (since the 'ping' only has to travel in one direction). Thus, one gargoyle staying silent can easily stay out of radar range of a gargoyle who's continually pinging (but the silent one is going to be unable to see anything /else/ 4D)
- He can't see outside the normal universe in /colour/. (He may be able to see in /texture/). So, if he picks up something interesting or unexpected, he might still want to bring his eyes to bear to get an idea of what it actually looks like in colour.
- Things inside normal 3D space just look like part of the same infinite flat sheet to his 4D sight. So he can't tell you what's inside the next room without opening the door, unless something in there is 4D.

Huh. The first thing I can think of is stilts. Have his human form standing on stilts, mostly outside the normal 3D world except a little twist at the bottom... that seems a touch silly, though, and limits him in height.

I'd rather go with sufficiently advanced Atlantean technology; he doesn't know it himself (due perhaps to the memory wipe), but he has built-in anti-gravity generators which automatically switch on when he flaps his wings.

Yes, but, importantly, people /do/ keep falling for it. And, well, if it's ridiculous but it works...

Of course, the needs of balance mean that she's still four eyeballs in a rough tetrahedron. With three allies moving in more-or-less unison, the three lower ones can hide in three pockets (it doesn't matter if one of them moves a few centimetres back or forth, but if he gets left behind he'll get dragged by his pocket) while the upper eyeball is floating well above most people's line of sight (where they can see it if they just look up, but most people /don't/ just look up... also, they can hide the upper eyeball by disguising it as a helium balloon...)

Let's say that he closes his eyes, covers his ears, and so on and so forth; that he is, for a while, perceiving the universe /only/ via his 4D radar.

The universe looks like a flat sheet. A /perfectly/ flat sheet, with hardly a bump on it to stand out. There are, in fact, three bumps in the area; these being William, William's vombie, and Red - all being vampires, and thus 4D beings, lets them stand out a bit from the flat 3D universe around them. He can see their 4D shapes clearly, no matter what walls may lie between them.

But now consider a number of closed boxes, in the storeroom. /This/ box contains a number of books.

To the gargoyle's 4D radar, the contents look flat and shiny.

/This/ box contains a supply of vintage playing cards.

To the gargoyle's 4D radar, the contents look flat and shiny.

/That/ box contains a selection of antique cuckoo clocks.

To the gargoyle's 4D radar, the contents look flat and shiny.

The box way over there contains a multitude of brightly coloured scarves.

To the gargoyle's 4D radar, the contents look flat and shiny.

...you see what I'm getting at? He can see around ordinary 3D walls, but ordinary 3D objects all look the same - flat and shiny - to his 4D radar. Until he actually opens the box, he can't tell whether it contains books or bricks.

Hmmmmmm. Not really. I can see that he wouldn't see colours, so he could see a book, but he can't see the title unless it's raised/embossed. Where my gap of knowledge starts is: I can read everything that's on a piece of paper, so why can't a 4D creature "read" everything that's on a "3D plane" within his eye range? It's because there's no photons that go from the 3D world to the 4D world, isn't it? Photons definitely don't travel into the 4D world or physics crumbles under the inverse cube law. (Also a reason that Atlantis couldn't be a 4D world and our world is a 3D offshoot universe - physics as we know it just won't work in 4D)

Had another unproductive conversation with my husband about how 4D eyes would see the 3D world, and has resulted in him convincing me that the 'terrible technobabble' explanation of 4D creatures causing one of the 9 dimensions from string theory to 'uncurl' a bit is /apparently/ not only super plausible but super elegant, and could be used to explain magic (he said that if you could change the 9D geometry you could do pretty much any magic you wanted, making light appear, moving things, transformations, etc). He said it was something to do with Kurosaki-yao shapes (just googled it - turns out it's this [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold]] - I do not understand a word of the article so I have to take his word for it.)

I /think/ what my husband was saying is these Calabi-Yau manifolds mean you can have photons stick around to hit the 4D eyes, with some very localised physics breaking (which can also be used to cast spells), and you get the x-ray vision.

It's kind of annoying that x-ray vision is so tricky when to a "layman" like myself (i.e. someone with moderate experience with the implications of a 4D parallel world) the x-ray vision is something that should /obviously/ be there. My co-author/roleplay partner has little tertiary mathematics expertise (she's a biologist) so she's in the "true layman" camp and just thinks all the random consequences of the phyiscs are really neat.

I think I'm going to have to nut this out with him and maybe see if I can get him to help me write something canonical about how it all works as I've reached the very limits of my ability to comprehend. It's great that what is going to be essentially GLBTwilight will have lore based in string theory though, so that's something.

This is pretty much what I'm getting at, with the added conditional that it would need to be raised/embossed in the fourth dimension, which by definition a 3D object isn't.

I'm not saying his 4D radar /has/ to work this way. It /can/ work in ways that allow him to pick up the shape of 3D objects. I'm saying that it /can/ work this way, and this neutralises a lot of the advantages. In short, I'm trying to suggest a way in which it can work, without giving free X-ray vision as a consequence.

I don't know much about Calabi-Yau manifolds either. But one potential niggle strikes at me - if a 4D creature is locally untwisting one of these extra dimensions, then surely the following consequences follow:

- Any magic dependant on this is limited in range to the area of the untwisted space
- The gargoyle's 4D radar will not be able to see through an area that's not untwisted
- As a consequence of the above, the 4D radar can only see another 4D being if they're close enough that their untwisted region overlaps the gargoyle's untwisted region, at which point they're both in range to throw untwist-dependant magic at each other.

Yeah... I think the problem is I want X-Ray vision. Being a gargoyle whose only wish in life is to protect whoever his master is at the time, as well as have a family every few hundred years does not put him in a very powerful position, plot-wise, if that makes sense. The tension is mostly from the vampire hunters vs his master (William), and the head vampire hunter has become a secret jannisary (of William) after a bungled sting operation, which means she's kind of sort of but not really delaying the capturing of the vampire even though they know a LOT about him, ultimately resulting in her taking big risks with a different vampire and getting another character (Red, William's former thrall) killed by a /third/ vampire as a result and thus ultimately turned into a vampire himself. (Not complicated at all, is it?)

My understanding is that the magic itself can untwist it.

That's the problem, we have ambitions of novellising it /at some point/, if only so our parents/partners/etc can read it, but it's hard when taking into account narrative structure and whatnot. Like, we're happy to yadda-yadda over two characters bonding and falling in love and just going straight into the conflict, but in a "real" novel you can't really just say "THREE MONTHS LATER" and skip to the action. And there's so many characters and the narrative just jumps around them based on who is interesting at the time. We probably need to work out an overall story arc, lay it out, write what each character is doing at each point, and then maybe hire an editor or something to help us slot it all in the right places.

I suppose it depends where the energy is coming from. After all, a wizard can shoot a bolt of force at a bad guy, which takes a lot of energy. The wizard might feel tired afterwards but the amount of energy in a force bolt is more than would be in the average person's gylcogen stores.

Glycogen: [[http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/the-bodyrsquos-fuel-sources][about 1500 kcal is stored in the muscles]], a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy][rifle has about 2,000 Joules]] of energy. This is a factor of *3000* in favour of glycogen. If we assume a force bolt is equivalent to the biggest caliber bullet on that chart, the glycogen stores are still bigger by a factor of /200/.

Whether using muscle glycogen for spellcasting is actually reasonable, it's actually a large enough store of energy that the human body could pull it off. Wow!

(Of course it depends how 'easy' it is for magic to 'uncurl' the Calabi-Yau manifold stuff...)

Add in a 4D creature which has several orders of magnitude more mass than a human to store its 4D glycogen analogue and you really have no trouble with the energy requirements IMO, though I'd imagine he might only use his radar when he's actively moving or looking at things.

Make sure to follow the rule of "show, don't tell" as much as is reasonable. /Never/ outright describe how the magic works - rather have a behind-the-scenes set of rules and just apply them as necessary.

#+begin_quote

And yeah, hiring an editor is probably worth the trouble.

#+begin_quote
  I suppose it depends where the energy is coming from.
#+end_quote

We'd previously discussed the idea that the gargoyle's stone form during the day might be in order to allow him to recharge from solar energy. A lot of the energy could come from there.

#+begin_quote
  Glycogen: about 1500 kcal is stored in the muscles, a rifle has about 2,000 Joules of energy. This is a factor of *3000* in favour of glycogen. If we assume a force bolt is equivalent to the biggest caliber bullet on that chart, the glycogen stores are still bigger by a factor of /200/.
#+end_quote

Which means that is the wizard fires off 200 force bolts, he falls over dead. And even a single force bolt means he needs a good 7.5kcal meal to make up the difference.

#+begin_quote
  (Of course it depends how 'easy' it is for magic to 'uncurl' the Calabi-Yau manifold stuff...)
#+end_quote

Yeeeeeeah.... that's going to be tricky. I have absolutely no idea how much energy that would even theoretically take.

It's probably reasonable to make the amount of energy proportional to the area that gets uncurled, and the length of time it is uncurled for. So a mage who uncurls an entire tunnel, then fires a force bolt along it, will use a lot more energy than a mage who fires a force bolt that moves with a 'bubble' of uncurled space. (This implies a more skilled mage will get the same effect with less effort - also, the 'moving bubble' missile means the other guy can't fire a missile back up your tunnel).

Those are all interesting questions to toy with! Emotional harm: probably, but only extreme emotional harm, so he wouldn't be full of white lies (probably total unyielding honesty would be one of his requirements, anyway), so yes, he would have to protect William's allies if reasonable. He wouldn't be required to prevent harm to the vombie; or maybe he is by default, but he would have been given specific instructions to keep the vombie alive but not allow it to harm anyone William wouldn't want to harm.

He's also compelled to obey William's orders. Presumably some sort of Asimovian three laws type scenario is happening in the background, only he's sentient so has the ability to choose to prioritise the third law over a weak second law command, just like in /Runaround/. Of course, no explicit three laws type doctrine is actually there, just it's a good way of thinking about this.

#+begin_quote

I worry about that. I don't enjoy reading our logs if we gloss over things that I consider would be necessary to include to establish later scenes - then again, I suppose that would come under "tell your story", since "ignore narrative structure" does not mean "throw everything to the wind and just do a highlight reel".

Added to that there's no "one story", things start and stop and run parallel to each other and it ends up looking kind of like /Sense8/ in that you have multiple narratives happening independently of each other but also sometimes dependently. Characters who are protaganists in some plots are antagonists in others (which is great for having a well-developed, rational antagonist). I suppose part of the process is to select a narrative to choose, stick to it, and then write subsequent narratives as new "books" rather than try to make /The Lord of The Rings/ on the first try.

So the same would go for the vombie - even if he is required to protect the vombie, he is permitted to restrain it (and if the vombie would harm William's protege, I'd argue that the gargoyle would be /compelled/ to restrain the vombie).

The interesting question here is whether or not the gargoyle would be able to allow the vombie to be re-staked.

#+begin_quote
  He's also compelled to obey William's orders.
#+end_quote

Can William order him to harm William?

Consider what happens if William gets his foot caught in a bear trap shortly before dawn. If the gargoyle cuts off the foot, then William can get to safety before sunrise; if not, the rising sun will kill him.

Is the gargoyle:

1. Unable to harm William by cutting off his foot? (Or, worse, constrained to prevent anyone else from doing so as well?)
2. Able to cause temporary harm now in order to prevent greater harm?
3. Forced to take a third option of some sort (e.g. wrapping his wings around William to block out all light before turning to stone for the day)?

And can orders from William change which of these options the gargoyle can take?

#+begin_quote
  (Sorry I forgot to reply to this section before btw!)
#+end_quote

No worries.

#+begin_quote
  I worry about that. I don't enjoy reading our logs if we gloss over things that I consider would be necessary to include to establish later scenes - then again, I suppose that would come under "tell your story", since "ignore narrative structure" does not mean "throw everything to the wind and just do a highlight reel".
#+end_quote

Yeah, you can always go back and edit those scenes in later, but it's probably best to include them from the start. But you shouldn't let some arbitrary rules get in the way of your story.

#+begin_quote
  Added to that there's no "one story", things start and stop and run parallel to each other
#+end_quote

Yes, there are /lots/ of stories like that. Some of them unify the disparate scenes by having some sort of overarching theme running through the whole thing, others have the separate plot threads all weave into a single story (or at least all crash into each other in one big climactic scene), while others just have them weave through each other. There's lots of ways to do it.

#+begin_quote
  I suppose part of the process is to select a narrative to choose, stick to it, and then write subsequent narratives as new "books"
#+end_quote

That could also work very well.

(/Lord of the Rings/ is a very hard goal to reach. Are you paying attention to the phase of the moon throughout your story? Tolkien did...)

#+begin_quote
  This is something we're pretty bad at (why last night we did a whole, very explicit explanation of vombies - but the protegé asked and William was not going to lie about it - though this stuff can always happen off-screen if it doesn't directly help the narrative).
#+end_quote

Having characters describe stuff is fine. They're limited by their knowledge of the subject (though I expect William is very knowledgeable on this matter) and are allowed to get it wrong on occasion, of course.

It just shouldn't be over-done, but it's fine used sparingly.

#+begin_quote

  It's worth considering that the emotional harm from finding out about the lies would almost always exceed the emotional harm prevented by the lies in the first place
#+end_quote

It's semi-autobiographical. My boyfriend informed me very early on that he won't lie to me, except when lying is part of a board game. We were having problems partly because of that horrible honesty, he wouldn't do the white lies that are sometimes necessary for a relationship to function. So I told him he could start lying. And he did. It lasted a couple of hours before I realised that as much as I hated the honesty, it was really, really great to be able to trust everything he said implicitly, and now he was explicitly able to lie I just couldn't trust a word he said anymore.

So while I have problems with lying - in that I do it /a lot/ and really feel I can't help it sometimes - I think absolute unyielding honesty is a really great feature for a relationship, especially for what is literally a master/slave type relationship.

#+begin_quote

He not only allowed it but encouraged it, so I guess he mustn't see the vombie as the same person. Makes sense - if he was owned by a human who was an identical twin, it wouldn't make sense for him to obey/protect both of them.

This is like the "would a vegetarian eat a pig on a desert island" question in that it would never happen in real life where that was the only two options; in the situation at hand, the gargoyle would be more likely to rip the trap out of the ground, William could cut off his own foot, etc.

But to answer it in the trolley problem spirit in which it was asked, the gargoyle is effectively a really, really good friend who wants what's best for William.

#+begin_quote

Glycogen is basically sugar that is stored in your muscles so that it can quickly be used when you move them, without having to call on reserves from elsewhere in the body. When you get tired during exercise, that's because the glycogen stores in the muscles you used have run out (also not a doctor but that's how I remember it). It's basically your body's quick source of energy, while fat is the "slow source".

Alternatively, he doesn't see staking a vampire as (significantly) harming it, since the stake can be removed at any time and the vampire's back up to full strength in moments. (This may have implications for William; if William gets /too/ far on the gargoyle's bad side, the gargoyle might be able to stake him and then guard his unconscious body without actually breaking his own rules).

I read an article a while back, centered around the idea that the ability of magic to solve problems for the protagonists should be directly proportional to how well explained it is.

That is to say, unexplained magic should only ever cause /problems/ for the protagonist. (Example; Lord of the Rings, Gandalf's magic is never really all that well explained, but how often does he use it to the benefit of the protagonists? And when he does - to stop the Balrog - there's a cost; Gandalf is immediately gone.) On the other hand, the protagonist should only ever be able to get out of trouble using magic that has been fully explained to the reader. In advance.

I think that's a good guide on when to or not to use exposition of your magic system.

January's good for me! No university, work will be relatively quiet, and all the Christmas stuff is over. Thanks for that. My roleplay partner will also be writing an action/friendship story from the same universe so we'll be editing and reading each other's stuff, which will hopefully be really good encouragement. I'll have to get an outline sorted, since there's a lot of history stuff I want to put in, questions to ask myself. Like, the story is about a vampire (William) who as a human was the king of the Frankish people circa 580 CE; we pick his story up in ~1940 when he meets a young defecting American soldier (Red), they fall in love, Red becomes a thrall, decides he doesn't like the implicit slavery, ultimately ends up becoming a vampire, because while dying he begs William to turn him, and they both have a hard time adjusting to that. I kind of want to have a prolog with William's life/death, or maybe use a literary device of flashbacks, or something, or should I just keep it from Red's angle of vision so we can start in the 1940s and not really delve all that much????

Not very, but how important is anything for the reader? I mean, I write it because I find it interesting, and I find William's past interesting - but I've been invested in William in one guise or another for 15 years so, you know, I'm a special case.

He's a pretty tropey vampire though, except that he's a devout catholic - though non-practicing, and, um, a practising bisexual, so that's a bit odd. But he probably has very different ideas about love, relationships, and sexuality based on where he grew up and also the intervening 1500 years of immortality. Would vampire society be more socially progressive? My incarnation of it is very, very strict, full of symbolism, but with some red in tooth and claw stuff in there too. I suppose a series of powerful vampires would just keep on adding things to the list of rules, which most everyone is intelligent enough to remember, so you could build a whole bunch of crap like that up.

Hmmmm. Looking into alchemical history, I see that silver was associated with the moon, while gold was associated with the sun. Hmmmmmm. Would have worked out better the other way round.

It could always turn our that silver is a sort of magical conductor (you'd have particularly ancient or powerful runes being made of silver) so that stabbing a vampire with a silver dagger is a bit like dropping a computer in water - it conducts all the energy to the wrong places and makes it stop working properly.

Or the old alchemists got it backwards, and silver is harmful due to having a sympathetic link to the Sun.

No, it would almost certainly be more conservative in just about every way, I think.

Of course, they also don't really answer to human social pressure, so there will be a strong strain of independence running through them.

It's not a dose-response as vampires get more sensitive to the sun with time. Does the moon have magical properties that removes the curse from the sunlight?

(Werewolves have nothing to do with the moon in this universe, so no need to worry about our lupine friends).

You know what - we're not wedded to silver being the vampire-killing-metal except by folklore. Maybe we can just retroactively make all silver into gold, then the alchemy kind of makes sense - or perhaps the alchemists got it backwards like you said. Gold makes anti vampire nets fabulously expensive, and, well, gold is pretty useless for things like daggers and knives because it's soft. If we go for gold, how pure would it need to be? I suppose the purer the more of an effect.

Let's back up - if we want a metal that is bad for vampires and can be used similarly to silver, can we, from first principles, think of something that would make sense? Iron might be an interesting choice as I think it's the heaviest thing that stellar fusion will produce before going nova, but it's also far too common - though giving iron magical properties will make anti vampire combat more.... accessible to the common man, and dangerous for a vampire.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, that's what I'm a bit afraid of. They say scientific advances get accepted when everyone who fought against them dies. Then again, the underground society has different sexual and social mores, and vampires would be exposed to /that/ in short order, so they are not just influenced by humans, at least - and maybe finding out that centaur society has a 4:1 m:f ratio, and high ranking females have about 10 husbands, among other things, would have a certain influence on vampire society on its own too. Or maybe the vampires will clutch their pearls in horror; who knows.

I guess you could spin it this way: vampire society /is/ more conservative, only what they've conserved from their "original" (i.e. atlantis 70 000 BCE) society is what we find very liberal today. New vampires are quickly given a culture shock but eventually manage to fit in.

If you'll excuse the terminology: human society slowly deviated from vampire society to become more "right wing", because of slavery or farming or something, and has slowly been deviating back to "left wing" ever since, maybe oscillating about like a sine wave.

  how does the moon, which is lit up with sunlight, not kill a vampire?
#+end_quote

Hmmm. It's not just the moon. Let us say that Tom Swift (human) is standing in the middle of a brightly-lit street at noon, looking at the vampire's mansion, and he sees the vampire looking out from a darkened, shadowy window. The vampire's not in /direct/ sunlight, but the sunlight hitting Tom's face is being reflected back at the window - surely the vampire doesn't die just because he can see Tom.

So. Thinking about this, what if it's not the light that does anything at all? The vampires are damaged by anything that's /associated/ with the Sun or solar magic (fire, perhaps gold). So how about if, instead of /light/ being what damages the vampire, it's the /image of the Sun/?

Direct sunlight, focused by a lens onto a suitable surface, produces an image of the Sun. So /direct/ sunlight, in essence, contains that image; any surface on which direct sunlight falls is being assaulted with millions of tiny pictures of the Sun. Even a small speck of sunlight. (Large areas contain millions of overlapping images). Reflecting it from a good reflector (like a mirror) preserves that image, and thus is still lethal to vampires; but reflecting it off the Moon (or Tom's face) destroys the image of the Sun, leaving just harmless light.

(Of course, the vampires themselves are - at least most of them - unaware of this subtlety)

This has a consequence, that a vampire will burn when coming in contact with a sufficiently detailed picture of the Sun. (Your average "yellow circle with rays coming out" isn't going to make the cut - as a rule of thumb, I'd say it needs to be detailed enough to make out the sunspots, which means that even an image taken with an ordinary camera will be insufficient, but (say) a poster hanging in an astronomy lab, showing a very detailed photo of the Sun, will burn a vampire that touches it (worse, if it's a small enough picture, then it leaves a burn on the vampire which is /itself/ a complete image of the Sun, so the burn itself keeps eating through him like acid until he cuts off that limb. I can imagine a completely oblivious astronomer who's gained an entirely undeserved reputation as a powerful vampire hunter, simply because he has a novelty doorknob that's an accurate carving of the sun, and every vampire that grabs it ends up dead unless he cuts off his hand (and the astronomer has no idea why he sometimes hears screaming outside his door, but there's always just a pile of ash out there when he opens it). Or maybe he has a gold ring, with a really accurate image of the Sun on it - in gold - in place of a stone (a gift from his faculty, perhaps) which causes similar problems every time he shakes a vampire's hand... which really frightens the astronomer because he has no idea why this guy's suddenly lying on the floor, grabbing his own wrist, and screaming, so he naturally calls an ambulance)).

Incidentally, vampires are /very/ lucky that photons don't travel outside the normal 3D universe, or they wouldn't be able to hide from sunlight at all.

#+end_quote

Silver is an element. As a general rule, if you want an "element with similar properties", look for other elements in the same column in the periodic table.

For silver, this means copper or gold. (Or Roentgenium, which is one of these elements which has to be created artificially and was only discovered in 1994, so we can discard that one, I think).

If gold is what's harmful to vampires, then some very forward-thinking vampires have probably been spending several centuries carefully corrupting the mythology - spreading rumours that it's actually silver which is use.

That's an interesting thought - not sure if I go for it yet. It's very complicated, though it need not 'face the reader' as such.

It seems cleaner that the act of reflecting off the moon, someone's face, hey, even a mirror degrades the sunlight in some way (like I said, I don't think mirrors need to be allowed). The big problem with that is that vampires should still be burned through glass.

#+begin_quote

This is interesting. The sun does not just produce visible light, but infrared, ultraviolet, etc. Given this, there's no reason a picture of the sun that's accurate /solely in the visible spectrum/ would burn a vampire - the other stuff the sun produces is just as bad (though - do the sun's radio waves get stopped by the shadow of the earth at night? Its neutrinos certainly wouldn't, though those aren't electromagnetic radiation).

I think you could say that everything the sun produces - radio waves, visible light, ultraviolet, etc have to combine in just the right ratios - ratios that are unique to sol's particular elemental makeup - to kill a vampire.

Gold seems to work quite well though, for its sympathy with the sun and for its position near silver on the periodic table. Plus, it's kind of an interesting restriction to put on them.

No need to fit in with humans, but yes with other vampires, who have cultural baggage from before written language was rediscovered. I like that. Especially because you'd imagine that many vampires would spend a few decades at least, early on, doing all sorts of high risk activities that they never got the opportunity to do as humans. After all, when your family has been dead for centuries, and there's no need for you to marry and continue the royal bloodline - it's continuing fine without you, or it did until that pesky French revolution - then of course you're going to pursue those things that make you happy.

That's also reasonable, and it allows you to disallow mirrors.

Image-of-the-sun means that mirrors must work, but... hmmm. How reflective is the average mirror to ultraviolet, infrared, and other non-visible frequencies?

Nah, they can't; you can harvest sperm and eggs for however long you could harvest them from a corpse I guess. I was just thinking you could harvest eggs from a female vampire if you wanted to, but you probably couldn't with modern technology - although the eggs exist from birth, they still need to go through some changes to be 'ready' for ovulation. Same as sperm and the primary spermatocytes. So I think probably with the technology in say 50 years time (less probably) a suitably motivated vampire would be able to have some of their original germ cells extracted and matured in vitro to create a test tube baby with an appropriate surrogate.

Their human body is effectively completely dead, their digestive system just ferments the magical blood so it can be used to make the next vampire (by making an incision and vomiting gross goo into their aorta). All the work is done by the heart and brain.

The nice thing about it is that it /works/, at least in terms of passing through glass or reflecting off the moon, and it does so for consistent (albeit less-than-obvious) reasons.

Not /just/ Fort Knox. Banks all around the world! And then, of course, vampires can't handle gold coins - once upon a time, this just meant that they had their ghoul carry the money pouch, but in modern times it's a major driver behind the development of paper money, credit cards, and the watering down of the amount of gold in coins. (Vampires do /not/ like the idea of a rich man having a pocket full of anti-vampire weapons)

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  I was just thinking you could harvest eggs from a female vampire if you wanted to, but you probably couldn't with modern technology
#+end_quote

It's worth remembering that we've already established that a given vampire might have access to technology (in a narrow field) a few years ahead of what's available to baseline humans. So a vampire who /really/ wants children and is willing to put in the effort in biology might be able to manage it (but do you let a jannissary be the surrogate, or would the drugs injected into the jannissary as part of the feeding process have a negative effect on the child? Do you have your jannissaries kidnap a surrogate?) But such children would presumably still be infants in modern times, because even a really motivated vampire hasn't had the technology /that/ long.

Either way, the child would simply have half the DNA of the human that the vampire used to be, and would be human in every way; no messing around with half-vampires. (Though a doting vampire parent would presumably change her child into a vampire before he or she dies of old age - whether this is done in infancy or whether the vampire waits for the child to reach adulthood first will depend on the vampire).

#+end_quote

It's not the sight; it's having the image somehow come into contact with the vampire. (Same thing would happen if they actually touched the Sun, but for obvious reasons no vampire has ever actually done that).

But there's precedence in stories about magic - specifically, sympathetic magic. The idea is that things that look alike have a certain degree of magical linkage, and the more alike they look the stronger the link. Harry Dresden used something of the sort when he created a scale model of Chicago to scry with; and the idea of the voodoo practitioner sticking needles in a doll to give the linked person debilitating pain is also linked to this.

In this case, the Sun is cursed - and very strongly cursed - where vampires are concerned; so things that share a sympathetic or magical link with the Sun (i.e. fire, gold (more alchemical than sympathetic, perhaps) and accurate images of the sun) are all harmful to vampires. And the stronger the link, the stronger the effect - gold that's /on fire/ will kill vampires faster than either gold or fire on their own. (Gold that's on fire and looks exactly like the Sun is just overkill).

Okay, so negative effect, yes, but minor. Still, a vampire who goes to /that/ amount of effort just to get a child is going to want /everything/ to be just /pErFeCt!!!!/

...which means tht the surrogate can be neither jannissary or ghoul. And... there might not be another parent, the child would quite possibly be a straight clone of the vampire. (If there is another "parent", the selection process will be exhaustive, and he'll probably be a Nobel prize winner or Olympic athlete or both and might not know that his DNA has been harvested).

Options include:

- Kidnap someone. Jannissaries in local law enforcement will keep the investigation(s) away.
- The surrogate does not know that the backer is a vampire, she just knows he's really rich and willing to pay off all her debts in exchange for nine months of discomfort and having to follow the provided diet.
- The surrogate was briefly in a hospital where some of the doctors are jannissaries. She does not know the child is not hers (and may or may not be expending significant effort trying to figure out how there could possibly have been a father)
- The surrogate is aware of vampires (and that the parent is one) and has a very good idea of what will happen to her if she objects to anything. Fear keeps her obedient.

After the baby is born, I guess the surrogate might or might not be permitted to leave alive... in some circumstances, the surrogate might end up being a kind of foster parent as well (what vampire really wants to deal with dirty nappies?)

#+begin_quote
  When it comes to plant magic, the sun is associated with a number of flowers and herbs, including sunflowers, daisies, dandelions, chamomile and rosemary. Use these in your workings for a bit of extra solar mojo.

You don't need a wealthy family.

Nah, you'd want a wealthy family because they're wealthy/intelligent/stable and thus have the appropriate qualities to raise Your Special Child. For example, say you have some trailer park hillbillies - give them a few million dollars and they still might not send Your Special Child to the best private school or feed them the healthiest foods, and moreover they might just go the way of most lottery winners and end up worse off than before.

Ah, good point - you need a family with a certain approach to wealth. You could still pick a surrogate with the right approach, but who had recently (say) been made a pauper by a bad divorce and her husband having better lawyers and then pull the "wealthy uncle" trick if necessary - or if they're about to send your child to the second-best university because they can't quite afford the very best or similar - which means that attitude towards money is more important than actual access to money.

How/why do stakes work? They have to be wood. Looks like wood is an element in traditional chinese philosophy. So are fire and gold. This is... interesting and I think I'm going to try and run with it! We add earth and water to round out the set. Earth = vampire's body (flesh), which turns to dust maybe; water = blood, naturally.

Fortunately, though each element has a planet, none of them have the sun as their planet. Fire is associated with the heart though which is neat.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing]]

The philosophy has two phases: generating and controlling, which are on the left and right of the table below.

| Chinese               | Vampire              |  | Chinese              | Vampire             |
|-----------------------+----------------------+--+----------------------+---------------------|
| Wood feeds fire;      | -                    |  | Wood parts earth;    | Wood splits flesh   |
| Fire creates earth;   | Fire creates flesh   |  | Earth absorbs water; | Flesh absorbs blood |
| Earth bears gold;     | Flesh bears gold     |  | Water quenches fire; | Blood quenches fire |
| Gold collects water;  | Gold collects blood  |  | Fire melts gold;     | Fire melts gold     |
| Water nourishes wood. | Blood nourishes wood |  | Gold chops wood.     | Gold chops wood     |

* Nourishing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: nourishing
  :END:
Wood feeds fire: self explanatory.

Fire creates flesh: implies that creating a vampire involves setting something on fire. I'm OK with this. It makes reproducing a dangerous thing for a vampire to attempt.

Flesh bears gold: ??? Maybe a parable about ancient mages making gold and the sun sympathetic to each other, thus "creating" the power of gold

Gold collects(creates) blood: Gold 'hurts' a vampire by causing bruising as the flesh turns to blood, maybe?

Blood nourishes wood: Rather than creating wood, blood from a vampire's heart soaks into the stake and so is unable to power the vampire's organs, creating the torpor. This also implies that a stake is somehow empowered by the blood in some way; maybe planting a stake soaked with vampire blood will make your crops grow? Who knows.

* Destroying
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: destroying
  :END:
Wood splits flesh: Pretty clear that the wood has a bad impact on the vampire's fleshy body due to the stake.

Flesh absorbs blood: The vampire drinks blood, to live and all.

Blood quenches fire: Not sure on this one. Perhaps this is meant literally, or, metaphorically, a vampire can survive in a fire (or sunlight, gold) as long as she can continue drinking blood?

Fire melts gold: Gold that has been burned is harmless to a vampire, perhaps; maybe flesh bears gold means that gold, once burned, is harmless, but once it touches human flesh it becomes dangerous again (too complicated. flesh means vampire in other places, why not here?)

Gold chops wood: Pretty self explanatory.

* Conclusion:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: conclusion
  :END:
Probably most of the Wu Xing stuff can be thrown out. After all, no ancient society got it all right when it comes to magic, so why should the Chinese be any better? Things I like:

- Fire creates flesh: the final step in the ritual of creating a vampire is to burn the human corpse.

- Gold creates blood: a vampire is harmed by gold because it causes flesh to turn into blood, essentially it makes bruises and destroys muscle.

- Blood nourishes wood: a stake sends a vampire into torpor by essentially being a giant blood sponge. This causes the stake to have some cool magic properties afterwards.

- Flesh absorbs blood: vampires gotta drink blood

Fire injures vampires; it /destroys/ flesh.

There are two things in that table that fire destroys; wood, and gold. It might make more sense to cast the vampire's flesh under 'wood'...

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

What kind of gold are you using? Gold's soft. It doesn't keep an edge. Attempting to cut down a tree with a golden axe will just get you a blunt axe (assuming you can even /lift/ the thing, gold is /heavy/).

...

Looking at the wiki page, it looks like the Chinese philosophy uses "metal" as a category instead of "gold" - which makes more sense here, because while gold is certainly a type of metal, most metals will chop wood.

...okay. Here's my thoughts. Mythological vampires don't just sleep in a coffin for fun, sometimes they actually recover by being buried in a grave. So "earth" already has a place in vampire mythology. As does water (especially running water...)

So. Vampires are harmed by two things in the list; fire and gold. They are put in suspended animation by one; wood. They have no negative reactions to two; water and earth.

Since the Wu Xing has this creation/destruction theme going on, it would be, well, symmetrical, if those last two items were somehow (mildly?) beneficial in some way.

Fire consumes wood; metal (gold) overcomes wood.

Wood consumes water; wood overcomes earth.

So. If we class the vampire as 'wood', what does this leave us with?

- Fire consumes vampires, destroying them, leaving wounds that do not easily heal. Perhaps would that do not naturally regenerate at /all/.

- Gold chops through vampires, perhaps slicing more easily through them, or messing (again) with their regeneration.

- The effect of water counter fire - a vampire leaving a wound (or a burn) under running water may speed up (or re-start) regeneration.

- The effects of earth counter gold; perhaps resting underground, in contact with earth, allows a vampire to heal faster.

- As for wood - if a vampire's body is magically similar to wood, then a wooden stake through the heart will mess with the system. Probably the animating magic flows easily into the stake - because it's wood - but then never flows out again, because it's the /wrong/ wood. It doesn't have the right channels, the right flow mechanisms.

Okay, so I just took the Wu Xing in a completely different direction to the direction you took it in.

Yeah, but (one of the) literal translations of the character that means "metal" - 金 - is gold, which I thought was /very very/ cool, from a worldbuilding perspective; originally the person who actually was on the right track about gold called it gold, but then everyone else fucked around with it, added their own stuff, and eventually the fact it used the character 金 was "just a metaphor" and "they really mean any metal" and "why don't you buy my feng shui consulting service?".

I like all the above, it's a pretty neat system. I'll have to work out which I prefer. I worry all the powers and counter-powers is going to get confusing, but at the same time, it's a pretty rich sort of tapestry and doesn't require much investment as it only happens at times when vampires are being torched and stuff by hunters anyway.

Also wood! It works because it's magically similar enough to vampire flesh - it's like ramming a bit of copper through an electric circuit, it makes thing stop working because it conducts the 'electricity' in all the wrong places.

And, as we've conclusively proven, it's wide open enough for two people to apply it to the same fictional situation and come up with two wildly different ways to make it fit said situation. So it can probably be used to explain /everything/.

I think I like the fire/gold damages the vampire permanently unless the vampire heals using water/earth, though I'm wondering if there's some way we can make vampires unable to cross running water, but I think that's probably getting a bit too far out there.

I think I'll keep the "fire needs to be used to create a vampire", because it makes it difficult to make new vampires, though I'm not sure how that would happen mechanically. If you threw a match at a recently dead corpse, they wouldn't catch alight, would they? Maybe you have to set the fire on the heart, or the slurry a vampire vomits into the vamp-to-be's heart is flammable and you have to light it on fire, close the chest cavity, and the heat + the slurry creates the magic. Maybe?

Will also keep gold creates blood -> gold causes vampire's flesh to turn into blood, which creates some pretty sweet gory scenes, probably.

Blood nourishes wood -> stakes soak up the blood and get all magically charged and can be used for ????.

#+end_quote

Easy.

A vampire can go out in the day, as long as he doesn't allow any sunlight to fall on him. So, one an imagine a rich but eccentric vampire, in very thick clothing, with an umbrella to keep the sun off his face, strolling through the countryside in the middle of the day.

He approaches a river, running water. The water gives off /reflections/. Sunlight - a full, undistorted image of the sun - strikes his face from a direction that the umbrella does /not/ cover. Instant sun-injury - instant death if he's too old.

Two or three incidents like that, and a rumour goes around that vampires cannot cross running water... though in reality, running water poses no obstacle to them as long as the sun is down.

#+end_quote

Hmmm. A funeral pyre needs to be a pretty big thing; so a corpse /can/ be burned, but you need to take some effort to do it.

Maybe you need to take a torch (the flame-on-the-end-of-a-stick type, not the battery-operated type) and use it to seal the wound after the slurry is inserted into the heart. Possibly create a few ritual burns at specific locations. Hmmmm... fire is opposed to vampires, so one would expect it to hurt them... but perhaps the practical reason is that it burns away parts of the animating spell? Perhaps the original vampire enchantment was supposed to have them take no action unless explicitly ordered by a member of the right family, and these burns are basically ripping apart the parts of the enchantment that keep the new vampire's old mind sealed away?

Hmmm... and if that's the case, does the security programming revert if the wound ever heals? Do all vampires carry a burn scar on their chests that they have to take care to keep away from water? Or does the flesh heal back but leave the security programming broken?

#+begin_quote

Magic wands. In these modern days when magic is all but forgotten, a blood-soaked stake is one of the few things that can act as a magic battery, quite beneficial to a mage who has some idea of how to use it (or even just one who has used too much magic and wants to use more)

  That said, the 'just so' story doesn't explain why it's /running/ water - you'd imagine still water would be worse, because it can be perfectly reflective.
#+end_quote

Perfectly flat water is only dangerous from one direction - if the vampire and the sun are both to the east of the lake, then there are no dangerous reflections to worry about. (Well, not until some idiot throws a stone into the lake and causes ripples, anyway).

But that doesn't really matter - a superstition will often have a lot of unnecessary details attached. Consider the matter of vampire stakes, for example; a lot of traditions say that it matters what /type/ of wood you use.

To quote from the Wikipedia article:

#+begin_quote
  Methods of destroying suspected vampires varied, with staking the most commonly cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures.[46] Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states,[47] or hawthorn in Serbia,[48] with a record of oak in Silesia.[49] Aspen was also the wood of choice for stakes, as it was believed that Christ's cross was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night).[50] Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany[51][52] and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.[53]
#+end_quote

So, yeah, superstitions acquire unnecessary details all the time. (Why a /black/ cat?)

#+begin_quote
  Not sure about how to incorporate fire into the vampire creation ritual. All your ideas are great, though I don't want to get too complicated by having a vampire die or become an automaton if she ever gets wet.
#+end_quote

Eh, the security program could be non-self-repairing if properly destroyed while creating the new vampire.

...maybe the ritual, done properly, makes the vampire's system think that the burn wounds are "supposed" to be there, and so the body regenerates with the burns if injured. (I just like the idea of every vampire having a very visible scar if you know where to look - somewhere that's easily hidden by clothing, so it doesn't stop them pretending to be human, but it kind of feeds into the idea of vampires being a twisted unnatural mockery of life, which is always going to be part of the undercurrent of a vampire story)

#+begin_quote
  Not sure if this will help any, but here's the description of the ritual (it's a bit incomplete).
#+end_quote

Hmmm. So, basically, sludge and readings in Latin. And it's known to not always work... interesting. I wonder why not? Perhaps there are some requirements to the vampire ritual that the vampires themselves have forgotten (something not hard to get right accidentally, but also not 100% certain - perhaps it requires a very specific range of air temperatures, or doesn't work if the humidity is too high, or something). Or perhaps there's something about certain people - it may be that the magic genes prevent vampirasation, or are required for it.

#+begin_quote
  Completely changing the subject, I was having a discussion with my rolepalying partner last night about whether it was appropriate to have mages in fiction be able to, for example, remove traumatic memories so that way kids can grow up without the baggage from those.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Well, I see no reason not to have it, if it's handled properly. I mean, some mental disorders can be handled by means of chemistry, so why not by means of magic? Magic should be a tool - it has uses, it makes some things easier, but above all it needs to be used by someone who knows exactly what they're doing.

Having said that, I don't think it should just be a matter of waving a magic wand and all is well. There should be drawbacks and tradeoffs. Some examples might include:

- Memories are intertwined; they connect, and you may remember thinking about a memory, or remember a time when a memory helped you make a decision. Either the memory erasure spell wipes all associated memories as well (and thus using it on a sixty-year-old to erase a childhood trauma that's continually affected him may leave him a drooling idiot). This type of amnesia spell can still be safely used /immediately/ on a person to deal with a traumatic memory that happened ten minutes ago - or three days ago, at the cost of wiping all memories of the last three days.

- The spell removes the memory, but does nothing for the brain chemistry. The patient remains fearful and traumatised, but can no longer remember why. Some patients recover naturally at this point; others descend into paranoia and, in extreme cases, insanity; this is more likely if the patient finds something that proves him memories have been erased (e.g. he looks over his diary, or, worse, he realises that his diary has been deliberately removed) and less likely if the original trauma was less severe.

- The memories are removed - and so are any lessons that may have been learned from them. The patient them happily goes off and gets himself straight into the same situation all over again - or at least a similar situation. The trauma hits harder with each successive event, because every time there's a little bit of trauma that the spell doesn't /quite/ remove, and it builds up with repeated exposures.

- The spell doesn't remove the memories, merely hiding them from the conscious mind. Over time, the memories slowly seep back - mainly in dreams - and eventually (slowly) return completely. This type of memory spell would be best used in combination with conventional therapy, to ease the impact of the trauma - it's still there, it just doesn't hit as hard as it otherwise would.

A common thread in all of the above is that, if you just throw it about at random, you can do more harm than good. But, at the same time, if you are, or work with a competent psychologist, the magic can be used to complement a more traditional means of dealing with trauma... it's not going to solve everything with the wave of a wand, but it can make everything a lot easier (or, in some cases, possible at all) to solve /if used correctly/.

#+begin_quote
  Like it's just a hair below "and then the super mage cast a spell that removed racism, sexism and homophobia from the world forever"
#+end_quote

...that one's straight up mind control. The super mage may have had good intentions, but he's sitting right on top of a giant heap of "absolute power corrupts absolutely".

He'll probably still have good intentions when he casts a spell to make people obey the laws.

And he'll probably /still/ have good intentions when he casts a spell to make people say "please" and "thank you" when appropriate. Or donate one-tenth of their income to various charities.

Will he notice the point at which the planet Earth is no longer populated by anyone with the ability to make their own decisions?

  Perfectly flat water is only dangerous from one direction
#+end_quote

Ohhh, right. You have still lake water and you can see the perfect reflection of the trees at the other side of the lake but you can't see the sun unless the angle's right.

Had a discussion with my boyfriend about how the vampire "mind control" power worked, trying to make sure it wasn't too exploitable. I figure it's /basically/ the same level of motivation as having a gun to your head - so you could have someone do almost anything, but, for example, if you asked a loving father to kill his daughter, he might be strong enough to resist you. The effect lasts somewhere between one and five minutes, so you can't have someone attempt something complicated for you, and it only makes the person /really genuinely want/ to do what you've asked, so for example if a vampire ordered a person with OCD not to have intrusive thoughts, they would fail; but if the same OCD person was ordered to double numbers in their head, they'd happily sit there doubling numbers in their head for a full five minutes and probably not have any intrusive thoughts in that time.

The person remembers what they did, but aren't horrified by it. You could order a person with OCD to touch a filthy table, and then five minutes later say "how do you feel about touching filthy tables?", "oh no that's horrible", "but i saw you do it five minutes ago", "yeah but it felt right then/Vlad told me to do it and I trust Vlad/it seemed like a good idea at the time but I would never do it again".

So, say you order a loving father to kill a hooded figure; turns out the hooded figure is his daughter and he doesn't realise until he's chopped her head off. He would justify that as killing the hooded figure seemed like a good idea at the time, but it /totally ruined/ him when he realised it was actually his daughter.

That sort of thing. Doesn't change peoples' minds (with OCD, for example, just having someone experience that they don't die of SARS after touching a toilet seat can really help them recover), but lets vampires order people to do stuff and get away with it.

In my head it was a combination of the time after death/the amount of sludge/the potency of the sludge/how intact the heart was, but I think a genetic component is also a great idea.

I'd also imagine you'd need a mage who was not only a one in a billion level mage, but a neurologist, to be able to do the sorts of things we're talking about. After all, if you can fix the brain with surgery then a neurologist mage can just as easily kill the improper bits of grey matter and pull them out through the nose.

Yeah. The reason I got onto vampire mind control is I was asking my boyfriend (severe OCD, hence all the OCD examples) about the issue and he was pointing out to me how a vampire could force people into therapy and give them effective therapy and wasn't that a problem too? I said vampires could force people to have sex with them and that doesn't mean I condone rape. Basically, the /author/ is responsible for what the /system/ allows, but /characters/ are responsible for their /actions/.

Great!

Now let me see how I can exploit it.

#+begin_quote
  The person remembers what they did, but aren't horrified by it.
#+end_quote

Ooooooooh, now this /is/ exploitable.

Let's consider Sam. Sam has a daughter, Sally, who he loves with all his heart.

Let's consider a vampire, Vlad. For complex reasons outside of the scope of this example, Vlad wants Sam to kill Sally. The simple way to do this would be to put a hood on Sally... but no, Vlad wants Sam to knowingly kill Sally.

So. First thing Vlad does, he controls Sam, and asks him to spend five minutes imagining why it would be a good thing to kill Sally. Sam does so (since it doesn't involve actual harm to anyone), and, this is important, he /is not horrified/ by the idea that he just spent five minutes thinking about why it was a good idea to kill his daughter.

In fact, he'll make excuses to himself why it's acceptable to do so. "I didn't actually do anything," he'll tell himself. "I just thought about it. As a hypothetical situation."

Next day, Vlad controls Sam again, and asks him to describe circumstances that would lead to him killing his daughter. Sam suggests the possibility that he might shoot someone he thought was a stranger breaking into his house, only to find afterwards that it was his daughter - Vlad shakes his head, and asks Sam under what circumstances he would /knowingly/ kill Sally. Sam's at a loss, but he tries to come up with something - anything - that might satisfy Vlad's question. Maybe - maybe if it was necessary to save an entire city of people?

Next day, Vlad goes to Sally. He gives Sally some item of value (e.g. her mother's wedding ring) and Controls her. He tells her to sell the ring to his jannissary standing right over there in exchange for drugs, which she will hide in her room. Because of the Control, she thinks this is a great idea and does so. (She doesn't /take/ the drugs because (a) she is not stupid and (b) Vlad didn't tell her to do so).

It doesn't take Sam long to find out (Vlad will point him in the right direction if necessary) that his daughter sold her mother's wedding ring for drugs. (Doesn't matter that the bag of white powder is really cake flour). Now there's a definite rift between Sam and Sally. And, every day, Sam is being Controlled and asked to spend five minutes imagining the benefits of killing Sally.

In fact, just to desensitise Sam further, he might Control Sam and get Sam to kill a few total strangers - starting with borderline suicidal people who have been Controlled into begging to be killed and working up from there - just so that Sam is less horrified at the idea of murder at all.

...he still wouldn't do it on his own, but how long will it be until the rift between Sam and Sally is wide enough that Sam can be Controlled into killing Sally?

--------------

Okay, that's one way to get around the "he would never do that" problem. Now, second exploit - how to make someone do something both complex and long-term?

Easy solution. Control their boss. When Mr. Smith tells Tom from accounting to prepare an extremely complicated fifty-page spreadsheet and /not ask questions/, then Tom does it because he doesn't want to be fired - and Vlad only needed to Control Mr. Smith for one to five minutes.

Definitely a neurologist, but he might not need to be a one-in-a-billion level mage. I mean, how much magic force does it really take to nudge a neuron? (It takes a ton of /precision/, of course, so he'd need to be a seriously well-practiced mage, if if he doesn't have much magical muscle).

#+begin_quote
  we have no idea how memories are stored so how would a mage be able to begin to take effect iwth it?
#+end_quote

Magic has to follow rules, but it doesn't have to follow the same rules as everything else. And magic often works with high-level concepts.

Consider Sleeping Beauty. Magic puts her to sleep until such time as "true love's kiss" wakes her up. But how do we define "true love's kiss"? This is a high-level concept, which we can't translate in terms of neurons.

Or the idea that an inhabited structure prevents an uninvited vampire's entry. The idea of a structure makes sense, and so does the idea of an inhabited structure - but not so much on the atomic level. It's a high-level concept, but it /works/ with magic.

So, I see no reason why magic /wouldn't/ work with the high-level concept of memories. It just has to do so in a consistent, rule-based way.

#+begin_quote

...you don't want to remove /all/ negative emotions, though, because that leads to the horror story where the victim sees noting wrong in repeating the nightmare. Maybe just remove 90% of the negative emotions, to make it easier to deal with but still leave it as something to avoid.

#+begin_quote
  That's nasty. Eeep!
#+end_quote

It is, rather. I was thinking it would be a bit like the difference between dropping an anvil on someone versus dropping books one by on until he's carrying an anvil worth of weight - the eventual impact is equally large, but in the second case you've got a bit of time to adjust to the weight and not get crushed instantly.

  He'll make excuses to himself why it's acceptable to imagine killing his daughter. "I didn't actually do anything," he'll tell himself. "I just thought about it. As a hypothetical situation."
#+end_quote

I would have conceptualised it more as, he would still think imagining killing his daughter would be just as bad as he did before he did the imagining. Like, the fact he did the action has no bearing whatsoever on how he feels about it. Just like someone with OCD doesn't get "accidental therapy" from deciding that touching greasy tables is not going to cause the apocalypse, his attitude towards imagining killing his daughter is just as negative as it was before. The same way that, say, if he was drunk and hit his daughter for misbehaving (something he'd never do sober), when he was sober he'd look back on it and go "omg, never again", until he inevitably gets drunk again and hits her again.

  Next day, Vlad goes to Sally. He gives Sally some item of value (e.g. her mother's wedding ring) and Controls her. He tells her to sell the ring to his jannissary standing right over there in exchange for drugs, which she will hide in her room.
#+end_quote

Yeah, a vampire could definitely manipulate family members to kill each other. You could make a loving husband kill his wife by controlling her and getting her to have sex with a jannisary at the exact moment that Sam is looking through the window.

#+begin_quote
  And, every day, Sam is being Controlled and asked to spend five minutes imagining the benefits of killing Sally.

  In fact, just to desensitise Sam further, he might Control Sam and get Sam to kill a few total strangers - starting with borderline suicidal people who have been Controlled into begging to be killed and working up from there - just so that Sam is less horrified at the idea of murder at all.

  ...he still wouldn't do it on his own, but how long will it be until the rift between Sam and Sally is wide enough that Sam can be Controlled into killing Sally?
#+end_quote

I definitely concede that you can have a loving father kill his daughter through mind control, even if it requires waiting a few weeks/months to get the gap wide enough. I don't think there's a huge issue with this exploit because e.g. a semi-loving father could be controlled into killing his daughter with no problem.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Now, second exploit - how to make someone do something both complex and long-term?

  Easy solution. Control their boss.
#+end_quote

Sounds like a perfect option. You'd probably need to control the boss semi-regularly (i.e. once a week have Mr Smith say "How is that money laundering project going?") so that way Tom doesn't move onto other priorities, or, worst of all, Tom doesn't say "Hey Mr Smith, that money laundering project, can I take time off my TPS reports to finish it up because it's taking a while?" and then Mr Smith would inevitably reply "Oh, no, it seemed really important at the time but just shelve it for now, the TPS reports should be your priority."

--------------

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Yeah. I'm not sure what sort of themes I'm looking to explore with vampires. It's probably more in line with the standard Supernatural Romance tropes; they're sexy and other and dangerous and wise, rather than being tortured creatures, though they kind of are.
  #+end_quote

  Eh, fair enough.
#+end_quote

Yeah. It's kind of embarrassing that I'm trying to rationalify (somewhat) something that is essentially a Twilight/50 Shades level of prestige. It's really "yaoi vampires kissing a lot", but hey, romance novels are very popular so why the hell should I be ashamed if that's my genre, and we won't be talking about quivering members.

#+begin_quote
  Hmmmm. Even if there's no scar left afterwards, the only place I can see fire fitting into that ritual is to cauterise the wound when it's done.
#+end_quote

Hmm. I had William wrap Red in cloth; being wrapped tightly in flammable cloth which is then set alight could be part of the ritual (and make it pretty risky and impossible to do covertly), though not really sure of an in-universe explanation for that.

Cauterising the wound or setting a fire inside the body would make more sense.

Boiling the sludge is also a good idea but I just like the mental image of a vampire throwing up directly into their target's heart (it's totally disgusting).

#+begin_quote
  Of course. It might not even be the original purpose of the spell - a spell that causes (say) the smell of chamomile might just interfere with the nascent vampire's energies in just the wrong way.
#+end_quote

Oh goodie. I wonder what another major (or minor) magical / superstitious belief system is, that could get me thinking about that. I do like the idea of a smell interfering somehow. Indian is another big one, but I'm sure there's plenty of places in Africa and the Americas and Oceania too.

It could also be something specific about the "energy" of the place, though that might end up too much with feng shui and I want to stay away from Chinese now we've already stolen from it.

    we have no idea how memories are stored so how would a mage be able to begin to take effect iwth it?
  #+end_quote

  Magic has to follow rules, but it doesn't have to follow the same rules as everything else. And magic often works with high-level concepts.

  Or the idea that an inhabited structure prevents an uninvited vampire's entry. The idea of a structure makes sense, and so does the idea of an inhabited structure - but not so much on the atomic level. It's a high-level concept, but it /works/ with magic.

  So, I see no reason why magic /wouldn't/ work with the high-level concept of memories. It just has to do so in a consistent, rule-based way.
#+end_quote

  ...you don't want to remove /all/ negative emotions, though, because that leads to the horror story where the victim sees noting wrong in repeating the nightmare. Maybe just remove 90% of the negative emotions, to make it easier to deal with but still leave it as something to avoid.
#+end_quote

No, you can remove the negative emotions entirely and the person can rationally understand that strangers in white vans are very bad, assuming they're old enough. Sure, some people have to touch "wet paint" when they see a wet paint sign, but if you go to a mage to have a traumatic memory removed, the mage might say "ok, I am removing the emotion of you not liking what happened in the white van. Just remember that white vans are bad places to be, the things that happened were bad, and you should not let them happen again".

Anti-mind-control contact lenses is a trope, but it's a good one that makes sense especially if eye contact is a requirement. I did have a character wear sunglasses to a meeting with a vampire, but was vague about whether it would actually have done anything since the vampire wasn't going to try anything (she was an emissary for an android that, through a series of hilarious misunderstandings, the vampire thought was an even more powerful vampire - one who could eat and go out in the sun, oh my! - so he didn't want to do anything to piss the uberVamp off).

I was thinking sunglasses might be a good compromise (between completely neutering a vampire's powers and being incognito about it), but then again, there's no reason anything to do with sunglasses can't be replicated by contact lenses, so it's kind of out.

My original character that I made at age ~13 for my vampire hunter included purple eyes (that's on a mary-sue checklist somewhere), so it'd also be a nice nod to her history as a character to give her a particular affinity for putting purple ones in. She's a police officer though so I'm sure she probably wouldn't be allowed to wear unnaturally coloured ones at work.

At the time it was written, it was silver not gold, and one of the gifts that the vampire gave to the robot to welcome her to the town was an aluminium necklace studded with jewels - since aluminium used to be more valuable than gold, making it an appropriate gift. The vampire hunter was poking through her things and saw a necklace that looked silver but wasn't silver, further cementing the idea that this android was a vampire who was hiding it with "fake" silver jewelry.

I'm trying to work out, canonically, how /good/ she is at her /actual job/. She seems to spend a lot of time hunting vampires and such, and she picks up leads from her job (e.g. "bar brawl" was really a vampire wrecking shit up). She also probably snoops around files she's not technically meant to be looking at. Would she be the rogue police officer who is forever skirting the lines of what is acceptable behaviour? Or would her hard working, high achieving attitude that resulted in her deciding to rid Our Town of the supernatural menace once and for all give her the skills it takes to shine? Would she regularly get supernatural creatures to turn themselves in, in exchange for brownie points (after all, a vampire doing 5 years in prison with appropriate accommodations is not the biggest sacrifice)?

Hmmm on that note, suppose, say, Catholicism is "right" in this universe. When a human dies and made into a vampire, is their immortal soul judged and sent to heaven or hell? Or does the soul stay in the vampire until it does? Or does the act of making a vampire completely torch the soul altogether, and you have traded heaven/hell for a paltry thousand years or so? I suppose that depends on so many things that you can barely begin to speculate.

Hmmmm. Having her be the secretary and have to deal with all the admin is a great way for her to both pick up leads and have access to a lot of paperwork, but will tie her down in the office a lot.

It sounds like she's going to be doing a lot of skirting of the rules /anyway/, which means that there's two ways the Captain can deal with her. Of course he knows she's skirting the rules a lot - but as long as she's genuinely good at her job and manages well under pressure, he might decide that he doesn't Know unless someone brings it to his attention. If she's not, she's going to end up fired.

I'm imagining her as the person who gets sent in to the really dangerous situations - where there are hostages or the strong possibility of bullets flying or so on - because she handles that sort of tension /really/ well, and knows exactly when to break the rules to save a hostage's life.

  Hmmm on that note, suppose, say, Catholicism is "right" in this universe. When a human dies and made into a vampire, is their immortal soul judged and sent to heaven or hell? Or does the soul stay in the vampire until it does? Or does the act of making a vampire completely torch the soul altogether, and you have traded heaven/hell for a paltry thousand years or so? I suppose that depends on so many things that you can barely begin to speculate.
#+end_quote

Ooooooh. Hmmm. Vampire mythology suggests that a vampire trades their soul for their eternal life, and they've traded eternity for a few thousand years. But you don't heed to stick with that. William could be right - he could be just the left-behind body while his soul has moved on. Or perhaps he still has his soul, and his continual feeding off people and addicting them to his spit is doing bad things to it.

This is very much a case for authorial fiat. Does it make a difference to the story?

    OK. I am putting in that /any/ sort of barrier to direct eye contact negates the orders, including ordinary corrective lenses or those stylish clear glasses that hipsters wear these days.

  Good start. What about cigar smoke? Air?
#+end_quote

... well, that's an interesting thought. You'd /think/ the designers of this feature would allow it to work in a smoky environment (e.g. near a fire set by an army sacking a village), but if that's the case why it would be stopped by ordinary eyeglasses (which though a reasonably recent invention, you'd assume the atlanteans had them also) rather than, say, working on sound alone is obviously an issue.

I guess you could say there's a /physical/ barrier, that the magic of the vampire eye contact is like alpha particles, it's not going to be stopped by smoke but a piece of tissue paper will do it. (Just looked up alpha particles - smoke detectors work because the rate of alpha particles is reduced by smoke blocking their path - oh, and they get blocked by a few cm of air though that's mostly because of the magnetic charge).

Still, the same sort of "idea". Air and smoke are not as dense as glass. So it's just about having a certain density of material in between your eyes and the vampire's. Being behind a thin sheet of tissue paper might not protect you, but an ordinary piece of glass would.

Does that make sense? Seems like the most logical way to have the same sorts of limitations/etc.

It doesn't make a difference to the story; for some reason I decided William had a catholic worldview (my former faith so I'm not /entirely/ clueless), it seemed to make an odd sort of sense (canonically, he's Clovis I, first king of what is now France, and he converted to Catholicism at his wife's behest). Not sure /why/ he keeps those thoughts or beliefs after 1500 years, but it provides him with some different motivations and whatnot. He obviously has a way of justifying his clearly un-catholic behaviour (murder, pre-marital relations, not going to mass, not going to confession(? maybe he does every few dozen years) etc), and maybe that's because he believes he lived an honourable life until his death, and that's what matters, since his immortal soul is probably in heaven, or will never be able to be, he can just enjoy what he has since either way he's dead forever. Or maybe vampires have catholicism 2.0 now, or maybe catholicism from circa 400 CE is very different to modern catholicism.

Okay, so a solid object or a serious amount of gas. A pair of glasses will prevent it; the air in a normal room won't, but if I'm standing on the top of a mountain and the vampire is standing down in the valley, then even if he can look directly into my eyes at that distance there's probably enough air between us to counter the effect.

That seems reasonable.

Of course, there's probably going to be a vampire hunter who thinks, incorrectly, that mirrored sunglasses are necessary, and considers it more evidence in favour of this hypothesis every time that the mirrored sunglasses /work/...

...actually, talking of mirrors, if the vampire and the victim are both looking at a mirror and the vampire's eyes meet those of the victim's /reflection/, does that work?

I think some of the types of fake gold are merely alloys that include a little gold, but not as much as has been advertised. Or are gold-plated instead of being pure gold. And both of those are probably still effective against vampires.

...a bit of googling suggests that gold-plating is common when dealing with fake gold (presumably because then you're sure you have the colour right).

But copper is more plentiful and cheaper yet has very similar metallurgical properties to gold (same column in the periodic table). I'd be very surprised if there wasn't some alloy of copper that looked gold at first glance. (It would probably get the weight wrong, there's not many metals as heavy as gold)

(Actually that could be due to some ancient werewolves trying to spread the rumour that they were invulnerable - together with arranging suitable demonstrations that seemed to prove it - until one brave villager really /did/ genuinely attack with a silver knife and drove the pack away, leading to the legend that werewolves were invulnerable to anything except silver, an impression that the wolves themselves are in no hurry to correct)

Secretaries have actually got incredible power. Especially when it comes to keeping the minutes of meetings (and /especially/ when the people doing the meeting are a little elderly and their memories are no longer all that reliable).

(It's also possible that the secretarial duties are the one thing that /nobody/ wants to do, and she keeps getting assigned them on the basis of her flagrant violation of uniform code with regard to coloured contact lenses which no-one notices except when it's time to decide who gets to fill in the paperwork)

Politics. When the ANC came to power, a lot of people thought the country would go the same way as most African countries coming out of colonial rule, i.e. massive internal collapse because the guys in charge have little to no idea how to run a country and are enthusiastically getting rid of everyone who does know how to run a country.

There were a lot of people who left around then.

And, yes, there have been a few hiccups and problems since then, but /significantly/ less than anyone would have expected; Mandela played a big part in making sure the country didn't fall right off the rails but only wobbled a little.

Still, you can pretty much set that air distance where you want to. It's quite possible that contact lenses could be a third of the thickness and still work, or that hydrocarbons are a significantly better blocker than air. This is basically going to be a matter of what works best for the plot.

Next question. When controlling someone, does a vampire need to actually give a verbal command?

Let's say there is a vampire at a live concert (indoors, so there's no sunlight to worry about). He's in the front row, close enough to the stage, and he wants to, say, make the singer drop his microphone. Can he do so non-verbally, and thus without the people around him taking any notice, or does he actually have to say something like "Drop it!" (And if he does, is the signer able to misunderstand him and drop something else instead? ...let's just say he's holding something in his other hand as well).

  I don't know, if they tend to plate fake gold then either the copper alloy that looks golden is more expensive than gold itself (e.g. copper-platinum) or just doesn't look /right/.

I've been looking into this a bit more, and apparently there's some types of brass that look /really/ golden. One, called Prince's Metal (or Prince Rupert's Metal), being 75% copper and 25% zinc, was apparently used to imitate gold in the past. (You won't fool a metallurgist with it, because the weight is all wrong, but it's the right colour which is what's really important).

  Next question. When controlling someone, does a vampire need to actually give a verbal command?
#+end_quote

Good one. I'm two minds about this: it makes sense conceptually that, for example, giving a command in sign language (whether like ASL or that military gesturing thing you see on TV), putting your fingers to your lips to indicate be quiet, etc would all be sensible ways this power could work.

However, also conceptually, you'd imagine the power would work from the vampire's gaze having a power over you. So if you stopped looking into her eyes to see what she was signing you to do, the spell would be broken.

I'd say that it can be a non-verbal command, however it has to be easily "read" by someone staring into your eyes. So you couldn't hold up a piece of paper with instructions on it, and you might not be able to sign (I'm not sure if you can understand sign language whilst staring into the speaker's eyes?), but you'd definitely be able to put your finger to your lips to indicate "quiet" for example.

#+begin_quote
  Does he actually have to say something like "Drop it!" (And if he does, is the signer able to misunderstand him and drop something else instead? ...let's just say he's holding something in his other hand as well).
#+end_quote

Using the gun to your head analogy: it would be the thing you thought they most probably meant. So, for example, if you had a microphone in one hand and a sandwich in the other and you were signing, you'd probably drop the microphone unless you saw the vampire was the person you stole the sandwich from.

You might be able to deliberately disobey (e.g. dropping your handbag rather than the gun you're pointing at the vampire's ally), but it would take a lot of guts, and the willpower to do so would be just below what it would take to just ignore the order in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  ...not quite sure how that hurts Perseus, but okay, that makes sense.
#+end_quote

In the myth, he kills Medusa by using her reflection in his shield to guide his blade. If you look at Medusa, you turn to stone, but the reflection doesn't have the same property. So, using the mirror physics just proposed, Perseus would not be able to kill Medusa like that.

Vampires are immune to mind control, so no. It also takes effort to do, so it'd be hard to come up with a situation where a vampire might try and control her reflection (though you could always throw a mirror in the way before they try and control you.

Of course, it would be /great/ if Red could get his immortal soul saved and all that - he asked him a few times whilst he was alive, and it seemed he was on some variation of what Saint Paul started only a few hundred years before William was born. No chance of him getting an authentic 5th century catholic priest to bless him and make sure it's all legit, unless - oh god, William is going to turn the world upside down to try and find an authentic 5th (or really, 6th or 7th will do) century vampire priest to get all this down.

Took me a bit of googling to find actual stats on that, but suffice to say that we're doing worse than Australia. (If we can get a better handle on infant mortality, we'll do a whole lot better on that front.)

We've got great language policies, though. (Seriously, we have eleven official languages, and you can interact with any government department in /any/ of them.

  If someone had a gun to your head and told you to "drop it", would you try and figure out what they meant or would you drop them both? I'd probably drop them both, because I'd know that dropping the wrong one could be bad. That's what I'd rule. Again, with sufficient willpower/motivation you could probably deliberately misunderstand, but it would be say 80% of the willpower required to outright reject the command.
#+end_quote

Okay, fair enough.

New question. Vern the Vampire hands Tim a gun, tries to Control him to shoot himself. Does Tim do so?

Using the gun-to-the-head analogy, I'd think he wouldn't, regardless of his willpower - he comes off no worse for refusing that command than for following it.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe. In the myth he carries her head around in a bag and takes it out to turn a bunch of people into stone, so it probably wasn't stone. That said given her dead head had stone powers, maybe her stone head would have stone powers?
#+end_quote

I don't see why not.

The other option, of course, is that Medusa /knew/ that looking at her own reflection would stone her, and took the simple precaution of shutting her eyes. And Perseus, of course, shut his eyes... which put them on an equal footing. Only Perseus was armed and knew how to use a sword, so Medusa had no chance...

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, because those isolated tribes are probably dying of infectious diseases, high infant mortality, etc. So they probably do have a huge life expectancy gap that would put the ones in our respective countries to shame.
#+end_quote

Exactly, yes.

#+begin_quote
  Could.... could colonialism actually have improved the lives of the subjugated? I mean, bad times, separated from their families and all that, but they'd live longer. But they also would have their culture, language, and traditions which probably has some asimovian zeroth law importance....
#+end_quote

[[/twiponder][]] Better medical care helps them. The trick is finding a way to get the better medical care to them without separating them from their families and stuff. It may well be that they're a good deal happier having full control over their lands than they would be living in a slum, I can believe that... but there must be some way of getting them the medical care (and electricity and stuff) without putting them in a slum.

And I can definitely believe that someone like Jacob Zuma (current South African president, and Zulu) is doing a lot better where he is now than if colonists had never visited South Africa.

So.... it's iffy. There's good and bad, and for the first generation there's a /lot/ of bad and not all that much good... but several generations down the line, done properly, there could be a lot of good.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, the issue isn't so much that the doctors aren't treating people who need it, but that the system as a whole puts people in the wrong frame of mind (e.g. low food literacy => people won't cook and eat healthy food => diabetes)
#+end_quote

Yeah, education is important. People need to know things, and the most important thing that people can learn is how to learn and think logically about things.

#+begin_quote
  That's so cool! I kind of resent that I grew up in an anglophone country, because I feel like I have the sort of personality that would make me want to learn English to participate in the Wider Internet, so I'd be more motivated to learn a second language.

  He'd never lose another election. Actual combat experience plus 1500 years of vampire powers? Then again, his vampire rivals might want France for themselves. Oh god, a future where the vampires out "out of the coffin" and decide to wrest back overt control of the world is.... awesome.
#+end_quote

How would sword-fighting win him elections? I mean, yes, he'd win the fights (until someone challenged him to meet them in the city square at noon) but I'm not seeing how that translates into guaranteed votes.

...this might actually be the explicit aim of some vampire politicians. Reveal themselves to the public eye, then rule the world. Of course, before they reveal themselves, they've just got to kill off this irritatingly persistent sect of vampire hunters...

#+begin_quote
  I was more imagining the Vatican having a priest on retainer, in their famous ineffable catacombs, and that's why the Catholic church has a reputation for being so conservative (they /did/ preach in Latin in living memory, after all). That priest is /possibly/ a Pope from way back, and, well, the rest kind of writes itself.
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure that a Pope remains a Pope as long as he's still alive. 'Alive' is a bit iffy in the case of vampires, and then there's the whole 'unholy abomination' angle to worry about... but I doubt there would be a vampire /Pope/ given that there are other Popes after that.

A vampire /cardinal/, on the other hand, is a lot more possible. But I don't see what he really changes insofar as the Vatican is concerned. All it means is that when all the cardinals meet, there's this one guy who'd been at every meeting for the last thousand years.

Yeah, Tim would not shoot himself in those situations. You basically can't Control someone to do something that would kill them.

I had a thought though - I said Control doesn't work unless you've got eye contact. I can see that the Vampire would need to look into the victim's eyes (to.... aim the Control beam?), but they can still see the eyes regardless.

It looks like the pupil is literally a hole through to the retina, so I /guess/ you could say that Control works through pupil-to-pupil line of sight, and it would make sense that way. But the cornea sits in front of the pupil so it's not like an /actual/ hole.

Indigenous representation in politics in general is pretty abysmal. I don't think there's any chance of an aboriginal being elected Prime Minister any time soon, I think there are two or three in our entire political system? Looking at the wikipedia page, we have 4, 5 if you count a non-indigenous person with indigenous ancestry.

Proportionally, we should have 6 in the Federal parliament. Apparently New Zealand has 7 maori seats, we have no such thing!

State parliaments look equally bad, except in the NT (6/25; indigenous people are 15% of the population there so they're actually over-represented if anything, but probably less so for their divisions as I'd imagine a lot of them are very rural).

The "bad guy" aliens in Stargate: SG-1 were known for being theatrical rather than practical. They had a slave population that was completely subjugated, and just ran wars against each other using multitudes of servant classes, so they did not really require "good" weapons.

Any disunity in that 60% was more than capable of realising that their own differences were minor in comparison.

Shhh. I was writing it stream-of-consciousness. Or this vampire is part of the Red Tribe, and she wants you to kill the Blue Tribe vampires, so it IS an Us and Them type thing.

In JaNoWriMo news, I had dinner with my RP/writing partner and we've both gotten excited about it! We're going to have some serious roleplaying to do in the next couple of months so we have skeleton scenes to build up, and because we both have sets of characters who are basically a hair away from being full tulpas, we are going to also have to edit a lot of each others' scenes to make them work right.

I also kind of sort of explained 4D physics to her. She also expressed gratitude for your awesome work at helping me hammer this stuff out, she thinks we should write a "the physics of the verse" book about it.

But this is what we're going to do:

Me: Pretty straightforward romance story of Red and William. Act 1: They meet, fall in love (c. 1942). Act 2: Red becomes a ghoul, dynamic with that (c. 1950). Act 3: Red becomes a vampire, relationship almost strains to its breaking point (c. 2016). Act 3: Red is now a mature vampire, everything is perfect, the end (c. 2050). Probably going to have no or only minor antagonists. Good communication.

Her: Pretty straightforward friendship/action story with Jack and Gwyn. Act 1: They become roommates, wtf a vombie?!? Act 2: so we need to stop this vampire menace, wtf vampires are people with feelings?? Act 3: major antagonist. Act 4: Peace is achieved.

I don't know anything about the science of addition (probably something to research!), but I'd imagine the difficulty would be similar in kind but more severe in magnitude to whatever the 'most addictive'^{TM} modern drug. So you can get clean with enough effort and support (in fact, a plot line involves a main character trying to do so, though I'm not sure if she succeeds as of yet).

However, I'd imagine that jannisaries would for the most part be drug addicts looking for a bigger thrill, so they'd recruit each other (possibly out of a genuine desire to share a better high, possibly because the vampire encourages recruitment), or someone who graduates up the drug scale to the very top (is this a real thing?) and wants something better might seek it out.

I haven't studied addiction much either, though my impression of it is that after the initial high it's less about seeking out a high and more about feeding an irrational desire. Drug addiction seems to trick the part of our brain designed to incentivize beneficial behavior, so it's very difficult to resist.

Additionally, the kind of people who actively seek out drugs to get high probably aren't the kind of people vampires would want to work with. Peons have their uses, but the best people to have in your pocket are the ones who can open doors. Politicians, police officers, lawyers, doctors, businessmen, and professional criminals are all far more useful than random junkies off the street that the cops pay more attention to.

I just got an idea for some kind of independent jannisaries. The one advantage peons have is that it's easy to hide regular feeding, for VIPs you need to pay extra for privacy, so many of them could be used like gas stations for whoever is passing by. They're easy to manage and easy to replace. Some may even pay to get bitten as if it were a drug, though the more forward-thinking vamps prefer their food stay financially solvent so they don't have to find more.

Problem is, with all this in mind, you end up back at my problem of why have jannisaries over ghouls/thralls. I suppose the psychic energy being a limited resource makes the most sense.

I also imagined vampires as being /very/ protective of their jannisaries. They're an excellent resource in that they're a meal whenever you want it, but if you have to share them, they become infinitely less useful, especially because in order to get their high the jannisaries are likely to lie about being fed on in the past. In most cities this would take the form of vampires having 'territories', and you can only take jannisaries who live in your territory. It would have the counter-intuitive consequence of vampires tending to prefer the 'bad' parts of town. Individual jannisaries, though, would be out for themselves a lot of the time. And I do like the idea of truck stops literally having rooms of jannisaries in them, so vampires who are just passing through have an easy food source.

************* I thought there were already enough reasons to make jannisaries over thralls, the latter are more reliable but require more personal attention. Jannisaries are better contacts, while thralls make a great entourage. You'll probably have to play with the specifics of the addiction until you get something that will hook the kind of people that you want vampires to have. That will definitely effect what kind of story you're telling.

Currently, the only way I can think of to reach powerful people would be to have vampire prostitutes get to them and the addiction would just be strong enough to entrap most people, but that may not make for the kind of story you want. If jannisaries are influential, then vamps would also be protective of them to prevent their loyalties from switching. I've come to the realization that controlling people through a drug addiction is rather counterintuitive.

************** Yeah, you're right. Thanks again for your input.

I did a little bit of research into the specifics of addiction and 'highly addictive' tends to gloss well with the established canon of jannisaries (instant gratification, especially).

The big problem is I want to have them be content waiting at least several weeks between feedings, but be desperate for them in short order after that, so it'll probably consist of huge initial high during the feeding itself, which is replaced by a more mild pleasant sensation for two to three weeks, perhaps including the sort of benefits that things like ritalin and modafinil provide to provide incentive for 'the rich and powerful' to take it, gradually fading into withdrawals that put you back below your baseline and then as time goes on get worse and worse and worse. So, say, six weeks after a feeding you'll be a little beneath your best, the headaches start after two months, and then three months in you've got basically the worst flu you've ever had and you just KNOW that the only thing that will fix it is that beautiful toothy beast.

Note to self: research drug addiction and withdrawal further

*************** That sounds like a really good idea for how it all works. It also has the added "benefit" that jannisaries who get cut off may be inclined to seek out an alternative, so their new addiction makes a great cover for their old one.

** I'm writing a jumpchain fanfic, in major part to try and get used to writing a lot quickly. Would enjoy being used to writing loads, getting into a routine.

In the story you are taken to a fictional universes, use point buy to buy various abilities, and live out your life in said universe for several years. I'm trying to work out how they would play out the fairly standard eating pokemon issues- pokemon are clearly smart enough to understand language, handle complex issues, use tools to say, build a playground, and people on occasion consume them. I'm trying to work out how a person would justify that if questioned.

*** Whichever way you slice it, eating sentient beings is morally grey at best. That's fine, it gives room for discussion. Most likely everyone will justify it to themselves differently.

- I refuse adamantly to eat Pokémon and you should too.
- I refuse adamantly to eat Pokémon but I respect your boundaries.
- I don't want to eat Pokémon but I don't have the energy to argue about it with you.
- Nearly everyone else in this world does it, what difference will I make one way or the other?
- Nearly everyone else in this world does it, I should eat Pokémon to fit in.
- Nearly everyone else in this world does it, they can't all be wrong.
- Nearly everyone else in this world does it, so I never really questioned it.
- Pokémon are not really sentient so it's OK to eat them.
- I know and accept that this is evil, but they're delicious.
- I know and accept that this is evil, but I have enough problems of my own without worrying about Pokémon rights as well.

Basically, just rehash the reasons people think it's OK to eat meat and you'll get most of the possible justifications. That's what this is an obvious allegory for, anyway.

****** A natural, species-wide talent, I'd guess. There're plenty of examples of such things in other media; just check out any D&D monster manual.

I'm sure there's a disconnect between what I'm thinking when I see psychic -- telekinesis, telepathy, whatever -- and what you are. If your issue is with telepathy, you could consider it, to the creature in question, a kind of non-visual body language, because that's probably what it feels like to them.

** First, an apology. The first chapter of /Collateral Damage/ was supposed to have been up by August 6th or 9th, to coincide with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That simply did not happen. The plot was mostly fine, but it was causing tone whiplash. I'm still deciding if it's salvageable or not.

The bigger problem is the fact that I still feel like I know nothing about nuclear weapons, their history, properties, or broader things about nuclear physics. Maybe complete accuracy is a terrible standard to impose. I know it doesn't /really/ help the story, but I really, really wanted to keep actual, accurate physics in the story, and not only go halfway.

How do you worldbuild around such complicated topics in a timely manner? How much study and research is "enough" and how do you extract it from history and science books? I feel like someone who tried to walk across a frozen lake, fell through the ice, and drowned.

I don't know how much research is "enough." There's got to be a cut-off point somewhere. Personally, I would settle for internal consistency. Throw a disclaimer in there somewhere and exclude real nuclear physicists from your intended audience.
