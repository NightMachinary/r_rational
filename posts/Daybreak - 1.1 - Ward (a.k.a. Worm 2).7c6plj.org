** Wow, I almost immediately like the protagonist/PoV character here.

She's such a contrast to Taylor - she seems to measure her response and deescalate whenever possible. She also appears very aware of subtext and psychology. Very analytical in general.

While I was writing the above, it occured to me that it'd be a wonderful way to show some character development, maybe of Taylor herself. And so I was only half surprised at the name drop. Damn nice.

**** Glory Girl's real name is Victoria Dallon, so she was revealed at the end of this chapter as being the protagonist of Ward. She was part of Worm, a member of the group New Wave, notable for having their civilian identities public. Her power was projecting a forcefield a millimeter from her skin, giving her flying brick powers, as well as having an aura that radiated either terror or awe depending on whether the person looking at her was on her side. Her primary defining characteristic was the overwhelming use of force by beating a few (non-cape) criminals nearly to death.

The essential breakdown of her story as presented in Worm was that her aura unintentionally caused her (adopted) sister Amelia/Amy/Panacea to fall in love with her. Panacea then changed Glory Girl's brain so that Glory Girl would love her, which caused some drama, and later Panacea turned her into a mess of elbows and heads. She was presumably fixed by Panacea at the end of Worm, though there's only an offhand mention of this in Worm itself.

****** I was hoping to not reread Worm until the edited version was available, mostly because I really felt/feel like it needed an edit in order to address some of the issues. I think that I'll settle for reading the Glory Girl relevant chapters and muddle through whatever else there is with the help of the wiki, which is obviously not ideal, but reading through 1.6 million words of unpolished work just in order to not have those moments of "who?" doesn't seem worth it.

**** I didn't get a lot of useful information out of the preludes, but basically you should know that the Parahumans Online Forum is up and running (barely), Glory Girl frequents it, multi-trigger events and group trigger events for grabbag capes with similar powers were discussed, Madison the bully feels regretful for bullying Taylor, prejudice against capes due to their inability to minimize damage from Scion is high, there are geopolitical tensions across the multiverse and war might be coming, and there's a cape with multiple personalities who may have put a hit on themself. There's probably more insight to be found, but it's written in an irritatingly obfuscating way so I didn't look too closely.

**** Vicky is Glory Girl is the teacher and main character of Ward, she's a former member of New Wave, the team of heroes with open secret identities, she was turned into a monster by her adopted sister Panacea (the healer) who had a crush on her because of Glory Girl's aura's side effects. She has a weak aura that inspires terror in her enemies and love in her allies, along with flight and a forcefield that shatters on impact but recharges every couple seconds. Vicky frequently used excessive force in taking down criminals and enlisted Panacea's help in covering up her misconduct. Eventually Panacea had a psychotic breakdown due to her repressed feelings and accidentally mutilated Victoria into a caricature of herself who was forced to love Panacea, the caricature was hideous so Vicky was monstrous in appearance and had to go to a parahuman asylum to deal with that and her artificial feelings, and near the very end of Worm when Taylor was done being Khepri she dropped off Panacea next to Victoria where she presumably did some healing.

**** Glory girl is Victoria Dallon, a pretty blonde hero with flying brick powers and a emotional aura that can inspire fear or awe. She was a unmasked cape that loved the attention, the powers and had a all around kickass life.

Being under constant aura effect fucked up her younger sisters Amy/panacea (strongest healer) puberty, causing her to fall in love with GG. Amy was hated by her mother, suffered from depression, hated being guilted into healing people every day forever.

After the Slaugherhouse 9 invaded BB and Bonesaw forced Panacea to break her "No brains rule" she fucked up and altered victoria's brain to be in love with her. This caused more drama. Before it could be corrected Glory girl was melted by Crawler acid. Amy put her in a sacrophagus made of dead cats and tried to fix her. Jack slash interfered, fucked some more with amy's brain. Amy is then to emotionally invested to restore glory girl to her old form. and glory girl is stuck as a blob/squid/chimera monster unable to move for... some time.

Amy volunteers to go to prison. Is released prior to golden morning. Skitter and Co beats Scion. In the last chapter its aluded to that Amy goes to meet Glory girl and their Mom.

Then a few years of time skip lands us at this new story. Presumably Amy or Bonesaw (she reformed into a good girl) fixed Glory girl at some point.

** I've read Worm, probably about three years ago now. I read it the whole way through and enjoyed it for the most part.

That said, the previous internet bits and the name drop at the end of this chapter made me realize Wildbow is expecting an absurd amount of buy-in for the various plot points to land. I had to google "Victoria Dallon" to remember, even vaguely, who she was.

So maybe following along isn't for me. I don't remember (or don't obsess over) Worm enough for that dramatic final line to mean anything for me, and I didn't like Worm enough to reread the whole thing.

Really? Huh. My perspective almost certainly got skewed because of all the fanfiction I've read, but the Victoria/Amy subplot was a big deal, both were memorable characters.

To be honest, I honestly should have expected this because in earlier incarnations of Worm, Amy and her /were/ the protagonists.

**** Not really. As you said, there aren't many books that wait several years before coming out, and those that are do have a BIT of the same issue (looking at you, Wheel of Time). Most novels also don't swarm you with characters quite as much as Worm does, and when they do bring them up they have the same or related POV characters and mention who they are.

But the surprise reveal of the POV character, as in that first chapter, is something I've only seen attempted in serialized stories, in any event. Can you imagine that in the first chapter of a published book when the blurb on the back cover already ruined the surprise?

*** I had a very similar reaction; the text seemed to think that "Victoria Dallon" was going to be meaningful or impactful to me, and it wasn't, because I read Worm while it was ongoing and haven't been back to it. I'm really hoping that there aren't too many more dramatic reveals like that which are predicated on me having perfect recall of what happened in Worm. I'm sure that it works for a particular type of fan, but /I/ had to do a Google search, and there's nothing like a Google search to make a reveal fall flat.

That said, I'll give this at least an arc to show that it's not a story geared toward the superfan.

(My other problem is that I much more readily identify people by their cape names; Bonesaw is far more memorable than whatever Bonesaw's real name is. Same goes for Glory Girl.)

*** I wouldn't judge it so thoroughly based on a single chapter. It's quite possible that we'll get some sort of a reminder as to who Victoria Dallon is next chapter, or whenever it ends up mattering.

I definitely wouldn't get any of the plotpoints here just from a single binge-read of worm a couple years ago, either - the knowledge of Worm only solidified itself for me through fanfiction later.

But I never did that and the original story is freaking huge. :)

The lead-up to this chapter is also part of why I think I might just not remember enough to really enjoy the sequel, all the using the first letter, vaguely mentioning what happened at the end of Worm, and so on left me cold.
