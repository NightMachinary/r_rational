** This ark has been, for me, one of the best in the series. I am thoroughly enjoying every chapter as it comes out and the twists really do surprise me.

** Considering just how much time she spent setting up a band with all the potential traitors, it's not at all surprising she gets backstabbed. I'm just curious what her contingency is at this point.

Also, I'm not sure that this revelation about the Bard is going to do her as much good as she thinks it will. Yeah, she got it from the mouth of a Fae, but the only witness to that is the Fallen Monk, who is almost certainly about to die. So really she has just a little more hear-say to work with.

*** Even if he dies, they can still interrogate his ghost. Yes, the Named with that ability is a Villain and therefore suspect, but at some point the evidence mounts up.

And presumably, after two years of working with her, Tariq trusts that Cat wouldn't risk destroying her own fortress and killing her own people in the middle of the war against Keter for the sake of creating fake evidence for a complete lie.

Tariq's issue when Cat met the Intercessor wasn't "I have no proof that any of what you claim just happened in your head is true", it was "I'm assuming you're telling the truth, but even then I believe that the Bard's intentions were good".

If Cat tells Tariq "I saw ironclad proof that the Intercessor attacked us", he'll believe her.

And even if he doesn't, she's made it clear that the Bard acting against her or hers will have /consequences./

  “You spoke for that faceless thing, Peregrine,” I said. “And so now you answer for her as well. If you shelter and safeguard her, then you are responsible for her actions: if she schemes against me or mine, if she moves against truce or Accords, then I will take it as betrayal from both of you.”

  My jaw clenched.

  “That will not be without /consequence./”

*** I've been thinking about that. I think that Narrative means her claims can be trusted to be factual. If she lied, afterall, that would be guaranteed to come out at the worst time, and Tariq and Hanno know this. Also they know and trust Cat, so it would be really out of character for them to distrust her anyway.
