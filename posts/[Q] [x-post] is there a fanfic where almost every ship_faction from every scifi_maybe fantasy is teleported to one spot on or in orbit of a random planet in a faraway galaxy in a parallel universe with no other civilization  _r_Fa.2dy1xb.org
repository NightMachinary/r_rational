** First, the answer I have to give is "Not that I know of".

That sounds like it would be terribly hard to structure as a story. /Every/ includes a whole lot of ships, and with the varying power and sanity levels, it seems like you'd be five seconds away from 90% of the ships being obliterated.

Storywise, you'd have to follow five or six main characters, and preferably those that survive the initial "someone shooting at everyone". Since most of those ships have heavy FTL, I'd suggest putting them in a place that's more mysterious than a random planet - possibly a lone planet with a lone star and /nothing else around them/ because otherwise the smart ones are going to kick their engines to max and fly as far away as possible.

If I had to write it, first act is everyone getting teleported into place and having a giant clusterfuck of a fight, second act is communication and the formation of coalitions, and the third act is coalition warfare over something valuable.

** Not that I know of , though I have a feeling that if there was, or even if there was not they'd just make it, Culture GCUs, CelestAI shards, and Jurian tree-ships would just carry on smartly.

This would be fun to read if you removed the boring I can do anything ones, though you might need to start with a hypothetical list and pare it down to something manageable.

*** well, I didn't necessarily mean everything - a couple dozen or more is actually what I had in mind. Basically, without it skipping straight to boom boom I imagine it would be "interesting" to say the least. Think of all the drama and the rush to get weapons built back up, the intrigue, etc. Then think of the fantasy-novel people on the surface zapping eachother with spells as these huge ships float about desperate to open fire on eachother.

** Good dog, I hope not. That sounds horrible and pointless, like mushing together late-era Heinlein, Ian Banks, and Dr. Seuss.

...which actually sounds rather awesome, now that I say it that way. But I'm sure reality would disappoint. Horribly.
