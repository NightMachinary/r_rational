** The more mundane commercial use of Gentle Repose is given in the Stronghold Builder's Guide. This specifies that you can have a permanent version of the spell cast as an area effect on a room, preventing decay and spoilage.

Apply that to your wagon and you can transport fresh spices while your competitors all trade in the relatively ineffectual dried varieties. You can slaughter animals in one place and sell the meat on another continent. It's what refrigeration wishes it could be when it grows up.

** At that point, why carry the merchant at all? Just let him stay at home and let the cleric handle the exchange of items. If you like lugging around corpses, pack some random graveyard into your vessel.

** tl;dr:

- Cleric of god of death painlessly kills merchants and casts Gentle Repose to preserve corpses

- Dead merchants' souls go to a comfortable antechamber of the afterlife, by special arrangement with the god of death

- Caravan space that would've been taken up by merchants' food/water/clothes can be devoted to more sellable goods, allowing more profit for the merchants

- Cleric rides with corpses to maintain Gentle Repose, then casts Revivify or Raise Dead upon arrival at destination

** Huh. Seems inefficient, honestly. Is being dead for the journey really /that/ much more relaxing and safe, especially if you're conscious the whole time?

... on the other hand, glancing at the item prices, maybe it isn't such a bad deal.

*** You're not conscious of the journey itself; you're conscious of a luxurious place of rest and relaxation, and you're NOT conscious of the nitpicky details of the passage of time. (Departed souls are explicitly stated by the rules as only knowing a vague idea of how long they've been dead.)

The thing that seems inefficient to me is that the cleric has to go on the trip, and the cleric requires supplies... although I suppose the cleric could just pray for Create Food and Water.

Additional inefficiency: The merchants themselves aren't nearly as much of a drain on the caravan's capacity as their guards are. Merchants with character levels can serve as PART OF the caravan's guard, which is more efficient than hiring henchmen AND stocking supplies for them (and musclebound henchmen probably eat a greater volume of food than merchants, even though the food they eat might be cheaper).

There's... also the problem with Revivify... uh... not working that way. Whether it's 3.5 Revivify or 5E Revivify, Gentle Repose doesn't change the fact that the merchant died more than one round / one minute ago. In fact, 3.5's description of the spell's effect is that it works by preventing the soul from leaving in the first place, so the suggestion that they have a cushy room in the afterlife to wait is explicitly contrary to that.

You can work around that with Revenance, which calls the soul back to the body for a limited time, and then Revivify locks the soul into the body. But now you're paying the cleric for even more spellcasting services. (Which is a good deal for the cash-strapped god of death! But not so much for the merchant.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Actually, it explicitly does. That's it's primary purpose.

#+begin_quote
  Gentle Repose

  You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. *Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see raise dead). Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit.* Additionally, this spell makes transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant.
#+end_quote

Revivify works the same as raise dead, only it measures its time limit in rounds, not days.

***** Specific trumps general.

Gentle Repose has a general rule that says that the body doesn't decay, so as a result spells that raise the creature from the dead get a bigger window.

There is also a general rule in the PHB that says:

#+begin_quote
  Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.
#+end_quote

Revivify, at least in 3.5, has a specific rule that says:

#+begin_quote
  Before the soul of the deceased has completely left the body, this spell halts its journey while repairing somewhat the damage to the body.
#+end_quote

The specific requirement of Revivify ("before the soul [leaves] the body") is not addressed by the general provision of Gentle Repose ("[the remains] do not decay") and overrides the general description of life-restoring magic ("returning it to his or her body").

The reason Revenance+Revivify works is because Revenance does not override this general description and therefore it does in fact provide a mechanism to return the soul to the body, which then will not have departed before Revivify can be cast.

I grant that the change to the wording of Revivify in 5th Edition invalidates this criticism, and given that the article in question is referring to the spell costing 300gp instead of 1000gp, it seems to be written from that perspective. However, I also don't currently see a first-party source for the existence of Gentle Repose in 5th edition, so... you'd have to house-rule the spell in for it to work!

****** I think you're mistaking flavor text for rules text.

And even if you weren't, in this scenario the God of Death is on side for team Rez.

******* The whole thing about the Open Gaming License is that Wizards of the Coast wanted to allow the rules text to be shared while making the flavor text be their own exclusive property. As such, everything that makes it into the d20 SRD as opposed to the published Dungeons and Dragons sourcebooks is, at some level, rules text. The SRD /is/ the authoritative documentation of how the d20 system works, and any deviations from the text of the SRD are by definition DM fiat. And there's nothing wrong with DM fiat; it's explicitly encouraged by the rules themselves. But if we bring DM fiat into the picture, then it makes the entire discussion pointless because the Word of God has spoken.

Meanwhile: If the God of Death had the ability to break the rules of mortal magic enough to allow his clerics to successfully cast a spell that ought not work, then this whole mess isn't even necessary. He could grant his clerics a different spell entirely -- something like a Temporary Death spell that would perform the painless peaceful killing, maintain the corpse, and then resurrect the subject without penalty at the cleric's command if it didn't take damage during the spell's duration. Such a spell would be balanced because it's a MUCH stronger predicate on when the resurrection can happen: you can't use it to revive someone who died of ANY other means. (Juliet would have used a potion of this spell.)

The exercise here is to provide a way that the God of Death could do this within the rules as written.

*** I don't think it'd be quite that popular. However, I can see it being a tourist thing - the God of Death could set up a whole otherworldly vacation destination to enjoy while on your way to real vacation destinations, and for /really/ long trips - halfway across the world with a medieval tech level - it would probably be preferable.

** This is a lovely thought, but why in the world would you do this? Load your goods and people into a set of Portable Holes. Have a mage Teleport to the destination. Boom, done.

Things to note:

- Portable Holes can be nested by RAW, so you can have a lot of space.
- There's 10 person-minutes of air in a Portable Hole. You only need two rounds to do this. (1) pick up Hole + cast Teleport. (2) Put Hole down. It is open, it has unlimited air.
- If you want more safety margin, there's lots of options. Darsson's Cooling Breeze (ideally + Permanency), Bottles of Air, those brass pipes from Stormwrack designed for diving bells, another PH that you open when you need air, etc.

Assuming you don't need the Permanency, you can do all of this with a 7th level mage. Teleport has a margin for error, but it's a percentage of the distance traveled, so you can walk your shots on target. Portable Holes cost 20,000 gold and therefore 3 weeks to make -- with demand as high as it would be, plenty of mages would be cranking them out. There's other options too -- Enveloping Pits, Bags of Holding (the largest), Teleportation Circle, etc.

I can see Gods of Death offering vacation packages, but not just to make trade caravans easier.
