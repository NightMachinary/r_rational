I was thinking that the investigations presented on [[http://easydamus.com/alignment.html][this site]] might be useful for people who wanted to write about characters who adhered to the "alignment" system promoted by /Dungeons & Dragons/ (i.e., the lawful-vs.-chaotic and good-vs.-evil axes) in a rational fashion.

** The D&D alignment system is terrible for everything but a very black and white game. It's trying to put round pegs into square holes. Either the pegs aren't going to fit, or you're going to end up cutting off all the interesting bits in order to make them fit.

I've gotten in some big fights with people that stem from the ability to cast things like, "Detect Law", or the existence of weapons that require you to be a specific alignment. It's not enough to say, "My character thinks that taxation is theft and labor is slavery", you have to slap some kind of label on it, and unless you're explicitly playing to a defined type, you're going to run into trouble pretty quickly.

If you go look at those pages, it's easy to see the counter-examples, or the corner cases. I can be chaotic evil, driven by hedonism, and still not be a murderer (expect to the extent that any adventurer is). If I'm "chaotic evil" and also think in the long-term, I'm still not going to stab my supposed friends in the back, because that's a short-term solution. If I keep my word, people will know that I keep my word, and then those suckers will be tricked into trusting me. And then I'll abide by the agreements that I've struck, because that means that the next suckers will keep on believing that I'm trustworthy, which gets me better jobs and makes people treat me better. You can play a chaotic evil character who plays by the rules and routinely does "good", because he thinks that's the most convenient way to live life. (This is how I tend to play CE.)

When I DM, I ditch the alignment system entirely. Tell me what your character values, what they fear and what they love, who they have connections to and what their breaking points are, and we can come up with something a lot better than D&D uses.

*** The way I tend to interpret it is that the alignments have molded people's values, rather than the other way around. When there's an objectively-measurable thing which mostly lines up with what they already think of as good, they're likely to adopt it as their standard measurement for goodness, because people tend to find the idea of objective morality to be comforting.

Once it becomes the standard, the points of inconsistency between their original values and the “good” that they can objectively measure start to melt away; people reason that anything which registers as “good” must be morally good, even if it wasn't previously labeled as such.

Also, of course, I'd expect different cultures to latch on to different alignments. For instance, I'd expect drow culture to see the alignment which the rulebooks refer to as "Evil" as the /good/ one, since it's the one most in line with their values.

A side effect of this interpretation is that the round-peg-square-hole problem stops being a problem. Someone with complex values will /keep having/ those same complex values, regardless of how the universe's alignment-measuring algorithms decide to label them.

I'd say that's what lawful means. You follow the rules such that people knowing you follow those rules is to your advantage. "Detect law" just says if the person will cooperate with acausal trade.

But yeah, the D&D alignment system is oversimplified and you're better off without it. There shouldn't be clear lines for if each act follows each alignment.

***** What's a traditional anarchist, I've never once heard that phase and I'm not exactly a novice. These ideas come from the separate schools of anarchism, individual and collective. Basically to hold both at the same time you would need to hold two very contradictory ideas to the question "how should disputes over resources be settled?" Either you believe in property rights or communistic democracy (or a state) as ought to be the final arbitrator.

To take a simple example, an anti-gay store, either you respect property rights and allow them to continue to opperate or mob rule overrides it and you /force/ them to serve gays or shut down there's no middle ground here.

****** Self-sufficient isolationism? You claim a piece of land and live there with your family and friends until a big enough argument makes the smaller party pack all their mobile things and leave for greener pastures. Or you simply have no problem with theft as long as you are the thief, making you NE or CE.

Not really, no. All anarchists agree on getting rid of taxes and the government, and all anarchists agree on getting rid of wage-labor and capitalism.

Individualist variants of anarchism, like mutualism, still do not tolerate wage-labor, though they'll accept loans issued by a community provided that it doesn't result in a class of people who don't have to work like everybody else. Collective variants of anarchism, like anarcho-communism, still do not accept taxes, though they encourage voluntary communal arrangements which ensure that everyone produces what they are willing and able to produce and freely give away whatever they don't want to the community, and they are freely given things made by other members of the community, so it's effectively a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy][gift economy]].

The statement, "Taxation is stealing the product of our labor, and the wage labor system does the same" could easily come from any of the anarchist variants.

******* Sorry to trend on the "true anarchism^{tm"} but I'm an an-cap so fuck your end all capitalism, and government; end states, you are not acquainted with individualist anarchism in the least; I'll point to two sources "natural law"/"no teason" by Spooner, suggesting that the government, not states is not an invention by an-caps alone; and while I don't remember the source in the book "markets not capitalism"(I assume this represents multalism on a whole) one of the essays is on the meaning of "wages are theft", where they retreat from the impaction, its a crime but rather a vice they would never violently oppose.

They are incompatible, for the simple reason either "social contracts" overwrite individual rights or they do not. And taxation rests on social contracts, while extreme vices rest on individual rights. So even if you did believe all the horrible things about wages, it still falls into extreme vices so replace it with "meth" or something similar. Taxation is taxation regardless of how good a cause its funding, like saying "buying out all meth labs to destroy all meth", which our methhead wage slave may not be for; but the question is simple would you force him to give up meth or not if a "direct democracy" voted to get rid of all meth? Does your moral code protect exterme deviants?

  [Lawful good characters] will obey the laws and customs of the area that they are in, but will attempt to find legal loopholes to disobey a law which is clearly evil or unjust.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  A lawful good character will not honor a law that runs contrary to his alignment. A government may believe that unregulated gambling provides a harmless diversion, but a lawful good character may determine that the policy has resulted in devastating poverty and despair. In this character's mind, the government is guilty of a lawless act by promoting an exploitative and destructive enterprise. In response, he may encourage citizens to refrain from gambling, or he may work to change the law. Particularly abhorrent practices, such as slavery and torture, may force the lawful good character to take direct action. It doesn't matter if these practices are culturally acceptable or sanctioned by well-meaning officials. The lawful good character's sense of justice compels him to intervene and alleviate as much suffering as he can. Note, though, that time constraints, inadequate resources, and other commitments may limit his involvement. While a lawful good character might wish for a cultural revolution in a society that tolerates cannibalism, he may have to content himself with rescuing a few victims before circumstances force him to leave the area.
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Conflict between lawful neutral and lawful good characters will center around the nature of laws. Lawful good characters want laws to protect the weak and punish the wicked, while lawful neutral characters are only interested in maintaining or expanding laws to cover every foreseeable problem within society without compassion or moral judgment. Lawful neutral characters will apply laws in a rigid manner, not worrying about whether the spirit of the law is upheld. It is the letter that is important to them. The language of the social compact and the wording of laws are all they are interested in, since that is all that is apparent from written documents. A lawful good character will be just as offended by a lawful neutral character's preference of letter over spirit as they are contemptuous of the neutral good character's insistence that the spirit is more important. The lawful good character will question the utility of laws that do not take into account all circumstances to provide a just and equitable settlement that coincides with their moral beliefs. The lawful neutral character does not consider morality when applying laws, only the effectiveness of the law to keep society stable.

Never understood that. So the LG crusader enters the Kingdom of Evil and is therefore expected to follow their laws? What?

What if a Lawful character lives in a lawless and anarchic country? Is he just free to do whatever with nothing to differentiate him from his mostly chaotic surroundings?

I always saw Lawful as the most subjective alignment. A mix of inner consistency when it comes to actions (do what your rules say not what you feel like doing) and a preference for conformity on both themselves and others. A LN character that also doesn't go into any extremes on any other type of axis (orange/blue morality) would probably prefer to have rules that everyone around him follows too rather than stick to his own laws even if everyone around him disagrees with them. It's only when Good, Evil, religiosity, loyalty or some other moral conviction comes into play that he wants to see his morals codified and if possible forced upon others.
