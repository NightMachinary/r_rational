Regarding it being rational fiction, I enjoyed this exchange (currently reading).

“Short of allowing me to heal your uncle, I do not think there is a simple way for me to convince you,” Liu Jianguo explained. “It is not wrong for you to be suspicious of me. I am, after all, a cripple. For me to have knowledge beyond the greatest doctors of this city is a laughable thought. It should be far easier for you to believe that I'm merely a charlatan that wishes to avoid death.”

“You know,” Xiao Nan said, his left eye twitching. “You aren't supposed to just admit something like that. You're supposed to grovel and beg for the opportunity to prove yourself to me.”

“If I begged and groveled, you'd see me as too desperate to be trusted,” the doctor pointed out calmly. “Make no mistake. I do not wish to die, and I believe earning your trust would help me stay alive. However, I don't think there is a simple way for you to suddenly trust me. I can heal your uncle. That much is true, but to you, I might as well be saying I am the general of a great army or the prince of a foreign country.”

** It's written better and with more forethought then the most XianXia but I am still not sure if it qualify for "rational".

Hero is no murderhobo and world isn't ridiculous - yes. Characters are not clichés - yes. Reading is enjoyable - yes. However, whether it's rational or not is yet to be seen IMHO.

*** I think it's one of the most rational xanxia available. Whether it fits the bill like you said is to be seen. But it's very promissing so far.

**** Maybe I'm just failing to understand xanxia but the characters always feel utterly alien to me. Their emotions, reactions, thought patterns, and sometimes goals are so far removed from my models of the people around me that they feel more like caricatures than real people. Is the cultural difference between western and asian just this big or is it something else?

***** Xanxia novels in China have roughly the same problem as Young Adult novels do in the United States - a glut of product, most of which is trashy lowest common denominator stuff packed with wish fulfillment and cliches. Only the stuff that sells really well gets translated and for the most part that's not the same as thing as stuff that readers would necessarily want to read.

***** it really depends on the quality of the xanxia you're reading. To be fairxanxia tend to amplify human traits with authors failing at writing the appropriate actions hence they nerf everyone else but the MC.

***** One of my biggest gripes with Chinese novels in general is how, despite how oh-so-great the MCs supposedly are, subservient the writing feels.

To give an example; the MC has a treasure, wealthy/powerful/influential/popular antagonist wants said treasure, MC defends treasure, then everyone, the MC included, talks about how the MC has offended wealthy/powerful/influential/popular antagonist('s family, clan, corporation, sect, world,...).

And it's freaking everywhere, xianxia, wuxia, xuanhuan, historical, romance, sci-fi,..., *everywhere*. I'm certain it's a cultural thing, given China's political situation (one Party to rule them all), but it's just so terrible to read.

Or how hypocritical every single MC is. If the MC was treated like shit, then they'll treat others like shit, but somehow that's OK now because they're the MC.

Or how tribal Chinese stories are. Everyone in the immediate area is a mortal enemy until a neighbour shows up, then they're all friends and the neighbours are the new mortal enemies. Then a newcomer arrives, and everyone unites against them, so on and so forth.

Argh, fuck it. The more I think about how shitty the features of Chinese writing are, the more angry I get at myself for still reading some of them.\\
But then I think of the alternatives; Japanese child porn, Korean VRRPG: The Book, and Western wish fulfilment.

*** Chapter 90 and "to be seen" means no, doesn't it? What relevant detail could possibly still be hidden?

Edit: guess I'll find out

** It's a bit unbalanced, 12yo kids are breaking the sound barrier while sparring by jumping fast. If that's the case every punch should break the sound barrier.

​

I think it's kind of dumb, breaking the sound barrier is generally high tier power level in most stories. Look at Delve, when people break the sound barrier it's f*ing awesome and it means they are incredibly powerful. Here it's something average 12yo kids can do without even trying hard.

​

Ave Xia Ren seemed good when it was just him in his home studying to become a doctor because it seemed like a parody, but now that we know that was only a prelude, something that would have happened in a normal story in less than 5 chapters, and everything seems like it's going to follow what the author promised in the tittle.

​

A generic harem xianxia story I've been quite disappointed with it. It seemed like it was a silly tittle with a story that differed wildly from it, but now that we know it's not the case and it has become a cliche fest a lot of the charm is gone.

** In a world where power is everything, Liu Jin only desires to become a great doctor like his father. However, destiny has no end of troubles stored for our hero. Powerful cultivators have their eyes on him. A nasty doctor is spreading rumors about his father. A burning man crosses his path, and his father's past may not be as simple as he suspected.

The tale of the strongest doctor begins now!
