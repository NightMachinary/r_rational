I've seen some discussion of the Bobiverse books here and thought it'd interest our community that the third and probably final book in the series is out!


** (Preventative typo apologies: I'm on mobile) I found it entertaining popcorn book. I gave it a half my attention first listen through today: it has some spots with poor pacing and there is a rather glaring strawman of anti-upload ideology repeated by more than a few characters, but overall if you've read the first two you will enjoy this one.

*** Well, I can sort of see the reasoning behind the anti-upload side. It isn't you, it's a copy of you. The anti-replicant racism is similarly just regular old human tribal bullshit.

Also most people are actually fairly illogical. Can't forget that.

** It's not the final book in the series. He has multiple trilogies planned.
