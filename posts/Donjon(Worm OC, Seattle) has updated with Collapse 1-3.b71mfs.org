** I really like this story so far. One thing I've been wondering about since Chapter 1: are her former roommates just enormous assholes, or does Carmin have some serious hygiene/cleanliness issues? I've had bad roommates before, but never any who were incapable of understanding how messy they were being when confronted with it. She seems quite likeable, if extremely self-conscious and -deprecating, from her own POV. I'm curious if she's maybe really hard to deal with externally.

*** Carmilla often wonders about that herself, it's quite a source of consternation for her.
