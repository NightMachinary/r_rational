I don't have terribly much to contribute for this one. Beyond what was on Toonami in the 90s (/Dragon Ball Z/, /Sailor Moon/, /Yu Yu Hakusho/, /Inuyasha/, etc.), Studio Ghibli's stuff (/Princess Mononoke/, /Howl's Moving Castle/, etc.), a few series on Netflix and/or Hulu (/Death Note/, /Madoka/, /Fullmetal Alchemist/, etc.), I haven't really watched that much anime -- I consider myself to have just enough for basic literacy of the form, and even then most of it is just Western dubs.

At any rate, this is the challenge companion thread. If you have recommendations for anime or manga, or for fanfic of those things, please leave them below.


** Log Horizon - players are transported to MMO world. They try understand rules of the world and form functional society.

Kaiji - gambler playing very simple games for very high stakes. It's about metagame and psychology.

Fate/zero - battle royale with mages and famous historical/mythological figures.

*** Be careful: make sure to watch Fate/Zero first. The other installments in the Fate series should not be watched until you have watched it. Although Fate/Zero was in fact written after the other Fate stories, it has a different target audience. It's a prequel of Fate/Stay Night written under license by Gen Urobuchi, and takes place in the same canon. Instead of being targeted at young adults (particularly young men), F/Z's target audience is older readers. It deals with darker themes and puts more effort into making character interactions more realistic. It's also non-H. I will also say I find Urobochi's writing much nicer than Nasu's, even though Nasu is a master of worldbuilding.

***** Watch the Fate Zero Anime. It's 2 13-episode seasons, and I found it quite gripping after episode 3. They really assembled an all-star team for it. The animation, voice acting, score, and writing are all top-notch.

It's available on Crunchyroll, and in America it's also available on Netflix.

The Voice Acting in the english dub is also fine, though it's not as good as in the Japanese dub. If you're willing to read subtitles, I recommend sticking with the Japanese voice acting, but the english dub is acceptable.

***** I'd actually caution you to do the opposite as to what [[/u/blazinghand]] recommended; if you watch Fate/Zero first, it will spoil some of the plot twists of the original TV series, Fate/Stay Night.

Fate/Zero is better than Fate/Stay Night, but if you're going to watch the whole series, it would be better to go Fate/Stay Night --> Fate/Zero --> Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (movie or TV series; same material is covered, but the TV series is newer). Unlimited Blade Works is set in the same time period and location as Stay Night, but is much darker and revolves around the protagonist being closer to Rin Tohsaka than Saber.

That said, if time is a factor and you only want to watch the best, Fate/Zero is the winner. It is definitely enjoyable by itself, but if you watch Stay Night first it'll make a lot of things "click."

****** This is true: F/Z spoils F/SN. However, I believe that F/SN also spoils F/Z. Since F/Z has a plot that I personally found more interesting, I was glad I watched it first. And yeah, if you're only gonna watch one, it should be F/Z.

When I was first was getting into the Fate Series, I asked my friend Derek who works at Crunchyroll which to watch first to avoid spoilers. He told me F/Z and F/SN both spoil each other, so I should watch F/Z first. Since either way one will be spoiled, it's better to get the full experience of F/Z, which is better written.

****** Are you talking about the 2006 series? That isn't recommended at all, it's a very bad adaptation of the original Visual Novel and the animation is very dated. The UBW movie is a bit better in the animation part, but it's even more of a butchered adaptation.

I didn't read the whole VN yet, but they say the best way is to read the whole VN then Fate/UBW and Fate/Zero. For anime only it's Zero > UBW > Wait for Heaven's Feel Movies.

***** That's a big question (also fix your spelling, you cur!)

Ok so. Fate/stay night is the original visual novel that started it all. It has three routes, the Fate route, the Unlimited Blade Works route and the Heaven's Feel route. You can feel free to start there, if you like. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/2b60x7/fatestay_night_realta_nua_100_patch_released/][Here's a link to just how to help you get started on downloading it]]

Fate/zero is a prequel story to Fate/Stay night and covers the Holy Grail war (that term will make more sense once you begin watching/reading) that happened 10 years before. It's not a visual novel, but it does have corresponding light novels and a completed anime. I highly recommend said anime.

There's also a Fate/Stay Night anime, that follows the first route primarily (the Fate route). There's also a Fate/Stay Night anime that follows the second route (The Unlimited Bladeworks route) People generally agree that the second is better than the first, considering it's released years after and has more fights+better animation. There's also an UBW movie that wil make no sense to you without context.

Those are the heavy hitters, although there's also a ton of other Fate media (collectively known under the Type-Moon name, or the Nasuverse if you like) such as PSP games, other visual novels, etc.

Have fun, go nuts and cry for Sakura-chan (you'll know it when you see it)

** It might be interesting to see a story about the one sane man (or woman) in the Saitama universe. Yes, One Punch Man is now an anime series.

Having the protagonist recognize that all the 'heroes' are loosely connected to reality at best, and try to figure out how to alternately avoid triggering or intentionally using their various insanities or quirks to make them take sane actions could be a good read.

** Shameless self plug incoming: I'm writing a Shokugeki no Soma (Food Wars) fanfiction called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11804422/1/Nisegami][Nisegami]]

It's not particularly rational, although it does take the main character and place him in a position to be more intelligent and strategic with his choices, as opposed to blindly shonen-esque.

Ok. Plug over. Code Geass features a fairly intelligent protagonist. At times, it can be a little too much (for example, there's a scene where said protagonist has a phone call with someone where he uses a recording. He's just able to predict exactly what the other guy was going to say days in advance. Pauses and all) but it's still enjoyable. Tbh, I don't really enjoy anime/Manga for their rationale elements (big surprise? :P) but for their other strengths such as romance, characterization, humor, etc. A particularly funny anime I've watched recently is called The Devil is a Part Timer. It's one of those that I'd almost say is better to watch English dubbed as opposed to subbed.

** Hmmm I'm trying to deconstruct a broad phenomena in anime/manga/porn in monster girls (yes I'm still doing that I've just pulled back and I'm doing a lot of structural work to get the character and plot rolling better then the more interactive version).

That seems like it would not QUITE qualify for this. If it does I could probably clean up my scripts, maybe slap some character illustrations or sketches on the google doc and get to chugging away at that as a kind of 2nd draft.

From the New World/Shinsekai Yori is my #1 favorite anime. a really nuanced and rich story. I recommend it to anyone on here without reservation, because the showmanship and execution is superb, and I think it easily fits the criteria of being rational fiction.

So far writing in that universe is pretty fun, especially since it's not something I have to 'rationalify'-- it's just a logical (to me) continuation from that point.
