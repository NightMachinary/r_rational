Ben 10 was a large part of my childhood growing up and he holds a special place in my heart. But I'd be lying if I said that everything was entirely rational and made logical sense.

So I've decided to undergo writing a rational Ben 10 Fan Fiction that will make sense especially in context to the aliens in Ben's omnitrix.

There will be new additions to Ben's omnitrix and I'll be changing a lot of the events in Ben 10 Alien Force and Ultimate Alien.

** One thing that always concerned me in Ben 10 was that the omnitrix was supposed to contain the DNA of all the species in the galaxy to foster unity or something, but the aliens Ben gets access to are ones that are useful in combat, instead of weak species like humans. Why did he get those combat species (and Greymatter) out of all the species he could have gotten? Why did humans fall on the shallow end of the power pool?

*** If I'm not mistaken, it wasn't to foster unity, it was to serve as kind of Noah's Ark, preserving the genetic code of all species. Ben got access to useful forms that would increase his chances of survival, as keeper of the Omnitrix.

*** Well in my story what makes humans so special is that they're not special at all. They don't have genius level intelligence, they aren't super strong or super fast. They are the average joes of the universe and their only remarkable trait is their ability to innovate and overcome hardship.

The Omnitrix was built by Azmuth as a tool of peace in an act of repentance following the destruction caused by his previous creation, Ascalon, a weapon of terrible power.

The Omnitrix had a three-fold purpose:

It would promote inter-species understanding by allowing other beings to experience different ways of life.

It would serve as a repository for the DNA of over a million different intelligent species, preserving them in the event that any of them should ever become extinct and bring them back.

**** That is a common sci-fi explanation for the importance of humans, but I don't think it is very plausible.

Innovation seems to be a matter of one' s ability to do three things.

1. Cast a wide conceptual net through the space of solutions

2. Filter the pile of ideas for good ones

3. Physically actualize the idea

All of these three seem like they must in some sense be dependent on intelligence, if not track absolutely with it.

If there are millions of intelligent species, and humans are even in the middle of the pack, then there are almost guaranteed to be orders of magnitude differences between the top and us. The only other solution would be to posit that among the enormous number of possible cognitive substrates and neural architectures, everything essentially converges within an order of magnitude or so of 100 IQ. This is all to say, I don't know that you can both have humans possess unremarkable intellect and remarkable talent at problem-solving.

***** Well as you intelligence in humans varies. Some are geniuses, some are just above average, and others are average and below average.

Humans in my story will be varying when it comes to what transpires.

****** I am not sure that that solves the problem. After all, there may be humans with 200 IQ, but there are not any with IQs in the 4 digits, while it seems difficult to believe that there wouldn't be aliens with intelligence topping that amount, considering the size of the distribution and our purportedly insignificant place in it.

******* Well humans in my story will have a defense against aliens in the form of the “Plumbers”. It's headed by some of the greatest minds in the world and I'll be trying to properly distributing intelligence to humans and aliens such as Grey matter.

But even the greatest minds of earth are nothing compared to a Galvan.

******** I was intrigued by your last sentence, so I did some quick research and math. Galvan are apparently roughly 5 inches tall, but otherwise look like they share proportions with humans. Optimistically assuming that they have roughly a tenth of human's volume/mass, that gives them ~7*10^{-3} cubic meters to fill and 7 kg to fill it with. That must be some serious stuff that they are made of if they are the cognitive 99.9999%. I look forward to what you do with it.

**** According to Alien Force, our main notable trait is apparently being interstellar Casanovas. We are biologically compatible with /everything/.

****** Perhaps humans are compatible with a significant fraction of intelligent species, at least insofar as the splicing tech is concerned. Maybe humans were even engineered for this purpose, to be sort of multi-purpose gene platforms. With enough psychological distance, the aliens might perceive (or rationalize) this as deeply satisfying for us, rather than existentially horrifying.

******* Ehh, even then I'm still kinda iffy on whether humans should just be able to be compatible with alien species and be able to bone them like nothing. As in my world osmosians don't exist Kevin 11 is just a mutant with strange abilities to absorb and take on the properties of Materials that he touches.

**** Have you considered that it might just to be really expensive to maintain such overly powerful forms? A human can go for weeks without food and for days without water. Who knows just how many calories a being that is literally always on fire might have to consume just to not fizzle out. Humans might just be special in that they can survive and even flourish in a resource-poor environment.
