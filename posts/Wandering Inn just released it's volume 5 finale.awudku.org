Originally heard of the series here, and while it's characters aren't extremely rational, but they believable pursue their goals. I'd say it ranks around WTC in that area, and I feel it tends to tick the right boxes that a lot of people on here enjoy.

Anyway, 5.62 is the latest volume conclusion and I think it's worth checking out if you haven't already, or catching up if you stopped in the past.

Synopsis: Normal people from earth find themselves transported to a new world where fulfilling requirements will give people classes and Skills. The Skills range from the supernatural, like harder skin, to mundane, like knowing how to better cook. The world's been stagnant around a medieval level of tech as a lot of people tend to rely on Skill knowledge instead of pursuing learned skills. The world also tends to be a bit more violent, as conflict causes people to gain levels and become more powerful.

The story mostly follows Erin Solstice who's just a normal person without any exceptional scientific knowledge who brings a bit of our sense of right and wrong into a hostile world. It also has many interludes and side arcs following several others. I've found I enjoy almost every side story characters, as well as how they tie together with the main thread.

Edit: Reread the post, found out I mistyped characters are extremely rational, instead of aren't.


** The Wandering Inn is very good serial fiction and it is extremely effective at evoking emotion, but I would hesitate to call it “rational.” It's more /realistic/ in its characterization of people than many fantasy stories, but not very rational.

** As others have said, the story of the wandering inn isn't super suitable for this subreddit. What's probably more interesting to discuss is the author, who has someone poured out several million words of pretty good quality fiction in under 3 years. And still seems not even half way through all the possible plot threads introduced thus far. It's a fairly crazy work rate

**** Erin Solstice, the main character, is a truly and remarkably irrational and intellectually uncurious character, who takes no substantive steps towards learning more about the world that she's in or finding a way back home to earth. She doesn't even read any books. Examples are endless. I'd compare her a lot to Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece, which makes her a very fun and unpredictable character to follow, but she is not a rational actor in any sense.

Ryoka pretends at rationality with her actions (refusing to start the arms race), but anyone with sense could see, after the phone call at the end of volume 1, that things are now far beyond that. The fact that she continues to work as a [Runner] with the knowledge she has is a joke and a complete waste of potential, whose only redeeming value is her relationship with the powerful, mystical characters of the world that she meets.

****** 1) In those circumstances, yes.

2) Ryoka's values swerve towards maximizing her self benefit and the benefits of her friends, without starting Innworld War 1. This would be most rationally accomplished by becoming wealthy and powerful without becoming an arms dealer in the process. This can be easily accomplished by numerous innovative, but unharmful inventions she possesses the knowledge of, such as penicillin and matches and ice cream. Instead, however, she does nothing on this front. Note how Erin, the half-idiot, is doing ten times more than Ryoka in this regard.

I suppose her true desire is to be as unimportant as possible. Which makes sense, but botches her potential as a character.

That's also fair and I especially agree with the last part. It explains her behaviors/decisions as rational as a character but then this value direction makes the work as a whole less rational because a character with those values exists. Thanks for explaining.

I would say rather that being incurious tends to undermine the capacity to behave rationally. Acting rationally requires a certain amount of knowledge and understanding, and if you're so incurious that you never bother learning how things work, it's going to be hard to act rationally. Instead, your actions will essentially be guesswork, which is a fairly good descriptor for how Erin behaves in the story. She makes it work because she has some good intuitions (and because she has some fairly blatant plot armor), but mostly she's kind of bumbling about.

*** Not sure where it first picks up, but I have a sense of where I at least personally found it start to lose energy. The first couple of books are pretty decent slice-of-life fare. After that it kind of slides downhill into an ever expanding cast of characters. It is a balancing act. Early on you don't have any world building done. Later on you have perhaps a little too much spread unevenly across too large a cast.

** I recall a particularly jarring set of retcons surrounding the idea of a level cap where people were initially complaining about level cap cultist but had never heard of the idea in later chapters. This was just the most visible change to accommodate the protagonists being unprecedented geniuses. It seems the rules and personalities of people often switch around to make whoever is the POV seem competent (as in you can make more accurate predictions about the world by questioning "what would make X look badass" than what has been directly stated in previous chapters). It's amusing in places ( I fondly remember the chatroom interlude) but it's no WTC.

A certain horned adventurer? I'm not sure I know who you're referring to otherwise. My memory's not great and I binged this pretty into it's writing so it's possible I've forgotten that detail.

As for the protagonists being geniuses I might've just forgotten details of the previous volumes since 5 focuses so heavy on Erin, I feel like most of the protagonists are protagonists because they're exceptional, as compared to say the some of the Heroes that get introduced around the Clown arc, and the other people from earth that the Lady finds and keeps.

The worst I can really think of is how a blind guy kinda stumbled into the system and ended up getting a good shake of things completely by chance, but the direction he took it in helped make it sit better with me.

**** One of the earliest chapter has people act squeamish around Ryoka when they find out she's refusing to level up because she's one of those weird people who think you can only level so many times. Skip ahead 2 books and Klbkch has never heard of this idea and neither has seemingly anyone else. Erin goes from outwitting stupid monsters with traps to trouncing world famous adventurers without any explanation.

And well...

Is this a normal person or very influential and powerful one? Are they needlessly confrontational or a subtle manipulator? Are they a racist xenophobe or exceptionally open minded?

The answer is probably yes.

This is a somewhat difficult accusation because you can always claim character development but inevitably seems to be the *same* character development every time. Its always a fun sort of development don't get me wrong but it's sort of like seeing an anime constantly going "Masaka?!" It never quite stops being amusing but it does become predictable.

***** What? I was always under the impression Ryoka didn't level because it felt like something was trying to control her. I think she theorized there might be a cap but I never ascribed that as a reason she would not level period. Also she theorized that levels stack in terms of difficulty. Someone already level 30 in one class will find it difficult to level something else from level 1. Not a game changer but important. It's why Klbkch was worried about his own classes. He used to be mostly Slayer but after several resurrections over the years, Slayer got lower and he picked up other classes which made progression in Slayer harder.

****** Yeah. That's not what was in the text originally. I'm not sure if you don't remember or if the author went back to edit it. You're right that Ryoka doesn't care about levels becoming more difficult to obtain but Klbkch doesn't even consider the possibility. He believes that levels get harder to obtain once you get older and the idea that it could be otherwise is a shocking discovery. Earlier there are people who specifically note that people who don't take levels because they think there's a cap are a thing and that they are considered pariahs. Ryoka gets accused of being one.

Wandering Inn is not terribly consistent most of the time. It's very obviously being written one story arc at a time.
