Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** How would /you/ create a rational Avatar world? The mechanics and spirit of the bending powers is all you need to keep for this prompt (i.e. they're partly spiritual, firebending is about the concept of Fire rather than oxidisation), in as much as you need to do anything I say.

Keep the Lion Turtles? Have prehistoric cavemen like in the real world, only with bending? Etc etc.

Love to hear what you can come up with :)

*** Bending is divided into four elements, with distinctions between benders of the same element largely being a result of training and aptitude. Bending is hereditary, but also somewhat tied to geography and spirit, meaning that two fire benders who have a child born in the Earth Kingdom and indoctrinated under Earth Kingdom cultural values will have a strong chance of their child expressing as an earth-bender. (We can think of the hereditary aspect as simply allowing a binding site for the element, with some kind of spiritual "Sorting Hat" element that takes into account expected personality, cultural background, parentage, and geography. It would allow benders who are 'against type', but they would be rare, and some people who have the binding site get a null binding, meaning that they're non-benders.) Most fire benders are aggressive not because that's their culture, but because those are the people who tend to get the bending power.

All the other disciplines are an outgrowth of the four elements, either being adaptations of a secondary element's style/ethos, or a deep dive into what an element conceptually is. Blood bending, energy bending, healing, vine bending, sand bending, glass bending, void bending, lightning, ice bending, metal bending, et cetera all fall under "technique" which have variable difficulty to learn, being easier if you have a good teacher and approaching nearly impossible for some if you don't have the right aptitude/training.

--------------

Practical consequences of this:

1. Benders will most likely be of a specific, pre-determined ethos. Since benders are more powerful than non-benders, they'll tend to have disproportionate power, which means that culture and society will have a pressure in that direction. If the Fire Nation ever started to shift away from the pre-defined ethos of the fire benders, there's a good chance that they would face a coup (at best, they need to accommodate the benders).
2. None of the nations can really have other benders in great quantity. There are a few strategies: hire benders from other nations, establish cultural enclaves within their own nation, or take territory from another nation and attempt to occupy it while still retaining their culture. All these come with costs and pitfalls, especially since there's a decent chance of fomenting rebellion or losing benders to emigration.
3. It's hard to hold territory outside of your own designated environs. Even if you manage to wrest control from another nation, you're never going to get the kind of homogenity that you want, and you'll /still/ get benders who are ideologically opposed being born there, albeit without much in the way of training.
4. Since fire bending polities can absorb other fire bending polities with relative ease, the result /should/ be that all the fire benders will eventually become unified, assuming that the civic technology exists to make that happen. Same goes for the other nations, except perhaps in the case that there's a large geographic separation.

I don't really think there's /that/ much that needs to be rationalized in the series/setting; it's relatively well thought through.

***** You can keep a lot of the same stuff. Republic City is a culturally unified city that's meant to have equal representation of benders, and it's chiefly composed of immigrants. I don't think that the show dives deeply enough into politics to get at stuff like "Fire Nation is overrepresented in the populace" or "different national ethos cause frictions", but that's good fodder for exploration of some themes, especially since they're essentially the same themes as the "bender vs non-bender" core conflict of season one (which got undercut by how they handled it and didn't have a satisfactory resolution).

If second (or third) generation immigrants are much less likely to have powers (since Republic City isn't of prototypical geography and culture is a mish-mash), then you get benders as foreigners and hardliners, which underscores and layers some of the bender/non-bender tensions, since it's not just "why should the benders have all the powers" but also this separate issue of "what do the powerless do against the powerful" and "what do you do when your ethos is disadvantaged by the facts of the world in spite of its moral correctness".

Of course, if you really wanted to, you could change the rules between series, which would have its own effects. Since bending is partly spiritual, the "who gets to bend" issue could be "solved" by the Avatar at some point, especially if they realized the systemic/political issues with what's outlined above. IIRC something like that happens in Korra anyway, with the air benders coming back.

*** Make the bending techniques secret, the same way China kept silk production and porcelain a secret for thousands of years. Have the four nations speaking different languages (or dialects) and using different writing systems to make it difficult to spread information from place to place. Use a feudal society where most people are bound to the land and their family, not free to travel elsewhere, so the spread of ideas is painfully slow, and information (like Greek fire) can be lost to time provided the secret is well-guarded.

*** The world is just a place created by some lion turtles to keep their pets? Cause why would spirits separate from their property/territory/home willingly?

I don't know what else to change. The hybrid animals make no sense, except if some spirit created them. But it would be a different world without them, even if they are mainly fluff.

Maybe try to get avatar powers for everyone (you like)? There should be a way. Or use light bending to gift bending powers.

Find better martial arts that can be used by all benders (like the redirecting lightning is inspired by the water tribe martial art) or is specific for the avatar.

What do you find irrational? People trusting the avatar will fix things?

**** Mostly this is inspired by the recent Avatar nitpicking thread.

Probably what I'd do as make it so everyone has the potential to learn all bending styles, they just have different levels of ability. Some people would practically be non-benders, though, they have that little ability.

I'd keep as much of the rest as I can, I like the flavour of the world.

*** I would lean into the whole spirit-bending as the origin of element bending.

Command of an element isn't hereditary. Typically the talent is granted by lion turtles, and an aspring bender is expected to go on a quest to find and petition a lion turtle for the power. Any given lion turtle only ever hands out one element. No one but the lion turtles know if that's because they can't grant others or if they choose not to, but it's the reason for the homogeneity of the national bending traditions as the element favored by the local lion turtles is by far the easies one for somone to learn in that region. Lion turtles will almost invariably refuse to talk to the avatar, and have never been known to grant an element to somone who already had a different element (again, no one actually knows if the can't or just don't).

​

The Avatar is their world's Prometheus. Humans claim he scammed the lion turtles into giving him multiple elements and they punished him with personal responsibility to what humans do with bending and eternal reincarnation until he achieves the Sysephean task of bringing "balance" to the world which they deliberately divided by handing out bending the way they do. The lion turtles generally refuse to comment but Wan-shi-ton's library is rumored to contain their account of the origin of the avatar (it's basically the story we saw in Korra).

​

However lion turtles aren't the only sprit benders. The avatar has learned the art a couple times and therefore it's available to any avatar via the avatar state (though mucking about with somone's soul is usually not a task for the emotionally charged midset the avatar usually uses to induce that state), and some spirits can do it as well, but they don't tend to hand out elements. There are constant rumors of human spirit benders, but they're treated with the same stigma as "witches" or otehr practitioners of irresponsibly risky arts due to how easily it is for spirit bending to go bad and how hard it is to practice to the point of mastery without leaving a trail of shattered souls behind. Allegations that they got their power form a spirit-bender instead of a lion turtle is a prejudice that benders who develop novel application for their element (lava bending, metal bending, etc.) often face. And sometimes it's true (blood bending, mr. Explosion, healing*).

​

*I'd make healing super rare because it's pretty OP, and I like the idea of one of the most objectively good novel bendings being the product of the taboo for good reasons process.

*** The past thread complained that it was weird to have a 'Fire Nation', 'Water Nation' or whatever.

I'd solve this by saying that bending-potential worked like real-world blood type. One gene gives you element-coded proteins in your blood. But you need two matching genes to control an element. Since the genes always appear on the same chromosome, this means that everyone can bend at most 1 element.

Real world blood types create the possibility of [[https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/rh-incompatibility][Rh-incompatibility]], where you get medical problems if a baby has proteins that the mother doesn't have.

People in Avatar's history wouldn't understand blood-proteins, or genetics. But they'd notice that two fire-benders would always have fire-bender kids. And they'd probably notice that two benders of different types have non-bender kids, plus a bunch of health complications.

That's enough to create some pretty strong taboos and cultural norms.

** In a fantasy world where the technology is at about the renaissance level from us and (10% of the) people can summon temporarily material from (ectoplasm from) a different dimension/plane [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9g25b6/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/e619qk1/][(with some limitations detailed here)]] and telekinetically move the summoned stuff. (Personally I want the power difference from magician to warrior be like tank to soldier)

What monsters could there be? And what powers do they have?

They should have an evolutionary path and be somewhat plausible (in that world). Also if possible their powers shouldn't be too different.

For example, some dragon species can summon flames from the dimension/plane that destroys someone elses ectoplasm (material). But they aren't the big apex predators they are in other fantasy settings. They have big wings and light bodies. The biggest species should have a main body about the size of a horse (+ wings). There are cat/dog sized species used as pets (or guard dragons).\\
Pigeon sized dragons (without flames) replaced pigeons.

Fairies can hide temporarily in the other dimension/plane. And are intelligent hand-sized insects with humanish proportions (google winged praying mantis). There are other insects that can do this.

Dryads could be bears/apes that can summon plants.

Goblins are... smart lizards/salamanders/sharks (on land)\\
Also, what type of state should there be? Or you find interesting and would fit the setting? Kings/Queens and Lords/Ladies? Democracies and dictatorships? Just city states like in ancient greek? Communism? I don't plan to write about political stuff or mention it (more than once), but I dislike that all of fantasy has kingdoms as default...

Anyone has ideas how Chimeras, Manticores, Satyrs, Wolpertinger and similiar creatures could happen? I want them, but can't really find a way how to make them without saying a wizard did it. Maybe two creatures got fused using a portal in the other dimension... and somehow survived... and their genes combined (so they can have kids)... somehow... with the help of a wiz- f##k..

Anyhow I'm thankful for any input. Maybe you think they have a different technology path than us. (I just don't want too much chemistry aka explosives or steam power.) Or there should be vulcanos throwing out ectoplasm from the other plane/dimension (that vanishes before it gets back down). Or you have suggestions what the inhabitants would call the ectoplasm/material, creatures, other plane/dimension or I should call it to make clear what the ectoplasm/material does. (Cause all used terms are just placeholders for now.)

Thanks for reading, even if you don't comment :-)

I think sticking to biological creatures only is needlessly limiting in fantasy.

P.S. I think ectoplasm needs a shorter name. Ether, Pysche, Soulsomethingorother(soulmass? doesn't matter if it's not actually soul related, they don't know that!), but ideally no more than 2 syllables. It's going to be coming up a lot in whatever story features it, and 4 syllables is too long for it not to get annoying in my opinion.

But I don't know if I want intelligent ectoplasm.

Still maybe some ghost thingies have enough ectoplasm to become natural golems. Or slimes...

I just don't like to anthropomorph rocks... or water... or air... or fire... And those should still follow evolution (meaning there should be small and big ones and with similar different abilities). But creatures that are out of ectoplasm give dragonfire (which destroys ectoplasm) an evolutionary edge.

Still what do those things eat (where do they get their energy). Ghost can probably hount mages (and creatures using ectoplasm) and suck energy from them.

Also no clue why someone should be able to use telekinesis (on their own ectoplasm).

I would need some other things that uses telekinesis.

***** Depends how intelligent your Fae are. If they're human-level intelligence (even only small-child-level) or have poisonous bite or stings, then you have a creature that people do /not/ want to mess with (because they can slip in /underneath your armour/ and bite/sting/stab you).

Outdoors you'll have plenty of insects and indoors fewer - except the Fae which will be in about the same quantities either way. Also, that sealed grain silo isn't all /that/ sealed while they're around.

If they're intelligent or at least trainable, then you have potential for unstoppable spies (with perhaps a magic item for scrying on if they're only trainable).

What do they eat? If they eat ectoplasm then a swarm of them is going to really annoy a wizard (even if any individual one eats only a negligible amount), but at the same time a wizard who knows what he's doing can try to guide a swarm (e.g. towards an enemy's spell) by baiting them with his own ectoplasm, as a kind of targeted dispel.

That, and they should find their way inside carcasses before the creature that killed that carcass gets to the inside thereof - so a hunter kills (say) a deer drags it home, and when he cuts it open a bunch of Fae fly out.

Well, there isn't really any other magic besides ectoplasm.* There are no healing spells or divination or buffs. Only stuff you can make with ectoplasm. Some monsters may have different powers (like fairies or dragons), which should still relate to ectoplasm somehow.

Also ectoplasm doesn't really regenerate. If you lose some, you are weaker forever. So most try to keep their ectoplasm near them, to prevent enemies from bubbling it.

And I thought it was an old myth or something that was also mentioned there: " it might or might not have something to do with distorted re-re-re-re-tellings of some early iron age people's conflicts with more primitive, still bronze-using cultures."

  /Living/ matter. There's a difference
#+end_quote

The difference would be the steady state of biological reactions. And I don't see how that would be different from any other chemical reactions. (like rusting iron or burning wood or cooking)

We could say it is the biological electricity of the human body. But if that weak thing can stop ectoplasm, what happens if a storm cloud has lightning bolts in it.

So if I think it from the beginning to the end: ectoplasm interacts with electricity somehow. Maybe it stops someones control over it. Or throws it back in the other plane. Now fae would 'fear' magnets cause magnets produce electricity via magnetic induction (not sure about grammar) and that somehow interacts with their abilities, they either lose the ability to travel between planes or get pushed into the other plane.\\
Now if there is some electricity, like with a lighting strike, all mages near it lose their power over ectoplasm for a while. Maybe a second, maybe a minute, depending how far away they are. And mages can't use their ectoplasm if it got hit by lightning for days/weeks. But better than they get hit.

I think that could work. I just can't make a reincarnated millennial the protagonist (He would be overpowered.) Also you couldn't make electric devices with ectoplasm.

I like it, cause I chose ectoplasm as a temporary name cause I thought the magic stuff should act somehow like ghosts if unused. And it is 'proven' ghosts interact with emf sensors. ;-D

Now the only problem is how weak the electricity is, and why in the skin. I could say evolution made animals/monsters have more electricity in their bodies, since it protects from ectoplasm. But I think electricity should be in nerves and muscles. I should research that. But maybe that is why you can still use ectoplasm in somebodies body

It also could 'explain' why you could store/hide all your ectoplasm inside your body (well it is stored in the other plane and can be there compressed all you want). But the next problem is, why you can still use/control it. Maybe some ectoplasm acts like an antenna to your magnetic field and your ectoplasm interacts somehow with your magnetic field. Easier way would be, you just need to step to the side, so the ectoplasm isn't in your body anymore. Still weak explanation. Maybe the telekinesis works differently.

Well, that helped me a lot. Too sad I'm lazy and will never write a story... Maybe I make a post in [[/r/worldbuilding][r/worldbuilding]] and [[/r/magicbuilding][r/magicbuilding]]. On the weekend, maybe

Does your world have to follow the same rules as ours?

There is a clear difference between living matter and dead matter, in that living matter is capable of self-directed movement and of reacting in various (more or less) intelligent way to stimuli; well, animals, at least. (Perhaps plants don't have an ectoplasmic extension). What (if anything) this difference implies in ectoplasmic terms you can basically decide arbitrarily.

#+begin_quote
  So if I think it from the beginning to the end: ectoplasm interacts with electricity somehow.
#+end_quote

Now, /this/ leads in all sorts of interesting directions.

Imagine a tower - a tall tower, the tallest thing in the area. It is topped with an iron rod, and that rod is connected to half a dozen lines of iron which run all the way down to the ground. Naturally, it attracts lightning like anything. Any mages inside this tower will be completely unable to use any magic at all. So, if you need to keep one prisoner...

#+begin_quote
  But the next problem is, why you can still use/control it.
#+end_quote

Here's a thought. Your body uses a certain amount of electricity; some of it is to regulate your heartbeat. So /your/ ectoplasm is attuned to the beat of /your/ heart; exposing it to another heartbeat disperses raw ectoplasm (but not solid ectoplasm, or at least not immediately). It's not the voltage that stops it. It's the wrongness of the rhythm.

...as an extension of this, a mage whose heart stops and is re-started will lose all access to the ectoplasm he used to have (but may gain a different bunch instead, tuned to his new heartbeat)

*** Well I'm mostly just going to respond to the stuff about people using ectoplasm since that's what's going to most substantially impact human civilization and what I find the most interesting by far (everything else could be removed and things would still be very interesting).\\
As a side note if you want all your creatures magic to have common origins then you should have a pretty massive number of animals which make use of strategies involving creating extremely poisonous materials and shooting projectiles since ectoplasm control makes those the easiest offensive behaviors to evolve and lots of animals would evolve to create temporary shells around themselves out of something vastly more durable than bone, chitin or keratin. Also you're probably going to need a /very/ good reason ~100% of people didn't evolve to make use of ectoplasm because it would have been invaluable in the ancestral environment.

Anyway based on your previously mentioned limits on ectoplasm (including not being able to make solid objects smaller than a micrometer or any details of a larger solid object smaller than can be seen with the naked eye) I can imagine while overall tech level might be renaissance there would be a whole lot of exceptions to that.\\
Additionally even relatively weak mages end up becoming very formidable since one of the most important limits ends up being the amount of caloric energy your body can output in a day (with most people being able to at least manage 1-2k calories), so what really matters is how much someone can binge eat and still have their body make somewhat efficient use of the energy. However given how rapidly people with say anorexia can put on weight with high calorie diets and how many calories some endurance athletes need I'd say well trained mages could probably produce at most 10k of caloric energy per day which is somewhat over 8 kilograms of TNT.

Given the above considerations high quality gunpowder (or something that works about as well) will probably exist since once a single person figures out something like this the ability to create more via ectoplasm probably spreads rapidly. Additionally a whole lot of other rare or hard to synthesize materials are probably going to abound given how much easier ectoplasm makes chemistry. One impact of this is that chemical warfare is going to become very widespread pretty quickly which basically makes any non-mages a liability as they can only hope to flee or have a mage surround them with ectoplasm to protect them (since manufacturing sealed clothing capable of protecting against extremely potent poisons is probably not possible).

Armor piercing and high energy projectiles and explosives against other mages would also be the only real game in town in terms of weapons. Since while they might not have kevlar they could easily create the strongest spider silk which is an order of magnitude stronger and could be combined with limpet teeth (which are five times stronger than even that but rigid) making melee weaponry utterly useless (since you can't create ultra-sharp blades given the limitations) as well as any weaker ammunition. However while armor is probably going to be used due to shrapnel (and to protect against bullets which have lost much of their energy due to range) the use of high power single use ectoplasm guns and ammunition will probably still render the armor ineffective against a direct hit.\\
So together you're going to have really weird looking warfare, gas attacks which devastate cities being common. Artillery and high powered firearms and explosives are going to be used however large explosives are probably going to be rare due to the difficulty required in getting enough people to work together to make the explosive and then use it before it begins disappearing.

The benefits of ectoplasm on the development on chemistry are as mentioned before likely to be substantial and food protection will necessarily be very focused on, since that in turn determines how much firepower your military has access to. Given this chemical fertilizers seems nearly inevitable to develop by this time.

You're also going to have a weird dynamic in that flying around around especially with glider is going to be pretty easy with ectoplasm control. So you're also going to have something resembling WWI levels of aviation in many regards and no real way of detecting flying enemies beyond sight. The amount of equivalent horsepower that could be generated would be low however the planes would be more like sealed ultralight gliders and wouldn't need to carry much beyond the weight of the pilot(s). As thus bombardment from directly above is likely to be tremendously common as will parachuting enemies directly into enemy cities. In fact flight is so easy with ectoplasm control that you expect it to have been something will have dealt with for millennia in all likelihood. So the effects flight is going to have really need to be considered since for one communications (and troops) are likely to travel by glider at a speed on par with many semaphores but with a great deal of obvious advantages.

** Under what circumstances would it be practical for kingdoms and empires with access to both guns and magic to still do much of their fighting with primitive weapons such as swords and bows?

I'm specifically trying to rationalise Ivalice from Final Fantasy XII, but any other settings or original universes are welcome too :)

*** Dune has a good take on the sword thing: most everyone worth assassinating has a personal shield that deflects stuff in proportion to its kinetic energy. So something moving very quickly, like a bullet, will be deflected away, but something moving slowly, like a sword or dagger, will get through the shield. It's a kind of classic sci-fi trope; Stargate SG-1 copied it, for example.

To make it to a "guns and magic" thing, the magical charm that has this effect is very easy / cheap / long-lasting to cast. Bows travel significantly slower than bullets so you can just specify a cutoff above arrow!speed but below bullet!speed.

*** There is a simple magical means to protect against attack. It stops any object of sufficiently small volume that is going to strike the warded person.

Now, the power requirements with volume go up exponentially. So, it stops a bullet easily; an arrow if you've got a really expensive charm, and a greatsword never...

Or perhaps, instead of the volume of the missile, it's keyed off the distance to the enemy, so the closer you are the less effective it is. Something along those lines.

*** Guns are bad if: Laws against guns (automatically a live sentence, even in selfdefense) The accuracy of guns is bad Bullets are expansive or hard to get (arrows can be used more than once) The sound brings monsters

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAreWorthless]]

Magic is bad: Depends on the magic system Maybe you want to save it for healing Maybe it draws monsters Maybe killing with magic is bad karma (knives are fine... cause reasons) Maybe casting takes forever Or is impossible in a brawl Maybe to expansive

Of course in JRPG I mostly use swords cause it doesn't cost anything and magic/abilities is mostly overkill for most mobs...

Btw I think most soldiers still have knives and train for hand in hand combat for just in case.

And there could be other things like force shields. Or the character can't buy guns or use (offensive) magic. So the best weapons they can use are swords and bows.

Still if you look at the stats of the weapons (see link) you will see it is rational to use other weapons.

Maybe a sword kills in one hit and a deadly gun wound still let's the opponent make one last attack...

Hard to say, choose one reason or try to not think about it and accept is as rule of cool.

*** If you think about it from then point of view of economics, it basically comes down to demand and supply, so if there are guns and nobody is using them, that means that there is no demand for it so no one wants to invest in it and those that did (inventor?) couldn't make money off of it. So why is there no demand for guns? Is there a substitute item that is maybe cheaper or better than guns in which case the guns just can't compete. Maybe magical bows and arrows, magical swords,magic spells like fireballs can all outclass guns. Or something that makes guns obsolete, plasma guns are most likely superior to guns with bullets, so if they have the plasma equivalent of magic spells, why do they need an inferior weapon. Or what if the forcefield is especially strong against physical objects.

** Sorry if I'm late but I wanted to just throw something in here.

So, there are these creatures whose most distinct trait is their ability to cause fear. This fear is so great that anyone who looks upon their bare visage will be completely consumed with irrational panic though afterwords they will not actually be able to describe what said creature looked like. This fear also extends to their voices, which by themselves are horrible enough to cause most creatures to vomit.

However, these creatures are of human level intelligence and are very little in number. So, how would you munchkin an ability like this one?

*** Does the irrational panic cause in some people the need to nuke the place they saw the creature?

Peaceful lives: Make a village. Stay there. Hope nobody nukes it or burnes it down out of fear.

Worlddomination: Write the leaders of a country a letter what you want them to do, else you send monsters/demons after them. Go to their office and say hi, leave a letter that says that was the only warning. You are even so nice to erase the image of the monsters from their brains. Of course depends on the reaction of the leaders and how the power effects people. (I think Trump would nuke everything

Murderhobo/live comfortable Take what you want and don't care.

Counterstrategy: Walls and earplugs. Maybe locked doors. Always have two doors, where one has to be closed.
