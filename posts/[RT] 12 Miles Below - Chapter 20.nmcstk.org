** [Sci fi/Fantasy, Gamelit-lite, dungeon-lite, and Rational Adjacent]

*Summary:*

The world is in ruins.

Extreme sub-zero temperatures suffocate the surface, making even simple survival an ordeal. Frozen derelicts of bygone eras span across massive ice wastes. And the elite few hoard any technology rediscovered within.

The only escape from the deadly climate is beneath the surface. But it's another disaster underground. Monstrous machines lurk in the depths. Unhinged demigods war against them, dying over and over, treating it all like a game. The land itself shifts over time, more contraption than rock. And an ominous prophecy states that the key to everything waits at the last level - but nobody's ever reached that far.

When an expedition into the far uncharted north goes terribly wrong for Keith Winterscar, he finds himself trapped in a fight for survival. Stumbling upon an ancient power struggle of titanic scale; Keith will have to contend against gods, legends, and the secrets of the realm that lies below.

** Damn, the setting for this sounds amazing. Definitely interested in how far you pushed your world building here. I've got a lot of books to read right now, but definitely putting this on my to-read-list.

*** I think the worldbuilding is the most solid part of the fic.

Story wise, I'm well aware of that trap some authors hit where they put all their skill points into worldbuild and none into the story and characters. And since this is my first story, I went with following the mechanics instead of trying to subvert or throw a unique twist into it. The worldbuilding has plenty of twists already covered.

So I studied and banked on the standard hero's journey formula: A duo of mismatched talents gets tossed into an ordeal that forces them to work together and overcome their separate flaws in order to survive.

The main lead is a tech gremlin who's got a wild childhood that's warped his common sense. Excellent at tech, terrible with general fighting, and far too curious for his own good.

The side lead is a grizzled old veteran who's terrible with tech but the duo's heavy hitter, and a staunch traditionalist that all things engineering and 'scholarly' is a waste of time at best, and liable to get people killed at worse.

Both character look down on each other at first but slowly grow to work together as a real team.

**** Sounds cool!! I appreciate that you have such a degree of self awareness as a writer already. I gotta admit, if I read a similar plot on a different sub, I wouldn't be hooked. But from rational writers you can expect a certain level of quality. Looking forward to this one!

***** I tackled it like an engineering problem, bought a few of the most recommended books detailing everything that the big writers have learned up to now. Then studied it all applying each lesson one at a time into the whole thing. Kind of like a newbie cook following a tried and true recipe for cream puffs, with a focus on making sure all the ingredients and steps are followed. I only started releasing chapters once the whole was already complete and every lesson had been incorporated.

I'd like to think of it as an experiment in finding out if solid fundamentals can make even the weakest author write a solid story.

** A lot of world building in this chapter, and I have a theory. Spoilers for chapter 20 below.

So the Deathless are memory-less invincibles that randomly arrive in the world. Well, given the post-apocalyptic nature of the world, what if these Deathless are actually people from the pre-apocalypse, who found a way to survive either by cryosleeping far beneath the ground and continuing life in VR, or maybe they all uploaded their consciousnesses to a data server drifting around in space, either could work.

But of course, people get bored of VR existence, and so they invent something fun to do with their time. They've figured out a way to transport themselves back into the frozen wasteland of earth (nanobots or something, idk), were they can have fun, dungeon-delving adventures for as long as they want before eventually returning to VR land. Naturally they have their memories wiped before this experience so that information about the lost generation isn't spread and endangers their existence.

That is all, thank you for coming to my ted talk.

*** Love seeing theories like these thought up, I aimed to leave a lot of open possibilities exactly for this reason - so that people can play around and try to predict the plot ahead of time. I'm interested in seeing what sorts of counterpoints others might consider in this theory :3

** As someone currently playing through Subnautica: Below Zero I'll definitely check this out.

Extreme weather scenarios are always fun to read about since they force innovation in a different direction than a story with a more typical setting.
