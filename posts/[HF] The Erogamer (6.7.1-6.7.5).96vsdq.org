I'm curious, do you have a schedule for releases, or do you just post them as you write them/when you complete an arc? I've checked in on The Erogamer every few days since the last update but hadn't seen anything about when this release was expected to post.

Thank you again!

** Thanks for posting this here as well, Groon! I definitely feel it belongs here.

I'd like to note that the /previous/ arc (6.4.2-6.6.d with 6.4.1 serving more as connecting material) not ONLY had a aspiring rationalist character in it, but it explicitly had a reader of rational/rationalist fiction in it -- which uh, may be a global first? Has any other fiction had a rational fiction /reader/ as a character in it? :-) I was actually thinking of making a thread here about it, but the new arc beat me to it.

Anyway Lavelle/Ziquan (character introduced properly in 6.4.2 and being one of the two most prominent characters in the arc) is a reader of HPMOR and makes a couple of references to it, and mentions Unsong as well.

B) It's not. Well, maybe it's because of the banner I have under my name, so I suppose I'm not entirely representative, but it isn't that bad at all. Furthermore, Not all the staff is positive about ratfic in general, but The Erogamer in specific had universal approval from staff and CC. Furthermore, Marked for death is a fairly major thing on SV, and many other, rational adjacent works are very popular as well. I would't say it's anywhere near as supportive of RatFic as here is, but I most of the vitriol that does occur is from a the subset of users that will go into a debate thread about ratfic. It's very much a recipe for sampling bias, because the only people who will be joining such a debate thread are the virulent haters from any population and counterjoiners from ardent defenders, which leaves very little room for conversation.

You may get away with liking rational fiction if you are apologetic about it. E.g. possible tactics (1) describe it as a guilty pleasure, (2) say that you know rational fiction objectively sucks but you enjoy it anyway, (3) perhaps heap abuse on the rest of the rationalist community while saying you like rational fiction anyway.

But if you want my opinion it's because when you have a sufficient mass of people sneering at something strongly enough, then more people start sneering at it just to fit in, even if they've never read any of it.

In a thread dedicated to HPMOR I noticed that many people's primary objection was something that was just plainly factually wrong, which made me wonder if they'd even read the fucking thing. When I corrected their factual errors, I was called names, accused of 'bad faith debating' for daring to correct them, and then the mods locked the thread.

If I ever comment on anything on SV ever again. Which right now doesn't seem likely, since it has gone to use up all my goodwill piece by piece.

Here's the first infraction I received in SV: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/8012871/]]

Do please explain to me how my post merited a "Bad faith debating and Rule 3 breach." infraction? Where's the 'Bad faith debating' or the uncivility in that post?

Nowhere. But I dared defend rational fiction in that thread, so the asshole moderator ManusDomine just wanted to find anything to infract me for, while also patting himself on the back for how gracious and generous he is. His moderator post is /hilarious/, accusing me of all sorts of stuff I never did and which correspond to my attackers much more than to me.

Also note, how everyone /else/ in that thread is allowed to freely insult, insinuate, slur, sneer, misconstrue, throw hatred and bigotry at whole groups of people (not just rational fiction fans, but also e.g. MLP fans), and none of them ever gets infracted. It's not a Rule 2 violation if you're hateful at MLP fans, or hateful at rational fiction fans. It's not being disruptive (a Rule 4 violation) if you openly say you're a sneer-clubist there to sneer. It's not Bad Faith debating or uncivil if you insinuate that if you like Fallout:Equestria it must be because you're getting off on pony rape.

(1) Really? Okay, when someone abuses me, I report them to the mod, and the mod rejects my report, what can you do? You can't actually do anything, because you can only advocate in favour of lifting infractions, not in favor of placing ones, right?

So even if you successfully advocate for me in every given occasion, I'll still be getting fucking abused every time I dare speak an opinion about anything in SV, and I'll have to be unfailingly polite in response for me to not get banned.

(2) Well, the most /recent/ infraction I received was in "Let's watch Jojo" thread, which also got me perma-threadbanned from there. I did briefly consider contacting an advocate like you, but then I saw you personally had done a 'like' to the mod decision that perma-banned me from the thread for daring to call out the abuse I was receiving, so I scrapped that plan.

It's been gradually made clear to me that nobody who abuses me in SV will ever get infracted, unless a more severe punishment falls at the same time on me, which lets them get the 'victory'. If I'm so absolutely proper and polite and rule-following that they can't possibly justify an infraction, then they'll just rather lock the thread, rather than infract my abusers.

************ Within that first thread? [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/8028365/]]. As for your infraction? No, thaat post had nothign in it. Some of the other posts he quoted were borderline, but it was nothing that Blazinghand or I wouldn't have considered a open and shut appeal. Staff do make mistaken posts, and the arbitrator staff is generally a rather separate entity; I have an over 60% success rate on overturning moderator actions, and this would have been one of the easier ones I believe.

There isn't a direct step aside from "additional report from someone not in the conversation," but in practice both CC members and Advocates have a much greater ability to influence staff decisions since we have direct lines of communication. If we ask for explanations, or justifications, etc. we tend to get them and can engage with them. It's definitely not as strong as I'd like it to be, though.

I liked that post because it was threadbanning "no." who really, really pissed me off. I honestly didn't think about how that would affect you given that you were also infracted there. Even if this conversation doesn't lead to anything else, I'd like to personally thank you for pointing out what other affects doing so could have so I can improve myself; this isn't sarcastic at all, I just genuinely hadn't thought about it even though it should have been obvious if I had for more than a few seconds. I apologize for how this affected you in specific here, and will use this as an impetus to do better.

Isn't it a bit strange that the post that ManusDomine issues a warning against is also the very same post that he has himself put a "Funny" tag on, and which he hadn't objected to two days earlier?

Doesn't that seem a tiny bit strange to you? Like sending mixed messages?

I don't know what the deal is with ManusDomine suddenly finding the same comment objectionable two days later, but I have a set of uncharitable pet theories about it. (And yeah, I may be biased against him, but none of those theories is that he's actually interested in fairness, or would actually ever infract people making infraction-worthy comments against rational fiction fans.)
