So I finally decided to write/run the story referenced here:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ctgyx/bstdffso_if_you_found_yourself_as_a_magic_the/]]

And, since I don't know all that I need to know about Rational/Rationalist fiction and characters that act in that fashion, nor do I know all that I need to know about Magic: the Gathering... I need your all's help!

That's good, because I am running this as a 'Quest', which is a sort of communal forum roleplay play-by-post thing, where I write a little bit of story focused on one character, and then open up replies for discussion, roleplay, and suggestions for what the character should do or be considering or should worry about!

The basic premise is a character who probably resembles a lot of us in this subreddit (20-something, middle class american geek type) wakes up one day in a forest far from any sort of civilization, and finds himself a Planeswalker, as in a Magic: The Gathering style Planeswalker. Normally, this would be a short hop into massive amounts of power-buildup and escalation and power-fantasy, but there are... complications. Things don't seem to be exactly the way he expects them to be, least of all his powers. And the first order of business is making sure he doesn't end up dead.

That's where that Deconstructionist tag comes in. In order to make the world described in the Magic The Gathering cards, and lore, make sense, a huge amount of setting assumptions and card game interactions need to be re-analyzed, torn down, changed, or manipulated. I am going to do this as the quest progresses, and I have my own ideas, so hopefully that sort of deconstruction is something we can work on together.

Further, so far, the suggestions have not... really shown enough Rational or Rationalist thought processes. Which is where I need your all's help and participation to give this a bit more exploratory and strategic and truth-seeking bent. I am definitely going to be doing that the map (ie, the magic cards) is NOT the territory (ie, the world he finds himself in). Can you help? Can you help make this as good of a story as it can be?

Here's the link to it:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/planecrawler-quest-mtg-semi-si-quest.28496/]]

Also, I would really encourage people to make an account in sufficientvelocity if they want to participate, but I WILL keep an eye here for suggestions that people put in the replies, but those will have less 'weight' than active suggestions in SuffVel.

Edit: for my second post in the thread, I am having trouble showing how hard wilderness foraging is for someone who doesn't know what can be eaten or how to find things. Any suggestions??

Edit again: My third update is up! As the character transitions from pure survival to exploration, discovery, and industry, does anyone have any good suggestions for experiments to discover the limits of his magic and plabeswalking abilities? Or descriptions of what some of the canon limits should be, or what he would expect them to be and how to test it?

Edit again: Major update in the quest!


** One of the most important aspects of magic in *Magic* (IMO) is how the color pie (the differences in mechanics and philosophy between the five colors) interacts with magic users.

I don't know if, for example, your natural affinity to blue magic makes you more of a blue character, or if being a blue character enables learning bue magic. But the correlation between personality and acccess to specific colors is very much there.

**** That option is what I think is most likely as well. That would mean that learning, for example, red magic, requires that the person frames his/her thoughts in a red way, like prioritizing short-term goals instead of long-term ones, or using one's emotion to fuel rage, passion, or happiness and use these emotions as conduits for the spellcasting.

That's why I think there are enemy colors and allied colors. It's easier for a blue mage to think in a way that represents order, structure and morality (White's characteristics) than it is to reframe your mind to stop making detailed plans and think only "on the moment" (Red's characteristic). So, it's easier to learn allied-color magic than it is enemy-color magic. One must be good at reframing their way of thinking/feeling to adapt to new colors.

And that doesn't even take into account intra-color magical styles. A Beastcaller (a mage who controls and summons beasts, /a la/ Garruk) has a different way of thinking from a Nurturer (a mage who encourages and hastens natural growth in plants and animals), though their way of thinking is much closer than the way of an artificer.

I've been thinking a lot about the precise mechanics of magic in *Magic* for at least 3 years (when I started playing), so, I have some pretty strong opinions on it, hahaha. Feel free to prod my mind for anything you'd like.

** Lore-wise, I might be wrong, but here's a list of things to consider:

- Planeswalker-ness doesn't really come with any other upgrades. It doesn't make you smarter, or better at magic, or more resilient, it just gives you the GURPS 4e /Warper (World) [100]/ advantage.

- Mana is not discrete in the way portrayed by the card game. Mana ought to be physics-like. Mana Field Theory?

- Anyone could in principle cast any sorcery/instant that does not involve summoning creatures.

- An open question is whether to accept the post-mending summoning mechanic (turning archetypes real) or the pre-mending summoning mechanic (essentially D&D /Gate/ spell.)

*** Lore-wise, being a planeswalker means that with enough experience, you can be a better mage than any non-planeswalker.

Regular mages are limited to the mana and spells of a single world. Planeswalkers can draw from dozens. However, this isn't particularly relevant when you know little to no magic yet.

*** IIRC, the planeswalker spark gives you some advantage in magical skill. That's why Jace, being so young, can still be considered one of the best mindmages of Ravnica. If you look at his early history, he was one of the best mindmages of his homeplane (Vryn) as well, and he was still a child. He managed to defeat an ancient sphinx in a mental battle (he lost most of his memories, but the sphinx forgot /how to breathe/.) The same can be said for every planeswalker we encounter on the lore. All of them were greatly talented in their fields and more powerful than their peers. I guess it's safe to assume that it's not just coincidence.

Also, your last point is crucial to the development of the quest. Summoning an aetheric copy of something is vastly different from summoning a specific something from somewhere. Because there's the conundrum of "how can two planeswalkers both summon the same legendary creature?" or "Why does the summoned creature obey the planeswalker's orders?"

Well, Do any of the planeswalkers we typically see even do summoning? Jace 'summons' illusions in stories. I think Garruk just calls actual beasts that happen to be around, Sorin makes vampires the hard way. Do story walkers even typically do summoning the same way player walkers do?

It's more of a business relationship between equals than the "summon, mind control, send to their death" of normal creatures.

Modern storyline planeswalkers vary considerably in power. The spellcaster types seem to be at least as powerful and versatile as the average 60-cards Standard deck, albeit with fewer creatures (Liliana excepted). Others are just buff warriors with a few tricks up their sleeves.

** If you're going to make it into a quest, I would suggest against explicitly making it an SI. Many people play quests to immerse themselves in the character as a form of escapism, and when that character is explicitly someone else that becomes harder. Especially when that someone else is in fact the QM. Double especially since many people will feel like they can't make proper criticism since they would be indirectly criticising the QM which is a rather dangerous thing for any player to do. Not all QMs are reasonable about such things after all, and it is hard to know which side of the line a certain QM lies on before it is too late.

To be clear, I am not suggesting actually changing the character in any way; make them be as SI as you want, but I suggest not actually telling/reminding players that they're an SI.

** In the second post, I have had difficulty as an author getting across exactly how fish out of water the character is with wilderness survival and finding food, and how hard it is to sustain yourself in the wild and take in more calories than you burn if you have absolutely no idea what you are doing, and that you have to be very careful and make a really hard decision because of that. What could I do as an author to get that across, or am I missing something obvious?

*** I don't know how you'd do it in a quest, but typically you'd show a series of failures.

The main character thinks "I need food", decides "I'll catch a rabbit", then starts building a trap. But he doesn't know how to build a trap, so rather than just outright saying that, you want to describe his pitiful attempts to make some sort of collapsing rock trap he'd once seen Wily Coyote use in a cartoon, which is difficult because he has to improvise everything and doesn't really know what sort of bait to use for a rabbit. He's getting hungrier the whole time he's doing this.

Eventually, after the rock trap fails to get anything, he goes looking for rabbits, and eats some leafy greens along the way in the hopes of staving off hunger. This makes him quite sick, but he eventually does find something that he thinks is probably a path made by animals, and sets up a rock trap there to wait.

As he's approaching true starvation, he somehow, by some miracle, catches a rabbit, only the rock falls on the rabbit's back legs, so he hears [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-3z-TjnqB4][this horrible, almost human screaming]] and has to kill the rabbit by snapping its neck, only he doesn't quite know the right way to do that, so spends a lot of time fumbling around with it before deciding to just bash the rabbit's head in.

Next comes starting a fire, gutting the rabbit, etc.

But you get the point; if you want to express that someone is over their head, show them being over their head. Especially good if you show a lot of stuff that seems reasonable if you've never done anything with wilderness survival.

Edit: You're probably not looking for any reading recommendations, but I really enjoyed "Drop City" by T.C. Boyle, which is about a bunch of 1970's free spirits who move their commune from Colorado to Alaska where they hope to live off the land.
