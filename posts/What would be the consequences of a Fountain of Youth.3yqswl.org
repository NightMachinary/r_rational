In fiction these are often in remote hard to reach places. But after initial discovery, I suspect a very well paved and maintained toll road shipping the stuff by the barrel will pop up quickly. So what economic effects would this have on a medieval setting. Say the Vikings discover such a fountain in Iceland. Produces a litre a second. Consuming a teaspoon de ages you by a decade and cures all diseases, ailments, and injuries. Side effects, over consuming won't de age you past 10 but can turn men into girls.

This is the argument against /any/ technological or scientific advancement. In this case what he's really saying is "We don't want humans as a whole learning what we know".

** Interestingly, (a litre per second)*(decade per teaspoon)=60 billion people can be kept young and healthy by this.

Someone will conquer it, use it for them and theirs. They'll need a young, healthy army to defend it. They'll also need to provide water in some quantity to leaders/nobility/upper classes of other nations, or they'll face a world united against them. Nation (or at least its leader) owning the fountain becomes obscenely wealthy.

Speaking of reproducing, a better way to nerf it is that it renders you sterile. That cuts down the "immortals population explosion" problem as well as providing a disincentive to using it.

*** When I first posted the last sentence was a bit odly worded I then edited it thinking no one had seen it yet but then found out there was already a reply. But even if it is only if you continue to consume after you have been rejuvenated to 10, if each does rejuvenates you a decade and most people would want to stay in their 20's then it only takes a few serious injuries or diseases in a row that treating them turns you into a 10 year old girl. Which could be fairly common in the medieval world. Turning people into 10 year girls could be a way to make freshly captured POWs and slaves easier to control.

** Were you serious about the last sentence?

My first thought on seeing the title was, oh boy, just what we need: /immortal/ ruling elite. Because that's almost certainly the outcome: those who discover the fountain (assuming they are intelligent and not moral saints) will keep it secret, building up their power. Any sufficiently advanced technology (or magic) inevitably either finds its way into the hands of the ruling elite, or makes those who possess it /into/ the ruling elite.

If the discoverers did foolishly brag about it (or, more understandably, use it to keep all their friends young, thus tipping their hands) then a massive war would break out over such a resource. Eventually, it would come into the hands of a country, and who would control it? The ruling elite, of course. I'm going to say that as much as I can, apparently. But now they would have to at least make some show of sharing it or doling it out. But if the fountain is finite or replenishes slowly, then again we will see it concentrated among the rich and powerful. If not, whatever country controls the fountain will become a superpower within a generation, as they will have a workforce and military that never ages and is constantly in their prime.

Now assuming you were serious about the last line, that's harder to speak to. Quite likely, if the Fountain were restricted to a bare few, the society that controlled it would become matrilineal, with women dominating positions of power (whether by birth or by Fountain). If unrestricted, the country would likely face serious issues as birth rates would drop drastically: I imagine many men would be willing to become women to stave off death. This might increase societal acceptance of LGBT groups (would be a dream come true for MtF transsexuals).

*** Eh, I think an immortal ruling elite would actually be pretty effective at governing. The first few hundred years would suck, but eventually they realize their primary goal is stability (to make sure they don't get killed) then maximizing hedons (which more advanced societies are better at.) Anyone they didn't like would be screwed, but statistically speaking we'd be pretty well off, because if the ruling elite is incompetent... well, they're still vulnerable to regular weaponry, disease, and unfortunate toilet-related accidents. Democracy is the greatest achievable form of governing, but an immortal plato-style philosopher king would be pretty swell, if we don't have to worry much about succession.

tl;dr: a fountain of youth would probably lead to magic pony land.

Um, I dont know. I was think it might throw a spanner in the works of the obvious immortal warrior elite answer, instead maybe then it would mainly be used by warriors, knights, and Kings to keep their wives, and concubines young and hot, only used by themselves as last resort if you are really sick or old. I wonder what the percentage of men who would rather get old and die would be. I wonder how much authority an early medieval warrior king would retain if became a woman, if all the elders are women I suppose it would eventually create some kind of matriarchy. Then I changed my mind and edited, then you finished typing your reply, consider it an optional scenario to ponder.

I think it would be hard to keep secret, without any unwanted side effects almost everyone in the discovering party would want a sip, and want to take some back for their relatives and friends, a chief saying "Now, now this is only for a select few in moderation", while a fountain is gushing behind him might be a hard sell. How do you become an "immortal ruling elite" without people noticing you are not aging over time anyway?

***** I think some of them would. Suicide rates among transgender people are significantly higher than in the general population and you'd effectively be turning almost all the men who went through it transgendered. The big questions are how different they'd be from the normal transgendered population that we have now, and whether people would be able to see gender dysphoria as a negative consequence ahead of time (since it's entirely possible that they would think it's a sweet deal and only be affected after the fact).

I personally think it would be way worse to be transgender in medieval times than in the present day.

It's really difficult to tell if the "cis-by-default" theorem is correct, but even if it is, and the numbers from the less wrong survey are correct and half of the entire modern elderly population would respond to a magic gender change + renewed youth with "Score!...

****** I think that having a random person's body change sex may not imply the same dysphoria, on average, as a trans person. There's a selection bias here - the people who decide to transition don't just have brains that make a different gender from what they were assigned be better from them, they feel enough pain to overcome the perceived risk from societal transphobia, discrimination, etc. So only the ones that are mismatched by the largest distance identify as trans, and transition. The recent LessWrong survey for instance showed that using the Bem Sex Role index, trans women are more mentally feminine and less masculine on average than cis women, which supports this hypothesis - only the most feminine ones identify as trans and decide that it's worth the risks (which are inflated, IME, especially if you transition young).

There's a useful difference between genetic sex, anatomical primary and secondary sex characteristics, and psychological gender. The difference between the first and second (and the second's complexification itself) is due to intersex conditions. The difference between the second and third is due to transgender conditions. In other words, gender is a differentiable concept /because of/ transgenderism (and gender apathy vs strong cisgenderism).

Transition is an attempt to reduce gender dysphoria via various medical and social interventions, most of which focus on primary and secondary sex characteristics. It is not gender that is changed, it is not genetic sex that is changed. Transition is a long process, but 'passing' is possible, and becomes more likely the younger the intervention starts. There are rampant selection biases present when casually evaluating P(passing | trans), as trans people that pass are not /apparently/ trans.

#+begin_quote
  But I think person after surgery would be more likely to being suicidal than non-transgender person.
#+end_quote

Yes, which is what the study said. It is, however, incredibly useless when evaluating the expected QALY effect of SRS. Non-trans people are not going to get SRS. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, you have to contrast to trans people who did not get the operation over the same period of time, yet are still seeking transition.

************** A large part of the biology can be redirected and transformed simply through hormone replacement. If intervention occurs before puberty, even just puberty postponement like androgen blockers (speaking for MTFs), almost all of the noticeable characteristics, body hair, voice and throat, skeletal and facial structure, bust, can be made entirely feminine.

After puberty, it gets harder to intervene, but masculization still increases as you get older and older, which is why you have 40/50+yo transitioners that don't look so hot. There are generally two spikes in a trans person's life that they are likely to decide to transition, around young adulthood and around middle-age. Self-suppression, which is particularly exacerbated by culture, leads to denial of the condition around the first spike and delays recognition to the second spike or indefinitely, assuming they don't commit suicide in the interim.

Harassment and violence are culturally-inspired reactions to trans people transitioning. Trans people are at risk for domestic abuse, sexual violence, drug abuse, poverty, sexually transmitted diseases, and suicide. These are cultural problems; transitioning is the /only way/ trans people are able to alleviate gender dysphoria. "True gender" has nothing to do with these issues, this is a problem of suffering and death.

**** An interesting question, but ultimately, I think it's just a matter of scale. All advanced technology will invariably be put to use by those wealthy enough to afford it. Some technologies offer only a meagre advantage over those who do not have it: an iPhone, for example, provides comparatively little advantage over a much cheaper Nokia. This is simply a commodity, in my opinion.

But a rare technology that confers a massive advantage over others would be more like a Secret Treasure. Nuclear bombs, for example, are very rare (comparatively) and are something that any nation without would suffer for, and be at a distinct disadvantage.

This is just off the top of my head, so the examples probably aren't great and the underlying idea might be wrong.
