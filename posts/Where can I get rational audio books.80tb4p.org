Besides everything in the [HPMOR podcast](hpmorpodcast.com).

Also, for all the stories in the HPMOR podcast which don't seem to come in a consolidated audio book form, such as The Study of Anglophysics or 3 Worlds Collide, are those available as a single file somewhere?


** I'm not sure I understand your problem, so I'm going to think about it carefully and present possibilities... instead of going with my first impulse, which was to downvote you for laziness and silently move on.

A single audiobook is somewhat more convenient than hundreds of downloads for a large series, but for a short series, it's not a big deal. If you want to listen to them on your music player of choice, you can just make a playlist out of the handful of files, and you're basically there. For that matter, many audiobooks that you can download are broken into chapters in terms of file format, which is approximately the same as the podcast format.

Since you're specifically referring to the HPMOR podcast, I suppose it might be a little better to have a miniseries as a single continuous audio, instead of having the intro-outtro thing around each episode, so that's one thing that someone might conveniently do to simplify your life. I haven't seen those particular files in that particular format either... but what you're asking is not a particularly difficult sort of audio editing. If it's /that/ important to you, I'd suggest downloading some audio editing software and doing the job yourself, reading a few tutorials if necessary.

**** There has been a few discussions before on audiobooks. I think we should get around to compiling an official list.

**** I didn't actually downvote you; that was just my first impulse, which I suppressed.

The reason why I might have done so is because there is not much difference between an audiobook and a podcast, so your post came across as a petty complaint about the HPMOR podcast... and furthermore, one that didn't do a very good job at specifying just exactly what your complaint actually was, or what you would consider an improvement.

** A trick I've adopted because I'm still to lazy to organize my own podcast of fiction I want to listen to: I use a text to speech engine if there isn't or won't be a podcast of the story. That said I started playing with listening to robo-text and getting all of the context clues from words not toe of voice in 99 or 00. It takes about six month to a year to get used to it, but once it becomes comfortable you can listen to anything from research papers (do your first and second reading not your hard nth deep read) on it to Time Braid.

*** I do this too. I have been using Ivona Reader - it's amazing, especially once you find a good voice pack that sounds natural to you (VW Paul is soo good) I ended up using it for everything from my textbooks, powerpoints and of course ebooks. On android there is a handy little app called PDF to Speech that wasn't bad either - it supports more than Pdfs despite the name.

***** Yeah you can speed it up - or slow it down quite a bit now. The quality doesn't suffer from the increase in speed.

I'm not one for audiobooks and I've never given it a listen so I can't speak for its quality, but it exists.

  Then there's several stories in the HPMOR podcast (Mmm, 3 Worlds Collide, The Study of Anglophysics :) ), but they're broken into episodes, where's the audio book?
#+end_quote

In the specific case of HPMOR, I did a google search for 'HPMOR podcast' and the first thing that came up with [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56][this page]] which seems to have all of the episodes compiled into several larger audiobook files, so rejoice, for the audiobook you seek is readily available.

In the general case, a podcast is basically a collection of MP3 files distributed through an RSS feed. An audiobook can be distributed as MP3 file(s) or, alternatively, an M4B, which is an audio file that can contain multiple "chapters" (hence how hundreds of MP3 files can be condensed into a small handful of M4B's). Most modern audiobook and podcast players have the ability to remember where you left off regardless of file format (by simply storing that information in the app settings, rather than in the audio file itself), so at a certain point, the distinction between "podcast" and "audiobook" basically just comes down to distribution, as the end result is "I have a bunch of audio files that I want to listen to" (and at that point, how exactly you acquired them is less material).

When you say, "I get that there's a podcast, but where's the audio book?" I'm not sure I really understand the nature of the problem you're experiencing. If your issue is "I don't know how to listen to this audio file in a way where I can easily pause and resume my progress," I think the solution would be to simply get a modern podcast or audiobook app with a pause/play function. If your issue is "downloading 50 different podcast episodes from an RSS feed seems like a huge pain," my suggestion would be to find a podcast app with a "download all episodes" function, which seems like it would be a fairly common feature (it's included in Pocketcasts, which is my podcast app of choice). I think that the developers of most podcast players are cognizant of the fact that "I want to download this podcast's entire history and listen to all of the episodes in order" is a fairly common use case, and consequently I would expect most podcast players to have a feature that makes this easier. (Stitcher might be an exception to this, since Stitcher's business model is based around getting you to listen to ads, and serving you ads requires that you have an internet connection, so allowing you to easily download large collections of episodes for offline listening is counter to this goal. This is just one reason among many that I don't recommend using Stitcher.)

** "Mass Market" titles, like The Martian, would have audiobooks. Fanfiction and niche titles (like.... Crystal Society or whatever) less so as you seem to have experienced.

I'd go on the TVtropes mohs scale of science fiction hardness page and look at the stuff listed in the "hardness 9" section, and see what you can find audiobooks of. Audible is the go-to location for audiobooks.
