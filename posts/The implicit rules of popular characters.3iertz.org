Believe it or not, this is actually explained in-story; the only reason the existence of the dragon balls is leaked out to the universe at large is because Raditz kept his communicator on when Krillin, Bulma etc. were talking about them after Goku died. Earth apparently had no aliens heading there before Raditz who weren't too young to remember anything different and Namek apparently kept their secret really well.

****** In order to mass produce it yes, but in order to make it in the first place no. In any case, I was being flippant. Duplication rays are such a common plot device in comics that it seemed the obvious solution.

"devalue" in the sense that the price in dollars would go down, but not in the sense that people would derive less value from using it. Computers are hugely cheaper now than they were thirty years ago, but they're also more useful. Keeping the duplication ray private would admittedly allow you to capture a much larger portion of the value created for society, but it wouldn't change the amount of value so created.

While there are potentially dangerous or harmful uses of a duplication ray, I'm much less worried about them than I am about the harmful uses of, say, a nuclear warhead.

Sometimes, it only becomes clear after you think "If there was a /completely different/ character starting from scratch with the same powers/resources/setup, who thought about things rationally, what might they do with those resources?" It can help with not subconsciously filtering the resulting answers so they fit the personality/MO/backstory of the canon character.

(It can also help to cycle a number of previously existing characters, including ones who tend to use resources to hand in unexpected ways, through the starting position. The result may not be comprehensive, but it can often generate a larger starting set of ideas and lead to some interesting directions of thought.)

I would totally expect this from the average person, and from the politicians who cater to them.

You can see a sliver of that in how people treat mental illnesses. And that's when the worst possible consequence of being too nice is getting attacked by a foaming lunatic, not your entire city being levelled.

I fully expect that if this happened in real life, politicians would point to the most or least harmless mutants, and use this to support their political positions towards all mutants. And considering how a 'mere' terror attack like 9/11 went down, the first time a mutant DID cause large-scale destruction, it wouldn't go well politically for the mutants, even the ones who wouldn't or couldn't do such things.

I mean, we went to war against Iraq, an entire country, because we thought they MIGHT have WMD's. There are mutants who walk around with that kind of power in their back pocket. (I think. I am not familiar with X-Men, but if we're talking about people on the level of Brainfart, we can turn that down a couple of notches for Pocket Nuke.)

** In a lot of fiction, especially YA:

-*no character should be too thoughtful.* Impulsive characters push the plot forward, even if their lack of learning from consequences is infuriating eventually.

-*no character should remember and be willing to immediately use the full extent of their powers.* A good example is Percy Jackson in the second series-- he's often rendered useless or put on the defensive just in time for another character to do something useful. Even though he's repeatedly established and demonstrated to be so far ahead of other demigods that its something of a running joke in the fandom. A less egregious example is when Percy is threatened by monsters, which happens a lot of the time. You know from his previous feats that he's easily capable of defeating basically any medium-size group of average monsters, even after his curse is removed, but he stills treats them as a substantial threat.

-In YA fiction, *no enemy except the 'final boss' is deserving of death*, even when a character's continued existence is enormously convenient and that person has caused enormous suffering. *So the rule would be that protagonist should not feel okay about killing anyone except for the final boss.*

I mean, its true that Percy forgot about her, but he had: lost his memory, been killing giants and titans, and had ZERO time off from his mission to save the world. Also, at some point, we should see consequences for the Gods breaking their Styx vows and not freeing Calypso like they promised Percy. Instead it all falls on Percy.

I'm really hoping or the next series to have some sort of massive rebellion against the Gods.

Despite all these cases I still maintain that it's a rare event. The show tells you as much, and the characters certainly act as if it is. This doesn't strike me as unreasonable because all of them happened in special circumstances.

The Enterprise-D's computer has been stated to be unusually powerful, as befitting its status as the Federation flagship, and that's the reason given for its ability to generate sapient holograms. That combined with the relatively-new holodeck technology resulted in the inadvertent creation of Moriarty and Redblock.

The Doctor was never designed to be sapient, but deliberate modifications were made to his programming by the Voyager crew to allow him to attain sufficient complexity that he could be considered self-aware. They only did so because they had no one else to fill the role of ship doctor, so they were forced to upgrade their emergency hologram into one.

Leonardo seems to have been allowed to attain sapience because of the Voyager crew's boredom. Weak justification there, but I can't think of anything better.

The Hirojen have been stated to deliberately tweak the holodeck's programming to create realistic prey. They actually wanted self-aware holograms to hunt and kill, so where the creation of sapient life was seen as unethical by the Federation in their case it was actually what they were aiming for.

To sum up it isn't that the Federation has some sort of ironclad rule against creating AI, or deliberate safety protocols against it. They just see it as unethical and a hassle to deal with when it happens by accident. In situations where they do need AI (most notably Voyager) they're willing to go along with whatever's needed to keep them functioning.

That's not rare. Out of three installations depicted, it happens by accident in all three. And that's just the cases where it's been noticed. If some WWII soldier hologram woke up half an hour before being gunned down by Lt. Paris in a D-Day sim, would anyone know about it?

My point is that if it's that easy to happen by accident, why aren't they doing it /deliberately/? AI is clearly not /hard/. It doesn't take a lone genius to make a positronic brain to get AI.

The answer is, they've got rules against it.

Someone else in the thread asked why the other, what, hundred and fifty races (species?) in the Federation don't have rules against it. That one doesn't bother me so much. Humans are the ten ton gorilla, that's why.

But then there's the non-Federation races...

***** The Federation has rules against genetic modification of humans because of the wars that were fought on Earth over that prior to the discovery of warp travel and the subsequent formation of the Federation. Apparently those events have left them so traumatized that they refuse to even consider genetic manipulation.

So it's a Butlerian-Jihad-rule in that sense. But they do not have any rules against the creation of AI that I'm aware of. Data is the one of the few androids in existence because apparently creating AI is very hard. That doesn't stop others from trying, though.

The reason that holodeck characters coming to life is seen as problematic is that you're effectively creating sentient life forms that you're then responsible for when you weren't trying to do anything of the sort. Almost like an unplanned pregnancy, except worse, since they're 'born' fully sentient.

Of course, you don't want to have that happen accidentally, especially when they're based on simulations of fictional criminals, but given how easy it seems to be... there's got to be some reason they don't do it deliberately.

Well, he does get your soul for eternity. I definitely remember CS Lewis' Screwtape writing something about how well-being on Earth is irrelevant, because it's nothing compared to suffering in Hell.

I was thinking of setting where you get to name your price for the deal. (Actually, on thinking about it, I think this rule applies to /wishes/ rather than merely DwtD - why do so many supposedly-altruistic people get genie or fairy wishes and never consider helping anyone with them either?)

Actually, I just thought of an aversion of this rule: in the /Ghost Rider/ film, the Devil shows up and offers to cure the protagonist's father in exchange for his soul. Crucially, in this case the Devil named his terms, rather than the other way around.

  Star Trek's Federation implicitly has a rule banning elective cybernetics and beaming enemy crews into space ... the Green Lantern has an implicit rule against creating any construct whose effect would be too brutal (no turning his enemy's brains to mush via razor wire up the nose, no blinding his enemies with retina-destroying brightness, no railgun constructs launching pebbles at mach 3 at the enemy's skull).

The Federation explicitly has laws, albeit unclear ones, against human enhancement - this was a major plot point on DS9 at one point, and is usually strongly implied to be related to the Eugenics Wars.

Green Lanterns are forbidden from killing; if you kill someone with a Green Lantern ring, it will immediately shut down. I haven't read it, but I've heard this restriction was removed during one plotline (Sinestro Corps War) and they began sniping people at superluminal distances and whatnot.

He uses gas to take out opponents, and has used sonic attacks / kryptonite / etc against Superman on multiple occasions. He's also used explosives quite a lot -- off the top of my head, C4 to take out a rebuilt Amazo and (on a different occasion) Metallo. He only uses them on enemies who can take it, though, and most of his enemies are squishy humans.

The reason for all the rules is because Batman is supposed to be the shining light for the viewer -- he doesn't have magic powers, or a mutant gene, or alien godhood, or even power armor. He's simply human, and vulnerable. Unlike almost all superheroes he suffers pain. Despite that, he still fights in the top tier alongside people like Superman and Wonder Woman, who can tank howitzers, fly, and rip through steel with their bare hands.
