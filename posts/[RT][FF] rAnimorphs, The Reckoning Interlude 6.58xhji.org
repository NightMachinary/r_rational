** Random thoughts on this chapter, and other recent ones:

- I wonder what Telor and its hosts think of Esplin's speech. I can totally imagine controllers going "Wait, these guys are sentient?" "Sure. You didn't notice?", and hosts thinking "Does that mean they're going to treat us with respect now? ... Ha. Ha. Ha. :(".

- One of the possible goals of Esplin's speech that hasn't been suggested so far could be memetic vaccination. If he visibly betrays humanity after this speech, cooperation between any group of yeerks and any group of humans will be much more difficult and unlikely going forward. "Oh, you regret enslaving us? Yeah, look at what the last guy who said that did!"

- This chapter seems to imply that there is a complete information blackout from at least the American and the Estonian government, probably many more. That's weird, I'd expect that governments would want to be as open as possible, and official should make speech after speech after public conference to reassure the public. Shutting the media out sounds like something that A would get the media very angry, B would get many, many people to riot out of fear that their government is working for the alien invasion, and C would be missing political opportunities to show your value as a leader by taking visible measures in difficult times.

Anyway, everything about this update is awesome. I liked it a bit less than the PHO Worm update because I'd already seen most of the contents, but otherwise it hit all the marks that PHO did: the formatting, the abbreviations, the typos (beware the Andalight menace), people being assholes to random internet strangers, and so, much, sarcasm. The last message really hit a note too.

** I am really looking forward to seeing how the Animorphs deal with this.

Lets say that the world receives true confirmation of the aliens, and the resolution of the Fermi Paradox becomes fact. Then naturally the smart thing for the Animorphs to do is come forward with Ax, and tell their side of the story.

Only then they have to admit to having the morphing technology, which, in the hands of the Yeerks, would give them an unprecedented advantage. (Side note; wouldn't morphing tech allow Yeerks to stop taking hosts? Sure, it would limit how far an individual could go from the pool, but it would remove their dependence on awake, sentient minds. That is, if a yeerk collective can even acquire the ability in the first place. ).

And this would also put them at the centre of the international media storm that would follow, which some of them might find objectionable, considering that quite a few would blame them for the meteor.

And perhaps, most importantly, the andalites. In canon, the andalites thought the animorphs were lying when they said their home world was being invaded; in this case they already know, and their go-to plan when it came to stopping an unaware humanity from serving the yeerks was to scorch the planet.

If they caught wind that humanity might start willingly cooperating with the yeerks? Earth literally might be forced into an alliance with the yeerks, just to survive that first wave of andalite aggression. Especially considering that the last individual who the andalites might listen to (Ax) was last seen letting a yeerk infest him.

In fact, that could actually be Visser- Ones plan, if my model of the andalites is correct.

*** Morphing tech for Yeerks has been discussed around here once in a while, but not explicitly mentioned in the story. Unless someone convinces me otherwise, my current take is "it'd work on a single Yeerk, but then break when that Yeerk diffused back into the pool," meaning it'd work on Esplin for good (and his time limit would be RIDICULOUS, given his mass, but he probably wouldn't want to lose his Alloran brain).

Without saying yes, no, or sideways, I like the way you think re: politics, especially regarding the Andalite homeworld.

**** If Esplin morphs Alloran he's technically not losing the Alloran brain, but then you kinda get an issue of not much changing at all, especially if Esplin keeps his Alloran morph conscious. Which leads to an interesting question...if a Yeerk were to morph, would they keep the morph unconscious the entire time, or would they get 'creeped out' by the silence?

This is kind of a fascinating ethical question. If you give Yeerks morphing tech and they morph sentient species, are they still technically infesting them?

** So... I would like this update a lot more if I didn't already know most of the individual pieces from heavily participating in the IC reaction thread. Even so, the overall idea is very good, a very nice way of crowd sourcing. If it was my first time seeing it, it would be very fun, like the best of the PHO updates from Worm. Even knowing a lot of the content already, it was still a net positive reading it, and the expansion on the last comment was absolutely brilliant. I feel like my in character response was insensitive for not offering any condolences or such, it was a really great way to give the audience a sense for what all the deaths meant (otherwise they would just be a statistic to the reader).

** Woohoo, made it in! Literary immortality via ratfic!

Question: how did you possibly make the decision on which posts to keep and which to cut? You could have easily made the chapter three times as long, and I admire your restraint, but I am interested to know your methodology. Was it mostly by feel, or was there a more logical component? Did you try to limit yourself to one post per facet of the situation? Was any of the humor worked in in earlier drafts?

One criticism as well -- perhaps it's due to the fact that I read through the source thread several times over, but I found the dissonance between the crowdsourced content and your writing somewhat jarring. Perhaps predictably, you didn't quite manage to capture the feeling of a hodgepodge collection of internet voices as well as the actual hodgepodge collection of internet voices did. I will try to be constructive and suggest that the more effective method would have been to fight the instincts that have invariably produced wonderful writing and try to, well, write worse.

**** Serious response - a sort of living vicariously feeling. I'm not much of a writer, honestly. I'm kinda your stereotypical STEM major who can nitpick on the ridiculousness of CSI managing to get forensic DNA results back in 2 hours (come the fuck on, PCR takes like 3 hours to run esp with a manual plate load) and other such nonsense, but writing? It doesn't come easy to me.

I know that you and I comment a lot on [[/u/TK17Studio]] 's updates here on [[/r/rational]], and you consistently comment on 'where things are going'. I mostly comment on 'biology things the author got wrong' and 'how I can break the rules of the world next'. Don't get me wrong, I truly love this fanfic. I just can't read and immediately see all those literary devices that other fans of this story can. I can appreciate, but not articulate.

So seeing the author dedicate about 1/5th of an interlude to expanding on a comment of mine that came from a place of personal experience (bitter, bitter grief at the unfairness of the world) is frankly...well. I feel like I've 'made it' in a strange way. Achievement unlocked: KnickersInAKnit inspires someone else to write something.

** Typo: User countingcards refers to himself as countingcards52 in his own comment.

Very interesting chapter. I'm glad to see myself represented in it (yay!) and I can see where my comment's been edited to make the central point more clearly (good job). You definitely hit the nail on the head when it comes to the point of having a lot of different voices in this chapter. And I can see where a lot of the points came from.

I especially liked TroubledTrousers' long diatribe at the end, there.

I notice that most people are treating it like it had little or no emotional impact on them personally - which is probably not entirely unreasonable, given how most people probably didn't have relatives or people that they know in Ventura - and Troubled's long post at the end goes a long way towards countering this.

I liked it.

**** Here is some hopefully more constructive criticism.

This interlude broke with the convention of previous interludes, because there is no omniscient narrator. I think this damaged my sense of immersion somewhat. However, I think the problem might ultimately be that your change was not dramatic enough. I can imagine the break in convention could have served to emphasize the seriousness of the events that just occurred. The format change, if executed to its fullest potential, might have caused disorientation in the reader that would mirror the confusion faced by the in-universe world. So, possibly, I think the weaknesses in this chapter come from the guilt or shame that you're feeling. You should never write scared or half-heartedly.

It's very off topic, but i feel compelled to recommend you watch a specific creepy YouTube video. The sense of fear and confusion it evokes in me is identical to the sense of fear and confusion I feel your unconventional interlude might also have been able to evoke if executed just slightly differently: [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mw_HKzo9Ync]]

Applied to your chapter, aiming at this kind of feeling might have meant putting a big EMERGENCY notice at the top of the page, for the sticky? And increased general disorder would have been nice as well, so perhaps you could have chosen a "sort by new" display and shown some panicked, idiotic, low effort, or heavily downvoted comments as well.

Just spitballing here, obviously, as I am not actually a competent fiction writer myself. Much of this plausibly would not have been workable for you. My aim is just to use these examples to help better convey to you the state of mind I'm feeling.

Also, it's possible I might have had my reactions negatively biased by reading the fake thread first, so add an additional grain of salt to how you interpret all of my feedback.

I'm glad you edited my comment to make my point in a way that was more graceful, thank you for that.

I found myself wishing you had changed more of other people's comments, however. Again this might be due to bias, but a lot of the replies in the fake Reddit thread seemed off to me, in the same kind of way that bad actors sometimes seem off due to tremendous overexaggeration of their facial expressions and vocal dynamics. I'm guessing you tried to preserve the originals as much as possible, in order to convincingly simulate writing by multiple different people. But the reactions were never authentic in the first place, and I think additional editing would likely have made them seem more believable, rather than less.
