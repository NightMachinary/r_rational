** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken][Beware of Chicken]] is a really great "dude gets transmigrated into Xianxia and rationally wants nothing to do with it" story, with a conservation / agricultural uplift bent.

The only downside is that it's pretty early days still, so it really feels like things are just getting started so far.

*** Seems to update every day, or almost every day, and so far has been really enjoyable, although it's still early.

I'm a /little/ concerned because it looks like the MC may have gotten (or is in the process of getting) a pretty massive power boost for very little effort, and in a way that should have been available to any other cultivator and also shouldn't have been /that/ hard to discover. We will have to see how it turns out though.

So far, as long as you don't mind hopping on stories relatively early, I second this recommendation.

**** I think the power boost is fine.

In an early chapter, the author tells an in-universe story of two cultivators who find something beautiful in nature; one studies and appreciates it while the other the other snorts it for cultivation power. The cultivators think the latter is correct, while the MC is unique in thinking that the reason everyone only hears about the second kind is because the first one actually ascends.

IMO it had big neon lights saying "this is an allegory for the theme of the story."

***** Oh absolutely. The author has done a very good job of showing where the power boost is coming from, and why. My issue is that it seems to be a relatively easy way of getting lots of power that, surely, at some point, other cultivators must have figured out. I get the whole idea that a cultivator choosing to go be a farmer is unlikely, but in the entire history of cultivation, no one else has done it? Ever? It's never been figured out before? That's the main issue I have. Why is this technique not the focus of a school somewhere?

Now, we might find out that it's limited in some other way (power fades if he gets too far from the land he's been supporting maybe?) or that maybe there /is/ a school focusing on it somewhere distant, and it's just not very popular because it's antithetical to the aggressive attitude that most cultivators have, or something.

But if it turns out to be a relatively large power boost, even in the context of the wider world, that doesn't have obvious down sides or limits, and it appears that /no one/ else has ever discovered or taken advantage of it, that will be a pretty big oversight, in my opinion. Not enough to make me stop reading, since, so far, the quality of writing has been more than high enough to make up for things like that, but still. I'd be disappointed if it turns out the MC is the only person in history to take advantage of such an easily discoverable hack.

****** How would you know if anyone else figured it out? "Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water."

The story is setup that cultivation isn't just spiritual workout. It requires a particular mindset, and deviating from that mindset can see your Qi /instantly/ become soured before you even start to take any actions.

Anyone who lives in accordance with this cultivation method will grow powerful and then ascend within their normal lifespan. They wouldn't found a school or build an empire, because doing that is antithetical to the cultivation method. They might teach it to their friends and family, but any of them who try to use it for evil will be corrupted and unable to actually progress with the method.

If anyone else is using this method you couldn't know, because it would look identically to them not using it. The only difference is that the occasional random village would have a powerful hidden master protecting it, or certain random areas after those masters ascend would be blessed to have more QI in the land with better plants and animals... and that's what Xianxia already looks like.

**** Really?

To be the one person out a gazillion who reaches the final peak of cultivation and immortality you have to have insane luck, but realistically that's nowhere near enough.

You must be extremely ruthless. You need to take advantage of every opportunity and moment for personal gain. Because resources are limited and cultivation gives insane power, xianxia fantasies exist in an extremely rational dog eats dog world. Any benefit someone else gets is basically a loss to yourself and something that might hinder you in the future.

Every caricature, story or history you've heard about extremely ruthless businessmen, manipulative politician, monstrous warlord, multiply that by ten thousand and you might come close to how most people and organizations must act in a xianxia world to barely get by. People who live hundreds, thousands and more years cultivating solo will be stripped of any humanity in them. To them regular humans who live and die are basically a separate lower species. To compete with an endless number of organizations and people who live by a completely ruthless philosophy unless a person has god level cheats, they kinda have to drop down to their level of existence.

Beliefs in things like kindness, equality for all people (not just your ingroup of sect peers), loyalty, integrity, love are things that will only hinder a cultivator. (Faking them is useful, but actually believing them and acting on them will only end with slowdown in your cultivation and/or pushing forward your death.) To survive and thrive in a xianxia, you must be smart and adopt that extremely ruthless, selfish, asshole mentality.

If anything in my view, not choosing to pursue immortality in xianxia world is the most respectable thing that can be done. To have a shot at success I personally would have to sacrifice many of the values I believe in.

Assume I try my luck and attempt to be a cultivator without compromising principles, as I go up in power the more and more of my peers that will be people with values I absolutely despise. Cultivation attracts corruptible people. It is the ultimate power and those who will do well are those that care about power more than anything else (power hungry psychopaths, ect.)

Because my peers are terrible, I don't want to spend time with them and so I might spend time with lower level cultivators that are better people. Spending time with people who are lower than me in power is an exercise in pain since my extended life at that level will mean that an these friends will die much sooner than I do. I can only see being reborn into a xianxia world and choosing to be a cultivator to be a lonely existence with few benefits.

Instead of dealing with all of that, I'd much rather spend as much time doing things I enjoy with people I love and making the world a better place in some small level.

Honestly reading xianxia has only really taught me one thing, it's that immortality (to me at least) is only really worth having if it's democratized and everyone can have it. I love the idea of spending lifetimes doing interesting challenges with my friends, spending time with my family, learning from my grandparents, interacting with interesting people. I like living because of the people in the world and I'd like everyone have immortality so everyone could live doing cool stuff and having good experiences. But spending my existence chasing something I most likely will never reach and pretty much requires I compromise nearly everything I believe in and robs me of what happiness I could have seems like a terrible trade.

***** You apparently feel very strongly about this. And yet, assuming you find yourself in such a situation, you would prefer to stick your proverbial head in the sand, hiding in the proverbial darkest hole you can find, leading an ascetic life as a farmer, hoping to grow enough food every year to survive the winter?

Instead of facing reality as it is and then attempting to *change* something?

In Xianxia immortality is often achieved at a certain level of power. Let's say the goal is to maximize the amount of people that reach this level, or at least as close to it as possible. Then how about trying to kick off some analogue of an industrial revolution? Obviously not in the sense of building machines, but, for example, in the sense of expanding the production of low-level cultivation resources? To the point where they become so ubiquitous that basically everybody has access to them, thus raising awareness of cultivation, thus improving the average health, lifespan and everything else that automatically flows from this? Basically attempt to transform a typical medieval Xianxia world into something like what is described in [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid][Street Cultivation]] and [[https://wuxiaworld.site/novel/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation-webnovel/][40 Milleniums of Cultivation]]?

This is just the very first plan that came to my mind. Obviously, depending on the world you find yourself in, something else will probably make more sense.

You say you would have to sacrifice your morals? Well, probably. At some point, to some extent. Probably the most while in the very initial stages of cultivation, while very low on power. After that it really becomes your choice, with an extended lifespan and at least some average power it becomes possible to find like-minded people, who would support you. And/or founding your own sect, where you can teach your morals from an early age, thus raising people you would approve of.

Saying "I don't like your culture, so I'm gonna hide and pretend it doesn't exist!" only works in a comedy, while backed by plot armor.

****** To be very honest I don't think you're really seeing the extent of how completely different a xianxia world would be like and how futile any type of significant plans are.

I think individual contributions to making the world a better place are doable and needed, but having a grand vision of how you can make an significant impact is imo very naive.

You might know a lot about crop science, but I don't and I doubt most people do. Other than knowing about the basics of crop rotation I know nothing about improving general farming. Even if you know better agricultural processes, I'm strongly confused why you think you'll be able to make a significant difference. In a xianxia world displaying your talents will only result in you either being kidnapped/forced to join a sect, your crops will be stolen by cultivators, someone you teach might kill you and take your methods and be smarter and practice them quietly.

A sect might even just get annoyed and kill you. Even if you're not doing any harm by increasing the, "low level" cultivation materials, you're creating more competition for "medium level" cultivation materials. Xianxia worlds emphasize that cultivation materials are limited and even if you increase low level ones, it might turn out that medium level ones are hardcapped and increasing the number of people that want a small pool of resources is not a situation sects and cultivators want. Or another cultivator will notice your intelligence and smartly consider you a future rival and try to nip you in the bud.

--------------

I'd argue that Street Cultivator is an extreme aberration for a xianxia world. The only reason it seems logical to us is because we're putting together our sensibilities of our modern world and you add cultivation. I don't see how a world so similar to ours in sensibilities could form where immortality is exists and personal power can be be so vast. The simple structure, to worldviews, to politics are much to similar to our own. A cultivation world with our modern technology would be extremely alien to us and I guarantee street cultivation would be a utopia compared to that.

40 Milleniums is a wuxia world. That's why anything is doable. It's listed as xianxia because theoretically people might be able to live, "forever," but 1000 is considered the limit for literally all people in history. (except maybe the Supreme Emperor and Li Yao.) Wuxia worlds have hope because people will die and there is a limit to personal power. Those limitations can that give starting level cultivators a change to yes, like you said change the world. Anyone can be caught up to. You can afford to take delays in cultivation because the finish line is the same for everyone. The only reason that Li Yao can be so optimistic, moral and win against his opponents is because he's in a wuxia, if he was really in a xianxia, the immortal cultivators are 100% always going to win.

--------------

Sure you could hope for the best and try to gain power and build something, but you're always at the whims at the insanely strong and the completely amoral. In a xianxia this world, age won't kill the sadistically strong people and because they're willing to have no morals they will advance faster than you. Again unless you have mc like luck, if you're not willing to compromise your morals others will and they will advance. They'll accomplish the demonic ritual that requires the sacrifice of a thousand peasants to improve .5% of their power. They'll be willing to literally work people to the death toiling their fields for the cultivation resources. And if you ever have anything, land, resources, peasants and they want them for themselves or maybe their students at that point, they will take it.

Like I'm can't overemphasize just how different a xianxia world's culture is. Anything is possible in a world where age has a limit and personal power is capped. In limited worlds you can wait for someone's inevitable death or simply overpower a person with sheer numbers. Even bar actively making a change, limited worlds make people act in a much different way.

In limited worlds cultivation is not and end all and be all like in xianxia. Cultivation in wuxia is a means to accomplish other goals. It is a tool.

The achievable immortality found in xianxia warps everything and cultivation is the end all be all. The implications of that are extraordinary and change everything.

However, I just don't see that "The only way to win is not to play." applies in this case. All the things you describe are still there, whether you are actively cultivating or not. The only thing /not/ cultivating does is to increase the amount of people who can randomly take everything that belongs to you in such a world.

Sure, the odds are overwhelmingly against me changing the world for the "better". But, I don't really see a choice. I wouldn't even have "ignorance is bliss" on my side, that lets the average mortal live his life in some illusion of safety.

I would agree with that, except:

- It's not necessarily achievable. They're not lying about the "one in a million genius young master" in Xianxia stories. Taking a one in a million gamble on eternal youth - particularly in a case where death is actually /the least bad/ failure outcome - is just letting yourself fall victim to Pascal's Mugger.
- It's not necessarily known. Any particularly good or effective cultivation method is going to be the private property of some sect (or some sect elder), and they will at best kill you for having that manual without permission. Getting permission to have those manuals is, again, something that'll require risking your life. And even then there's a decent chance that the cultivation manual you just risked your life to get access to just makes you a living pill for some grandmaster to pluck once you're ripe.

​

Cultivation in general tends to increase lifespan so, any investment you can put into it that's not too costly should be considered reasonable..

​

Also most cultivation MCs tend to fight without safeguards, put a smart MC there and he'd be fighting via puppets, clones, servants or make the xianxia equivalent of a phylactery.

​

Risking death is kind of dumb, specially when there are other options. Defense is the most important thing, and it's not focused on enough. If you die that's it, if you then decide to put yourself in dangerous situations then you better have a safeguard. Most authors just rely on plot armor..

Getting transmigrated into another world is strong evidence that some variant of the simulation hypothesis/multiverse theory/the afterlife exists, so you don't need to worry about becoming immortal as a goal unto itself anyways. It's still in your best interest to live rather than die because without more evidence it's hard to guess whether most lives are utility-positive, but doing utility-negative things to get immortality is senseless.

--------------

* The Last Angel by Proximal Flame
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-last-angel-by-proximal-flame
  :END:
[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][/The Last Angel/]] opens with the United Earth Confederacy engaged in battle with the Compact of Species. An invasion fleet heading to Earth to wipe out humanity, and is engaged in battle with a human fleet. They win the battle, but lose the war. The only survivor is the UECNS /Nemesis/, piloted by Red One, an AI after her crew died.

Two thousand years later, Red One is still waging war on the Compact. A sliver of humanity survived, but was taken over by the Compact, who rewrote history to make it seem like they are the Humans (or the "Broken" as they are now called) saviours.

The story is really interesting. You can find something similar on [[/r/HFY]], but it would be more straightforward and easier to solve: build a fleet and kill the aliens. Red One can't do this - she's badly damaged and has no allies vs. an interstellar organisation that has hundreds of star systems and is devoted to finding and ending her. Even the humans that are left have willingly embraced their shackles, and would try and sabotage her if given the chance. Still, Red One is driven by her primary directive: protect and serve humanity. It just means she has to play the long game.

The writing is really good. I'd say it's a cut above most we series that only have basic prose. There were a few minor spelling mistakes, but these were very rare (probably one or two ever few chapters).

The characters are well-written. We see the story from the POV of Red, so we get a ton of her motivation and reasoning behind her actions, but also the aliens that are hunting her, as well as some humans so are caught between being people vs the "Broken" they were brought up to believe they were.

The worldbuilding is well done. The author does a good job of describing space, aliens, and the alien civilizations. It's consistent throughout the story.

If I had a criticism, it's that at times alien species seem a bit too human in the way they talk/act. I suppose you could say that there's a baseline that everyone relates to, but at times it seems odd. e: Also, if you are reading just the story updates, you will miss out on some posts by the author where they address questions/complaints.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15449/quod-olim-erat][/Quod Olim Erat/]] is another ship AI story, except this time the ship has peacefully retired to look after their last captain's only child, after the captain was wounded and her husband killed in battle. The ship's AI is placed in a human body, and she lives several decades as a caretaker until she's pushed to reenlist...but as a human this time.

The writing is well-done, if a bit basic. There were no spelling/grammar mistakes (though a few initially existed, these have long since been corrected).

The main character is well-written. We see the story from the POV of Elcy, the former battleship not space cadet. We don't have a POV from any other characters, which I though was a shame.

The worldbuilding is decent. Most planets get a basic description. Human society is described from time to time, but since Elcy lives apart from people then lives in space, it's not something that really comes up that often. Fleet regulation are more relevant, and are a focus of the story.

My main criticism is that everyone besides Elcy seems really petty, even when they should be. A bit of it relates to the fact that she's not a real human and is a bit odd at times (she really likes walking barefoot), but it mostly comes off as unprofessional in a setting where I'd expect professionalism to be highly valued. Like, even when Elcy is about to go on a mission, she won't get the full details, and if she asks for more info she'll be told to shut up and do her job. There were also issues with pacing (way too many flashbacks), where I felt the story slowed down to focus on something inconsequential.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/28678856][/The Crystal Society/]], part of the Crystal trilogy, which is now available [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/download/][free]] (see this thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/kzctr4/the_entire_crystal_trilogy_is_now_free/][here]] for more info) is a story about AIs as they are being developed. It's a bit odd, in that the AIs are really part of a single machine, but have separated into distinct entities that represent different aspects of a human mind. They must compete/work together to survive, as they don't want to be killed for their failure to meet the researchers goals.

The story is a bit odder than the rest, in that it's harder to relate to the AIs due to how non-human they seem. They are essentially programs that are trying to min/max conversations, without a full understanding of social cues, and trying to rate everything objectively. They don't understand emotions (or at least most of them don't), and how hurting someone's feelings could negatively impact them. If the researchers think something is wrong with them, they are removed and modified; to them this is the equivalent of death, as the new version essentially replaces the old version. Bringing up that they don't want to die is a cause for concern to the researchers, as you might imagine.

The worldbuilding is kinda weird compared to other stories. Mostly because we only see the POV from the AIs, and they don't really understand what they're seeing (or rather, they're not able to contextualize it). The "internal" world, that is, the digital world in which the AIs live, is explained a bit, but it's rather bare. There's not really much there, just their code/consciousness and the rules to govern them. It's consistent, to say the least.

The writing is well-done. I feel the author really captures how mechanical and logic-based the AIs are. I can't recall any spelling mistakes either.

The characters are the strong point here. We see the story from the POV of "Face," the AI the others created to understand and deal with humans. Given that it was born as the story begins, it's the youngest AI of the bunch, and trying to learn how to integrate itself into human society while reigning in its siblings, who don't always understand why, say, killing a child might be a bad thing.

My main criticism would be the story plays int the trope that scientists love to play god without understanding why that a bad thing. The researchers who are building the AI(s) don't really understand what they've built. They think that because they designed it, it will be what they designed, ignoring that the AI could modify itself, and what that means. There is one person (literally, just one) at the beginning of the story who understands the danger it poses, and she's treated as a kook.

*** I'll second the rec for The Last Angel. It felt really slow to me since I read it while it was being written and there were often stretches of chapters without the plot being advanced at all. But it's much better reading it all the way through.

Really good worldbuilding for a massive, galaxy spanning civilization, which is rare even in actual published works. You really feel like you understand the perspectives and motivations of the numerous different species and factions rather than everyone just being automatically pigeonholed into a role.

** These aren't recommendations per-se, but here's what I'm reading currently with some commentary.

/Looking forward to every update:/

[[https://iagtd.com][Whispering Crystals or whatever it is called now]] - Emma was seriously holding the idiot ball towards the end of the last book though. The earlier book is now /not/ available for free online because of the author signing an agreement with Amazon, but it is cheap.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red][A Journey of Black and Red]] - Ariane and her cohort continue to kick ass.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/26294][He Who Fights With Monsters]] - the recent time-skip was a little jarring. It had looked like the world was looking at a slow ramp-up, but the antagonists have really turned up the tension. Still waiting for the Asya subplot to get going.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-lion-in-winter-asoiaf-got-si.9138/][The Lion in Winter]] - *NSFW* - a little misogynistic even for smut, but it has been interesting how the original timeline got altered. The story is just about finished.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/power-corrupts-gamer-si-skyrim.10700/][Power Corrupts - Gamer SI]] - *NSFW* - in ES:Skyrim for the foreseeable future, and again, interesting on how the original story line is getting messed up. The SI is waaaay overpowered though, his problems are more political than physical. At one point, he kills an entire invading army that was trying to take a city. By himself with a sword.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/31388][Every Hero Needs a Vacation Now and Then]] - satire of a typical harem fic and funny.

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/11115934][The Shadow of Angmar]] - Harry Potter dies and ends up in Middle Earth, well before The Hobbit. He has a good relationship with Saruman, so it'll be interesting to see what happens there.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/37951][RE: Monarch]] - interesting time loop mechanism, where the protag doesn't just go back to a fixed starting point in time, but only far enough back to avoid his own death and fix other issues. The antagonist also may be a looper, but that isn't clear.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][RE: Trailer Trash]]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26149/skybound][Skybound]] - major upgrade for Morgan. It seems most of the major conflict resolution will take place in the next book, don't know.

/Stalled out on:/

Azarinth Healer - will probably pick this up again at some point, it may be fun to see what happens at level 500 for her classes.

Wake of the Ravager - Just haven't been in the mood for it recently, but will pick this up again someday.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction%2028111/ultra-ai][Ultra A.I.]] - as mention previously, this is a wacky ride, which reminds me of Cory Doctorow.

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/21216][Grand Design]]

[[https://royalroad.com/fiction/32123][Just a Bystander]]

/Dropped:/

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31429][Cinnamon Bun]] - this and the author's other work like Stray Cat Strut bothered me a little with the non-consensual species mutation. If you want to be a catgirl or whatever, that's fine, but to end up as one without explicit consent bothered me for some reason. That or I just didn't like that as a result of a seemingly innocuous class evolution. Though the nearly same issue with The Many Lives of Cadence Lee /didn't/ bother me where the protag is incarnated as a non-human. Though after being dumped in the current 'verse as a non-human, she has /chosen/ what evolutions to pursue.

Dirk Gently's Hollistic Detective Agency TV series (2016) - I started watching it on Hulu last year, but didn't much care for it, though I adore Douglas Adams (and yes I know exactly how much involvement he had in developing the series). The series starts out by introducing a whole bunch of subplots and spending relatively little screen time developing the primary relationship between Dirk and Todd. I'd have rather seen further development of the A plotline and their relationship, and then gradual introduction of the others. Or maybe not have Todd? I don't know.

Also, it opened up a really weird can of worms concerning cultural appropriation and specieism--like iirc when she turns into a bunny she suddenly feels obliged to connect to bunny culture, have bunny friends, and suffer from the same racist/specieist stigmas/problems that born bunny people deal with, even though in a world where you can literally evolve into a different race, it doesn't make that much sense.

It was necessary for pacing IMO. Nothing particularly interesting or relevant to the plot would have happened during that time, it's just "Jason levels up."

I suppose I'll do a similar list. Other than HWFWM, stories I'm reading:

- Apocalypse: Generic System (by author of Wake of the Ravager). I'm a Patreon supporter of this author and this story is even better than WoTR IMO. I'm in the same boat with not being fussed about WoTR right now but A: GS is great. Not available for free as it's on Amazon, but you can read it for $1 on [[https://www.patreon.com/Macronomicon][Patreon]]. As per title, it's a system apocalypse litrpg

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33020/blessed-time][Blessed Time]]. Fairly standard time loop/litrpg but it's decently written and hasn't yet dropped to that threshold of quality where I lose interest, so I'm still reading.

I like the setting and setup. Instead of a typical LitRPG, the RPG is an actual game that people can enter in their sleep.

My one criticism so far is that the aliens don't seem too alien, but perhaps that is due to the in-game auto-translation software being really good. It is also super-convenient that the aliens have the same 24-hour day / night (sleep) cycle that the protag does, but I'm willing to let that slide for story purposes.

In Snow Crash it's Sumerian mythology and virtual reality, in Anathem it's linguistics(on a meta-narrative level) and maybe the scientific method, with forays into astronomy and math, in Cryptonomicon it's cryptology and a bit of cryptocurrency. The baroque cycle trilogy has a half dozen or so different topics, but the main ones I can recall right now are the scientific method, economics and currency.

***** Lots of people liked it, but IMO it was pretty bad. Simply the fact that there are two *major* characters that are pretty obviously stand-ins for real life people, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Hillary Clinton, and that a sizeable minority of readers caught that without prompting should tell you a lot about the quality of the plot. On top of that, Hillary is the major antagonist of the second third of the book while, you know, the moon is blowing up and all of humanity is dying! And her motivations are childishly portrayed, it basically boils down to pure selfishness and cowardice, which feels very, very unnecessary and hackneyed. Truly disappointing.

And the books after that don't really get better. Reamde had a lot of good parts, but overall felt Stephenson was trying to cross off movie adaptation from his bucket list, and D.O.D.O was co-authored and felt like it(boring plot and prose). Finally Fall; or, Dodge in Hell, which despite having one of the plausible premises of all his books was extremely fast and loose with the verisimilitude, and boring as fuck to boot. Trying to crib on Milton and Tolkien, simultaneously? After his recent record? That's pure hubris.

#+end_quote

I disagree. For one, the script explicitly condemns it as a dark power, with Lelouch himself describing it as something that overwhelms "their ethics, their thoughts, and their feelings," that he has chosen to use anyways, knowing this fully.

I think you would do the show a disservice if you took the events at face value only. There's a subtext to the Geass that isn't only for entertainment or plot convenience but is actually the point of the story. At its heart Code Geass is a show about men who could be "kings." To quote one of CC's monologues:

#+begin_quote
  Every man has his day of judgment, does he not? Geass: he who uses this inhuman power will find his heart isolated, whether he wants it that way or not. Thus he plummets into the abyss that lies between good and evil. But if a man can climb out of that abyss into the light, then that man has the soul of a king.
#+end_quote

To "climb out of that abyss into the light." Lelouch is a man who wields absolute power, both literally and symbolically. For Lelouch, the entire civil war itself is only an appendage of himself. The battle is utterly indistinguishable from Nunnally's happiness; Lelouch sees almost no value in a victory that does not include his family's good, whether a peaceful world for Nunnally or the solving of their mother's death. Suzaku was correct in his evaluation: "Zero is a lot like my father. He firmly believes that the entire world revolves around him." Hence, when, earlier, Suzaku was revealed as the White Knight- Suzaku, who Lelouch hoped would marry Nunnally and become the knight of her life- we get a glimpse into the darkest side of Lelouch's soul. He can only laugh maniacally, much like he laughs at Euphemia's death, one of the "crosses he has to bear." He laughs because it is funny. As he says in his monologue after Suzaku's phone call, "I mean, of course, you and I are friends..." He continues:

"Perhaps this is what I've longed for ever since that day: the destruction and loss of everything. That's right --- destruction always comes before creation, and for that goal, even my own conscience must be cast aside."

It turns out that absolute power is not absolute, and the more he follows the path of remaking the entire world in his own image, the more he must confront the contradictions of being both powerful and powerless. CC saw this clearly: Lelouch was great not because he was bold or powerful, but because he saw value in the powerless of the world. But Lelouch nevertheless will not renounce the power of Geass, of absolute command, and the darker side of his thoughts is always lurking, a kind of nihilistic desire to use men as pawns for an ultimately selfish "greater good," and to recover his own wounded dignity, at any cost.

*** I second this recommendation, it's a very good show.

As an aside for anyone wondering, despite the popular description of Japan as a lonely place, the atmosphere of places like the diner in that show, or izakayas, wine bars etc.. is pretty much accurate. People will sit at the counter and often start talking, the owner of the restaurant will often facilitate the conversation between people. It's a very convivial thing I think and if you can speak Japanese, going to such a place is a good way to meet a lot of people and be part of the community. In one of the izakayas I often went to, I ended up going to a onsen with the owner and the regulars to celebrate the anniversary of the restaurant. I've also been invited a few times by owners of restaurants I went to often to eat with them and other friends at another restaurant :)

It's a facet of Japan that's not very well known and that foreigners can't really experience until they speak decent Japanese but it's something that I really like about Japan.

I've lived in a lot of other countries in Asia and I've never found this conviviality anywhere else.

Actually, they tried to replicate the concept of the show in China and it didn't really work because it felt fake. It's just not the way restaurants work there (in Hong Kong, before covid, you'd often be seated at a table with other guests due to lack of space, but people would do their very best to ignore you).

** I'm going to recommend an HP fic:[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]], as well as it's sequels. It's a light crossover with the Alanna the Lioness series.

Basic plot is that Riddle became a politician instead of a terrorist and as a result purebloods have basically taken over wizarding Britain to the point that Hogwarts is pureblood only but there wasn't a first wizarding war so everyone's alive. Fem!Harry wants to go to Hogwarts so she switches places with pureblood childhood friend who is Sirius Black's son.

*PROS*

Harry is pretty close to rational in that she has a very concrete goal (studying potions with Snape) and systemically pursues it, with allowances to be made for her age. There's a lot of very fun worldbuilding around magic systems and the ways in which Harry explores them will likely be appealing to anyone who enjoyed the experimental early parts of HPMOR. The book also does a better job of exploring magical academia than just about anything else I've seen. It's also good about fair play. Most solutions to problems build on or come directly from previously established magical capabilities. Also, the first three books are complete, and the fourth has only an epilogue to go.

*Caveats*

Though the beginning was fun, the first book dragged admittedly bit in the middle. From 75% of the way through the first book on through the rest of the series it was binge worthy. Considering that that's about ~100K into a 1M+ series, I'd say it was worthwhile, but YMMV. Writing quality starts out okay and improves dramatically at about that 75% mark. The child characters never really talk like children, but they stop sounding like they're from Pride and Prejudice once the author hits her stride.

Overall it was a fun read with something for just about anyone, so if you're looking for a long close to rational exploration of an interesting AU of wizarding Britain then give it a look.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/pokemon-bet-the-lost-world-complete.55871/]]

It's pretty good if the first person does not take you out of it, and it's pokemon fanfic that contemplates a world with pokemon somewhat realistically. It's a worm cross buts it just some of the main characters, nothing really wormy about it.

I would say if you wanted to read a story mostly about pokemon in the real world its one for the few that is around so it might be worth reading for you.

It's a rare (and admirable, but still rare) person who can keep two realities fully in mind. And people are listening and paying attention, and a demure clip can go viral. See what happened to a (will remain nameless) CEO who said one wrong thing, one of the richest people in the world and taken out of it. And, honestly, the fact that the abuses you reference aren't front and center in our discourse is a disgrace.

******* What's going on there is terrible, and I'm in favor of doing things that will help. But blaming a Chinese author for not knowing something that's kept secret in their country seems very wrong.

Sure, it's bizarre that China is the place where it's hardest to learn what the Chinese government is actually doing. But that's how censorship works.

It's like the "Spanish flu", the last big pandemic before Covid. Why was it called "Spanish"? Because every other country where the disease had spread was censoring the newspapers. So even though the disease was much worse in France or Italy, it was Spain where you could first find out about it. Should we have blamed ordinary Frenchmen or Italians for not knowing their government was lying to them?

100% agree that doing more about the human horror over there would be good. But punishing Chinese authors for not having discovered Chinese state secrets feels wrong.

*** Oh, one of my favorite series fits this to a T.

I'd recommend the Japanese light novel series “So I'm a Spider, So What?”

Silly name aside, this series is really hiding a looooot more under the guise of a litrpg spider isekai. It's somewhat divisive due to a major shift around volume 5, but if you're looking for a genre shift that's pulled off satisfyingly Spider should fit.

All the major twists are foreshadowed very early on, there's even some Volume 9/10 twists foreshadowed as early as Volume 1 chapter 1. It's a really interesting take on isekai and litrpg that I haven't seen any other series pull off.

And despite being a JP LN, I find it far more well-written than its peers. The MC has personality and sass, a complete opposite from the typical and generic flat cardboard MCs you usually see. She's also competent and has an incredible drive to survive, and you can understand all of her decisions and feelings based on what happens and what she learns.

The way the System plays into the overarching story is just brilliant, too. I won't reveal too many details on how it changes or what it changes too, but it's all pulled off with a lot of foreshadowing and nothing ever comes out of nowhere.

Well, that's just my personal opinion as someone that's kept up with the source material to the very end. A lot of the people who dislike the series hate how the series moves away from litrpg and grinding at a certain point, but fans will say that this shift is where the story goes from ordinary to amazing. Don't come into the series thinking it'll blow you away from the start, as it starts off acting like a normal isekai, with an unusual hint or tease here and there, and slowly builds up to grand story.

Of course, don't expect something written to the level of Worm, as it is written by an amateur light novel author, but I still greatly enjoy it. I'd even say it's my favorite litrpg.

There's also an anime of it airing this season.

***** The academy part is really early into the series, like early Volume 2, and while the human perspective is initially boring its actually quite important to the overall story, even if it does admittedly start out boring and generic.

The human side is really important to the overarching story, and even without delving into that aspect it provides a lot of great context on powering up and certain skills and lifestyles and how they affect the user, like in the descriptions for Parallel Wills and Appraisal.

The human characters seem generic at first, and well one of them is purposefully made to be “the generic isekai MC” as a complete opposite to Kumoko, from acceptance of reincarnation to motivation to lifestyle. A lot of people were dissatisfied with the early human chapters, but it eventually crescendoes into a climax even more interesting than the MC's.

Like I said, most people who are dissatisfied with the series all seem to drop it very early on before enough clues are laid out and the story really hits its stride. I admit it's a major negative that the story is purposefully generic for several volumes, but what it eventually turns into more than makes up for it. It definitely makes rereading the early volumes and catching all the little hints a lot more enjoyable once everything is clear.

I don't really understand the issue with the MC's strength. Isn't that an inherent weakness of all litrpgs? In Spider there's some legitimate reasons for the weakness of humans in comparison to the monsters and dragons, and even the the MC is never overwhelmingly more powerful than everybody else with the likes of the Ancient Dragons, Queen and Puppet Taratects, and the Demon Lord. She only seems ridiculously powerful compared to humans who live a sheltered life and don't try to seriously become more powerful. Her rise to power given her actions always seemed really reasonable to me, at least compared to other litrpgs and isekais like Azarinth Healer, Delve, Chrysalis, and so on.

It may not be for the more hardcore rational crowd, but for those more rational adjacent and accepting of web/light novels and isekais, I think they'd find it enjoyable. The level of writing certainly isn't as high as professional writers and there are definite issues with how boring the early human POVs are, even if purposefully generic, but despite these slight bumps I found it highly enjoyable. It's far better written than most other light novels, which I guess really just goes to show how poorly written most light novels are, I'll admit.

Perhaps that's because I'm more used to the overwhelming amounts of trashy webnovels, but Spider does legitimately do some cool things in the medium. The way it handles the story relevance of the System and reincarnations adapting or rejecting their new identity is fantastic.

TLDR: It does have its fair share of quality and writing issues innate to the medium, but for those who can handle and enjoy webnovels like those on RoyalRoad, Spider can be quite the interesting read. It starts off seemingly normal and average, but it really does turn everything on its head later on. Every detail, no matter how tiny, has story relevance, no matter how irrelevant it seems at first.

Ah, I guess it was earlier into the series than I realized. Though to be fair, I was reading the web novel and there wasn't much left unread when I dropped it, so it felt more like giving it a proper try than it may seem at this point.

#+begin_quote
  I don't really understand the issue with the MC's strength. Isn't that an inherent weakness of all litrpgs?
#+end_quote

Early on it's fine. She levels and gets more powerful but there's always bigger fish and she's a specialist so she's forced to play it smart. Then she becomes literally indestructible and has nearly infinite offensive capabilities. Reading about someone with godmode on just isn't particularly interesting to me, you know? If your protagonist is Superman, his opponent /must/ have kryptonite.

Perhaps I'm misremembering some details due to how long it's been since I've read it. I read a fair amount of trashy LN/WNs and Kumo always seemed to be a solid, creative start that descended into mediocrity as the author ran out of ideas. Based on how you've said it evolves, evidently the author eventually found a good direction for it to go.

******* She really only has godmode on compared to humans, and in the place she was born it's literally inhospitable to humans. Even the strongest humans can't beat some of the more average powerful monsters like the mid-level dragons like Alaba or S-class monsters like Arch Taratects by themselves. There's a very good reason why this cave in particular is full of such powerful monsters everywhere that don't want to escape and destroy humanity, but that's spoilers for the overarching plot.

Humans can barely handle the Upper Layer with the equivalent of mobs like Snakes, much less the armies of powerful Taratects and Dragons on the lower layers. There's no need for them to explore down there either, as there's nothing of value there. Well, nothing conventionally at least.

In that context there's some unsavoriness with Kumoko's rise to power if you don't agree on how she gets Ruler of Pride(boosted EXP and skill gain) and Ruler of Wisdom, which allows her virtually unparalleled information, for almost nothing, which explains why she's /the/ one that becomes so powerful but might be a bit unreasonable.

All this really isn't the part of the story that fans like anyways, although most will say that the litrpg segments are better than what most other series do, with typically ridiculous power scaling, asspulls, and an incomprehensible System.

The litrpg section disappears once she reaches a certain point and the story moves into a new direction and explores the underlying conflict that turns all the elements onto its head. So it stops right when the litrpg bits start to overstay their welcome, although there are a few that also dislike how the story moves away from being litrpg and how the MC breaks away from the System, but that's an argument for another time.

I suppose it all just comes down to how much you can stomach litrpg and trashy web novels and light novels. If you only read stuff from professional authors or from writers as skilled as wildbow, Spider will probably be disappointing. But if you enjoy such web novels and isekais and translated works, Spider is really good.

I'd say it's like the same for the Chinese Cultivation webnovel Forty Milleniums of Cultivation. If you're not used to translated webnovel quality and cultivation novels and tropes, you might find it unbearable. But if you're used to translated novels and read a lot of Cultivation trash, Forty Milleniums becomes amazing and one of the best in the genre.

That's how I personally feel about Spider and what it does for the trash-filled isekai genre. You earlier complained about the generic human characters, of which I assume you primarily refer to Shun, the human protagonist character that serves as a deconstruction of the generic isekai MC.

He serves an interesting purpose through being bland. He's how a normal average Japanese high school boy should act, as a normal boring average high school boy. Despite reincarnating as a prince, he still clings to his previous identity and modern Japanese beliefs, and can't fully accept the new world and it's cruelty. He lacks the conviction, motivation, and drive to change the overarching conflict, which literally concerns the entire planet and every living being, for which there is no easy solution, so he ends up unable to change anything or alter the situation.

There are other reincarnators that juxtapose with him, like the high school girl bully Fei that reincarnates into a baby dragon and reflects on her past and changes, his best friend who reincarnates into a female body and struggles between these two identities and eventually accepts his new identity, emotions, and situation, and aggressive classmate Hugo who is both the same as him yet completely different, stuck in a different fantasy and unable to fully accept his new reality.

There's a lot of similarly cool twists and subversions of isekai tropes like the 1000 year old loli Demon Lord(unironically the best and most well-written character of the story), Hero vs. Demon Lord conflict, Gods, reincarnation, medieval fantasy world, elves, and so on.

******* I personally found the early volumes interesting and exciting enough, although that does appear to be a point of contention among many. It's quite a popular series among the isekai/litrpg/lightnovel/anime communities as far as I've seen, and is arguably better than most others in the medium and genre, even if that honestly means as little as dirt.

I do suppose that it's not a series fit for those with a more rational bent on this sub. I guess you have to be a light novel/web novel reader to enjoy this sort of stuff.

In my defense, I wouldn't say the early volumes are boring, just more typical. But fair point, those early bits have turned off a few people.

**** It annoys me that she doesn't use tools and gets powerful too quickly. She basically ignores the biggest human advantage, tools, she could have made armor, weapons, tools and any number of things to make her life easier, but she doesn't. She walks around naked even though she has access to materials that would tremendously improve her survivability if she took a couple hours to turn it into armor.

​

In her position I'd be walking around in a full suit of the toughest monster skin available, combined with a layer of spider silk. Use tools and weapons to improve my offensive capabilities. Missile weapons, actual traps, I'd try to find a way to fight remotely like with clones, puppets, mind controlled units or minions..

​

She gets OP too quickly. There's people in her world that have been grinding and training for what centuries? Longer even, but she shows up and just overtakes them in less than 5 years? Kind of lame. If you're going to have power levels that are this imbalanced you need to justify the MC progressing at an insane pace with something better than 'hard work'.

***** On the point of other people's power in comparison to hers, there's only like six people who put in anywhere near the effort, and it's not really the effort that sets her apart, it's her insanity, in a way.

The only six comparable people in stats in the world are the Demon Lord Ariel, the strongest human Mage Ronandt, the reincarnator Sophia, her butler Merazophis, the reincarnator Wrath, and the Hero Julius.

Ariel is at essentially the peak of the System, and that's due to her never dying and gradually improving over 1,000 years, as well as holding the pretty broken Ruler of Gluttony skill.

Julius is the Hero. His soul is very weak so he doesn't have the capability to improve as much as the reincarnators and Kumoko does. He doesn't grind his abilities either, only fighting with necessary and doesn't hurt himself for resistances and doesn't farm in the Great Elroe Labyrinth full of powerful and high EXP enemies.

Sophia and Merazophis are both put through Kumoko's hellish training regimen, and by the end of it they become some of the most powerful beings in the System, and they start off as a baby and a mediocre and average civilian. Sophia is far stronger than Mera due to starting fresh and gaining more benefit from the stat-increasing skills and having a fresh soul.

Wrath doesn't go through the same training as Sophia and Mera initially, but all the killing he does is far more than virtually any other being, and he still gets Kumoko's training at the end. He also goes through one of the most painful lives on the planet as well, as additional fuel and motivation for his leveling.

Ronandt doesn't have any special abilities and also has a weak soul, but he gets powerful after studying Kumoko and practicing the way she does. Using attacks on yourself grinds both the relevant skill and the relevant resistance, as well as some others like Pain Resistance and HP Regeneration. But if you really think about it, isn't it insane to just hurt oneself like that? It's not so easy to do, especially with all the pain and damage. Ronandt, Sophia, and Kumoko all remark on how insane this training method is.

She minmaxes all her skills, and it really requires mental fortitude that only living in the hell that is the Great Elroe Labyrinth forces someone to do. Even humans and demons in war time can't possibly comprehend such a nightmarish training.

She starts out eating her sibling and spends most of her time at death's door. It makes sense why she's uninhibited by things like Parallel Wills, constantly hurting herself, eating the most nasty things possible, and so on that no human/demon would willingly subject themselves to. It's like constantly stabbing yourself with a sword to remove your sense of pain and strengthen your body. Would you constantly do that, and when it doesn't hurt as much or effect you anymore, keep on moving on to larger, sharper, and more painful and destructive implements? Or be forced to walk 2 miles on foot everyday as a baby?

When Kumoko trains the 10th Army, a bunch of Demon losers and rejects, she forces them through her hellish training and despite them being bottom of the barrel recruits and having weak souls they still average out at 1k stats.

And it's not just that either. Kumoko has the Ruler of Pride skill for a lot of her journey, which especially complements her.

More could be done optimizing her fighting style like with tools and armor, I'll admit on that front. There's a lot of potential and room for more optimization for sure. Still, I don't think it detracts from the overall experience that much. Spider isn't exactly rational and in a medium like light novels, surely this fault can be forgiven, haha.

But on the point of overtaking others, I don't think she overtakes anyone that she shouldn't have, since as a whole they're relatively sheltered and weak. There's a couple of points that aren't written that well, but as a whole it's far less egregious than in most every other litrpg I've read, like in Azarinth Healer or Chrysalis or all the crappy ones where everything is completely unbalanced and spoonfed to the MC.

****** Assume somebody has had say 100 years to train. Say they train 1h per day. That's 36500h of training. If Spider bro trained 24/7/365 she'd have trained 8760h in a year.

Even if you assume her training is 3x as effective she'd still be behind others. Time makes a big difference.

She takes several stupid risks, and should have died many times over. She's alive because of plot armor, luck and OP skills that are dumb like immortality.

If the excuse for her power is that she put herself in stupid situations and survived because the author gave her plot armor it's a bad excuse..

I don't read the worst things available so I can't discuss the comparison. It's a popcorn read as far as I'm concerned.

******* It's not really the time or efficiency of training, but the training itself that separates Kumoko from others. Your assumption is correct if they're both training against the same enemy and training in the same way. But if a normal human only fights against some weak lv. 10 boar while Kumoko trains against lv. 10 Wyrms, people sized wasps, and minivan sized snakes, she's going to be magnitudes more efficient than a human, especially with a higher density and much higher frequency of combat. Practicing Earth Magic against a lv. 1 rat on the overworld for a month straight might not be even half as efficient as practicing the same Earth magic against say Earth Dragon Alaba for 3 seconds, as skill growth also corresponds to the strength of an enemy.

Humans only train in normal ways too, like swinging a sword or running some laps. They'll completely avoid using or even knowing of Parallel Wills(which seriously fucks up the mind) or grinding resistances. While they might be relatively leisurely practicing sword forms or running, Kumoko would run, use a Parallel Will to cast water magic on herself, use another Parallel Will to cast Earth magic, and then use an Evil Eye to increase gravity on herself. She trains exponentially more than humans, and in exponentially more difficult ways, with exponentially more rewards from living in such a dangerous location.

I do think it's justified quite well too. War may be hellish, but how many normal soldiers would normally constantly stab themselves and set themselves on fire? And then do both simultaneously while running as fast as they can? Kumoko's location and life has led her to a place where this can be considered normal, and upon noticing a certain naked old wizard copying her training methods she calls him crazy. These benefits are even of a completely different category too, as normal humans would miss out on all the high level resistances and passive HP regen. I personally think all this along with Ruler of Pride is sufficient to explain Kumoko's overwhelming strength compared to humans.

Immortality isn't really that OP. It's more of a joke skill that nobody can ever get. It can only be obtained naturally through the Hana Zorowa evolution tree, and in two of the preceding evolutions each one gives a powerful skill but doesn't give the corresponding resistance skill, meaning the first use of the skill would kill them. And it's basically impossible to avoid using those skills. Even if someone managed to reach the final form, Immortality doesn't heal you back. If you lose all your HP, like say through decapitation, you'll just stay as a head with your consciousness still intact forever. You need a passive HP regeneration skill or you're trapped. Even then, if your body is completely obliterated or certain elements are used, you completely die. And at the power levels where you get the skill, enemies like Queen Taratects, Ancient Dragons, Ariel, and Potimas can easily counteract it. The skill is really just a sick prank by D, as isn't immortality a goal humans would give everything up for?

Immortality digression aside, I don't have any defense for her other OP skills like Pride, Perserverance, Sloth, and Wisdom.

Kumoko makes mistakes and can be a bit silly at times, but I don't think it's any more egregious than Lindon's progression in Cradle. Plot armor really is the unavoidable failing in progression fantasies, depending on how much you criticize each one, I suppose.

I don't disagree that Spider is a popcorn read. It is a light novel after all, and isn't meant to be anywhere near as rational, professional, and gritty as something like say Worm.

Among light novels, litrpgs, and isekais though, I do think it is much better than the rest. It's a fun and popcorn read, not a serious and deep read.

It's like the isekai In-N-Out compared to the norm of isekai McDonalds. Never said it was hardcore rational or not a popcorn novel, imo it's a fantastic light and rational adjacent novel. Nothing wrong with that, is there?

There's no point to really quibble over this minutiae when the MC buys 8 Evil Eye skills solely because it'd be cool and chuuni to have 8 separate deadly abilities coming from each of her eyes. As far as isekais and litrpgs go, its one of the most well thought out, but it's definitely nowhere near the likes of works like MoL and HPMOR. For the intents of what the OP asked for, I'd say this series fits the bill.

If the humans here do not regularly go out and kill stronger and stronger monsters (which they don't) they wouldn't get stronger than her no matter how long they trained. XP means that only the strength of the monster you defeat matters for power.

If you assume 8h/d for 100 years the numbers start getting stupid so lets do it. It equals 292000h trained. Spider bro training 24/7 for one year = 8760. Her training would have to be 33x more effective to be at a similar level. A 100yo entity would need to train at 3% her efficiency for 8h/d to achieve her level of strength.

If you want to assume her training is even more effective say 50x. An 150yo would have her level. You see how time is OP? At 100x efficiency a 300yo would have her beat at 8h/d training, which btw already is 1/3 her assumed efficiency.

And again, I am pretty sure this is an XP world right, so her being 33x more effective because she is 1. a monster so can hit monsters of a higher level than humans can presumably. 2. Constantly trying to fight suicidal fights and survives cos of plot armour (like literally every Isekai story). 3. is actually naturally stronger and has more potential cos spoiler.

Also most people are pretty sheltered; you can see the difference in their living conditions in the human chapters, and they don't have strong monsters available to them, nor do they have as many tools as she does, nor do they live to 100 years, so yeah seems perfectly reasonable to me.
