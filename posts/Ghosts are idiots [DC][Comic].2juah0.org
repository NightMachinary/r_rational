** Ghosts: immortal, have all the time in the universe, have unrestricted access to said universe, can interact with material objects / living beings in said universe ...

Sounds like I'd be doing a lot of science, and then communicating it to Earth through ouija boards.

*** They may be angry at scientists for not believing in ghosts :)

Actually a story aboug ghost of a scientist who tries to explain his continued existence and takes holidays on Mars and Europa would be nice.

** I always thought ghosts were involuntarily tied to the place they haunt. They'd /like/ to travel and see the world, or better yet move on to the afterlife, but they're stuck.

*** It's ambiguous and depends on what kind of fictional canon you're in. Really, the idea of "moving on" seems like a better thing to question. If I was forced to haunt my place of death until I resolved my unfinished business, I'd do so as efficiently as possible, but I certainly wouldn't be interested in "moving on" into some ambiguous white light afterwards. I'd like to enjoy my time as a free, unattached ghost instead.

** Something a little lighthearted. The artist's the same guy who illustrated Zachary Weiner's Augie and the Green Knight. Oh, casual female nudity towards the end.

Thoughts on munchkining the hell out of being a ghost? :P

*** It's hard to know how to munchkin the hell out of being a ghost without knowing what rules we're operating under. The rules for ghosts have a huge variance among them. Just saying "ghost" is like just saying "vampire" - it doesn't really mean much, given how large the differences. Hell, in HPMOR ghosts don't even seem sentient.

** AFAIR, ghosts are people who aren't in afterlife because they can't let go. Either because of internal (regrets) or external (not being buried, etc) reasons. That's why they look like some obsessive maniacs - because they are.

** Unless ghosts can move FTL, wouldn't even exploring Mars take WAY too damn long? :(

**** True, but unless whatever it is that makes you bored isn't attached to your ethereal self, by the time you get anywhere significant outside our galaxy , the boredom would've driven you mad. Not to mention, you are pretty much accepting that, should you choose to explore beyond our galaxy, you're giving up on ever coming back to humanity (like to interact with humans) Although trans-solar system travel would give you plenty of time to circle back and enjoy Earth, although again, dat boredom tho

** I would totally do the "hideous sick ghost" thing, but only because it would be the best way to show the people I love that it's really me.

"How long have you been like this?"

"Oh, about a year"

"WTF?!? Your first 'hello' is to re-enact the Ring? You couldn't IM me or something?"

"Do you know how hard it is to steal a GoPro and /find/ an abandoned roofless well in the middle of the woods? You only get one chance to prove the existence of the afterlife, and I wanted people to know it was really me."

"Asshole."

"Mission Accomplished!"
