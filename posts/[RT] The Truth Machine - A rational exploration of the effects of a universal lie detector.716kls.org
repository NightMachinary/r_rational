** I read this a number of years ago, but it has stuck with me a long time. The author posits the creation of a universal lie detector that can also eliminate those who are not capable of telling truth from fiction and proceeds to examine the effects on society. He also has a quasi-sequel called [[https://smile.amazon.com/First-Immortal-Novel-Future/dp/0345421825/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8][The First Immortal]] set in the same universe. Unfortunately it is only available in paperback.

*** Actually you can find the ebook on Library Genesis, if you don't mind pirating.

** If it is viewed as ethical to answer this, is there anywhere available a (even if crude/terse) synopsis of the plot, rather than of the premise only?

Edit: Particularly, is the protagonist portrayed as a would-be-liar unjustly living while other would-be-liars justly die, justly living while others unjustly die, or a 'third option' in which he justly lives while no others unjustly die? (Replace the concept of 'just' with 'sympathisable-with-by-a-fair-reader' as appropriate.) (If the 'third option', how plausible is it that he's truly the only person in a comparable situation?)
