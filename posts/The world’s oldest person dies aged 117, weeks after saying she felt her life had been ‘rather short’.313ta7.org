** I felt this deserved to be here for the "rather short" comment. Nice thing to point to the next time someone argues against wanting life-extension.

** Sometimes I wonder if it might be worth creating a foundation dedicated to encouraging marriage and children between families of centenarians like what Heinlein postulated in his book [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah%27s_Children][Methuselah's Children]]

I wish I had the funds to do so.

*** Eh, I think we're on track to get technological life extension before that sort of project would even start paying dividends. If someone had started it centuries ago like in the story it might have made sense, but now it's probably too late.

**** It wouldn't necessarily have to yield results directly, by itself. It would certainly yield very useful data to anyone studying the aging process with the intent of more direct genetic manipulation. Sampling could be part of the requirements for participation.

  */Methuselah's Children/* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_novel][science fiction novel]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein][Robert A. Heinlein]], originally serialized in /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astounding_Science_Fiction][Astounding Science Fiction]]/ in the July, August, and September 1941 issues. It was expanded into a full-length novel in 1958.

  The novel is usually considered to be part of Heinlein's "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_History_(novel)][Future History]]" series of stories. It introduces the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Families][Howard Families]], a fictional group of people who achieved long lifespans through selective breeding. The space ship in this novel, the /New Frontiers,/ is described in the Future History timeline as a second generation ship, following the /Vanguard/, the vehicle for Heinlein's paired novellas "Universe" and "Common Sense".

  According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Campbell][John W. Campbell]], the novel was originally to be called /While the Evil Days Come Not/. This provisional title stems from a quotation from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes][Ecclesiastes]] that was used as a password on the second page of the story.

** This woman was here for 1900 and 2000... she might even have had memories from around that time, and probably stories from even before then. That is truly amazing. After some quick research, there are 53 confirmed cases of people over 110, but another 300 or so how suspect that they are, but can't prove it. This is truly awe inspiring

So a probable 353 out of >7,000,000,000 or >5E-6% have only reached the point of a "rather short" life. We can do better than this as a sapient group.

Not to disparage one who we have lost, for now, but her life was amazing, only by comparison to our rather poor status-quo. Once again, we can do better.
