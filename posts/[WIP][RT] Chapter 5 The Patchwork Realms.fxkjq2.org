** Going to go against the flow here; the garbled syllables didn't bother me at all. He's a dog and that's not English and he's almost to the point he knows all the basic words and it's been a couple days!

Seconding what fortycakes said about hoping our dashing, perceptive Goodest Boye gets to rest and heal soon.

Marza's species is /super/ interesting. This chapter gave some insight into what their deal is, but I look forward to gleaning more details.

** A slightly slower chapter, but Athos is starting to get more of a handle on the language so answers to some of the "what's going on?" questions should begin to be visible.

*** Reactions, mostly as they come:

- I'm enjoying it so far, but the language thing is starting to grate. I think it's the mental effort of sorting through sentences for the actual words when they're not visually distinct. I found the "blah blah" sentences less ugh than the "fleeb nurb" ones.
- Dog perspective is, as always, fun to read.
- Internal bleeding? Yikes. I hope he gets some time to rest up and heal soon.
- Just noticed I don't really remember the dog's name (Arthos? Athos. Had to go check the chapter again.), since it hasn't come up that much, though we're only at chapter 5 so this is probably a brainspace issue on my end.
- I have just spotted the cover image on royalroad. :D
- "Weapon of Peace" seems interesting - some sort of "stamina damage"?
- The cage of mice is mysterious, probably as intended - I'm guessing they're used as a sacrifice of some kind, or maybe for Skills that require a living target.
- Eugene is clearly going to be trouble, but what kind I'm not sure.
- Hopefully we see some more of the worldbuilding soon - I vaguely recall a Sliver-quest set in a similar (same?) setting that you did which was cool.

**** Thanks, that's helpful.

I may switch to blah blah for all of the unknown words. It's easier to write, for one thing, and I can see how it would be easier to read. I might even go back and switch it for past chapters. Regardless, there's about to be a minor timeskip (about a week) so language will be much less of an issue going forward.

The mice will be explained, but it's not super exciting -- more of a "don't be stupid, Eugene" than anything else. I'll spoiler just in case: When something dies, each nearby living being over a certain weight will collect 0-1 of the Skills released. If you are hunting solo, bring some mice to collect the Skills you don't get, then one by one take each mouse aside and kill it to collect its Skill.

EDIT: Weapon of Peace causes your weapon to do extra knockback but no HP damage.

Yep, the setting reuses the general idea of the Chaos Lands sliver quest, except I won't be having fanfic worlds show up and they won't shift in and out as much.

***** Suggestion about the gibberish words: either italicize the gibberish, or bold the words he picks out.

I do like the random gibberish, because it indicates that different words are being said, but I agree that picking out the real words is harder than it needs to be. However, indicating that Athos is noticing words (or ignoring them) thru formatting feels like a better solution than replacing everything with blah.

***** I'm just chiming in to say that I prefer the random words over the blahs - I think it really adds to the feeling of the new world being strange and different, and plays really well with the dog logic in Athos' internal dialog.

****** Also, using the random words up until now allows you the extra meaning with the blahs that Athos doesn't just not understand what Eugene is saying here, but has actively stopped listening because Eugene is just being a big meanie and whatever he's ranting about isn't important anyway, which I thought was a really clever bit and would be sorry to see it go.

Another option to separate out the nonsense words, if your various hosting sites allow it, is different fonts. Maybe play with serif vs. sans serif but otherwise similar.

******* Good thoughts all.

The next chapter has a week-long timeskip in which he learns enough that it's mostly English with just a few nonsense words, so hopefully that will resolve the issue.

I'm another person who kinda liked the gibberish - the more so because Artos caught on gradually but quick, and it's tapering off now. Whatever you decide though, you do you; you're the author, it's your story.

But if it's a question of the work involved: I don't know if it would be more or less interesting/annoying to read, but maybe you could find a [[https://www.google.com/search?ei=jVGRXrSVLe-j_Qbf8J-gDw&q=gibberish+OR+nonsense+translator+OR+generator][gibberish translator]] or [[https://www.google.com/search?q=cipher+text+encoder][cipher text encoder]] that suits your needs, or even just use find-replace to substitute a gibberish word for the real word everywhere. For some readers, keeping the English to Gibberish substitutions consistent across multiple uses, might even be more interesting and satisfying - the ability to go back and retranslate earlier conversations using the new understandings developed later.

***** I would second the opinion on "blah blah" vs. "fleeb nurb". Occasionally knocks me out of the flow when reading.

** I continue to enjoy this. Interesting premise and its nice and lighthearted so that really tickles the fancy at the moment.
