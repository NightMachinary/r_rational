***** It's entirely possible and likely probably that he just read all that information from Jake's mind. It would be much simpler.

We see no evidence in Suze's goddreams or anything else that the gods can leave their multiverse. We have clear evidence that there is no magic and no souls in our world.

None of these gods would be worshiped there, and so risk cessation of existence. We saw how fast that hit Lolth.

****** We don't know that we're on a separate multiverse. We could just be a separate plane, so gods could get here just as easily as they could go to the plane of fire. [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/planes.htm#deadMagic][We wouldn't be the only plane without magic.]] I think not having immortal souls is the norm outside of the Prime Material Plane. Mortals managed to take Jake from our universe and send him back with other stuff. If mortals can move to and from this world, it would be surprising for gods not to be able to. There are gods worshiped here. It's possible for a god to get power through means other than worship, such as the god of death getting power from undead. We don't know whether or not gods in our world would be able to get power from worship in another world.

Y'know, if they're worried about Jake raising an army, then why let him have all of those magic items? Was him bringing that HH a condition of the bombs not going off?

#+begin_quote
  Anyway. The plan was too complicated by half, but it worked. A month before I was going to be executed, I went to the Archmagi and told them that, unless they sent me home, each of my two thousand spell engines was going to go off and Polymorph Any Object a pebble into a cubic meter of antimatter neutronium. Then, of course, I had to explain what neutronium is, which took a while. Anyway. Moving on.

Yep. At that point he could have said "and before I go, I want you all to paint yourselves blue and dance the Watusi naked on Jeweler's Square" and they'd pretty much have said "well, crap. Maybe this whole 'planning to murder him' thing /wasn't/ such a good idea." ...and then gone and done it.

** When Jake was filling his backpack did he toss in just any magic item he could find or were there any items he refused to bring with him due to being too dangerous? Also how are they(as in the governments) going to handle any wish scrolls that were brought over? Can you imagine what would happen if some omnicidal lunatic got his hands on a wish scroll then decided to cause as much damage as possible, made even worse if he has an internet connection or is an experienced and creative D&D player. Loved the ending by the way and looking foward to reading your future works.

*** Jake's...not the most forethoughtful guy. His strategy for putting things in the pack was "sure, why not?" Hopefully he's got the brains -- or he used someone as an advisor who DOES have the brains -- to remove the really dangerous stuff before handing it out.

**** Personally, I kinda feel like the wish scrolls should've been left behind in that case. Unless he's planning some hard-core regulation, and has a way to say "Fuck Off" to every major world government and organization as well, once his claims are proven valid, and the wish scrolls are proven valid, I feel like any number of agencies will hunt him down to obtain them. Even if it's just to lock them away so that no one else can use them either. I get that some people will argue that they can do just as much good as bad, but rational statistics aren't always correct. It only takes one fucked up wish to wipe out all life in our universe, even if that wasn't its original intent.

***** Like I said, Jake's not the most forethoughtful guy. I think his thought process was first "Sure, why not?" and if he thought beyond that it was "meh, it can do just as much good as harm so I'll just be careful to only use it for good. Better to have the option and not use it."

EDIT: For the record, I don't always agree with my characters. This is one of those times where I'm not sure if I do or do not.

****** I see what you're saying. I'm sure you've read Metropolitan Man, and I'm thinking kind of like that story's Lex Luthor. There's plenty of potential good to be had, but does the statistically small (but still possible) chance of complete human extinction worth said good? And even worse, as opposed to a sentient being with a strong moral compass being the gatekeeper to such destruction, we get Jake. I don't think he'd ever destroy the world, I just really doubt his capacity to predict consequences of his actions and/or protect the scrolls from those who would abuse them. Although, for all I know, he'll Wish up certain contingencies. Most likely after his first big fuck up. It fits his pattern :P

Are you saying he's not sentient? Or maybe that he doesn't have a strong moral compass? :P

He's smart, and he's got (what I think is) a good moral compass, he just has a failure-to-think-ahead problem.

As to him destroying the world...well, he threatened it, and was prepared to go through with it -- only because he knew that, as long as he was prepared, he wouldn't have to. Still.

(In case anyone's wondering: he sacrificed the 'blow up the world' idea to Herrún back when she was being re-reified. That big, overcomplicated plan that he used to escape Flobovia, that required him making deals with basically everyone? His deal with Herrún was to get that idea back, hence why he was able to do it.)

******** I think my wording's just kind of ambiguous. I was comparing Jake to Superman. With Superman, the threat is purely within him. No one (beyond mind control not present in Metropolitan Man) is going to make him do anything, beyond your regular threats and manipulation, whereas with Jake's situation, once someone gets their hand on a Wish scroll, they've got autonomy to fuck things up.

So I was moreso saying on one hand, the threat is a super powered sentient being. On the other hand, the threat is a cache of items, free to be used by anyone that can subvert Jake.
