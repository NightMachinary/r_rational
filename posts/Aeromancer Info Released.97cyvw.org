Hi all! Cultist Gelifyal here! Some people have requested that I release info regarding the rest of the story, which I have no problem doing (and perhaps world building stuff at a later date if that's desired).

To clarify something quick though, this isn't an AMA! I may or may not respond to people's questions. I ultimately decided to do this since I decided to place a higher priority on a different aspect of my life. And no, no one asked me to do this.

Firstly, I'm going to give out what I have written up until this point (which is up to chapter 18, though that chapter itself is not completed). This introduces new aspects of the world so if anyone does actually decide to continue writing the story, you'll have some idea of what thing's are like.

Please note that chapter 16-18 is of less quality because my beta readier/editor from this subreddit hasn't touched it yet, and he's the one who points out plot holes and what's "too convenient" for the MC. He's also the reason why my writing quality "went up" lol, so huge props to him!

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tH3no9waN8gd2wOvG7EEa3rqq5MmuNdYIbXTR7pCKhA/edit?usp=sharing][Chapter 15 - Detention]]

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aKN0QdWONb3kqj0u_kbJ9gvKExOLtghS7N3aPTEWX0U/edit?usp=sharing][Chapter 16 - Enter Reimi]]

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ddO1ez7e64OY5dN1eNtnka1wIeQW9XnhgDSWJ18_TVw/edit?usp=sharing][Chapter 17 - The Prefect Elections]]

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ba4vdSyhqDyd-Pcq849M8asDIBiUUFVplUm9LA5nyU/edit?usp=sharing][Chapter 18 - The Summit of Champions]]

And for the plotline to show where this was going in its entirety, I've decided to link this [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zOEdis_-tq0Xd04eWMd8ZEukyB62e0dLePtFVMK_GRE/edit?usp=sharing][doc]].

Had I known that people were going to like it as much as they did, I would've started writing much earlier lol. In any case, writing takes /a lot/ of free time, which I simply don't have anymore. I'm sorry for stringing everyone along, but hope you enjoyed what was made. Cheers!


** Since it seems like you're making a big life change here and this is, after all, the rational subreddit, I feel obligated to suggest you remember to take a rational perspective towards this intervention.

Make sure you keep careful account of whether it's actually working and how effective it is. I've seen a lot of people make certain life interventions for a variety of different reasons, and they're all usually pretty hyped on the momentum of it at first and very satisfied with their decision, but after that inevitably wears off, two common failure modes present themselves:

1. They couldn't stick with the change for discipline reasons
2. They do stick with it, but it didn't actually turn out to be better than what they were doing before

Your scenario seems unlikely to fall into case #1, but try to carefully track whether #2 ends up being the case once you get past the honeymoon period. The main reason I bring this up is because I've almost never seen someone end up happier after giving up one of their passions for something "more important". Sometimes it's necessary, such as dealing with mental health issues or freeing up time to spend with your family or because of changes in your employment situation, etc. But the resulting decrease in life satisfaction from giving up a passion is something that's hard to predict, let alone quantify, before you actually do it. Sometimes it's worth it to cut other areas of your life in order to make sure that you can continue with your passion, even if it's in a diminished form.

What does this mean in practice? I'd recommend keeping a quick and easy log of your daily happiness and satisfaction with your life. Maybe just a 1-10 score and a quick pros/cons list. Shouldn't take more than 5 minutes a day. Ideally you would have started /before/ this change so you'd have something to compare with, but it can still be helpful for analyzing the change rationally once your honeymoon period wears off.

If it turns out that you're not actually happier with the change you made once a few months pass and this is supported by the data in your log, then make another change to fix it, whether that's undoing the previous intervention or making adjustments to it to fix any problems that the previous change introduced.

Hope this was helpful.

And FYI: I am /not/ one of your readers, so you can take this post to be entirely free from the "i want to keep reading your story" bias. :)

** Some of you might remember me from yesterday where I shared [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/972fh9/aeromancer_update/e45buvl][copies]] of Aeromancer in various formats.

Well...I made all new copies that include chapters 15 to 18 and the plotline notes as a 19th chapter. Making all of the formatting consistent from chapter to chapter was so problematic that I even uploaded the four chapters to FictionPress just to make sure that I had the right font! Don't worry I deleted the story afterwards, so there's no plagiarism.

It was to my understanding that Gelifyal's beliefs (Christianity) don't demonise or marginalise rationality or any common culture of our group. I found many of the comments on the other post on this sub and on royalroad to be insensitive in that they were completely ignorant, yet rather assertive.

It's like the commenter assumes they know exactly what's going wrong, and that their opinion of OP's decision is just *shake your head and smile sadly, this one is lost to us forever*. They stopped treating him as a thinking human and immediately started modelling him one level below them. This isn't useful, this isn't rational and this isn't smart. And yet almost every comment acted like this.

I'm using 'sensitive' to describe a way of talking kindly and with respect whether you agree with them or not. It doesn't hinder rational thought at all and it makes it easier to communicate since people don't get offended and don't need to act defensively.\\

Well nothing that holds across our entire group apart from the anti-empiricism that comes with making non-falsifiable claims.

I was more talking about the attitude of his book to individuals which [[/r/rational]] community has no issue with, like homosexuality, or their lack of willingness to murder infants when murdering children means they get infinite bliss and not murdering means they have a chance of being infinitely tortured.

I agree with this in principle, a marketplace of free ideas should result in the best ideas coming to the surface. In reality tolerance of ideas leads to their acceptance regardless of their merit. I think that ridicule can limit the attraction of positions to many people, of course what is ridiculed has nothing to do with what is right too, see for example the ridicule of socialism in the USA during the red scare, but it worked.

By 'his book' I assume you are talking about the Bible. I understand your opinion and I see how this translates to the points you make. I simply accept that I do not know enough about Christianity to make an accurate or useful judgement. I do not mean to strawman you by picking out arguments, but I feel inclined to respond to your comment: Murder is prohibited by their God and Christians aren't in it /just/ to go to Heaven. I could explain more of their reasoning, but you'd think I was just preaching to you, so suffice to say /there are reasons you don't know about/ and /murdering children does not help them/. I have no knowledge to make comment about homosexuality.

I realise now that this is a matter of personal preference and I was wrong to require others to reciprocate my views. I do not think this is a useful path to go down though; from a utilitarian standpoint, giving respect takes only self control and goes a long way in earning the respect of others, something essential to spreading rationality in a good light.

I did notice the group-focus of these comments, and made me consider: I wouldn't think of acting antagonistic to an individual because of something another person in their group said or did (unless of course, they are implicated). Let's be real, if Gelifyal hadn't said anything about his belief, nobody on this sub would've thought of it at all. As an individual he doesn't appear to embody any of the hazardous traits that we worry about (eg. he is willing to think critically of his beliefs).

And I realise that I kind of assumed Gelifyal to be a guy, so if I'm wrong then oops.

Identifying with a position is an action. If I call myself a Nazi I don't have to do anything other than that. By calling myself something, by stating that I identify with it, I am giving an identity support and validating it.

#+end_quote

I was raised Christian and while I'm aware they aren't in it just to go to Heaven it doesn't justify how in my, or in my opinion any decent, morality system if by action or inaction you allowed someone to be eternally tortured it suggests to me an obscene lack of empathy bordering on psychopathy. I recognise that Christians think that their partners and children deserve eternal torture if God decides such. Beyond that most Christians haven't even considered it which is absurd to me since you'd think optimisation of morality would be the first thing people think about when given scales as sheer as heaven and hell. I'm happy to acknowledge I'm biased against Christians (and religious people) based on my experience.

From a utilitarian standpoint encouraging people to see beyond the attitude of a comment and going for the meat of it is much more important to me. I think that stripping emotion from human discussion is an impossible endeavour, especially since you will lose versus someone who is using emotional arguments (why would we give up one of the best methods of spreading ideas), whereas teaching someone to ignore vitriol is a much more practical benefit and should be standard for anyone seeking to achieve rationality. Besides which the practical benefit of shaming a group into isolation which I think is a more relevant (since no one was arguing with him with content hidden in insults, they were just insulting).

#+end_quote

I think this is crazy. If someone walks up to me and says they identify with a group that I know that say, murders, people like me. I would not wait for them to perform an action, their identification is action enough. I don't want to make an assumption but my guess is that your comment has to come from a particularly privileged position where you've never interacted with a group that has targeted you. If a KKK member knocks on your door it might be easy for you to deal with them perfectly normally, but for those hunted by the KKK they might reasonably not open the door.

I haven't read the story, nor seen any of their comments, I just clicked in the thread and saw your comment. The respect beliefs because they are beliefs is something I've seen a lot and have particular distaste for. In one situation a large group of university students applauded when someone (from another culture) spoke about how they beat their children, and I was in shock that people would normalise something that has no scientific justification (and might be immoral even if it did) in the slightest.

******** Thank you for sharing past experiences to close the gap between our priors. I agree that I am sheltered and it makes it easier for me to think well of people since I have never experienced that fear for myself. It's definitely easier to interact with people over the internet. My comment about talking to someone with homicidal tendencies is likely also affected by my feeling of security.

I think it would help if I said respect =/= truth. I don't think I should respect the /belief/ per se, but the /fact that the person holds the belief/. That is to say: if they are wrong and I can't change that, then so be it, but I would tell them and others not to do that thing because it's still wrong. It means I cannot force the person to bow to my aesthetics except when it breaks an agreement they made (e.g law) and preferably to stop them inflicting harm on others. In that scenario you described where everyone applauded, I can see how it is quite distasteful. I am curious: Suppose everyone in that hall disagreed but clapped out of politeness, and nobody thought for a second that beating children is ok. Would that scenario be better than your memory of it?

I am noticing that I am getting a different feel from someone identifying as the KKK than identifying as a Christian. I completely agree with you that someone claiming to be KKK is a strong fact about them, whereas in my mind it appears that being a Christian is not (for me) a defining trait. I can guess that it's to do with the culture of it, or my knowledge about it, but this is idle speculation not correlated with my actual mental state. I just don't know why.

Shaming a group into isolation reminds me too much of echo chambers and cultish behaviours. A cult is strengthened by keeping only like-minded people, a not-cult benefits from diversity and any large group that is made for only like-minded people devolves into an echo chamber. Consult [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_to_Actually_Change_Your_Mind#J._Death_Spirals_and_the_Cult_Attractor][the sequences]] for the rest of this train of thought. Perhaps that's where my discomfort with shaming comes from.

I suppose technically, my problem with applause is that it moves people on the fence to thinking these things are ok and valuing their positions as if they are equivalent or just as justifiable as the other one. However the reaction would also have to not impact the person who is speaking.

My understanding of rationality is a distrust of myself to be right all the time and thus taking measures to ensure that I am wrong as little as possible. Ridiculing an opponent position is a good thing if I assume my position to be correct and thus I must do all in my power to ensure that the mistruths of the opponent are stopped. I don't trust myself to be 100% right, and so we argue, and the idea which gains followers shows its worth in being followed. I take that with a grain of salt given that.. ahem *trump* happened, but that means I need to find trustworthy people to get the judgement of instead.

My experiences of Christianity are that people who I've talked to have had a better life because of it. I can't tell them they're wrong for living the life they enjoy the most, just like I can't expect expect everyone to seek the truth as aggressively as we do. And so I found that arguing against Christianity is not useful for me. Talking in a Rational sub about Effective Communication is far more productive. Also fun.

In my opinion this is absurd and I don't think you agree with it. If you really spent all your time listening to literally anything anyone has to say you would have no time left. Some random guy preaching that the earth is flat because the faeries told him is not worth listening to just because you don't view yourself as 100% being right. In a world with infinite time sure you could give everyone infinite time to preach their ideals, but we live in the real world and you should be using Bayesian probability to figure out how many times for example Christian information improved your truth state.

#+begin_quote
  My experiences of Christianity are that people who I've talked to have had a better life because of it. I can't tell them they're wrong for living the life they enjoy the most, just like I can't expect expect everyone to seek the truth as aggressively as we do. And so I found that arguing against Christianity is not useful for me. Talking in a Rational sub about Effective Communication is far more productive. Also fun.
#+end_quote

You might not have an egotistical moral justification for telling a Christian not to stone a homosexual because it makes them enjoy their life the most but that's not the same as allowing them to do it or even supporting a belief system which allows it to occur. Someone having a better life is NOT a good justification for allowing discussion, many serial killers were much happier after deciding to kill than beforehand. If you are okay with people serial killing then obviously I bow to your consistency and don't have issue with your position.

I agree, I do not spend time to listen to everyone. Likewise, I do not have coherent arguments against everyone. I only find it useful to think and argue about things that I have knowledge of. So since I have a friend who is Christian and I want to argue with him about it, I require that I learn about his position first. If I did not have this friend I would likely have never cared about this discussion at all. I find that 99% of the 'science vs religion debate' is a complete mockery of the word 'argument', where everyone is content flaming their opponents and acting superior. If the people with incomplete knowledge stopped butting in whenever they felt like it, maybe we'd have a conclusion. Instead they are fodder for the opponents to strawman and now their side looks stupid.

What I was focusing on: ridiculing the position of others means that you are arguing with them, it means you want to change the state of their beliefs. If that is truly what the offensive commenters wanted to do, then ridiculing Gelifyal (or anyone) is an anti-rational way to approach it (not promoting the truth seeking attitude that we aspire towards). If they did not really care about changing his or others' minds, then what they said amounts to only insults.

With regards to your last paragraph, I'm sorry if I made you think that I wasn't approaching this rationally. I at least /think/ that my model has internal consistency and doesn't appreciate serial killers. I see a distinction between thought and action; thought is personal and harmless. They can imagine killing millions in their head and I am a-ok with that. If they actually kill someone, they are forcing their wants onto other people and that is /not okay/. None of the Christians I know actually hate any homosexuals, and they are certainly not crazy enough to want to stone them. Of course that would be not-ok! I would be fine talking to someone with homicidal tendencies if they can keep it under control, I would love to learn how/why they think like that and how to prevent other murderers from losing control.

The whole American issue 'what is free speech and what is hate speech' covers the topic of what discussions should be allowed, and I simply don't have an answer. I could say nice things like 'only constructive discussion is allowed', but they would be shot down by the point you made, 'you would have no time left'. I haven't spent enough time considering this topic to think that I could make that decision. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you have either.

No man is an island, and no argument is heard in isolation. I completely agree that aggro is not the best response for convincing the person you're talking to, but I do think creating a dismissive attitude towards a group rather than a "these people's opinions are as meaningful as other people's" minimises the memetic potential of that group.

This is part of my problem, moderates allow the existence of extremists. Once you've accepted that being Christian is acceptable then the approach of stoning people seems reasonable if not rationale, this is even more true in Islam where the holy book is the literal word of God. If you took a rational approach to believing the Bible is the word of God then stoning people seems quite reasonable.

#+begin_quote

But would you respect that belief?

#+begin_quote

Agreed, I only know I'm opposed to the idea that any belief is entitled to respect or a platform just for existing.

**** The etiquette is perfectly rational. It's there so we can keep having good stories.

You're free to think religion is wrong. That's not rude. Nor is it rude to criticize religion in forums about religion. Or in a debate with someone who wants to debate religion. The problem is when people treat the submission of a good story as an invitation to critique the author's personal life.

Increase the price of writing and we'll get fewer stories.

*** I'm from a Slavic background (Russian/Ukrainian) and was born there and moved to the USA when I was young. When I say "church camp", I'm using a term that most Americans should be familiar with, despite the Slavic version of it being entirely different.

While American churches tend to have ages 11-17 be the recipients of church camp, Slavic churches tend to be 17-30 and involve multiple churches from several states - more like a conference but with cabins and all that. Having a Slavic culture brings unity when it isn't readily shared with the outside world, loosely similar to the Families situation in Aeromancer, but heavily similar in the sense that people are judged based on their state location or their last name lol. Fun Fact: the MI boys made a homemade bomb and let it off on the campgrounds. It was loud. But no one was surprised it was them that did it.

This conference basically had several speakers and a lot of hanging out. No one asked for money or really anything for that matter. What stuck out to me the most was a simple phrase:

#+begin_quote
  "You don't have to give anything to God /except/ what He asks for."
#+end_quote

They don't tell you what's requested. Is money a big deal to someone? Maybe God will ask for that. Is someone placing their job or school above all else? Maybe God will ask for that. A boyfriend/girlfriend? The desired thing doesn't have to be bad. It's similar to God asking the rich young ruler to sell everything he owned and give it to the poor. Do all Christians have to do that? Nope. Did the ruler have to? Yup.

Since Christianity is based on a personal relationship with God who speaks with each individual, God's responses tend to be tailored to that individual.

***** You missed the point.

I think it's called congruence. If your activities are in dissonance with your believe, you will feel uncomfortable. There is a writer, who is religious, that keep writing SF because he doesn't feel writing get in the way of their faith. Author feel that writing demand more commitment than what he's comfortable with. And that's get in the way of his faith. So he stops writing.

It IS subjective.

Good luck author with whatever you may choose to do in the future. Some of us will raise an eyebrow if your basis of decision is religious in nature. But don't worry, people can do the same with different basis. I'd do what my wife told me if that's resonate with me, even if that means I have to drop commitments I've made before.

No, I don't have a wife, it's hypothetical situation.
