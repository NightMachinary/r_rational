** At least the last few paragraphs had something new and of interest.

Looks like we'll finally be able to see the Slime in the Soul soon.

** At least this chapter wasn't filled with cringey memes.

The entire chapter is soul stuff we've already seen multiple times, however.

*** Yeah we have had soul centric chapters before, but there were at least 3 new soul related things in this chapter. Feels a bit disingenuous to not mention that?

**** What's new? Stats effect the soul? What a shocking revelation. We already knew Dozer was in there.

***** - stats affect your ability to work within the soul space. You dismiss this as obvious, but it's not exactly obvious that a physical stat would come into play here. It might be giving a hint into the underlying mechanism of the strength stat and how stats affect the “real” world.
- something (most likely something to do with the area Rain is in) affects the soul. Soul <-> Real world interaction could be key to future power developments. (Can you communicate through this channel? Interface through it to macros that are manipulating/observing mana levels?)
- Dozer is reforming now, not just scrambled
- Dozer's first thought upon re-emerging (“filth”) gives some hint about what might happen with him in the soul space going forward (will Dozer clean it up, removing Rain's need to process it before doing work there?)

** I was thinking about posting this but I couldn't bring myself to. The /[FILTH]/ was strong with this update.
