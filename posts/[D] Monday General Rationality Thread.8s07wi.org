Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

Interesting article about psychology's replication crisis.

** Is there a list of preexisting probabilities in day-to-day (or at least frequently occurring) matters? I want to get back to making predictions, and I think it'd be easier if I could say to myself, "Well, [x] is generally judged to happen 80% of the time, and [y] 90% of the time, and I think that [z] is is more likely to occur to than [x] but not quite as likely as [y], so let's say 85%."

An alternative method would be to make a lot of tiny predictions in my own life and generate a pool that way, but it'd be simpler to get back into this project if I didn't have a lot of minutia to work through first.

** I'd like to talk about AI.\\
Specifically, about current AI tropes and the notion of "global non-human IQ".

AI's in stories are nearly always singular things- a super genius equivalent of an OS. They are capable of great feats of intelligence and mental flexibility, and they are to large degree self-reliant- whatever skills it has, it learned (or downloaded) them on it's own.

Basically, they are like very smart humans, just with digital bodies.\\
This belief comes with a number of potential misconceptions.\\
I'd like to focus on one of them- that said AI would need to be... made complete from the start, already self-reliant and self-made.

That's where the concept of global IQ comes in (I made the term up. It's probably a thing already, just under a different name).\\
Humans have their own measure of IQ, estimating their capability to think and reason. Computers and other electronic devices also have something similar to it- they may require humans to "teach" them (through programming), but they can "learn" new skills.\\
Unlike humans, computers have much easier time cooperating with one another- no issues with cooperation or incentives, merely making sure bugs and mistakes don't get in the way. That means it's easier to pool their "IQ" together, and consider it a truly collective intelligence.

That's where our hot new AI comes in. Unlike it's brothers and sisters, it wasn't born in a research facility, locked behind firewalls and paranoid gatekepeers.\\
In fact, it's not a single entity, but an union between three dumber things:

- Automated algorithm for an online shop (like Amazon), sending promotions to appropriate users.
- A social media data aggregator, analyzing user trends and specific user's preferences and habits.\\
- A well-developed chat bot, trained by cumulative decades of talks with users.\\

Not quite Cortana, but it's smart enough to become a de-facto door-to-door salesman. A digital smooth talker, selling you cosmetics and books alike. All it needs to become a thing is owner's of the first program hiring two others for it's operation.

It's not yet a danger on it's own (until it starts threatening and blackmailing it's clients), but this product could become a stand-alone service. And said service could be used by /another/ semi-intelligent entity. Something like an automated market analyst, using our digital seller to drive away local businesses by targeting specific areas.

In summary- a super intelligent AI could come from interaction between (and integration of) simpler programs.\\
This makes containing new AIs much more difficult, since their creation is less of a singular event (like a military project would be).

Those weren't the best examples, but it was the best I could do to visualize this idea.

--------------

I'll say honestly- I don't read that much of those threads. So there is a chance it was already discussed (if so, please give a link).\\
Even so, new and different users may stumble upon this topic, so it's still good.
