Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** *Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 14: Bendalloy*

And here we are, the penultimate episode of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is bendalloy. As always we're interested in what a bendalloy twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantically, bendalloy is very similar to cadmium. Like with cadmium, burning bendalloy creates a translucent bubble in which time passes differently from the outside world. In bendalloys case time inside the bubble passes faster than normal. From the perspective of anyone in the bubble the outside world appears frozen, while from outside the bubble people inside become blurs, moving to fast to follow.

Bendalloy bubbles are much smaller than cadmium bubbles, the maximum size being roughly enough to envelop a room. The extent to which time is sped up in the bubble is similar to cadmium though: 20 to 30 times faster than normal depending on the strenght of the allomancer. It's worth noting that bendalloy is not a cheap metal and that it burns substantially quicker than cadmium, so most allomancers only maintain bubbles for very brief amounts of time.

A bubble cannot be moved once it's created, it anchors itself to the nearest object of sufficient mass. Typically this is the ground on which the allomancer is standing (in which case the bubble maintains its position relative to the planet as it rotates around it's axis/the sun), but sufficiently large vehicles can also be used to anchor a time bubble to, an allomancer bendalloy while inside a train will see their time bubble stay in place relative to the train, rather than the ground. When the allomancer stops burning bendalloy the bubble immediately seizes to exist and it takes a few seconds before another bubble can be created.

Small objects like bullets can pass through the edge of the bubble if they move quickly enough, but are knocked wildly off course in the process. Larger objects pop the bubble entirely if they move through its edge. Objects are always effected by the time dilation entirely or not at all, depending on if more of their mass is inside or outside the bubble. Whether something constitutes one object or multiple depends on how it is presented in the cognitive realm, which roughly corresponds to how most people would view it. Moving objects that cross the perimeter of the bubble for longer periods of time (eg. a stick that you wiggle back and forth while it is crossing the edge) pop the bubble.

The edge of a time bubble absorb some, but not all, of the sound going through it. Sounds from outside the bubble are almost completely inaudible inside as they are dampened by crossing into the bubble as well as spread out over a much longer time than before. If you amplified it to a reasonable volume you would still only hear random noise though, as the same effect that knocks bullets off course also distorts sounds.

In the outside world, sounds from inside the bubble will be a constant, white noise hum (being amplified and compressed by time dilation and then mangled and dampened by passing through the edge of the bubble).

Light passes through time bubbles unhindered and the magic compensates for the fact that more photons move from inside the bubble to the outside world than vice versa as well as for any redshifting or blueshifting those photons would undergo. The result is that both sides of the bubble see the other side completely as normal, other than the fact that time is sped up/slowed down.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemically, bendalloy stores nutrition. While storing, any food that is metabolized by the feruchemist does not end up in the feruchemists body, but dissappears instead. Then when tapping the resulting metalmind, the sugars, fat, vitamins, toxins and all other byproducts that the metabolized food would have turned into start appearing in the appropriate places inside the feruchemists body, allowing the feruchemists to go without food for prolonged amounts of time.

Aside from this, bendalloy also allows the feruchemists to store fluids. This requires a separete metalmind (similar to how tin requires different metalminds for different senses), but the process is basically the same: while storing fluids any water that would be absorbed from the feruchemists stomach instead disappears until the resulting metalmind is tapped, at which point it reappears inside the body.

*** So aside from never needing to eat or drink, a bendalloy compounder should also be able to create arbitrary amounts of any chemical which can be secreted from the body and won't just kill you. The most interesting one I can think of is LSD, as it's nonlethal, secreted in urine and sweat (which they can produce more of with their infinite water supply), and could hypothetically be reabsorbed by the compounder to end the effects immediately. Coupled with the time bubble that would come along with compounding, you could create and purify a large amount of high-quality LSD over a busy weekend. This leads to an infinite money supply when sold over the darknet IRL, and would make you a religious leader on Scadrial assuming Harmony let you get away with it.

*** *Really terrible ideas*

Waste destruction:

- Eat something you want gone.
- Dump all the output into the metalmind.

I'm not sure what possible use case this would have. What edible thing would you want to get rid of that you couldn't burn (also giving power)? Very diseased/radioactive meat? How do you stop it from hurting you before you poof it?

Could you dispose of inedible things (plastic?), how about if you mixed it with a certain proportion of edible food?

​

Power generation:

- Eat a ton of food.
- Dump it in the metalmind.
- Be raised somewhere high.
- Drain the metalmind.
- Harvest the increased potential energy.

My initial thought was this would give you the power to become overweight on command (but not turn back again) giving a really long and unpleasant cycle-time.

On second thoughts this would only give you hyperglycemia on command, which is even less exploitable.

*** One possibility that springs to mind is picking up new skills. If I never get mentally exhausted from the tedious aspects of practicing, then I can devote more time to developing those skills.

Part of this depends on where you draw the line between willpower and motivation, but someone could (for example) devote a whole day to nothing but sitting at a desk and studying a new language's vocabulary, without having to take a break and go for a walk, or talk to a friend, or whatever.

*** Well, in the real world, there aren't any spells to fuel with willpower, so all willpower does is let you force yourself to do things you don't like, such as exercising or working instead of lazing around. Infinite willpower will let you keep on working whenever possible, but that's not such a big difference from workaholics with regular amounts of willpower so you aren't going to gain much from this method. Especially since working smarter tends to yield more than working harder.

Rather, it might be best to look for things that are utterly undesirable. Jobs that normal people would be reluctant to do, you can force yourself to without any problems. And I don't mean undesirable like wading through filth and gore, because plenty of people already do that for their work. It has to be far far worse than that.

Which means you have to find jobs where you are needed to make horrible choices. Become a judge/cop/etc and you can accurately execute the law regardless of how much justification the defendant has or how much suffering it would cause their loved ones. Become a politician and make the tough choices that will make you the most hated governor/president in history for the sake of your people. Become a spy and help your country murder countless innocents that have become your friends and family after you infiltrated their society, just because they oppose your country.

here's an easy solution: given enough intelligence, go sell drugs for money, then labor away at a PhD, but fund your own research if you think you can do something groundbreaking. Fuck, do both at the same time, infinite willpower. Try to make a big bite in anti-aging research.

** TL;DR: Magic lets you reshape the world but only according (roughly) to the laws of physics and chemistry. Exploiting this will probably require all the nitty gritty details laid out below though, because a lot of the obvious exploits are infeasible due to the way the rules are set up. For example, you can't just conjure and pawn diamonds because it's really hard to get all the facets right. But you could conjure and sell expensive drugs.

​

​

For the world, you can assume that there's a small number of people with equal or greater power than you. Anything clever that relies on being unique won't work, but anything that requires cooperation from a (small) group would. There's an extensive list of ideas I've already thought of in a comment, some more practical than others. I'm particularly interested in ideas that are efficient, that take very little mana to use, but anything is welcome. If there's any "godhood" type exploits lurking unnoticed, I'd love to hear about that as well. I don't think that's the case since this system doesn't have the flexible automation and raw power that godhood exploits usually require... but maybe I've missed something.

Magic spells are powered by mana, which can be produced by meditation. Everyone is born with a randomized potential channel rate (CR) for mana that determine how much they can refine or use per second. The actual CR starts at (almost) zero and increases through practice, asymptotically approaching your potential hardcap. After ~2000 hours of channelling (both refining and using) you'll have reached 90% of your hard cap. The hard cap can't be increased. Surpassing your safe CR while casting will cause splitting headaches if you do it for less than a second and kill you if you do it for longer. Potential CR varies by person, but it's a bell curve centered around 1000v/s (vhis per second).

Mana also comes in two flavors, vim and nix. Vim is associated with creation, nix is associated with destruction. Refined mana can be placed into caches for use later on, but you have to be touching the cache to withdraw mana. Any material works for a cache, but the storage space scales with the density, mass, and purity of the object. Attempting to force too much mana into a cache will cause it to become unstable and eventually explode. If placed in a non-transition metal, mana has a half-life of several minutes. Transition metals have half-lives of several years. You can only infuse bonded matter with one type of mana, and you must be touching the object to be infused.

Spell mana costs are determined by the base cost of the spell multiplied by the path penalty multiplied by the precision penalty. The base cost is determined by the type of spell (energy, force, or matter). Spell can only be case by humans. Animals don't have magic, and there's no way to get a computer to cast spells for you.

Casting a spell requires a path from the cache to the targets. The path can be any shape (not just a straight line). The formula for the penalty is M = 0.1*L2+0.25, where M is the multiplier and L is the path length in meters. This produces 0.25 when the length is 0, 1 when the length is 2.75, and it increases very fast after that. Paths for vim spells crossing through nix-infused matter have to first spend ten times the nix infusion to remove it, and vice versa. So, for example, if you try to path a nix spell through a 1mm thick sheet of metal with 100v of vim per cubic millimeter, and your path is 1mm wide, then you'll have to pay 1000 vhis of nix before you can start casting the spell.

The precision penalty comes from the size of the target. The formula is M = (1*10-10)/(L3) + 1, where M is the multiplier and L is the diameter of the maximum precision that the spell will use. Behavior beneath the precision is randomized, so if you want to conjure a perfectly smooth sheet of metal, it needs to have a really high precision. But if bumps are okay, you might only need 1mm precision. Precision also affects the size of the target --- for example, if you want to target a single molecule. The precision penalty also applies to the path diameter. Only the worst precision penalty will be used, they don't stack.

​

/Branches of magic:/

*Meta:* Metamagic doesn't contain spells but ways to modify the casting of other spells. You can cast multiple spells at once (as long as their total mana requirements don't exceed your channel rate). You can decide how much mana to put into a spell, or cut off the flow mid-cast (this doesn't cause anything bad to happen). You can assign triggers to spells, but the spell WILL occur when the trigger happens, even if it kills you! Each trigger is lost when you stop holding mana or touching a cache (and you have to recast them next time, they don't persist). Additionally, as you spend more time channelling mana you become attuned to it, gaining various abilities.

- 500 hours: you can see instantly see infusions within 32m. Vim is blue, nix is green, and the brightness corresponds to the infusion level, with a 4% margin of error.
- 4000 hours: you can instantly sense channellers within 16m, know their direction, and identify them.
- 7500 hours: you can instantly identify spells that are being cast within 16m, know their targets, and who's casting it.
- 11000 hours: you can instantly sense people who are holding mana (preparing to cast a spell) within 16m, know their direction, and identify them.
- 17000 hours: you can instantly sense the potential and current channel rate of people within 3m, with a 4% margin of error.
- 35000 hours: you can instantly identify spells within 16m, their targets, and their caster as soon as the caster starts thinking about the spell while holding mana.

*Energy:* Energy is the category of spells that allow the manipulation of heat. Vim lets you gather heat from the environment and concentrate it into a target, while nix does the reverse and disperses the heat in an object. Magic does not prevent hot objects from cooling or vice versa, but you can maintain a spell to achieve the same effect (but you'll eventually be unable to make it any hotter because it's losing heat as fast as you pump it in). Each vhi of mana is equal to 24 joules of heat energy concentrated or dispersed. This is enough to boil a 2 liter pot of water in five seconds, or ignite a sheet of paper in 3 milliseconds. It is not enough to melt your way through a solid steel door (the metal will conduct and disperse the heat too fast for you).

*Force:* Force is the category of telekinetic movement spells. A force spell draws energy from the environment and converts it into force, like a muscle except more efficient. To cast a force spell you need two targets, each one will get equal and opposite amounts of force applied to it. You can put the second target anywhere, so if you want to pull a nail out of a board you could put the opposite force against the board or the floor, or yourself. The targets have to be the same size. Each vhi of mana produces 3 newtons of force for one second. This is enough to fly and deflect bullets (handguns, sniper, magic-accelerated) from more than several meters away. It is not enough to pin a healthy, reasonably strong adult against the wall.

*Matter:* Matter is the category of conjuring and vanishing. You can only conjure or vanish homogeneous compounds made from a single molecule. This does include alloys (steel, brass, bronze). Conjured matter can take on any shape, but you have to concentrate or it'll come out messed up. You also need deep understanding of the molecule involved, including the bond length, bond angles, and relative sizes of the atoms, and the crystal lattice it forms. If you don't know anything about chemistry, you won't be able to cast matter spells. Also, simply reading a textbook isn't enough, you have to truly understand it. In other words, matter magic is complicated and requires a lot of study before it's useful for anything. But, it's not impossible, and once you've got the knowledge it's not especially difficult.

The atoms for a matter spell are drawn from the environment around you. The mana required for a matter spell is more complex than the other two categories; it's based on how much energy the old bonds had versus how much energy the new bonds have (but that's an oversimplification). What it means is that you can conjure small things. A kilogram of water will take about three and a half minutes. Vanishing is much more expensive --- to vanish the same amount of water would take twenty minutes.

Conjured matter appears at the target point gradually and will resist motion until the spell is finished. You could lift a car by conjuring metal blocks under its wheels, but if you started a conjuring a foot off the ground and dropped the car on it, the spell would just fail.

Unless they go to the trouble of saturating the glass with nix, and then I just use nix-force spells (I'm guessing that pulls instead of pushing?)

There's loads of ways in which small-scale telekinesis is ridiculously handy without being a big power exploit.

Vim and nix can both be used for telekinesis. It's a break in the theme but I wasn't able to find a meaningful distinction between pushing and pulling (it's just a different point of view).

​

I did think of that, but there's a problem. In the book example, the reason the book falls is because gravity is exerting a force on it. If you can use vim to move the pages, you can also use it to affect the book, which means you can move the book up, against the force of gravity. The logical conclusion is that if you control the power of the spell, you can duplicate any nix effect with vim. This means vim is strictly better than nix and there's no reason to ever use nix for telekinesis, so it might as well not exist.

​

The other thing I considered was changing it from force to kinetic energy. This would make it fit in really nicely with the other two branches (which are both energy based) and there's an obvious division of abilities: vim adds KE, nix removes it. Unfortunately, the math then says that levitating (hovering, not moving) takes zero mana. This is not good, it doesn't make intuitive sense and it's silly overpowered.

*** Stuff I've already thought of:

- Antimagic shields, infuse gas with vim and nix (each particle has a different mana type) and hold it in a layer around you. it'll stop any incoming spells but you'll have to open a hole to cast outside
- Deflection shield, trigger to push anything moving over X meters per second away from you
- Kill unshielded targets by conjuring gas into their brain. or poison. or whatever
- Kill unshielded targets by crushing their insides
- Kill unshielded targets by burning them from the inside
- healing, basically just surgery but more precise. it would take a long time though and it's not "magic", if you get beheaded you're done. might be able to reattach fingers, maybe even limbs, but it wouldn't be guaranteed and would take a lot of work.
- conjure white phosphorus instead of directly igniting something
- Heat doorknobs, weapons, etc
- Partial vanish a section of the floor (if in a multistory building). probably needs preparation though
- Conjure explosives inside the target
- Conjure explosives, period
- Conjure acid to melt through composite materials
- Conjure potassium in water
- Dig a pit by conjuring a solid substance then vanishing it (carbon?)
- Drop something really heavy onto a shielded target
- Hydrogen peroxide bomb
- Conjure something to block a doorway or other narrow passage
- Conjure shackles instead of tk holding someone
- Conjure nitrogen gas to extinguish a fire
- Conjure a cube of diamond then use high-precision vanishing to remove the unwanted pieces. Very, very slow, and harder to do, but you can take breaks.
- Conjure drugs (illegal ones or just medicine)
- Go near a jewelry shop and conjure gold or other precious metals
- Use platinum for a cache (non brittle, non toxic, very high storage capacity), or copper (cheap, but won't hold much mana)
- Weave wires through your clothes and use them as a cache to minimize path penalties
- Copy a mechanical key with conjuration
- Infrasonic sounds
- Sound manipulation
- Conjure things beneath a shielded target
- Destroy a hard drive by conjuring stuff inside it
- "Zombie"
- Torture
- Conjure swords, shields, etc
- Rock artillery (accelerate, stop once it's far away). Or do it with a bullet (but easily deflected).
- Prepare spear shafts then conjure heads into the wood (newbie trick)
- Conjure armor and shields
- Clothesline someone with a rope or a stick
- Garrote
- Contact poison booby trap
- Dust bomb
- Booby traps triggered by enemy's antimagic
- Use magic to create fortifications
- Conjure oxygen to survive a choke (have to be quick and it's hard)
- Spear caches to instakill anyone if the tip pokes through a shield
- Wire caches to shorten paths from the tip to the target
- Sneak wires underground to get close to a stationary opponent, or to fortify a building

Faster-than-light? Apply the usual faster-than-light munchkins.

  Attempting to force too much mana into a cache will cause it to become unstable and eventually explode.
#+end_quote

How strong is this explosion? Is it more cost-effective than just conjuring explosives? Can you roughly set how long it will take before it explodes? Because that can be more useful than directly conjuring explosives which don't have set delays.

  The atoms for a matter spell are drawn from the environment around you.

What!? That sounds incredibly overpowered. So suppose you get in a pool of pure water (H2O), and you conjure hydrogen. Does that pull the hydrogen atoms out of the water, leaving behind free unbound O?

I can't even imagine all the mayhem you could cause with more complex molecules. If you get in a tub of alcohol (CH3CH2OH) and pull the oxygen atoms off, what happens to the remainder of the molecule? Does it immediately recombine into ethane (CH3CH3)? Because the O is kind of connecting the CH3CH2 to the H, so wouldn't you end up with some strange CH3CH2 molecule instead? Also what happens to the electrons? Does the H that fell off get its electron back? Did the oxygen or the CH3CH2 steal it? Could you create large molecules with massively negative or positive charges by selectively stealing electrons from them?

By removing select atoms from complex molecules in this manner, you could probably create all kinds of all new chemicals, some possibly reactive enough to put chlorine trifluoride to shame.

The cache explosion is just the usage of all its mana for a random spell effect. Conjuring a bomb is probably more cost effective but cache grenades could still be useful. You can't set how long it'll explode, it just goes off at random or when jarred like, well, a really unstable explosive.

I'm not familiar with this, can you point me to some reading or explain it? The FTL only applies in a short range and it's only for limited kinds of information, and it's still bounded by how fast you can react to the information.

Yeah. But wouldn't the oxygen just combine with itself?

​

#+end_quote

The remainder of the molecule is unaffected by magic. So you'd have CH3CH2 plus an H. The oxygen would take its electrons with it. The H probably wouldn't get its electron back. But wouldn't it just recombine naturally? Or break down?

​

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, though it probably wouldn't be quick or easy. But, as the spell was working and stealing atoms (and their electrons), wouldn't the remaining molecule bits react on their own and form new, stable molecules? For the water, that would mean lonely H atoms reacting with all the O atoms in the air or with each other and bubbling up and away as H2. You would never end up with a massively charged molecule for the same reasons you don't see massive charges in real life.

​

Keep in mind, it's not like you can instantly suck all the oxygen out of the swimming pool. A swimming pool has around 400000 liters, which would take 26 hours to conjure all the oxygen out of. That's plenty of time for natural reactions to happen.

Can't triggers be used instead of having to react? Thanks to relativity, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone][Faster-than-light means time travel.]]

In this case, you could set up two spells 10m apart: the first conjures iron and is triggered by detecting a spell conjuring copper (you have the ability to do this at 7500 hours). The second conjures copper and is triggered by detecting a spell conjuring gold. Stand next to the iron spell and start conjuring gold. The 10m away copper spell will be triggered by your gold conjuration, and cause the iron spell next to you to also trigger. But since the magic happens faster-than-light, the iron spell next to you will actually trigger BEFORE you started your gold conjuration.

Now, since the distance is short, it will be only a very small amount of time in the past, way less than a second. But that just means you need more triggers or recursion. For example, you could make the first spell conjure gold instead of iron. That forms a loop where the spells will keep triggering each other backwards in time, effectively allowing you to send information to the past as far back as you can maintain the two spells.

Edit: I think I scienced the above wrong. Refer to the wiki article instead, I'm bad at physics.

Now you can apply the standard time-travel munchkins. E.g. precommit to executing some plan, set up the two spells above, and then execute the plan. If the plan fails at some point in the future, conjure gold, causing the two spells you have been maintaining to instantly trigger each other backwards in time until the moment you first set up the two spells, letting you know at that point in the past that your plan won't work. Now you can come up with a different plan.

Yes but they won't recombine to make the same molecules since some of the atoms are now missing. So you could create all kinds of exciting new chemicals that have never been made before. And given your ability to steal atoms without caring about entropy or thermodynamics, the resulting chemicals could be extremely reactive, to the point where you would need to magnetically suspend them in a vacuum so they can't get in contact with any air or other material that they could react with.

That's... interesting. I read the article, but I don't really understand most of what it says except in very general terms. However, it sounds like if the information isn't FTL then this problem goes away. Right?

This sounds an awful lot like particle accelerators making antimatter and whatnot: really useful for science, but not so important for real-world use. Unfortunately, I have no idea what "exciting new chemicals" might be possible, and it seems like the only way to figure that out would be to learn actual chemistry. Any suggestions for how I might cheat my way out?

​

I guess one possibility would be to leave it open and just have "reverse conjuring" be an exciting field of research, like how nanotech is an exciting field of research in the real world.

This already was the way to cheat your way out, since it is far easier to create complex molecules by stealing atoms from them rather than gaining the in-depth knowledge needed to directly conjure them. I'm not sure you can cheat further.

Another thing you can try to exploit is range. Seeing you gave examples of conjuring steel and bronze, the atoms in them had to come from somewhere. Unless steel conjurers walk around with bars of iron, I'm guessing the atom theft aspect is actually extremely long ranged. This gives you a method to kill/hurt/destroy things from far away, by conjuring rare atoms that compose the target but aren't commonly found in your environment.
