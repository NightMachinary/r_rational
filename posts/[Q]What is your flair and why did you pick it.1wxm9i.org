This isn't strictly related to rational fiction, but I'm constantly wondering about people's flairs and this would be the easiest way to find out what they mean.


** My flair is based on Anathem, by Neal Stephenson (which probably barely misses the mark for being rationalist fiction). In the universe of Anathem, the people who do science live secluded in buildings resembling monasteries (called concents). The important monk-scientists are called Saunts (similar to religious Saints) and the really important ones have concents named after them. I picked this particular concent because I didn't feel like picking the one the main character is from or the one that studies combat and warfare.

I chose to represent Anathem because Neil Stephenson is probably my favorite author and Anathem is one of those books where you want to live inside its universe. The idea of being grouped together with a bunch of people who are really interested in knowing more things and being intelligent was really appealing when I read it. (It still is, but things got better after reading HPMOR.)

*** Similarly, the Procians are a school of thought in the Anathem universe. The prime ideological conflict in the book is the Procian vs Halikaarnian split, which basically boils down to whether you believe that platonic objects/concepts "exist" or not (for an underspecified definition of the word "exist").

The Procians get rather (unfairly, in my mind) vilified in the book, and portrayed as less interested in truth and more interested in the appearance of truth (which, pretty funnily, makes them better ambassadors to the world outside the concents :P).

So if I had to pick my position here, I'd probably have to /lean/ towards not seeing the necessity of platonic forms to exist - they're collections of structure that we stumble upon when trying to make predictions about the world, but the map is not the territory - but this isn't a super strong belief or anything. I pretty much picked my flair pretty just to be contrary :P

/uh I mean/ - I picked my flair to impress upon everyone the importance of /not/ vilifying ideological opponents. Yea. That's totally it.

I may be falling to an anthropomorphic bias, but this argument, while reasonable, does not consider controlled modification. This may be because finding subtle mistakes requires the equivalence to murder by most means we can think up.

I definitely hope we do keep the powerful trans-humanists friendly, but that's usually nothing more than an adequate set of ethics.

[TL:DR the three laws on a "FAI" would be an existential risk to humanity] Three laws are an existential risk, and as much as the movie /Irobot/ perverted the title of a personally much beloved collection of short stories, I'm glad the implied zeroth law got some public exposure.

/Zeroith law of robotics: A robot by it's action or inaction cannot allow humanity to come to harm. (1st, 2nd and 3rd laws are revised to add except where this would contravene the zeroth law.)/

You can find better treatment of three law deficiencies in some of the foundation novels (I'm sorry but I forget which ones) where human is defined as only /homo sapiens/ with a particular characteristic, and another where a robot derives the zeroth law as a necessary superior corollary to the first law, and thus justifiable homicide for humanities good.

My point is that the seemingly idealistic three(+0) laws are far too vulnerable to redefining the terms: "human," "harm," ("humanity,) and "obey."

[edit on topic reply, apologies, but three laws make me shiver] Uncontrolled modification yes, but I saw no inference or instance of the scope growth, that made one optimalverse story interesting, and will get me buying theater tickets for /Transcendence/

They were some of my early posts on reddit, just when I was starting out, so I really put my all into each of them but wasn't really sure exactly how they might be received. So when I saw that not only were my postings well received but Yudkowsky [[/http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/13okoq/determining_the_mechanisms_behind_apparation/c76e83s][commented]] approving on one of them /and/ I had acquired this new title in recognition of my efforts.

I had never looked into "flair" besides choosing to join Dragon Army and hadn't really looked any further than that. Even after I learned how to make custom flair, granting me a near infinite number of possibilities [[[/http://xkcd.com/285/][CITATION NEEDED]]], I could not help but retain it. That title now fundamentally represented my ability to attain things with a skill and quality that distinguished me from the people around me.

And I freaking /loved/ that.

So that is while never really got around to choosing flair all that much, that is the reason I have seen fit to retain and reiterate it and plan on doing so now and into the future.
