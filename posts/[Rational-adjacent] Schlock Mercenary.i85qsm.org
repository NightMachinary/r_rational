** As it just completed, I would like to recommend the (very) long-running webcomic space opera /Schlock Mercenary./ As a strip-a-day webcomic, it's perhaps not perfectly rational, but it is internally consistent and concerned with ideas the [[/r/rational]] community is interested in. (Among them, strong AI, transhumanism, alien-human relationships, simulated afterlives, and so much more.) It has been at times, funny, clever, dramatic, lighthearted, tearjerking, and awe-inspiring, and I cannot recommend it enough.

*** Seconding! I've been reading it since the year of it's release and this is a story worth looking at. In addition to the above it had some plot points delivering looks at civilations in deep time and how low probability existential risks can become certainties given a large enough sampling size. There's also a few (at least three off the top of my head) plots illustrating multi-polar coordination traps AKA Moloch.

*** I've been reading it since it the very beginning, and I second all of this. It's very good. You have to allow for art evolution, but the writing is consistently strong and the subject matter fits very well.

** At 6PM PST every day I still reflexively check for the next update for this comic; not surprising given that I've been reading it my entire adult life and then some.

*** I know, right? It's a little weird that there's no more...

** Huh, Schlock Mercenary actually finished? That's crazy. I stopped reading around book 19 because I realized I wasn't enjoying the story as much anymore, and the last book I actually liked was 13.

I'll probably chug through it to get to the end and I hope it improves my opinion of the last third of its run but I kind of doubt it will.

*** Yeah the whole immortality filter and Fermi paradox approach with the missing Ancients was underwhelming, and TBH the ending was a bit on the 'meh' side. there still are some very enjoyable arcs in the latter books IMO - like the diversification of the Gavs and its hijacking. I would have liked that the artificial nature of the dark matter entities which was implied at some point led to something other than their simply being able to regenerate after being scattered.

IMO the best, truly satisfying ending to a long-running webcomics was that of [[http://starslip.chainsawsuit.com/][Starslip]].
