Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** "I - no," he says. "I am not a Power."

He considers how to explain, then produces one of his incomprehensible objects. It is a short stick; now it is a short stick which glows at one end. Glow. No glow. Glow. No glow. The difference between these states is accomplished by pushing on the end opposite the glowing end.

"A... thing, made by people," he says of this minor miracle, in his rapidly improving Quenya.

"You cover and uncover the light source?"

"No... almost." Glow. "Now it is a light source." No glow. "Now it is not."

 

That didn't make sense. Celegorm knew how to make gemstones that didn't merely refract light but created it, bright enough to read by. There were some that stopped working if you broke them, and there were some that crumbled into smaller glowing gemstones, depending how you'd married the stone and its new purpose. None of them lit on demand.

 

"How did you make it?"

"I did not make it. Other Men made it."

"How did they make it?"

He frowns in thought, then puts that object away and gets out another one, which also glows but in writing-like patterns on a flat pane. After manipulating this display for a few seconds, clumsily with his armoured fingers, he concludes: "I don't know."

 

Perhaps Miles isn't a scholar. This makes him instantly jump in Celegorm's esteem.

Though even Celegorm could explain how to make every thing the Eldar have achieved short of the Silmarils or AlqualondÃ«'s swanships. Or some of the obscure mathematics, possibly. He wants to take the light pen and see if he can identify the alloys on closer inspection, but it must be valuable beyond measure. Better to let Curufin be the one to demand that.

"Who was the creator?"

 

...Miles considers this question for another few seconds, then repeats, "I don't know," in a tone that suggests he is dissatisfied with the completeness of this response but can't do any better under the current linguistic conditions.

 

"In our people, to create a thing that enhances the world, or the joy of its inhabitants, is a great good. Everyone will know your name, and desire to study under you, and there'll be festivals, and they'll start thinking of you as collective property and crushing you under the weight of their demands for narrative perfection as well as engineering perfection until you're isolated, paranoid, and beloved by all."

 

That had started off in simple enough language that Miles was supposed to understand it, but he'd lost the thread of his thought somewhere through the sentence. A few of their cautiously circling guard stared at him.

1. Main character falls into another universe (or sees through the masquerade) and has first contact with the locals.
2. Long, slow build-up of personal relationships. Long, slow experimentation with local magic system(s).
3. A horrifying problem rears its head. Drama happens.
4. The problem is swiftly dispatched by the characters' now considerable magical power.
5. Crossover with the rest of the continuity!
6. Long, slow conversation so that both sides are caught up with everything about all known universes, that you the reader already know about.
7. Magical tea parties on the moon.

1 is like crack to me, and 5 is similar enough. 3 tends to give emotional whiplash; they don't hold back with how badly some characters get hurt. It's a GRRM kind of fun. 4 is wish-fulfilment sugar. The rest I could do without, though by now it has grown on me some.

** So I have been feeling pretty indifferent lately.

Is there anyone here who likes watching anime, manga, comics etc.? If you do then thank you.

I was just thinking about all those death battles, versus debates where people pit a character from one world against another from another world. Like, Naruto versus Ichigo, for instance. As a matter of fact I do love those kinds of debates because those are quite fun.

However, recently an idea has been bugging me that makes me wonder if it's even possible to get accurate comparisons between the characters on such basic categories like speed, reaction time, stamina, durability etcetera.

The problem is that, for instance in Bleach we have Author Canon that Ichigo in the beginning Soul Society Arc after attaining his base Bankai i.e his main (and only) powerup was capable and going up against his enemy a Soul Reaper Captain at the insane +speed+ velocity of multiple lightning bolts.

But then again, if that were really true you would expect the surrounding area to be constantly being updated with thunderclaps (as is natural in an Earth like environment), the intense friction superheating the air to plasma levels and thus marking his path with waves of glowing hot plasma. Since he was moving almost constantly in and around Byakuya's surrounding area you would expect those constant movement to be creating shockwaves, thunderclaps and most importantly the plasma with which Byakuya could have very easily noticed his movements.

Yet this isn't what happens. Instead, we get shown that Ichigo just flickers from one point to another like an afterimage with barely any sound, barely any breeze, barely any craters on the ground, etc. (no thunderclaps, no shockwaves, no plasma). And then he stops and a small gust of wind breezes through flaring his cloak around his person.

What can we expect from that type of physics? I know that that shows that his world is quite, *quite* different from ours in every way possible and that the similarities are just cosmetic. Purely cosmetic indeed.

If he tried that maneuver in our world, Universe, Earth the effects on his surroundings would be drastically different right?

So how does him being a Lightning Timer (in that period of time) in the Bleachverse which is operating on quite different physics reliably scale as being a Lightning Timer in OUR IRL world? And the same goes for the Narutoverse which has shown that it has pretty much the same thing i.e it too has entirely different physics compared to our default IRL version.

So my question is how the flying f can we even try to equate Naruto (Lightning Timer version) with Ichigo (Lightning Timer version) as if they both are characters whose movements in OUR IRL world's Earth will always almost entirely cause the same sort of physical effects on the immediate surroundings (even assuming both have the same mass for approximation purposes)?

The same thing goes for every other world we see in our daily fiction. Clearly, Marvel and DC have quite different physics so it's almost moot to discuss how a character relates to another character even if they both are continent busters.

Because the base standard isn't standard at all! To make a standard version for the purposes of accurate versus debates, we will have to extrapolate and analyse how exactly Fictional World A Physics (and Meta Physics) scale with our own IRL Physics and Meta Physics.

Am I wrong in thinking this?

*** I don't think you need to go so deep into things to get a (relative) satisfactory answer. Rather than look at the results of seemingly-divergent physics and assume the foundations must be different, why not look at what is already different and assume the divergence must come from there? The already-present difference in physics for Bleach is reiryoku, and in Naruto, chakra. It's reasonable, then, to assume any strange happenings in those universes are more a result of this additional particle/energy/law interacting with "baseline" physics, rather than a completely new set of laws.

It may not help much with trying to compare between different universes since you can still only get approximations of what a "lightning-fast" move actually means when chakra/reiryoku/etc is messing around with things, but it can still help when the feats are more grounded in reality, like bullet-dodging comparisons and such. [[/r/whowouldwin]] has a lot of posts about this kind of thing, if you're interested.

**** Thank you for commenting.

My main problem with such scenarios is that people always do blatantly illogical things like say: Taking Ichigo's feats in HIS Universe as evidence for him being a Lightning Timer and taking Naruto's feats in HIS Universe as evidence of him being a Lightning Timer AND THEN THEY PROCEED TO put them together in the same category of speed by saying they are both Lightning Timers! In our World even!

But the true fact is that that is totally wrong! That Ichigo is a Lightning Timer in HIS world (and that's up for debate too since OBVIOUSLY we can't equate their world's physics with ours because they are fundamentally different) and that Naruto is a Lightning Timer in HIS world!

That's the basic gist of it.

Edit: How the hell can an author expect us to equate Ichigo as a Lightning Timer with regards to our World's Quantum Mechanics when there world's are fundamentally different already? He's (past version) a Lightning Timer in HIS world. That's the ONLY fact we can say is consistent with the Bleachverse physics. Nothing more nothing less. And the same is true for Naruto in his Universe.

And now we can't even hope to compare the two's speeds because they are operating in entirely different realities where physics is fundamentally different between there worlds. Trying to analyse and standardise their energy also doesn't work since they are too inconsistent.

***** Yeah, but I mean, that's true of any series that isn't overly rigorous in defining how their magic works. People who write crossover works or versus matches have always had to use first order approximations or thereabouts to compare feats, which can sometimes fall apart when the authors of those original works are inconsistent with internal mechanisms of the story.

While it may be more accurate to throw up your hands and say "there's too much weird shit going on to compare the speeds of Ichigo and Naruto", that's utimately not a very meaningful answer. So even if it doesn't hold up to any kind of rigorous scrutiny, comparing the two is what we do.

** So I somewhat recently read a Worm fanfic (Thaumaturgic Awakening) that explained Skitters abilities a little differently. Basically, she couldn't do multiple human-level tasks (like reading) concurrently because there was only one mind in the hivemind capable of such things and in order for her to do otherwise, her shard would have to make a duplicate of her consciousness into every bug under her control.

â

So my problem lies in the fact that I was trying to develop a magic system where something like Skitter's abilities was a potential emergent property but if making millions of copies of your consciousness is possible, there are some pretty absurd alternate, unintended byproducts of that. I came up with some ways to get multitasking but on a lower scale (dozens of threads instead of millions), but I'm left with all sorts of questions as to how hiveminds would actually work and how much of what skitter does actually requires human intelligence distributed through every single bug.

â

Like, let's take weaving spider silk into rope, would you need to control each individually, or is arachnid intelligence combined with them having access to what you're visualizing enough for them to handle it with only minor supervision. What about making a bug clone? If we're going the hivemind route, each bug might know what a human looks like (roughly) either by themselves or by piggybacking on your memory, but I suspect properly animating it would still require at least one human consciousness. Do you think a collection of insects with their minds linked might be capable of some sort of more-than-the-sum-of-their-parts cognitive abilities?

*** I wonder about this a lot as well. The Tines from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep][A Fire Upon The Deep]] are my favorite fictional example. They have 4-8 bodies that communicate with each other hypersonically. True consciousness requires four, but more than eight isn't doable because there isn't enough bandwidth in sound for the mind fragments to remain in communication. If you want your hivemind to have a size cap, maybe it could be something similar? It could be something like addressing: only 1024 currently linked insects to a hive mind.

#+end_quote

I imagine it would require individual control, especially at first. But animals can be trained. To me the process looks like this:

1. Skitter minutely controls the spiders to make them do a simple weave. Each is moved individually and slowly.
2. The spiders individually learn the movements with their tiny brains and become capable of repeating them with a nudge.
3. Skitter optimizes the timing and movements until she can subconsciously perform all the nudges.
4. Skitter has generalized how to do certain things and can teach new spiders the movements rapidly in the future.

Real life humans do something very similar with muscle memory and subconscious actions. Consider video game controllers:

1. At first the human must carefully control each finger individually to press buttons.
2. After practice the movements become entirely automatic--a part of the human's brain has learned the task and offloaded the effort from conscious attention.
3. The human can now focus on playing the game optimally and can forget about the controller.
4. Having learned it, the human can pick up basically any controller and rapidly adapt to it.

It's a bit different because Skitter has to overwrite the old habits into new bugs all the time.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It depends. If you mean normal Earth insects, I'd say no--consciousness doesn't arise just because you have enough power. But it's absolutely possible to have nonlocalized intelligence! Octopi are that way already with their individual arm-brains, but surprisingly so are birds with their neural clusters. Mammals have sheets of neurons in the brain, but birds have interconnected nodes. [[https://www.quora.com/How-do-the-different-brain-structures-of-birds-and-mammals-affect-their-cognition-and-behavior][Link]]. Gram-for-gram, the clustered version seems much more powerful.

If nothing else, you could have pseudo-spiders with normal insect brains and a tiny amount of extra processing that can gather into a consciousness. It's important to keep in mind that more processing power doesn't /guarantee/ consciousness... but cells produce thoughts /somehow/ so we know it's possible for many to become one.

**** This was really helpful, the analogy to muscle memory when playing video games especially resonated with me since I've been playing fighting games for about a decade now.

I still wonder if consciousness is even necessary for human-level tasks. I'm, probably incorrectly, relating this to computer science, where words are like variables/objects stored in memory connected to data and any bug in the hive could access this memory and reading is more like a method call that requires the prerequisite hardware to run it (a human brain, of which there is only one). But, would human intelligence or consciousness (boy is this word a can of worms) be necessary for reading comprehension? I think part of the difficulty here is that I've never encountered anything that explored the results of brain-to-brain communication between human and sub-human intelligences.

Thanks again, I just wanted to make sure Skitter-esque feats would be possible with less exploitable and hard to write multitasking abilities. I worried something dangerously close to super-intelligence would result from millions of human minds being able to seamlessly communicate, coordinate, and amass information at the speed of thought. You're explanations make it seem like you could probably get by with relatively few threads of consciousness and still manage to do basically everything Skitter does.

Leave out 'speed of thought' part and that's basically a description of the Internet.

A hivemind made of an arbitrarily large number of average-human minds is going to have a capped level of intelligence - smarter than a single average-human mind (because they can effectively take more thinking-about-things time in the same amount of clock-time), but we're talking average-human-with-arbitrary-time-to-think-about-things smart, and not super-human smart.

*** I think Canon has it that her consciousness doesn't stay with the bugs at all, rather her passenger temporarily overwrites the bugs' instincts to go along with her desires. Similarly she doesn't move her consciousness to a particular bug, she just has an extra set of senses that copy what the bugs are experiencing and she can focus in and out of various parts like most people can with their hearing.

The few times she exercises fine control what is actually happening is that she's continually overwriting the bug's instincts to take very specific actions.

We don't have to go down that route though since shards are BS that can do anything. But that's the question, what is the shard doing? And it appears it allows multitasking, which if we are to use a computer analogy, you can't run two threads (thought processes) concurrently on a single CPU (a brain) but you can with 2 CPU's, so the shard is probably simulating copies of her brain to handle tasks simultaneously. You could potentially get similar results by uploading a copy of her mind into a sped up simulation of reality and control the bugs based on all choices she could conceivably make, but I think that's a bit more ridiculous.

**** Masochism. Or, if you're planning on debating with someone who has those beliefs, it's good to see what it's like in the trenches. But I'd guess it's mostly just morbid curiousity.

******* This is a joke implying that the people who hold Red_Pill-esque beliefs have no brains, and therefore should be referred to using pronouns for inanimate objects. Your "mistake", then, was using "who" instead of "that" when talking about a hypothetical redpiller.

You give me too much credit. I wasn't trying to say anything about red pill people at all. [[/u/Robert_Barlow]] originally used "that" instead of "who" but edited his comment to fix it.

Note that he ended his comment with an ellipsis, which probably implies that it was meant to be read as sarcastic or sheepish or something. I have no idea what specific tone was intended because the written word lacks inflection and emphasis and all that, but I assume the ellipsis was supposed to be a substitute for all that and indicate that the words weren't meant to be taken literally. Maybe. It'd be pretty silly to pretend not to have made an error when reddit shows that the comment was edited an hour after an error was pointed out.
