** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27769449][She folded her arms, and I noticed she was wearing a different shirt from the night before, this one with “Boning by the Bay” written on it. I was partially successful in suppressing a giggle.]]

I had to draw this as soon as I read it.

** I guess I just pictured Amaryllis with a much larger build. She seems sort of slight for the bad ass armor-wearing sword swinging future Queen.

**** I pictured her as having Korra's build from the eponymous "Avatar: Legend of" series. Lean, well-muscled, every lesbian's dream.

*** Well, it's my interpretation based on the descriptions of her in the story, so I guess it's as good as any other. :p

***** This is true, but the story definitely treated it more with respect to harem tropes rather than actual poly relationships. And did a good job of dealing with it without being unfair to the idea of poly relationships in general - just to relationships among these characters in particular.

Edit: correcting wording, I mean that the text does not support the idea of relationships among these various characters and Joon, except for the obvious exception.
