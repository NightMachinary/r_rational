I do not fully understand if this type of post is allowed, feel free to delete if not..

I loved MoL by Jack Voraces, do you know of any other good rational audio books?


** [[https://hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]

[[https://hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1705][The Metropolitan Man -- by Alexander Wales]]

[[https://hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1096][Other Rational audio readings]] (Three worlds collide is weird but good)

[[https://sscpodcast.libsyn.com/classic-the-goddess-of-everything-else][The Goddess of Everything Else]] (rational-ish mythology)

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxXwiMTYPCo][The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant - Prof. Nick Bostrom]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXwg-6PLXIWYlG8Z_N4evqWezQ_LIGwVf][Friendship is Optimal]] (reality doesn't grade on a curve)

Im sure there is more. But it is a rather new 'genre', and rather hard to write (and even more difficult to write well)

** If you're willing to pay for a commercial audiobook, I'd recommend [[https://www.google.com/search?q=automatic+reload+ferrett+steinmetz+audiobook][Automatic Reload by Ferrett Steinmetz]].

** There's a free audio-version of /Unsong/ which is a fantastic story.
