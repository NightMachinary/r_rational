[[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/mage_world/chapter_007.html][Chapter 7]] of The Tinker's Daughter is available for browsing, and the '[[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/mage_world/full.html][full]]' file (the one-page compilation of the book to date) is up to date.

Quick recap and book blurb:

/The Tinker's Daughter/ is a rationalist hard fantasy story in which magic is powered by mana that you get when worldlines are cut off -- either by a decision, a death, etc. There are multiple kinds of magic users, and one of them is the tinker, the mages who create magical machinery ("mechs"), including golems. Peter Tinkersmith created the very first self-aware golem...and was then murdered for it. His children (Jess, his biological daughter, and Rob, the self-aware golem) escaped. Today, still wanted by his killers, they survive as professional gamblers, betting on Rob's success in robot pit-fighting. +If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...The Tinker's Children.+

Last chapter they were forced to out Rob's secret to two people. They also made strides towards locating their father's killer, which they will follow up on in today's installment.


** Interesting chapter, but won't the fact that she left the driver mechs there be an issue? Both because they can be tracked to the company that manufactured them and then to the ones they were sold to, and because the company requesting the repairs will notice 2 of them missing when they put the factory line back together.

Not only, but the work she did on the alarmed door, bypassing it like that, is something that probably very few people in the whole city are able to do, so that could be an issue as well.

In addition, she scribbled down the 3 names she read, right? Where did she put the paper? Was it in the jacket that she left behind? Did she close and put away the document where she read the 3 names? If not, then that could be easily traced back to her.

Did the jacket have other things in it that could be traced to her?

The notepad in her rucksack didn't have anything that could be traced to her? Was it a new one, bought specifically for this?

Last but not least, could you please take a look at the tool you're using to make the .epub? THe issue of there being 2 copies of each chapter within it (1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7) has been going since the first one, and still hasn't been fixed.

EDIT: it could be interesting if you also went the HPMOR way: put the character in a difficult situation, make a full list of everything (s)he has to work with then leave it open ended to allow for a challenge post, where you allow everyone to submit solutions to the character's situation.

They are generic mechs used by a lot of companies but yes, they are distinctive. I don't think most tinkers put serial numbers on their work or that there's a central registry, so it would require a lot of legwork to trace them back to her, but it is possible.

Jess is smart, but she's sixteen; sometimes she's not as smart as she thinks she is.

Yep, the work she did was very clearly done by a tinker and a moderately skilled one. It's low-journeyman level work; most apprentices couldn't do it, but you certainly don't need a Master or above. Then again, any criminal that wants to be able to break into things will have studied these skills. It narrows the field a lot, but it's not a direct pointer.

She put it in her pants pocket, so she still has it.

It had her callbox. (Essentially her cell phone.)

Yes.

I hadn't realized that was happening. I'll look into it; thanks for the heads up.

Interesting idea, thank you.

*** Followup thought -- it says just how valuable the epubs aren't when they've been being published for months and you are the first person who's told me there's a problem. I wonder if anyone actually reads them?

****** Good idea.

The .epub is available only to Patrons, right?

******* Correct, only for patrons.

Have you tried the mobi or other formats?

******** Verified now. PDF is fine, mobi has the same problem as epub. It seems the issue is within the table of contents, or in the general structure of the file. The Viewer sees two of each chapters, so it presents each of them twice to the reader.

**** I actually don't see that issue with the epub file... Depends on the epub reader used? I use iBooks on my laptop and use a Kobo ereader. Both show the chapters fine without any duplicated chapters. There's a few strange things though, Kobo doesn't recognize the Title (iBooks does however) and there are duplicated chapter links in the table of content on Kobo (not on iBooks) but they all point to the same chapter (the second links point to the second page of each chapter).
