*Spoilers for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and associated sequels, spin-offs, etc.*

/Congratulations! You've just won the Mandalorian Wars and ended the greatest threat to the stability of the galaxy since Exar Kun!/

/But wait, what's this? The Mandalorians weren't just blood-thirsty warmongers itching for a fight? Mandalore the Ultimate was under the control of a hidden Sith Empire? And the Emperor's on his way to stir things up? Your assassination attempt failed? You've been sent back to make the galaxy ready for the Emperor's arrival?/

/But wait, what's this? Upon returning to the galaxy you were able to break free from the Emperor's control? And now you want to make the galaxy better able to fight the vastly superior Sith Empire ASAP?/

/What ever shall you do?/

If you're not terribly familiar with the Star Wars universe or The Old Republic era in specific, this is roughly the scenario which faced the Jedi Revan after he broke with the Jedi Council to intervene in the Mandalorian Wars.

In canon he plays along with the role of converted and conquering Dark Lord of the Sith despite breaking free of the Emperor's control and treats the Galaxy with some tough love in order to whip it into shape to fight the Emperor when he gets there.

Things get squirrely when he's betrayed by his apprentice who doesn't quite get the "pretending" part of "pretending to be Dark Lords of the Sith" and he ends up getting memory wiped by the Jedi Council and pitted against his former apprentice in a bid to stop the imminent conquest, since the Council has no idea of the threat of the Emperor. If you want to play hard mode, maybe pick up things from that point instead.

*Assets:*

- The Revanchists: A breakaway faction of Jedi Knights who followed Revan into the Mandalorian Wars, serving as Generals and strike troops alongside Republic regulars
- The Star Forge: Massive orbital space station which is able to construct ships, droids, and other material by siphoning energy from a star which is then directed by a force user of sufficient strength, though it will tend to corrupt and darken the user
- The Republic: Although battered, the Republic army has a tremendous amount of gratitude and loyalty towards Revan and the Revanchists. Enough that when Revan declared his war in canon, the defectors were able to man the Star Forge produced ships and weaponry to fight the Republic loyalists on more than even ground.

*Obstacles:*

- Malak: Your apprentice who commands loyalty and respect among the troops second only to yourself and has eyes on conquering the galaxy, whether he has to overthrow you first or not
- The Jedi Council: Although the Revanchists and the Republic troops who fought with you are very loyal to you, the Council has huge influence over the Jedi who remained neutral in the Mandalorian Wars as well as the civilian Republic government. They've labelled you a traitor to the Order and demanded you submit yourself to them for judgment.
- The Emperor: For our purposes, the Emperor will be arriving in ~300 years. Enough time that say, a reformed Galactic government would be stabilized if you got it in place early enough, but not so long that you're likely to stomp out all resistance and dissent; or for significant technological breakthroughs to be adopted throughout the Core Worlds, but probably not throughout the Outer Rim.

If there are any other assets/obstacles that you're familiar with in canon, or which plausibly must be considered, feel free to utilize or deal with them as you see fit.


** I go all religious schism, Buddhism-style. Yes, the Force is real and certain precautions must be taken when using it. But there is no requirement in the nature of reality for a single unified religious order.

I'll take my cause to the people, many of whom are already on my side, claiming the jedi are good people but the Jedi Order itself is engaged in active and deadly religious persecution. Their intolerance of any other group of Force-sensitives is a threat to galactic peace itself. I also question why they don't want a strong centralized military, given that their order is the only other major armed force in the Republic.

That all this is literally true, and the jedi know it, helps my case. A lot. As does the fact that I'm a cute, 5-foot-nothing red-headed war hero. What, isn't everyone's Revan?

In addition to rolling up my own sect patterned on a looser Jedi Order for those Force-sensitive masses still requiring their opiates on the rocks, I start my own public, secular training centers for Force-sensitives, with blackjack and hookers, and parent-teacher nights on every third Saturday. Both are run in accordance with the latest in medical and scientific knowledge of how the Force /actually works/ and how it physically and psychologically affects people. If there is some "ancient wisdom" that works, I use it, even if I don't know /why/ it works. Yet. It's super effective.

Then, while everyone is running around playing political games, I drop the bomb on Republic higher ups and show off all the stuff the Sith gave me to conquer the galaxy, telling the story of how I barely escaped their control. I hint this was made harder because the Order doesn't prepare people to actually fight against Sith, because of flaws in their training and basic philosophy. That this is literally true helps my case. This wins enough of the politicos to my side to matter.

I've already told Malak my plans. His task is to run the volunteer militia arm of Force-sensitives from my training centers while I run the Star Forge. He also gets the best psychological help the Republic has to offer. It works, because "evil" isn't an attribute people have in rational stories.

While he gets more sane, I make sure he understands that if he wants to run for a galactic senate position, even using...immoral and illegal means, I'll back him. The same for his inevitable political run at the whole shebang. With my status as a war hero and religious icon, this should be easy.

I keep him far, far away from the Forge, where I'm making unmanned drone fighters and bombers and the carriers task groups to run them. As few people as possible in my fleets to be affected by the Sith's own battle meditation techniques.

As this is a rational story, I intelligently manage my "going evil" with constant counseling, drugs, and medical monitoring. Since I don't literally "go evil" from using it, it is clearly just an imbalance of my brain chemistry causing me to think megalomaniac plans are a good idea. I'll baseline myself and my plans, and not allow myself to commit to anything without taking a long rest period after my last Star Forge session. I also offer to keep a jedi on hand to tell me if I'm going "dark". If my psychologist and the jedi agree on anything, I fucking listen.

If Malak betrays me somehow, I kill him with the bomb I implanted in his brain. Because /of course I did/.

By the time the Sith show up, the better armed and consolidated Republic is ready, and Forceology (as it has cringingly come to be known) is 300 years old. Jedi mostly stick to their temples, as they aren't needed to ensure peace or whatever garbage they were selling before. The /people themselves/ ensure their own peace. We win a bloody war -- though not that bloody, as most of our frontline soldiers are droids and people with absurd luck.

Malak is either still around secretly running shit, or /someone/ blew up his head because he was getting too crazy.

I am, of course, really good at not dying. Let's just say I never "lose the will to live". Whether through the Force, cybernetics, or just moving into a droid body, I'm still around. When 300 years old you reach, look as cute you will not. That's for fucking sure.

*** Don't forget to track down and recruit Kreia, I'm fairly certain she would approve of most of this and she'd be extremely useful.

**** If the Jedi Order does nothing violent to oppose me, they lose even more of those proactive jedi who can't stand to sit idly by. They grow even more passive and I win.

If they do try to...oh, say assassinate me or kidnap and mindwipe me, they will fail. The force is still with me, after all, as I'm not overreaching and trying to directly destroy either the Jedi Order or the Republic. I make their fumbling attempts public, losing them their moral high ground in the public and their own members' eyes. And then they splinter, hard. I pick up the pieces and win.

I see jedi like Kreia leaving fast in either case.

** Open up communications with the highest levels of the Jedi Order, explain where I'm coming from and that we're secretly on the same side.

Incapacitate Malak. Probably the best thing to use would be that mind-wiping thing. He's Dark, so presumably not too good a precog; short-term spidey-sense is one thing, but the risk of a full-blown vision is pretty much impossible to work around when designing a trap. Still, the Force is on my side, right?

Use the Star Forge to build robot miners and engineers, with attached security force and a few ships. Send them to an uninhabitable planet (Droids don't need to breathe and can endure extreme temperatures); have them make more until they have enough to colonize another planet. Exponential growth will make me the most powerful faction pretty quickly.

The Star Forge should be operated by my minions, who will preferably agree to be mind-wiped afterward if it's cheap enough. No point letting my brain get fried by the Dark Side.

How much do I know about the Emperor? Not much, right? Because the easiest way to deal with him would be to send some Terminators to kill his grandparents in the future.

Hmm, 300 years is well over the lifespan of a SW human ... Holocrons! Phew, I'm immortal even though death will cost me my force powers. Actually, can I just make a bunch of holocrons and make copies of myself in charge of everything important? That would be a huge timesaver.

*** Wait a second, the Emperor hasn't been born yet? Then he won't be because of the butterfly effect.

** The only way to deal with inevitable prophecies is to make sure they happen in a way that is congruent with your goals. Maybe make an invisible task force that monitors potential Emperors and tries to keep them from being genocidal maniacs. Also, we do have cryonics in this universe (carbonite freezing), so Revan should be able to stick around for the event if he wants.
