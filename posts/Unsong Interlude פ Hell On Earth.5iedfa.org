  force him to live in a one-room apartment with her, and within a month he'll be a domestic abuser.
#+end_quote

Should I feel special for living in a one-room apartment with my partner for four years without resorting to abuse? Because I really don't wanna.

** The 8th time the soul has been amid the markets din; I'm starting to think not only will the main plot have that as the moral of the story, but it will be a theme in every subplot. So how is ana/sohu comprising with sin and how will it enslave them?

**** How is that a grand child? I could see the plan failing and sohu needing help form Sarah who doesn't want it to happen and for some reason Sarah helps anyway, then one of the comet spawn marry sarah(why?)(it says "they" not "him" so it can't be only one person enslaving a grand child). But that seems a bit far fetched. Ana is down playing her marriage and Sarah isn't trying to be a child.

The foresaddow is weak in a world where "OMEN" likes to show up before space accidents, this would be at least equal to that.

It is the child of the Comet King's children. It is the Comet King's grandchild.

****** I don't think its about to be an ai safty story.

Uriel kinda set a tone that math is a good thing, it slowed down hell it didn't comprise with it, its one of the only things that hasn't. And the story is very clear about reality being fractal, of uriel slowed down hell with math because yay math, I think the comet spawn will slow down hell with ai because yay ai

**** The poem is breaking grammar conventions, it could be their grand children or it could be themselves. And I think its likely both given the author(of unsong) wrote that piece on mulock traps

** The lead poisoning one seems like a stretch to me. I haven't kept up with the rules for getting into Heaven/Hell (and I recall them being intentionally vague at one point). If someone roofies me and drags me into a scenario where I sin, does that count against me? How is that difference from poisoning me for 30 years in a way that changes my judgment?

*** These are the questions that people ask in-universe. Obviously, it's making /someone/ sin, because Thamiel's doing it. Either that or he's just devoted to doing as much evil as possible, which isn't out of the question. I can see a revalation like "oh, all that? We get about the same number of sinners regardless of circumstances, because Heaven adjusts for relative goodness and culpability. I just enjoy making people hate, hurt, and sin. It's nothing like a sex thing, but I'll suggest it is, and the possibility that maybe all the suffering of Hell is essentially me getting off on my sadism will give some small fraction of you nightmares filled with fear and disgust."
