[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nwfh6/biweekly_challenge_precommitment/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Precommitment". [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nwfh6/biweekly_challenge_precommitment/cvvlo6m]["Odd Man Out"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]]!

** This Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-time
   :END:
This time, the challenge will be "Fables and Legends". This is a broad topic that covers everything from Aesop's Fables to Hansel and Gretel, with a lot of leeway. The most well known rationalist fable is [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html][Nick Bostrom's Fable of the Dragon Tyrant]] which is a good example of the sort of feeling you might want to go for. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, November 4th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time the challenge will be "Amnesia", or more generally, the loss of knowledge. This covers everything from self-editing of memories to antimemetics. It's up to you whether to go with retrograde or anterograde amensia (the later seen in /Memento/), or if you want to go with something more in the realm of science fiction. If you want to write fanfic, franchises of opportunity include /Men in Black/, /Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind/, the /Bourne/ series, /Harry Potter/, /Artemis Fowl/, /Memento/, along with many, many others.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 11/4.* Please confine any questions or comments to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]].

He doesn't know that it's the /smartest/, but he reasons that Father Moose probably doesn't have some super-special way of figuring out which rabbit is the smartest either, so the context of the challenge is "beating Bear" rather than complete optimization (and Fox is both clever and lazy). Fox is not terribly surprised to find that this challenge was about /good methods/ rather than /good outcomes/.

***** By that logic returning with no rabbit would be the superior choice. The smartest rabbit is not going to be inside a fox's jaw. Or offer a monetary reward with risk free collection and all rabbits of some rationality should appear.

****** The Kept Promise and Future Apparent have nothing to do with each other--they're separate ideas that I had rattling around in my head and wanted to try writing down. The Kept Promise is about fable exploitation/usurpation, whereas Future Apparent is presented in terms of the self-narratives which run through the two sides' societies (the shape of the future each side sees and is absolutely certain of, which we can contrast each other and see to be both wrong and doomed). I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'the act of union'. I'm sorry for not making it clearer that the two stories weren't part of a series--thank you for making me aware of that assumption as a possibility!

******** Ah, I see. My apologies for misunderstanding. The entire British Isles (yes, including southern Ireland, for example because it would raise eyebrows amidst the populace if only it were unnecessarily left outside) are being protected/dominated, but an English person may tend (depending on personality/upbringing) to think of England more in terms of England than Britain, especially when thinking about English legends. It's a good point that Scotland, southern Ireland et cetera may have more incredulous populace overall regarding this.

********** Ahh. I might not have gone to that degree of wordiness (trying to represent a person's thoughts/impressions rather than oration), but for example 'To all our country' would likely have been much better as the more explanatory 'To all in the British Isles'. (I can't change the 'England's once and future king' part at the end without invalidating the 'once' or otherwise marring the line.)

Edit: Incidentally impression is that a version without a different timeline is simpler to posit than a version with it, but if mentioning Ireland by name is necessary to convey its presence I have no objection to the setting being imagined as an alternate timeline instead. <Code Geass reminiscence>

*********** Simply suggested it because the restoration of the Isles into one Kingdom would have been a notable part of this chaps perspective when detailing all that Arthur had done. The wayward southern Irish being subsumed would certainly be something an English person would find relevant.

I don't think you need to be as wordy as my example of course.

************ Ahh, I see! Relevant indeed, though it might make more people in the populace suspicious (particularly in the context of defense against a powerful outside threat--though, the more I think of it, the more the incidental folding of Ireland back into Britain in the face of a fearful enemy makes sense as something happening in the background, sooner or later (unofficially first, later officially)). Do you know of any legends of King Arthur as an English king that deal with him conquering other lands or ruling over Ireland? My impression of him was that he inherited the kingdom from his father (via the sword?) and then kept it safe until the Mordred thing, but I'm not a dedicated scholar.

--That said, it /would/ be hilarious (in a completely different story, say) to see the real Arthur come back, without an fraud of a great enemy (maybe "The people's souls cried out to me that the land is in need once more, threatened by this 'economic recession' fiend!"), and try to lead an army against 'the uppity French' by invading Disneyland or something like that... less so if in reality due to the death and bloodshed involved, but are there any fictions that come to mind where a legendary hero ends up in the modern world and actually makes reasonable headway at war against his traditional enemies before someone stops him? (Something like if, in Fate/zero, Alexander/Rider had /actually/ won and then tried to conquer his way from Japan to Greece across Eurasia as he'd planned...)

************* Well it might make the reader more suspicious which I think wouldn't be bad considering the ending but the populace can easily be swayed to it as with the other hints so I figured they can be dealt with the same way.

Anyway since historically Arthur didn't even rule over all of England. I immediately googled this and apparently:

#+begin_quote
  Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul.
#+end_quote

Obviously the French weren't really French by the time of Arthur's supposed existence.

But anyway that's what I remembered so the idea was his choice of either just the UK or the entire British Isles would be notable enough to be mentioned. Trying to find a map of his supposed Kingdom leads to all sorts of contradictory nonsense.

While I can't think of any legends or those other stories off the top of my head regarding either, for the time traveller one it is definitely not an unfamiliar concept. I think I've maybe seen a comic or something

*** My upvote is for "Future Apparent," which I enjoyed a lot. Like the other posters, I found that "The Kept Promise" covered too much inferential distance without enough explanation. But I'm glad that explanation was absent, since it caused your wordcount to come out low and therefore in turn caused you to write the other story.
