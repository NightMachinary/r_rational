** I think you overestimated the severity of her threat --- I read it as good-natured ribbing with some overacting (both on Noburi and Inoue's parts).

Cursory investigation revealed that this is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5923487/][a response to a joke]] one of the players made previously. In this scene, Noburi was about to jokingly suggest that since their team can't take a kid from elsewhere, they should /make/ one. Inoue saw the joke coming and turned it around on Noburi, either because she thought it wouldn't be received well, or because messing with him amused her (you have to remember that she's a recovering sadist).

I agree that all of this isn't very clear.

** Our merry quartet is a group of missing-nin, being hunted by the scariest hunter-nin alive, Captain Zabuza. As it is, its really hard to stay hidden. A civilian along forthe ride would get them all killed. Noburi at this point has some alpha-dog ish confidence issues. She shut him down /hard/ here so he wouldn't even think about ignoring her.

Additionally, something Mary thinks about but Nobby doesn't is that civilians really cant ever give consent to ninjas due to the inherent extreme physical differences. There's really no way to get some kid to come along with a group of missing nin besides kidnapping them, politely or not.

*** Oof. Yeah, this is some hardcore projection. Sorry : / I mean you recognized it yourself, which is why I'm being so blunt. I would look into why this hits you so hard, because while on one level you're right (the sexual stamina joke in particular can be a pretty mean insinuation), it's really common and generally not a big deal among friends who clearly aren't making it a personal remark, or have no reason to expect it to be taken seriously.

A much bigger issue is some of the physical violence threats that are actually carried out later in the story, but keep in mind also that these characters live in a world often full of literal daily life-and-death struggles and are trained assassins, thieves, seduction experts, etc from childhood. Not only should they be expected to have thick skin, if they don't it would be a massive liability to everyone around them.

(I'll also note that Shikamaru's apology was mostly instructed out of political necessity, from one noble family member inadvertently insulting another.)
