** I can attest to this story being a ton of fun. The humor is great, the LitRPG system is unusual, and the characters are a joy. Threadbare may not be taking over the world, or recreating the industrial revolution, but this story is hands down one of my favorite novels of the year.

*** How do you mean he's not taking over the world? What do you think happens after a high level Ruler rescues the princess of a country from her evil father?

**** I meant it a bit less literally. In LitRPGs the goal of the protagonist is often to seek power for itself, or to hold so much power that no one can control them anymore. In Threadbare, the only reason he's adventuring in the first place is because he loves his little girl and wants her back. I admit, it will be an awesome twist if he ends up the King instead of Celia.

***** Would that still be a twist? It's too heavily foreshadowed.

** So people here have greatly enjoyed following [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/threadbare-original-litrpg.43430/][Threadbare]] and the story has been put up on Amazon which is why I'm posting this link.

Don't worry, unless the author is offered a lot of money, he has [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/9848124/][said]] that Threadbare should remain up on Spacebattles for free.

** Good read so far, only recently was made aware that this author is also reaponsible for the Dire series and the Dire/Worm crossover. Both those works are excellent as well.
