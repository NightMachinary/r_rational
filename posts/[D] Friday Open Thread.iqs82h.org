Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** So, is anyone else planning to build a computer in the coming months? What are you thinking for a build? Do any more-experienced builders have any tips?

*** Wouldn't call myself experienced; over the last seven years I've built my own, my brother's, and a friend's workstation/gaming rigs. For basically /any/ build, I'd take suggestions from [[https://www.logicalincrements.com/][Logical Increments]], create a rough outline on [[https://pcpartpicker.com/][PC Part Picker]] within the budget I was given, then post the part list, budget, and intended use to [[/r/buildapc]]. The folks there would then usually change out every part for something better/cheaper/more stylish. I would then wait for a week, see if there are any sales on parts similar to the ones I was recommended, and try and buy everything from one or two vendors.

Actually building the computers was usually the easiest part. Watch some youtube videos of your case. Read the mainboard manual before installing, some wires can get tricky and you should know which RAM slots to use for dual channel. Also try and put everything together outside the box before installing, it's way easier to troubleshoot that way.

Then once you've installed Windows, run a couple of benchmarks to see if you're within the expected margin for your PC. If you aren't, odds are it's a driver thing, but it might also indicate some hardware problem.

*** I might, although it would be a vanity buy more than anything. My current computer is from 2013 except for the GPU, but I'm not really limited on the things I actually do with it. I would probably buy Ryzen, get an NVME SSD, and keep the GPU and hard drives while giving a still functional computer to my family. 1440p or 4k screens would be nice as well.

My advice would be to be realistic about what you actually will be doing with your computer (you do not need a 3090 to run League) and to consult people who have built computers before. There's a lot of marketing BS out there, so if you're not familiar with computer hardware beforehand, it's a lot better to just let someone else look at your parts rather than realizing your mistake $1000 later. Actually building the computer is usually pretty simple, it's occasionally called Adult LEGOs, but watch some guides before doing it. Also, "future proofing" is largely not worth it at all.

I'd be willing to look at your parts list whenever you have it ready.

********* Regardless, the G2 is a great choice, I was all geared up to try to gently argue you away from Pimax and towards either the Index or the G2. The Index's controllers are cool, but there's already straps you can buy to attach to the Oculus Touch controllers so you can let go of them like the Index controllers, and those'll probably work for the G2's controllers too since they're so similar. I'd personally lean towards the G2 just for the 2k per eye resolution, especially since it being $600 versus the Index being a thousand bucks means that if a headset comes out in 2 or 3 years with 4k per eye and varifocal lenses it'll be easier to justify upgrading before the 5 years you mentioned.

EDIT: Maybe even sooner than 2 or 3 years:

As for me, I just did a big ol futureproof build a year or two ago. I might get a 3070 just because the cost efficiency is too good (and I can put my RX 580 in my wife's computer and get rid of the jet engine video card she has now), but other than that I should be good for another 3 or 4 years at least.

*** Been using the setup of OneDrive (storage) + CloudPlayer (for android playback and caching) for a few years now. It's not open source, but since I already had 1TB of storage on OneDrive and a folder based hierarchical system for organizing my music, it integrated really easily and I'm pretty happy.

While using OneDrive you can easily access and play individual music files from the web, it's still not really a music player. The android experience is the best and covers 70% of my music needs. Windows desktop experience is also decent. (can use whatever music player you're used to, I use MusicBee or the built in app).

Other desktop OSs suffer a bit in the simplicity of setting it all up, but it looks like you can do it on [[https://github.com/skilion/onedrive][linux]]) altho I haven't bothered to try. No idea about Macs.

I technically also have a plex setup that can stream my music [and a web interface!], but plex android app needed to create a user for their platform to use it with my server, which seemed like a badly transparent way to gather user data (since on desktop they don't really care). And I might be remembering it wrong, but I don't think their android app did any offline caching. The last point killed it for me, since I'm traveling semi occasionally through 4G blindspots.

My biggest problem was that being a decently sized music library (25GB) I didn't really want to transfer all of that to my phone (only have 64GB of storage there; can't have music taking up half of it). CloudPlayer has a setting of how much offline cache they use so I set it to only cache 8GB of the most popular songs.

** Has anyone watched the Netflix show "Away" about a Mars mission yet? I feel like in some respects recently there's been this swath of space movies and shows (Gravity, Interstellar, The Martian and more) that have some degree of realism thrown in, and try to look like very hard sci-fi, but sometimes still mix it with very questionable choices. Two episodes in, I'm flabbergasted at how insubordinate and psychologically unstable this whole crew designated for a 3 YEARS MARS MISSION is - they've already broken into pieces before launching from the Moon - and by some frankly ridiculous design choices seen in an EVA scene (no backup solar panels? Moving around with just one tether that they keep hooking and unhooking? Wut?). Not sure if I'll continue, apparently it gets even more soap opera later.

Isn't this set in 1990 in the UK? The Ancient Aliens meme is from 2010s

I know the Daily Mail became the most popular paper in 1980s but I'm not sure about the feeling. I guess tabloids have been mostly the same.

Edit: In addition Snape getting into trouble for stalking Lily seems like you're whitewashing both the actual 1990s and the late Victorian era boarding schools on which Hogwarts and its society is based on. Every time you read the words "women consent" you can be sure you're portraying a better past than actually existed. (Marital rape wasn't illegal until 1991 in the UK)

About the stalking, yeah, it was a bit of a joke on my part I guess, but well, Dumbledore /is/ the Headmaster here, I think he'd be a bit more progressive than the average. Plus there's the curse, any excuse would have been enough to kick Snape out. But you're right, it's not extremely realistic. I guess I could have gone with a more serious idea - that they simply discovered Snape had gone and revealed the prophecy to Voldemort, or that the fact got out and he ended on trial.

Though I'd argue the History Channel one is the only really out of place - the Lily affair could be handwaved, after all sure, the general culture was different but that doesn't mean stalking was literally considered ok.

******* I agree that the history channel is more egregious because it's a factual error rather than a cultural error. Especially if since you have modern readers they might not clock on or not consider the differences in how sexual misconduct was treated only 30 years ago.

I would say that I think you're still underestimating. "Stalking" was basically considered okay, and even idolized. I wouldn't say the Wizarding World with its love potions, imperius curse, polyjuice potions, and more is really more likely to be in line with modern thinking. Dumbledore too, if he's ok with Snape torturing children during his tenure I don't think he's suddenly going to become some moral bastion over a dead woman. And sadly I imagine most wizarding parents simply wouldn't care just as few cared about the pedophilia rampant in the church and British boarding schools.

On stalking it was not really criminal until 1997 in England though there were some telecommunication laws prior to that. The 90s were really when a modern recognition of rape culture really got started.

I mean, things don't become criminalised unless a substantial fraction of the population already thinks they're bad. Culture usually changes before law. I don't think until 1996 you could go around parading your photos of an half-naked underage girl you took from hiding and not be considered a creep by many. But yeah, these sort of cultural considerations are way beyond the level of research I thought of putting in that one line of the story. I literally just conceived it on the spot as I needed to make up one reason why Snape wouldn't be DADA teacher any more in absence of... everything that happened in canon at the end of HBP.

Sometimes true but often not. Law can precede societal changes in many cases. Death penalty is the obvious example, but there are lots of laws that aren't popular or didn't become so until after.

I mean sure if Snape goes crazy with it probably then it could be a reason but since Lily was a muggleborn I imagine the reaction of the community will have very little concern for Lily. Perhaps some argument to be made that Snape's like of her would taint him too, but then plenty of slaveowners raped their slaves and were rarely ostracised for it. Snape's a known cog in the political wheel, he favours the Slytherin house which is all the purebloods want from him. If Voldemort's gone for good then yeah Dumbledore can oust him for someone of his faction but I don't really think any reason needs to be given for that.

I think you're pushing this a bit too far, as if everyone was a Malfoy or a Black. First, Lily Potter by this point is a national heroine, muggleborn or not. And second, even if she wasn't, we know that most of the management at Hogwarts - notably, Dumbledore and McGonagall - held her in a high opinion. What else is needed? The Wizengamot wouldn't get involved with a matter as trivial as the firing of a random professor - one with no particular social standing, even, Snape is a half-blood himself.

** I'm generally really, really dubious about AI-driven anything, but Spotify's recommendations engine pretty consistently turns up at least one band every week I hadn't heard of but that I turn out to really dig. And it's not just in one genre! The last month has seen Hanggai, David Garrett, Antti Martikainen, Clamavi De Profundis, Roger Pontare, Dark Moor, and Blackmore's Night added to my various playlists.

I wonder what makes Spotify so different from Youtube, Netflix, or Kindle, whose recommendations are pure, unadulterated trash. Is it just that my taste in music is more in line with popular opinion? It shouldn't be a matter of just the business model, because while that would make sense for Youtube, it wouldn't for Netflix.
