** I'm going to have to side with Delphic's parents here. This trio does seem fishy. I was already very put off by the roommates demands; in a world where superheroes exist, secret identities are probably serious business. Expecting Hector to be completely honest and upfront after spending literally one-night with Kimberly, strikes me as ridiculous. There seems to be no charitable reason for the roommates outrage, unless there's also an ulterior motive behind it, or some serious, serious backstory that hasn't been revealed yet.

I know the story isn't finished yet, and the world-building isn't complete, but getting mad at a guy for not telling a girl he's known for one night he's a super, seemed to me like someone getting mad at a fried they met yesterday for not telling them they're gay. Realistic? Yes. Believable? Yes. But it still makes me strongly dislike the roommate, and distrust Kimberly to some extent.

She appeared so suddenly, clicked with Hector so well, and has a strong interest in super. Hector already knows he's under suspicion for ties to Delphic. He should definitely check them out, make certain they're not government plants, because they definitely could be. They all seemed to be positioned in fields/clubs that would make it easy for them to get in touch with underground communities of supers; and one of them even has an 'ability' that lets them detect supers, making them perfect for finding undocumented ones.

Seems far to fishy to actually be benign.

** Since votes for Top Web Fiction only last a week, my lack of updates means this story has fallen off the main list.

Please [[http://topwebfiction.com/vote.php?for=delphic][vote]] to get Delphic back on there.

*** That would be Wordpress not properly policing their ads.

Make sure to hit "report" under where the ad is. Also send me a screenshot and I'll see if there is a way to blacklist the problem.

If it keeps happening, I think there's a way to turn ads off entirely for X dollars a month. I will look into that next.

***** Wordpress hosts the site, yes, and delphicserial.wordpress.com also directs to the page. The ads are served through them as well, I'm pretty sure.

Like I said, if you are having problems with redirects, it's due to the particular advertisers that are serving you. Message me details and I'll see if my service settings includes blacklisting.

****** No problem here with redirects, but I'm a Patreon supporter ( plug: delphicserial.wordpress.com ) and if an extra 5$/mo (the cost of a basic wordpress account) will turn off ads I'll bump my monthly by 5$. :)

******* Turns out it requires the premium account ($8 a month).

I'm turning off ads now. I would certainly appreciate any help with the expense, but it's worth it for reader convenience either way.

******** You don't currently have anything higher than a 10$ tier, and no "open field" to contribute with as much as desired.

Would you mind opening that up, or making a 15$ tier?

********* My bad. The $10 tier says "ten plus" on my side; I didn't realize it was capped.

I will happily make a $15 tier. Is there any additional reward you would like in it?

How about, "choose the codename and super powers of an upcoming supporting character"?

********* There is now a Hero Patron tier.

So yeah, if you want to, you can add a character to the story.

I have at least one new NYST superhero being introduced in the chapter I'm writing now, so let me know. :-)
