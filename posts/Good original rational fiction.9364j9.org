No real criteria, please send me the best non fanfiction works you know.

I've read and enjoyed Mother of Learning and Worth the Candle, so something in that ballpark would be nice.

EDIT: Thanks for all the recommendations, guys. I'll be sure to check them out.


** Of the list in the wiki, these are not fanfiction:

- Three Worlds Collide
- Shadows of the Limelight
- The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant
- Mother of Learning
- The Last Christmas
- Worm
- Ra
- The Fall of Doc Future and sequels
- The Two Year Emperor
- Ted Chiang's stories
- A Hero's War
- Worth the Candle
- Sufficiently Advanced Magic
- On the Shoulders of Titans

Not on that list that I read are:

- Practical Guide to Evil
- Set in Stone ([[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/]])
- Unsong
- The Last Angel; The Last Angel: Ascension
- Pact (by Wildbow)
- Twig (by Wildbow)

Not rational per se but I still like: * The Gods are Bastards * Super Powereds: Year 1 (by Drew Hayes)

And, just to recommend them because they're good: * Codex Alera by Jim Butcher * Walkaway by Cory Doctorow

BTW, Walkaway may be my new #1 fiction.

****** Pact is without a doubt darker than Worm, to me. It's all the escalation and greyness in Worm but there's even less down time and the victories are even more Pyrrhic.

In contrast, I find Worm relatively optimistic. People might treat some fights as lost, like the Endbringers, and it's very up front about how utterly the system can fail, but in the midst of it you can see the characters striving for something better, each in their own way. Some may be naive or counterproductive about it, and others strive to destroy instead, but there's enough desire to do better, enough hope for a better world even if just on a few frontiers, that I can't see the world as a whole as grimdark.

****** I dislike it when Worm is called grimdark; I've had this discussion before, and I'll just copypaste my point from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8uo6xb/what_exactly_is_munchkinry_and_the_best_examples/e1ijcjb/][back then:]]

So he literally defines it as "Gritty, adult, dark science fiction and fantasy."? That's pretty broad, and yea, under that definition Worm is grimdark - and so is practically any superhero movie besides Spiderman. At that point the word just... kinda loses its meaning.\\
Like, yea, Worm is a shithole of a world, and every superpowered human has a tragic backstory by default. But there are still decent people, in fact even most villains have /some/ decency or less shitty traits, even some of the literal Nazis.

Contrast that with WH40k, a universe where reality itself is close to coming apart at the seams due to Chaos gods, where a galaxy-devouring tide of bio-horror-monsters is about to overwhelm every major power, and where even the "good" guys are literal fascists that make North Korea look like a democratical first-world country.

No, these two aren't even in the same ballpark as far as shittyness is concerned. We shouldn't use the same word to describe both.

***** Then you slowly acclimated to it like the nominative frog in the pot.

Worm starts out with the /pro/tagonist nearly suffocating someone to death by clogging their orfices with insects. It proceeds through ever-increasing horrors: she befriends a group that includes someone who can turn you into a puppet in your own body. That happy group takes on all manner of SCP-grade horrors, becoming greater and greater horrors themselves, until an entire multiverse of humanity is briefly enslaved and billions upon billions die.

***** Among other things, the entire reason that the world is the way it is is because everyone with powers has a space worm in their head that makes them punch people instead of doing anything useful. The protagonist could have saved billions of dollars and hundreds of millions of lives if she had used her insect-control powers to pollinate plants efficiently and eliminate disease vectors such as ticks, rats, etc. Instead, she punched people with spiders. As far as I'm aware, she didn't even have the Protectorate set her up with a massive farm of millions of spiders so that she could weave those awesome spider-silk uniforms and cables for everyone.

Then there's the Endbringers, super-kaiju who keep society from making progress by occasionally showing up to destroy random cities. No nation on earth ever makes a serious effort at destroying these things; their only answer is "let's get all the super-powered types we can find into one place and punch the kaiju until they go away". There's a story called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/weaver-nine-worm-fanfic-au.289395/][Weaver 9]] in which someone actually tries to come up with real solutions to the Endbringers, all of which are much more sensible than those in canon.

Then there's the fact that society allows supervillains to rampage around instead of saying hello with a sniper rifle. (Or equivalent for the tougher supers.) If you do enough bad stuff then they will capture you and put you in prison (the Birdcage), but they don't really make that a priority; it's shown in canon that Alexandria is able to locate and capture random villains in a huge city within minutes, but she can't be bothered to bring in Lung, the Butcher, the Slaughterhouse 9, Kaiser, or any of the other supers who are running gangs or killing for fun. Yes, an argument could be made that this is because she is a member of Cauldron and they want lots of killing and death so there will be lots of triggers so there will be lots of capes to fight the Endbringers. This is a poor argument since Cauldron has a way to mass-produce powers. It's not reliable or safe and the powers that it produces may or may not be quite as strong as the 'natural' ones (it's unclear), but it exists, and it's a much better road to creating superHEROES than hoping someone will have an insanely traumatic experience and come out of it with a positive and prosocial attitude.

I could go on, but that's a reasonable list.

***** Because the author leaned way too hard on the scales to get people in costumes punching each other. And to get the grim-dark. Neither of those are logical outcomes of just the powers.

Also.. Taylors powers would make her very rich, or a very nearly perfect spy/panopticon, but what she actually uses them for is combat.

That is a general problem - Non-costume non-combat rogues ought to have made up nearly the entire meta population, because "Make money" is not the hyper-rationalist response to getting powers, it is the first impulse of anyone raised in capitalism.

And combat ought to have gotten her killed, because hard-countering bugs when you know months and weeks in advance you are going to be fighting a bug controller is just not that difficult. This never happens.

****** That's a very uncharitable view.

To me, Worm is more "rational adjacent" for two primary reasons:

- Worm is not primarily about people thinking, it's primarily about characterization and relationships. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but it's not generally what people come to this subreddit for, and any work which is more about characterization than thought will lean away from what I mean when I say "rational fiction".
- The world of Worm exists as it does through multiple attempts at justifying a setting with superheros and super-villains. Every way that this paradigm breaks is given a patch, and there are sometimes patches /to/ the patches so that the patches themselves don't break things. To me, this says that Worm cared more about pastiche than it did about following the consequences of the rules it made (especially since some of the rules are, IMO, really inelegant and over-fitted to creation of the setting).

These are both matters of opinion.

It is also a very silly series of books. Recommend for that, but not as rational fic.

April Daniels Dreadnaught and Sovereign is a world where 95% of the powered do just take up being a flying courier, tunnel builder or whatever their powerset lends itself to, it just also focuses on characters who are in the 5% and why the heck they would do that.

If the story premise was 'what if superheroes were all driven to conflict', then sure.

But instead it's 'what if powers deliberately seek out bad and broken people and manipulate them to seek out conflict, and also the world is low-key run by a group that thinks listening to the suggestions of one of these powers is a good idea, and also there are multiple sentient natural disasters that show up occasionally to destroy major population centers to stir up more conflict and then only pretend to be driven off because ha-ha fuck you they were just playing around the whole time, and one of those natural disasters is also psychic and precognitive so everything always goes wrong and she destroys spaceships humanity can't even escape the planet'.

That's okay! Not all rational fic is good and not all good fic is rational. It can still be a good and engaging story! And the characters can still show originality and cleverness! But at that point it sure sounds like wilbur wanted to write some grimdark spandex action and didn't care so much about exploring the plausible worldbuilding around a cool premise, or investigating how characters might overcome the limitations of that premise.

I definitely second the recommendation, especially of the world. The lore and structure around Names and Roles admttedly ticks my boxes very well, but the world is just very deep in general. Multiple books could be made and would sell just as well as the actual series from the tales implied by the quotes at the beginning of each chapter.

The whole sequence of events after Prevailer went on her rampage is excellent. Strong writing and characters overall as well.

On the subject of superhero Rational fiction, the other two good I've read are [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]], which you've probably read about. Excellent writing and conflict, but the world constantly fucks everyone you even barely start to care about in a fashion and frequency that would make George R.R. Martin shudder. By the end, I'd given up and was rooting for [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy][everyone to die]], pretty much.

+Lastly, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/][With This Ring]] is also a very good piece of superhero fiction, a lot more hopeful and lighter than the two above. It's basically uplift fiction, with the protagonist starting to use the countless pieces of technology and magic available in the DC universe to bring about a new age, while also being a normal (though a bit overpowered, later on) superhero on the side. Notable for also following an alternate reality version of the protagonist who is a lot less nice, like a videogame presenting you with "nice" and "harsh" choices. Extremely long, but an easy read+. Scratch that, forgot about the non-fanfiction bit.

** [[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]] by Peter Watts. It's a sci fi book that delves deeply into questions of conscience and sentience, eventually taking on a bit of a horror tone. An excellent example of a dystopia that isn't immediately identifiable as one as first. The book, originally published physically, is free to read online. It was part of this sub's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7yb64q/monthly_book_club_february_2017_book_discussion/][monthly book club]] (which I think is dead now??). Read it, it's excellent.

** In the way of web serials, you should look up A Practical Guide to Evil. Otherwise...

Lois McMaster Bujold's "Falling Free" serves as a nice stand-alone entry into her work, and the heroic engineering feats involved seem to be very much appreciated by this community.

Yoon Ha Lee's Ninefox Gambit is a phenomenal blend of fantasy and science fiction which absolutely delights, and "Yours in calendrical heresy" is a mindworm of its own.

Rationalists will find T Kingfisher's (aka Ursula Vernon's) portrayal of Paladins in her Clocktaur War books a great joy.

** Ok, I know I said hpmor earlier, and that was stupid and a result of reading poorly. Know what you should go read. UNSONG!!

It's....weird, but very very compelling. It's about a world that is ruled and governed by a gross mishmash of biblical metaphors and magics derived from kabalah. I am a staunch non believer, anti-theist, and I loved every word of it. It's not terribly long and is already complete so you won't be waiting for monthly updates. /cough cough/ worth the candle /cough/

[[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-1-dark-satanic-mills/][Here's the first chapter.]] seriously, part way through the series there is the only sensible excuse for the central question of theodicy that I've ever heard.

I just finished reading Unsong and that was literally what I thought. Like, ok, [[#s][spoilers]].

Anyway it was a really compelling read, and made me think back to Umberto Eco's "Foucault's Pendulum". There was a character in there who was too into kabbalah and even went as far as considering using a computer to try all permutations of the letters in the Bible to find the True Name of God (sadly, that book was set in the 80s so this was even more ludicrously out of reach for their machines than it is now).

Also now I have that verse, "they enslave their children's children who make compromise with sin", stuck into my head. First time I run into a /poetry/ earworm. But that sentence's rhythm is so damn catchy.

** I'm curious: why specifically do you want original works?

If it's just to explore a new setting, then there are probably fanfics worth reading where you aren't familiar with canon. Or where they're really far diverged from canon (there's not a whole lot of the original Harry Potter left in Following the Phoenix, for example).

** "Release That Witch!" is a story about an engineer who is transported to a medieval society with witches and body swaps with a prince. He uses his modern knowledge to transform lives for the better and exploit witch powers with science for maximum efficiency.

Not written to be rationalist, but I say it qualifies since it teaches real science within the story. Also if you wanted a ruler protagonist, this story fits that niche nicely imo.

*** I've read quite a bit of this, and I lean toward "no, it's not particularly rational, let alone rationalist." Figuring out how to exploit the variety of powers is nice, but seems to happen with an ease and speed that just isn't realistic at all, and the way that character after character is overwhelmed by the amazing awesomeness of Roland's territory tends to strain belief.

It's an interesting fantasy read, but little to do with rationality IMO.

***** I also have reservation on reading fanfiction. What's mattered is not about our knowledge of the fandom, but our general feeling toward the original works. An original works that is greatly written will discourage me reading its fanfic. In a way that anything offered inside fanfic will never hope to be canon. The original was already great after all.

An original works that is disappointing in one way or another will also discourage me reading its fanfic, but in different way. This time, bothering with them became questionable. After all, the original work already sullied the setting, character, plot, or whatever; improving upon them will only amount to excuse. This is what I feel about HPMOR. It's a good piece of fiction, but in the end it only amount to its author doing an exercise. I believe it would have been better if Eliezer Y used original's characters only as cameo instead of revising them. But it would have been GREAT if Eli creates new setting entirely instead of borrowing Rowling's.

That means, the greatest fanfiction is fanfiction of works that I knew nothing about. Without fore-knowledge or expectation, I suppose they will virtually be an original work.

***** I find HPMOR to be a pretty light read, in the sense that while there's certainly a lot of scheming and strategizing it also is all pretty straightforward - it's strongly plot-driven, full of humour and light moments, there's a main conflict, a clear hero, plot twists, all that stuff. I'd say for me a book that's more character-driven, has difficult prose or heavy symbolism, is more metaphoric etc. tends to be a far more challenging read. HPMOR is the sort of read you breeze through, and it would last very little if it wasn't so long.

****** Well, you /can/ just read through it and enjoy the story, but you're really just skimming the surface if you do that.

Which you're quite at liberty to do, but since those deeper layers are very much there, and are kind of the point of the whole thing, I don't think that the original 'action movie "turn your brain off"' comment is accurate.

******* I'm not sure what you refer to here when talking about deeper layers. I think perhaps the issue is, different people have a different feeling of what constitutes 'depth', depending on how much certain aspects jump to their eye. HPMOR wears its thematic heart very much on its sleeve - in fact, if anything, it occasionally spells it out a bit too much. Rational!Harry is very vocal about his ethics and principles. Of course, there's also a lot of undercurrents about how Harry isn't ALWAYS right - while none of that is usually said out loud (or at least it only partially is, usually through McGonagall, Dumbledore, Quirrell or Hermione) it's still pretty transparent. There's plenty of references to real theories and science one can go read up on, of course, and there's plenty to do if you want to crack the story as a puzzle and try to figure out what's going to happen beforehand (that was probably more natural for those who read it as it came out, and now you have to purposefully slow down the pace of your reading for it). But ultimately, there's not that much concealment about the /meaning/ of the story; and the prose is certainly easy to read and straightforward. So yeah, in a scale from JK Rowling to James Joyce, I consider it a light read. But that's probably me, because I usually don't really feel any effort following even a dense story as long as it's written in a straightforward manner. While literary prose (especially English one, since I'm not mothertongue) can get far more challenging for me.
