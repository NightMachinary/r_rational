In this story, a man wakes up as an AI. He's talking to his prior partner who won't let him talk to anyone else, including his wife. I think there was a terrorist attack leading to him uploading his consiousness, but I may be mixing two stories up.

Eventually (fairly quickly) he determines that he has been 'reset' by his partner multiple times.

Any ideas? Google wasn't much help.

No idea, this is the big question isn't it? If we can learn this we can build artificial consciousness of many different configurations. The problem is it's not testable in the traditional sense, at least I don't see how to.

You can't just make something that behaves like a conscious mind to an outsider, because we can be fooled. A simple conversation lookup table like the Chinese room thought experiment wouldn't be conscious IMO, but it could trick someone into thinking it was. This is super dangerous, because if we get it wrong we could kill everyone who we are trying to save by uploading.

edit: MAYBE we could build artificial minds with varying configurations with a minimal capacity for communication, and not feed them the concept of consciousness up front, and see if they come up with it on their own? I think I would accept this as weak evidence of consciousness, but it's not a very efficient way to test the search space of all possible configurations of "minds."

No? It's only the big question if you think it's the case. I don't think consciousness arises from the interaction between neurons, so it's not really a big question for me.

Since it seems to be the crux of you position, it surprises me that you don't have any ideas.

If you have no idea what about the interaction of neurons gives rise to consciousness, why do you think it causes it?

#+begin_quote

I take the position that what makes two things the same thing is that you cannot differentiate between them. If I have a "known conscious" entity and an "unknown conscious" entity, and I cannot tell the difference between their apparent "consciousness", seems like the reasonable conclusion is that they're both conscious (or both not, but, postulates).

So perhaps a better way to phrase the question is "what would be true for you to treat an artificial mind the same as a human mind"?

#+end_quote

I would only agree with this if you append the qualifier "with perfect knowledge of all attributes of the concerned 'things'."

Otherwise, it is an assertion that relies on your own ignorance. If cave men couldn't tell the difference between a rock and a radioactive isotope, does that make them the same thing? Surely you are not asserting that to believe something is to /make it true/?

The mind doesn't create the universe. The universe creates the mind. So, what we know about something doesn't change its nature or properties. "I think therefore I am" doesn't mean "I think and thereby shape the nature of reality and produce my own existence ex nihilo."

If you agree with the above -- which is really just admitting that there is an objective physical reality /at all/-- then I can clarify what I mean by "we can be fooled" and why it's important.

If we do not have clear understanding of the physical laws that necessarily produce consciousness for certain configurations of matter, then it is possible we could have incorrect beliefs about the consciousness or lack thereof in an arbitrary subject.

Behavior is not the same thing as internal experience. Just because something seems to behave in a way similar to a consciousness to an ignorant observer does not make it necessarily conscious.

Consider a simple chatbot generating responses from a lookup table (ie - a chinese room.) A child might be fooled by an unsophisticated program, but a savvy adult can recognize the irregularities and realize this is not a conscious mind they are interacting with.

Does this make the chatbot conscious to the child, but not the adult?

Now extend the scenario. The chatbot is made more sophisticated, with a larger set of responses, without changing its fundamental nature -- it's still just a lookup table. The adult is now fooled over the course of a short conversation, but the programmer of the bot knows it for a fake.

Is the bot now conscious to the adult Turing test subject, but not to the programmer?

Finally, consider a bot that can fool anyone - its lookup table is enormous, it has a plausible sounding response for just about any line of conversation, but it is still just a dumb pattern matching program.

again, is our ignorance of the nature of and requirements for consciousness sufficient cause to just /declare/ this Bot to suddenly be conscious?

Saying "good enough" because something /seems/ conscious is not acceptable. This is because the stakes of this declaration are the survival of all known conscious life.

We are talking about deciding what form uploaded minds should take - and these could potentially in the future comprise the entirety of humanity. If you "guess" that a lookup table that seems to behave like a person is "good enough" for consciousness, and we dissect all of humanity's brains and tile the solar system with these lookup tables, it could mean the end of consciousness in the universe.

So, how confident are you in your guess? Is it enough that you can't tell the difference? Or would you want to know more about what, at a fundamental physical level, is required to create a conscious mind?

I am of the later opinion. I /do/ acknowledge my ignorance of what, at a bare minimum, is /necessary/ to create consciousness. This /is/ the big question. I only know that human brains are /sufficient/, and propose that - until we know exactly what laws give rise to consciousness - that should be our minimum requirement for uploading or preserving a human mind.

I think that: There is no substance you can point to and say "this is what causes it". Mind/body dualism simply suggests there's a totally different kind of substance (than matter) that's responsible. I think consciousness (or whatever we have) arises from the "pattern" that our matter takes. If you re-enact this pattern in another medium, I would expect consciousness. I also expect there are other "consciousness islands" in the pattern state-space.

It's possible that the particular chemical (including anything quantum) interactions between neurons is a crucial part of this pattern; but I don't think so, and if that were the case, I'd expect that simulating them (with enough fidelity) would be sufficient.

You make solid points. You're very correct that going for something like human upload is incredibly risky unless you have a solid test that you believe in for things like "consciousness" and "continuity of self".

However, I'm extremely skeptical of there being any possible physics test for this. I can only even imaging a behavioral test; this starts getting into solipsist territory.

I guess another way to phrase my position is that any test I'd use to determine that other humans are also conscious is sufficient for me for AIs / uploads; not that I actually have a such a test.

So for /me/, it's more about the boundaries of that risk. You've solidly convinced that without such a test I should not undergo human upload.... prior to imminent death. Or try to convince other people that it'd be a good idea. (Which wasn't the plan anyway).

There's a saying I like, from psychonautics: "Cars are hard. Fire is hot. If you think you can fly, start from the ground. All else is consensus.". There's things that are real. There's things we think and act as if they are real, but there's no /thing/. AFAIK, there's no physical thing to point to that delineates music from noise, and yet (for the most part) we all agree that music is a real thing, and can generally agree on a set of things that are music and set of things that are noise (although the line is real broad and fuzzy).

There /are/ things that seem to (generally) become true when you believe them. AFAIK, they're also all things that there's no objective measurement for: Luck. Confidence. Stress. The placebo effect is a real thing with real effects.

********** Huh. It occurs to me that, if I'm even close to understanding Scott Aaronson's discussion on Free Will, you can actually imagine a test to distinguish the look-up table with "the real thing".... maybe.

A look-up table has constant time complexity. "The real thing" requires the entire universe to compute to the point of action to determine what "the real thing" does at that point.

But... You'd never be able to prove that the look-up table has the correct answer without doing the universe calculation...? I think maybe under this view, constructing such a table would actually be impossible.

I think my position on consciousness isn't shifted by this, though -- even if you use a time dependent algorithm to basically compress the lookup table (Aaronson touches on this briefly), I don't think it becomes conscious.

#+begin_quote
  consciousness arises from the "pattern" that our matter takes
#+end_quote

I agree, tentatively, with this. I used the word "structure." It is the physical structure of the brain that gives rise to consciousness.

But the important detail here is the word "matter." For physics to act on it, it must be a pattern of matter. it cannot be a pattern we merely imagine, or describe- it cannot be an /abstract/ pattern. Physics does not operate on abstractions.

If you agree that in our hunt for the source consciousness we are looking for a physical pattern in matter (be it neurons or silicon or what have you), then we are on the same page.

It's from that basis that I find software suspect. A /simulated/ pattern is not a physical object. it is an abstraction - a series of numbers we have simply declared to /signify/ something physical. Its relationship to the physical pattern is metaphorical - it represents, it does not reproduce the physical structure we are interested in.

Now, IF the structure of the underlying hardware contains the "pattern" we are looking for - if the physical circuits themselves, or quantum bits, or whatever adhere to that pattern and structure - it is /possible/ we will get consciousness.

But if the software is just an abstract calculation run on a general computing machine that has no similarity to the physical pattern or structure required for consciousness, I don't believe it will work.

Does this make sense?

*** I find the hypothesis that consciousness is a phenomena that emerges[1] from the patterns of our physical brain compelling.

Given that, why can't there be a direct and abstract translation of the fundamental characteristics and arrangement of the comprising elements of the brain into software? The trivial solution[2] would be to just directly scan and simulate the exact physics+chemistry of an existing brain like this story does.

[1] arises as characteristic of the system not found in elements comprising the system, but out of the interaction of those elements.

[2] trivial as in trivial to conceptualize, not trivial to implement or meet the prerequisites of. If we assume we can copy the physics over, we can have a brain that lives in virtual, but is identical to our own, but that is a false assumption for now. However, it seems to stand to reason that anything in the physical world can theoretically have an analog in the virtual world (be simulated).

  why can't there be a direct and *abstract* translation
#+end_quote

this is the key term.

Our universe is comprised of matter and governed by physics. Consciousness is necessarily a physical process. Physics interprets the interactions of the neurons in the brain as conscious.

Physics does not operate on abstractions - even a perfect digital model of hydrodynamics is not wet, and cannot power a watermill.

An abstract model of the brain is not something physics can operate on. it doesn't matter how detailed we make the model - it's still at the physical level just math we are declaring to /represent/ a brain. Physics doesn't care what we describe something as.

If an artificial brain is to be conscious, it must have /physical/ attributes that have the structure physics interprets as conscious.

If you were to build a physical copy of a brain with 1 to 1 correspondence between neurons you may be able to create an "artificial" consciousness. But I do not believe that an arbitrary program run on a general computing machine that is only said to /represent/ a brain abstractly would necessarily be conscious.

If we lived in a simulated reality (powered by abstractions of physics), would that make us less real?

Simulations are just math. They only represent something at all because we say they do - the observer is required to give it any meaning at all. otherwise it's just arbitrary numbers being crunched.

Simulations are /not/ just as real to the only universal interpreter-physics. Physics defines what is real in our universe and how it behaves.

You seem to be anthropomorphizing the universe/physics. "Realness" is a semantic distinction that only denotes whether the realities match up.

Addition: I don't think a virtual watermill or a virtual consciousness can tell that it's virtual physics is "fake". Its senses can even be directly linked to sensors in the "real" world.

I admit that it's probable that each layer of the proverbial matroska doll of theoretical simulated universes could lose some computational power/resources if each sub universe is necessarily strictly smaller (or lower resolution, or something) than it's container, but we don't /know/ that when we deal with possible infinities. I had an exam including infinite series and sequences yesterday. A monotonically decreasing sequence that is bounded below (in this case the lower bound is zero or greater as the theoretical minimum resources to run a real enough sim) will converge to a finite value (/at infinity./ though). Unless you have some other reason to believe it's not possible.

I'm not treating the thought experiment as it were real, but we don't have any reason to believe the assumption is false. Therefore we don't have any reason to believe your point that it's false is true. The fact that we can't immediately find hard faults with the thought experiment means that it's not obviously false.

I realize we can't just say something is true because we can't prove it is false. I'm saying that you can't justifiably say something is false without sufficient proof either. You're arguing the assumption is false because simulations don't seem to match up with your feeling for the human word real (I think). *If you're trying to say something isn't possible, I think the burden of proof lies on you.

******** I categorically reject your assertion that we, and physics are "made of numbers."

Math is a descriptor. It is not reality itself. Saying we are "made of math" is a nonsensical statement. You might as well say "we are made of poetry." Invoking string theory doesn't change this - string theory has nothing to do with simulated universes or whether a description of something is the same as that thing.

""Realness" is a semantic distinction that only denotes whether the realities match up" seems like gibberish to me.

The brain in the vat experiment is also irrelevant, as it is not proof that simulated universes are "real." There is still a physical brain in a physical vat.

What you are proposing is non-materialism - that any abstraction can represent a universe unto itself, and in doing so CREATES that universe. If you don't believe in an objective physical reality then sure, you are free to posit absolutely anything at all. We will have no common ground.

If you believe physics - and it appears you study it - and are a materialist, then we can converse on those terms.

You argument so far as I can tell is merely to assert that simulations are "real", and then defend this by defining "real" as "self consistent to conscious inhabitants of a universe."

This begs the question. You must assume consciousness to assert consciousness.

If you are a materialist, then the idea that a representation of something is identical to the thing itself is absurd.

I agree with John Searle on this:

#+begin_quote
  “The wall behind my back is right now implementing the WordStar program, because there is some pattern of molecule movements that is isomorphic with the formal structure of WordStar. But if the wall is implementing WordStar, if it is a big enough wall it is implementing any program, including any program implemented in the brain.”
#+end_quote

If consciousness - or an entire universe - can be created by nothing but math, an abstract concept merely said to /represent/ said universe, then every pile of pebbles is teeming with simulated universes. I find this conclusion ridiculous, but maybe you accept it as it is.

But then, why bother with complicated simulating hardware at all? Just shuffle some rocks at random. They represent numbers, after all, and reality is just numbers, so just declare that your latest shit is isomorphic to a universe where your consciousness is dwelling in eternal paradise, and blow your brains out at the next opportunity to escape this sad excuse for reality.

I'm kidding, of course - please don't take the above as a serious directive or invective directed at you personally. I mean only to point out how silly the idea that "reality is math" is, and how you can't possibly believe any such thing and care to live in the /actual/ reality.

I follow physics, and I have friends who study it. I aim to be a computer scientist by specialization (no time for everything unfortunately). However, string theory is the theory that aims to understand how /matter/ itself works and exists.

I was saying that if matter is just a pattern on this fundamental substrate, then matter itself is just an abstraction.

If /you/ are a materialist it follows that you believe that consciousness arises from interactions of matter. Then it follows that IF (and that's the if that we'll probably differ on)matter can be abstracted, and you abstractly simulate that matter, then consciousness can arise from interaction of that matter[1]. Then the way it will have no way to tell that the matter it interacts with is virtual to us in the containing universe.

Traditional simulations are not even close to the level that abstracts an entire physics.

I believe our universe is more "real" than a simulation or a brain in a vat because that simulation is a subset of our reality.

That is, I don't believe that a computer describing matter is the same thing as strings - if they exist - doing whatever it is they do to /create/ matter. It is a long and unsubstantiated leap to say that just because we don't know how matter comes about, but have some mathematical models that might describe it, that these models can /create universes./

  Then the way it will have no way to tell that the matter it interacts with is virtual to us in the containing universe.

Again, you are having to ASSUME consciousness at the outset to then claim that the simulated universe is /real to them/. This is backwards, you are begging the question. You claim simulated physics will create consciousness, but then you use the simulated consciousness to justify the "reality" of the simulated physics! it's a closed loop.

  Traditional simulations are not even close to the level that abstracts an entire physics

And cannot be! I agree that this is the key element we are circling around.

All simulations are by definition lower resolution than the universe they are running in. You cannot be higher resolution than reality, everything in your simulation is comprised of the material you are attempting to break down or describe, and must by necessity be more complex than the thing being simulated.

For this reason, you cannot have a "perfect" simulation of the fundamental layer of physics. a simulation will always be a bit blurry, compared to reality. And again, regardless of the fidelity, simply describing something with numbers does not physically create that thing!

At this point, though, I'm not sure we are even arguing about my original position. I want to restate it, in case our disagreement has actually dissolved.

My position is that, when deciding how to create artifical minds for the purpose of "uploading" humans to avoid death, the safest option is to reproduce the physical structure of the brain, and not rely on software that merely simulates behavior.

This is because we do not (and possibly cannot) know what exact physical processes are necessary to create consciousness. We only know that physical human brains are /sufficient./

Software run on a general computing machine that is not phyiscally similar to a brain has a low probability of being conscious, IMO, and is not a safe bet when gambling with the survival of human consciousness.

I don't believe it is sufficient to simulate the physical structure of a brain, because a mere simulation is not the same thing as the physical process that produces or controls matter. A description of a thing is not the thing itself.
