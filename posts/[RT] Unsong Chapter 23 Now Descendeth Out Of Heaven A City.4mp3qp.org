*** So even God is having trouble hooking up with Metatron.

Sounds like one of those pre-cellphone comedy schticks where two people keep just missing each other.

**** Or possibly Nemo is Metatron, and his ship (the /Not a Metaphor/) is in fact appearing at the locations as predicted.

Doesn't appear to make sense with the previous chapter's description:

#+begin_quote
  Since the cracks appeared in the sky, word had come from sailors of a mysterious boat, all purple with golden sails. They would see it on the horizon, but when they tried to approach it vanished at impossible speeds. Sometimes atop the boat they would spot a light, brilliant shining white, like an angelic figure. And the angels said ah, yes, it is Metatron risen from the deep, but you will not catch him, for he keeps his own counsel. And none see him and live.
#+end_quote

But I've never let a story get in the way of good tinfoil.

***** Not a Metaphor anagrams neatly to Hop a Metatron - possibly displaying their intent to 'jump' the Metatron, as a group.

Honestly, I think the one thing that Captain Nemo very definitely is not is an ordinary human being.

Edit: Actually, I could see him turning out to be some super enlightened guy, actually. I could see it turning out that Captain Nemo is in some respect a reaction to The Illuminatus! Trilogy's Hagbard Celine (and therefore a second-order reaction to Atlas Shrugged's Ragnar Danneskjöld, who Hagbard Celine is in some respects a reaction to). The whole 'mysterious figure who is enlightened and sails in a mysteriously amazingly powerful ship that is colored unusually dispensing whatever plot-actions are required' archetype is something I could definitely see Scott drawing on.

** The Name they're referring to is the Mistral Name, rather than the Tempestuous Name, right? That was given to Ana by her laptop [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-11-drive-the-just-man-into-barren-climes/][in Ch 11]]:

#+begin_quote
  And the third the Mistral Name, which according to the document's somewhat ominous description “called the winds”.
#+end_quote

So presumably there's some time traveler or precog or reality bender who fully intended Ana to be on this ship. Why?

** This is probably irrelevant, but:

#+begin_quote
  “IN ORDER TO INSTANTIATE THE NEW JERUSALEM, YOU MUST GATHER TOGETHER ALL OF THE LSD IN THE CITY AND PLACE IT IN A RESERVOIR WHICH I WILL SHOW YOU"
#+end_quote

It feels like this "which I will show you" formulation is very similar to God's demand of Abraham that he take his son to be sacrificed:

NIV Genesis 22:2

#+begin_quote
  "Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.”
#+end_quote

(I only remembered this because of Hyperion. The Scholar's Tale: The River Lethe's Taste is Bitter has left scars)
