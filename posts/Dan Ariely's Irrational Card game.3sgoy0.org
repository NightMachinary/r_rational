*** Exactly. The gameplay mechanics seem really bare-bones (and probably not very well thought-out - at least that's my prior for tacked-on amateur game design, having seen a lot of it). So what you're left with is lots of experimental psychology trivia. And while I really like experimental psychology trivia, there are better mediums for sharing it than a card game.

*** When I look at the trivia games that I play, most of them have somewhere in the hundreds of questions. Trivial Pursuit has something like 6,000, Wits & Wager has 900 ... this game has 75. The game is won when you have an answer card from all 5 categories or when you have 10 in total. So assuming that on your first playthrough you have 4 players, perfect play means that you could still go through half the deck (40 cards) and imperfect play means you'll go through more.

So yeah. Definitely an interesting idea, but there's not enough trivia to sustain it because you'll very quickly know all the answers.

That should reduce it by about 50%.

(Oh sorry, you said psychology, not economics.)

** In my professional experience, games devoted to teaching people something are usually terrible, and I never back anything on KS, but I figured this would be of interest.

** I agree that it's irrational to produce a card game with no replay value.

***** It doesn't; it says something about how ratoinal/irrational it is to produce the card game.

When you can make over $150,000 by making a game with no replay value, it sounds pretty rational to make that game.

To buy the game, on the other hand....

****** If you would pay $N (whatever the game price was) for an Anki deck to help you learn all this information, then it's worth it. And make sure to add in the value of the social network time with friends to your value of N.

But, yeah, not worth it to me.

****** Yep, you're completely right. I don't actually know what I was thinking here. Probably just didn't read it right. Oh well, live and learn.
