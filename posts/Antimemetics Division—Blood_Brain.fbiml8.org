  Inevitably, like an uncounted number of newcomer Foundationers before him, Wheeler loses a significant number of hours browsing the entries. The Foundation has a specific and recognisable house style, which is to describe even the most mind-bogglingly weird anomalies in absolutely mundane, factual terms. [...] it makes for bizarrely compelling reading.

I like that, in-universe, actual Foundationers read the SCP entries for fun. Bizarrely compelling indeed.

  Even heavily redacted --- different users see different amounts of redaction, but /there is plenty of data which he can't access no matter whose identity he uses/ --- it makes for bizarrely compelling reading.

****** That likely means it's restricted to O-level directors and employees of other sites than 19. However, you're right - some info is redacted because the words are anomalous and shouldn't even be written down and/or read. For example, in the file numbered [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/taboo][4000]], there are several times they reference somebody repeatedly referring to The Unnamable Gateway In The Chimney by a certain name, but they cannot write that name down, so they redact part of it. I think it's likely that O-level people wouldn't even see that, because it wasn't even written down originally.

** (spoilers for this chapter)

Wheeler is just the best. I love that he kills 3125's avatar using the same weapon George Barsin refused to use because he wanted to spare the kid. Without any training, Wheeler is doing better than most SCP agents before him.

This story is amazing. It nails that SCP ambiance in a way few other stories do.

Also, I guess this confirms satellites still exist.

Aren't Wheeler memory-washed high level SCP agent himself?

His (dead) wife, Marion Wheeler, was a SCP director.
