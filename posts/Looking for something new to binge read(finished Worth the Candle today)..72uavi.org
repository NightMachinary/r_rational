Once again, I am done with an amazing piece of literature and feel like this is it, this time I have really exhausted all the great stuff out there. time for the horrible long wait, winter has come. Well, things had always worked out in the end, but recently the search has become quite difficult, I think this time I need help.(seriously,I can't go through the day without at least 5 hours of reading. save me!).

What I am looking for is always the same thing, a protagonist who works hard within an established and well explained magic/combat system to get better at something... and the rational touch. Romance and good character interactions/dialogue are always a great bonus, And strong professional writing is a must( One of the reasons I could never get into those Wuxia novels/japanese LN).

This general personal preference always reflects on the stories I love:

HPMOR

Mother of learning

The games we play

Harry potter and the natural 20

The good student

Worth the candle

Savage Divinity( I wouldn't call it a rational fic, but good nonetheless)

Cradle series by will wight

A virtual dream

Dream drive

Not rational, but I also enjoyed- Not this time, fate and Professor Arc by Coeur. Mostly because of the comedy, time loop aspect and the great character interactions.

I have tried and couldn't get into: worm, The Wandering inn, The arcane emperor.

Anything( webnovels, books, manga, comics) along those lines that already has at least one book worth of content published is welcome.


** I've been enjoying [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/][The Gods Are Bastards]] recently. There is quite a lot to it, though, so you won't finish it in one binge. There are a number of main characters, and mostly they work hard (well some more than others) at getting better at stuff.

Also, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/][With this ring]] has had quite a lot of good character empowering themselves stuff over the years.

*** I'll second With This Ring, with a caveat: I think it's very much the "junk food" of superhero stories. There's no grandiose story-spanning arcs like Worm, or exploration of deep social issues like Strong Female Protagonist or The Metropolitain Man.

But it's there. It's just that story that consistently has a new post every single day (the author is /really/ serious about that), with consistently okay writing, fun moments, mini character arcs, explorations of DC Comics and superhero tropes, etc.

**** Why is it junk food? Among its main themes are deconstruction, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift][technology uplift]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech][schizotech]], and it works on these themes quite well. It also has good fight scenes and rational (if somewhat marysueish) protag.

It does have a slower-paced, “zoomed-in” narrative that also includes slice-of-life moments, but that's just what its format is --- it's not trying to gain its competitive ability through the story length alone (which is what I'd call “junk reading” --- just feeler chapters, but lots of'em).

Though admittedly I haven't checked on this story for some time by now, its quality could've deteriorated from what I know.

** "Worth the Candle" is pretty high on the list of things I've binged recently, but you've already read that, alas. If you didn't say you were against xianxia I would have recommended "Forty Millenniums of Cultivation" which is pretty much the /Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann 40K and the Methods of Rationality/ fic that the margins of HPMOR Ch. 64 were too small to contain, except that it's more "The Methods of Economics and Engineering" that are creeping in around the sides of the xianxia cliches. "The Erogamer" (requires login, very NSFW) has some of the same actually-thinking-about-the-implications as "Worth the Candle", plus the author is into either stats or ML and sometimes throws in math easter eggs or references. It happens to be randomly true that I've been rereading "Alchemical Solutions" (the wormfic) which might not be too far off the theme of your list. In case you weren't already on notice, ShaperV aka E. William Brown, the author of Time Braid, has an original SF book "Perilous Waif".

*** (Minor thoughts.)

After reading through the first 97 chapters of 'Forty Millenniums of Cultivation', chapter 79's “Amiableness is Amiableness. Happiness is happiness. Blazing flames are flames. But Dreams... aren't something that can be sold!" was surprising and refreshing, the main character choosing the route of greatest utility and engineering-knowledge-acquisition even in the face of hotbloodedness, friendship, and the dramaticness of slaughter. Making the choice that was right for him, rather than taking the easier route of smooth interpersonal relationships.

At the same time, I had an unhappy worry that this would turn out to be lip service, and that the narrative would forcefully push him to the path in conflict with those values he'd chosen (and in favour of friendliness and hotbloodedness), after token resistance.

As part of in parallel with the feared pushing, the interpersonal side of the chosen path went to extreme lengths to throw its face away as far as possible, making itself as unattractive as possible.

The true finally-followed path, revealed in chapter 97, did not make me happy.

I must now (rant about/)paraphrase conversations from a completely different author!

--------------

"Hey, there's an opportunity for violence and conflict! Are you going to join in?"

"No, for I am a noble soul, and would far prefer spending the time with my loved ones here. I have chosen that I will not be going."

"Ooh, ooh, here are now some random reasons that you can't avoid going!"

"Oh well. VIOLENCE AHOY!"

[Repeat x2-20]

--------------

Specific plotthread (Coiling Dragon):

"Only two more Macguffins and you can reach your special level to become more powerful than anyone ever, something that you've always dreamed of!"

"Yes! I long for it so much!"

"Okay, now you've gotten one, just one more to go! Then you can finally attain what you've always dreamed of!"

"No, no... I would have to choose someone to kill in order to take the last Macguffin I need, so I'm just going to shelve that whole idea."

"Okay, now there's someone here who viciously hates your guts and is part of a group trying to kill you and your loved ones, and he also has a Macguffin you need! Are you going to get his Macguffin?"

"No, no... no call for violence, it would be so uncouth to raise my hand against him."

"Hey! You went up against the final boss with only half-baked incomplete power, and now he's going to kill you--"

"QUICK QUICK I HAVE TO QUICKLY KILL SOMEONE FOR THEIR MACGUFFIN!"

/"I am the final boss. I am responsible for all the worst unnecessary misery and suffering and torment that you have experienced. If you kill me normally, I will die tormented and regretful, my dearest wish unfulfilled, and you will finally have delivered true punishment, or vengeance, or whatever. If you instead use your full power to kill me, I will die completely happy and satisfied, thinking 'All those horrible things I did? Worth it!'. Will you make me happy?"/

"Yes. Yes, fulfilling your dearest wish--which you did horrible things to my loved ones for--and making you happy is a worthwhile thing to do. In fact, it's so worthwhile I'm even going to kill lots of non-complicit bystanders too with the power of this strike, and not display even a moment of guilt or regret, despite my earlier words about not killing even one murderous enemy for his Macguffin that would bring me to my own desired heights of power."

/"Joy!"/

--------------

Edit: ...Ahh, and more memories...

"...And then, for personal benefit, I slaughtered an entire family, including the elderly and weak and babies, every single one I could find."

"Meh, it happens. Morally neutral thing, in the world we live in."

"Oh, and though you never had any interactions with them or knew anything about them, it turns out you shared some of their genes."

***** It's not what I would call "strong professional writing", but nothing OP listed that I've read meets my standards for that, so it may be worth ignoring me.

Fimbulwinter and sequels are particularly great for the "Protag builds things, works with others, doesn't completely ignore potential allies, etc" feeling that is missing from so much. It's particularly bad if you mind stunningly blatant self-inserts that the author doesn't seem to realize aren't subtle at all.

******* Japanese light novels have a style that tends to sound very conversational, understandably given their influences.

All the xianxia I've glanced at, including Cultivation 40K, has what translates as a kind of oddly and repetitively stylized purple prose, but maybe sounds completely normal in Chinese.

Don't speak enough of either language to say for sure but translation quality standards seem slightly higher with JLNs, which might have something to do with the smaller number of translations and slower release schedules.

The story features a very consistent system, and a main character that starts very weak (physically and mentally) and gets progressively smarter and stronger in a believable way. It is also rather funny.

As should be apparent from the link, the story has quite a lot of NSFW content. In fact, there are a couple of interludes early on that can be pretty much skipped if one isn't interested in smut but, after reader complaints, the author reduced the amount of sex significantly.

On the other hand, it's pretty dark and depressing; the protagonist is bitter and self-destructive in some ways, and her quest isn't exactly motivated by healthy reasons. Still worth a try.

[[http://www.prequeladventure.com/][Prequel Adventure]] The story can be extremely depressing, not in the "Holy shit this character I liked just died" way, but in a way that hits very close to home. Like, "Holy shit, this girl is a loser, I am really not comfortable with how much like her I am". The characters builds herself up, in the sense that she starts at the bottom of the barrel, with nowhere to go but up.

The moments where Katia does get her wins feel like some of the most moments I've felt from any work of fiction. This is a story that tells you something about yourself, and in a twisted way, gives you hope for the future.

There's also the fact that as far as I can remember (it's been a couple years since I read Pact) he had basically no allies and almost everybody was out for his head.

I am not saying he made the best or most optimized choices, but neither did he choose stupid things (most of the time). Actually, the point of my comment was to warn about the fact that regardless of his choices, he only survives each encounter by sacrificing something.

Much like Worm, I would say it suffers from a pacing problem, with no time to unwind and relax and a protagonist that simultaneously has both plot armor and heaps of suffering piled upon him.

My problem is both sides have an enormous number of options for quickly and decisively ending the other. None are used because they apparently suffered partial lobotomies. Hermione make reasonable mistakes and is disproportionately harped on, and everyone is shown to be in the wrong for criticizing her. When she does something stupid "we can't use ambush tactics against the murderers, torturers, and rapists, as that would be wrong" no one calls her out on it. This is war. People are tortured to death by an enemy that they are *letting go*. Someone being treated as perfect and/or being hated for no reason just to show what a fucking martyr they are when there are perfectly rational reasons to hate them makes them a Mary Sue.

Now, how I remember the ambush thing : the enemy wouldn't fall for it unprepared more than one or two times ; and consequently, that would jeopardize their ability to perform it in the near future, so they should try to wait some time between rituals.

I'll have to keep those points in mind (especially the "letting go" one) when I decide to go for a second read of this story ;)

Side note : last chapter I was surprised to see Ron basically proposing to hunt and kill death eaters and even more surprised that it got a non offended answer (roughly "well, absolutely but let's be careful, 'kay ?")\\
A position I can't imagine this Hermione sharing exactly : she knows that she will have to kill at some point (and that she most certainly did it in the heat of the moment recently) but I'm pretty sure she would rather avoid doing so if she could.

**************** Oh, I didn't read that one yet.\\
Well, I like Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, but it's hard to humanly/realistically relate to the character. I mean, if it weren't for the intelligence boost given to basically everyone in the cast that goes way beyond the point of making them "not stupid", this Harry would be quite a mary sue of his own kind.

(but again, I may not have exactly the same understanding of that term : to me, a character too perfect making problems non existent, being used to solve them in a deus ex machina fashion, or making the story uninteresting when used as a main character)

***************** A Mary Sue is someone who is perfect /to the author./. Who never makes mistakes according to the author, who only gets in trouble because of unreasonable people being unreasonably harsh.

A Mary Sue is usually a "genius" to gain these traits, but a genius fighting other geniuses is a more even playing field than a Sue is comfortable with, since it's possible for them to lose

****************** "to the author"

* checks definitions around *

oh, well... huh... nope...\\
The "author" part of those definitions is basically about how a Mary-Sue is generally a self representation of the author, nothing being said about that author believing or not that this character is perfect or not (which in itself would be saying quite a lot about that writer)

The notion of "too perfect" is brought, though, and I'm not sure I can see how an author would wish (aside from writing a parody) to make a character or story "too much" something. The pejorative aspect of the term speaks for itself.

So... Hermione doesn't think of trying to use elf magic to apparate in the horcrux cavern because of... nobody. She just dismissed the idea by herself when she thought about it... I don't see how the author could be willing to let her make such mistake if he or she wanted her to be perfect.

Hermione jumps in the middle of a battle like a noob : that is so perfect... right ?

So she can be shit on for making a reasonable mistake, thus making her a martyr. To silence the critics who called her stupid for his various other stupid actions saying "see, she's not perfect! I made her forget something once!" To make her more a self-insert Mary Sue.

Suffering heroically for reasonable or minor mistakes is totally in keeping with a Mary Sue.

** I've read (and enjoyed) almost everything you listed.

If you like "The Good Student", you may also enjoy Mooderino's other two stories:\\
[[http://gravitytales.com/novel/how-to-avoid-death-on-a-daily-basis][How to Avoid Death on a Daily Basis]] - It's an atypical portal fantasy. The main character is a selfish asshole, but in a good way. Can't say if it's especially rational, but it is a heck of a lot of fun.

[[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/10293/bitter][Bitter]] - An atypical LitRPG story with a (refreshingly) female non-gamer as a main character. Lots of fun as he explores the idea that it's a game . . . some of the the worst excesses of game companies. Certainly rational-adjacent.

As far as I know the MC is cis female, but there are no relationships, as such, in the story so far.

***** Ok, that makes sense.

I suppose my confusion stemmed from the fact that I just assume that the characters would question the narrative. I assume that step zero in every Saturday Munchkin thread is "Who else suddenly has super powers?"

Of course, that isn't the default, and it's my fault for thinking it was.

#+end_quote

The humor is VERY dry and self deprecating. I frequently laugh out loud at it, though. It's almost a parody/farce as everyone around the MC tries to do the tropey thing while he face palms.

There is mild sex and arguably romance, but it's not particularly romantic. The MC is a misanthrope who has a hard time accepting affection.

** I see we have a similar taste in fiction. I've been in a wuxia/xianxia kick lately, but it's very hard to find anything readable, all translated LN I've found are trash.

If you liked the Cradle series and Savage Divinity, you'll probably enjoy [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/][Forge of Destiny]]. It's a xianxia quest currently being written on Sufficient Velocity. If you haven't seen a forum quest before it's something like a choose your own adventure story where everyone who has an account on the forum can vote on the options the author gives after each "chapter" or update. As sufficient velocity's (and it's sister forums: spacebattles and QuestionableQuesting (NSFW)) userbase tends to act mostly rational it's very enjoyable.

It's worth reading it one the forum just to see the discussion and thoughts behind the choices, but if you prefer to read in a ebook like me I'll leave a fairly up to date version in epub [[http://www120.zippyshare.com/v/DcMKrdro/file.html][here]].

** You should look at the d&d [[http://www.digital-eel.com/blog/ADnD_reading_list.htm][appendix n.]]

From there, I'd highly recommend Fritz Leiber's Farfrd and The Grey Mouser series. Starting with /Swords And Devilry/.

Leiber is (perhaps) the originator of the trope Swords and Sorcery, Thieves (Adventures) Guilds, and basically the whole modern concept of humorous fantasy (L. Sprague de Camp's /Complete Compleat Enchanter/ came later).

Gary Gygax based huge amounts of AD&D on Leiber's works. Nearly all of the stories you have mentioned and everything in modern fantasy draws from Leiber. As much or more so than JRR Tolkien.

Read it, you'll understand better.

You can find all of it on sale as epubs or (better) at your local library.

For web serials? Maybe check out [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]]?
