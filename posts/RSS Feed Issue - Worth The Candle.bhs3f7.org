** If you have an AO3 account, you can 'subscribe' to a work to get an e-mail when it updates. This is not what you're asking for, but depending on your intended use might be helpful.

For my WTC updates, I usually either see get discord notification from AlexanderWales' discord, or see it here on [[/r/rational]].

*** I've cludged a solution using my RSS reader, feedly. I added the Worth The Candle chapter index page as a board so I can pull it up to check updates. Not sure how boards work, if they tell me when the page is modified I'll be well pleased.

** The way I deal is just use [[/r/rational][r/rational]] as a RSS feed, just add .RSS to the url and Bam, RSS feed. It is useful for MoL (though RR has a RSS feed for it now), PGTE, and WtC, so it works for me.

*** Does this work because reddit specifically supports it?

** I've just figured out how to create a WTC rss feed.

The rss link is:

[[http://createfeed.wprssaggregator.com/extract.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F11478249%2Fnavigate&amp;in_id_or_class=&amp;url_contains=11478249&amp;order=reverse]]

This will show the ten most recent updates.

** Those RSS feeds will tell you when a new work in a tag is posted - I don't think AO3 has feeds for when a specific work is updated with new chapters.

*** So there are multiple types of tags, some of which that get a RSS feed and some that don't?

The genre-related tag /LitRPG/ doesn't get a RSS feed. The specific work tag /Naruto/ gets a RSS feed. Is there a minimum amount of works necessary to get a RSS feed? Is there a minimum number of authors?

Edit: It looks like the number of works or authors in a tag [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Alternate%20Universe%20-%20Fantasy/works][don't have any effect]]. This enormous tag doesn't get one.

**** Naruto is not a specific work, it's a fandom that includes 39891 works. (the WtC tag you linked is /also/ not a specific work - it's a tag that happens to only include WtC).

I don't know how exactly the taxonomy of tags works. I know you also don't get the "sort and filter" sidebar on some tags, and I think the AO3 admins pick which ones are popular enough to provide those features for (I assume it involves a fuckton of extra server-side indexing).

Either way, none of this is what you're asking for. These RSS feeds - including the one you linked - are updated when a /new work is posted within the given tag/, not when a /new chapter is posted within a specific work/. As far as I can tell, AO3 does not provide RSS feeds for that.

That's the link I use. It relies on the author actually posting on Reddit whenever there's a chapter but it works pretty well so far.
