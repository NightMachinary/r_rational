** The thing I disliked most out of Range was the ending. It is good he is rewriting it but honestly I will not have time to read it.

*** I liked the fatalistic end. Sometimes we /fail./ Utterly and completely. That was what happened in Ra, a cascade of failure after failure on the part of humanity against a threat they had created themselves. The fact that anyone survived at all is a miracle.

**** I think the thing most criticised about /Ra/'s ending isn't its downer nature --- which is fantastic, I agree --- but the way Rachel Ferno enters the plot at the last minute, shuffles everyone to the sidelines, and saves the day^{1} on her lonesome. Which is fixed here.

Actually, this ending is even a /more/ complete defeat. In the old one, Actual Humanity lost the new war and was forced to flee into the unknown, but with nobody dying. In the new one, Rachel --- the person resurrection of whom was the main goal of one of the protagonists --- anticlimactically and irrecoverably dies after doing nothing of consequence, and Actual Humanity is uploaded into Ra, in a full surrender to the Virtuals' ideology.

It's perfect.
