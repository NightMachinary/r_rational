Crowley goes to see a trauma therapist. 16 chapters, 99K words, complete. By Nnm on AO3:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593]]

The night I started reading this, I did not expect that I'd stay up past 5am to finish it. That's what happened, and I was sobbing and blowing my nose at the end, and it felt so good. Not sobbing in a distraught way, but in a "that was so satisfying and strangely affirming and it seems I really needed that" way. 

If you've seen the Good Omens miniseries (or read the book), and you got something out of it, then I highly recommend this fanfic.

*Rational characteristics:* I could reasonably tag this [EDU], as the author describes many aspects of the theory and practice of trauma therapy. People with psych / therapy backgrounds have written deeply appreciative comments, even jokingly asking if they could get CE credits for reading it. The story provides a nuanced, layered, and thoughtful dive into the characters' thinking, emotions, strategies, and motivations. All the characters are trying their damnedest to navigate the various intersecting rulesets of their world, and the cracks around the edges of those systems.

*Note:* I found it a bit hard to get through the many appearances of the word "professional" in the first few chapters. I recommend treating it like a Greek epithet, like "gray-eyed goddess." The writer finds their stride and develops that character in more depth as the chapters go on.


** The trauma being the bookshop fire? I don't often read fanfic, but this sounds like a great premise. Speaking as someone who's prone to catastrophic hypotheticals about my loved ones being dead in a ditch somewhere, the idea that that event would have a lasting effect resonates with me (it was actually the subject of the only fanfic I've written as an adult, although that was nowhere near as in-depth as this). I'm also excited to see a ratfic recommendation for something focused on emotional exploration rather than passionless munchkinry, because I am a big sap. So I'm sold. I'll edit this comment with thoughts on the piece once I've read enough to form an opinion on the execution.

*Edit:* I've read through most of it and can confirm it's very good. It's a thoughtful and detailed character analysis (about much more than just the bookshop fire), sincerely emotional without crossing the line into sappy, and the writing is surprisingly deft when it comes to subtext despite so much of the story being /about/ explicating the subtext in the original work. I also like that the character of the therapist is given as much attention and depth as the canon characters, rather than just acting as a framing device.

The "professional" thing didn't bother me; I think it works as a representation of the lens through which the therapist sees herself, judges herself, controls herself. It's also only one of several examples of (apparently) intentional repetition in the narration.

*Edit 2:* The ending is extremely fun.

I would recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480][A Song For Two Voices]] then. No knowledge of canon is necessary.

** That was really good! It definitely classified as “rational” in that the characters took a systematic approach to solving their problems. Worm fans that like Jessica Yamada's interlude will definitely like this story. It was sometimes repetitive in its introspectiveness, but I think that was an intentional choice of the author to communicate the slow progress that real therapy can require.

** This has a lot of things missing from most rational fiction and I think everyone on this subreddit should read it. Normally writers gloss over what is explored in great depth and clarity here. These are complex, flawed people grappling with issues that cannot be summarized or be seperates from their analysis by their nature. A great deal of careful thought is put into it and it is imperfect because no things are perfect and one has to face problem of being unable to face a problem but still need to have it faced and where to move forwards from there.

** Fantastic story. Awesome use of prose, conveys actual knowledge, fascinating characters, and an actual /story/ with a beginning, a dramatic climax, and a satisfying ending. Probably the best story I've found through [[/r/rational]]. Thanks for posting.
