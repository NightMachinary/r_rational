I'm honestly curious whether it's possible to have one fic be both. That one Harry Potter fic where he's a lazy hufflepuff comes close but doesn't quite hit the line for being a ratfic.

From his perspective, it is though. He plans things out by rules of narrative, and while the other characters think he's nuts for that, he's actually still in another world that runs on things like that, so he guesses things correctly more often than you'd think.

From any protagonist's perspective their decisions are rational, unless they're making excuses for them. Twilight isn't made rational by that argument, so neither is Harry Potter and the Natural 20.

#+begin_quote
  he guesses things correctly more often than you'd think.
#+end_quote

Guessing doesn't matter. Any decisions he makes on the supposition that the world is a story that turn out to be true are happenstance and coincidence; more of the decisions he makes under that supposition turn out to be wrong than correct, anyways. I think the biggest thing that disqualifies it from being rational fiction is that, for the most part, the story doesn't have long-term consequences for mistakes being made. It's hard to remember those mistakes even exist, because they're relatively small in comparison.

Not like it matters; not everything needs to be rational, particularly not comedy. Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is great and hilarious, at least in part because Milo's decisions are at odds with what the readers know about the world of Harry Potter.

** That really depends on which definitions you're using for "crack fic" and "rational fic."

TV Tropes says a crack fic is any story whose premise and events would be completely implausible in Canon. Fanlore dot org says crack has a fundamentally ludicrous premise, or otherwise includes a plethora of unbelievable, incredible, or just plain silly elements. I don't see anything about any of that which contradicts the characteristics of either rational fiction or rationalist fiction listed in the sidebar.

From what I've seen, I think having at least Level 2 Intelligent characters (preferably Level 3) pretty much automatically qualifies a story as rational fiction, and nothing about a ludicrous premise precludes those characters from reacting rationally to said premise. In theory, there should be nothing preventing a rational!crackfic, though I don't think a fic has been written yet which /actually/ meets /both/ standards (and yes, I've read the other comments in this thread; HP and the Natural 20 isn't really crack, and Seventh Horcrux isn't rational, and the parodies were /pure/ crack (also, parodies don't automatically inherit the title of "rational" just because they happen to be parodies of something rational)).

I think you have to be /really/ intent on "showcasing 'rationality'" in order to write rationalist fiction, and I don't think that mindset is likely to decide a crack fic is the best way to go about accomplishing that goal. I think it's unlikely that there will ever be such thing as a rationalist!crackfic unless someone takes it as a challenge and decides to do it just for the sake of seeing if it can be done.

If you're truly interested in rational!crackfic, you might want to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11616203/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Irrational-Odyssey][watch this space]]. There's a rough draft of the first half of the first chapter acting as a placeholder there at the moment, but it'll be replaced by the real deal before June 1st. I didn't initially conceive of it as a crack fic, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be received as such.

For what it's worth, I prefer to think of it as a rational!candyflippingfic.

However, in a "rational" story, the "fundamentally ludicrous premise" would have to be extended backward throughout the entire setting, rather than merely appearing from thin air at the start of the story. This would entail a large amount of work for the author--and what if the "fundamentally ludicrous premise" turns out to be totally incompatible with anything remotely resembling canon?

**** That's just the thing; I addressed that in the very next paragraph. As long as the characters act/react the way "rational" characters would act/react, it's a "rational" story.

To quote Yudkowsky:

#+begin_quote
  If the character gets catapulted into a fantasy world, they actually notice the resemblance to their fantasy books, wonder about it, and think to themselves, "If this were a fantasy book, the next thing that would happen is X..." (which may or may not happen, because Watt-Evans doesn't write typical fantasy books). It's not done as a postmodern self-referential schtick, but as a faithfulness-to-reality; they think what a real rational person would think, in their shoes.

  If the character finds out that it is their destiny to destroy the world, they don't waste time on immense dramatic displays - after they get over the shock, they land on their feet and start thinking about it in more or less the fashion that you or I would in their shoes. Not just, "How do I avoid this? Are there any possibilities I've overlooked?" but also "Am I sure this is really what's going on? How reliable is this information?"
#+end_quote

It's not about world building, and it's not about the premise; it's about how the characters react to the situations they find themselves in.

*** My interpretation of the spirit of the question is more "is there any fiction that is a surreal satire of rational fiction tropes?"

Or possibly "is there any fiction that mashes setting-elements from disparate settings together incoherently like an inexperienced 12-year-old of an author is wont to do, and then attempts to thread a character through that setting, that---while possibly 'rational' under scrutiny---is also still performing the sorts of acts an inexperienced 12-year-old author would have a character perform."

My own simple take on this would be to imagine a rational character having semi-lucid dreams, with "their" actions being rational, while "the dream-world's" actions are surreal and silly---and where "the dream-world's actions" also includes controlling them sometimes, in the same way a DM can dictate what a player does sometimes.

(I guess I usually associate the term "crack fic" with silly, goofy humor.) And just to clarify, I meant soul-crushing in the sense that the happy ending we got in HPMOR was a trick, and HJPEV is actually in a much worse position than he was ever in during canon HPMOR ... well, I mean, he's basically in the same position of being completely at Voldemort's mercy, plus the emotional whiplash of "Just kidding, Hermione's still dead!", plus Voldemort can read his mind so he apparently can't even out-think him.

Anyway. I'm still eagerly awaiting more. You are awesome.
