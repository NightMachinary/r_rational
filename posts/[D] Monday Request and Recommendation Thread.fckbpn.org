Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread, which is being posted manually because Automod is apparently asleep on the job. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I highly recommend the film [[http://imdb.com/title/tt3281548/][Little Women]].

I thought it not only a great coming of age story, but also a really poignant portrayal of four intelligent and rational young women and their differing approaches to romance/courting, which they undertake within the paradigm that was true for most of history until very recently: that marriage signified the final death knell for whatever ambition or potential a woman might have had.

This film struck me surprisingly hard, emotionally. I find myself thinking about it often these past few weeks. Truly a great film that can be appreciated on multiple levels(my teenage sister loved the romance and the hunks, for example). Also, the multi level meta-textual ending was very clever!

The setting and characters are pretty novel (if not always likeable), and the writing itself is top-notch. The prose, the pace, the character moments are all well done. It truly feels like something written by a professional author.

*** 'Practical Guide to Evil' scratches a few of the same itches - instead of capes you have Named, there's still the hero/villain divide, and (without too many spoilers) there are some enemies or problems where Named need to work across the good vs evil divide. It's also fairly dark and depressing at times. That said, Worm is better-written on the whole, and has more side characters that are slightly better fleshed out. I'd call PGtE 'Worm, but shorter and more tightly plotted, plus it's fantasy instead modern'.

** Time to recommend [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/11022733006234505/Lord-of-the-Mysteries][Lord of the Mysteries]] again. My favourite rationalist novel, involving a quick-thinking protagonist in Lovecraftian fantasy Europe (also inspired by SCP Foundation, Pirates of the Caribbean, One Piece, and video games like Bloodborne & Darkest Dungeon) and a Chinese author that loves setting up 1000+ chapters old foreshadowing. Rereading the novel has been a great pleasure and the writer's seemingly innocent words early on sends chills down my spine after "knowing" what they were hinting at.

My favourite joke by the writer is how a detective character took the alias of the most famous fictional detective while solving all his cases via magical divination, then bullshitting a convincing explanation working backwards logically when asked how the hell he managed to get to the truth. I believed [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] had written about how Sherlock's deductions can't be reproduced by the readers in real life at all, and this seemed like a nod to that observation from the other side of the world.

Be warned that this is translated into English from the Chinese original though, and thus the prose suffers a bit from rather awkward word choices by the translator and some cultural differences (such as weird names for characters).

Chapters after the paywall can be found [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][here]] and on other sites.

******* Oh, I think “good” translation is always a balance between accuracy and accessibility, and the correct balance is highly subjective for both reader and translator.

I personally prefer the translation to carry as much of the original author's meaning as possible while still flow smoothly in the translated language, to be considered “good”. The translator's presence should be as subtle as possible. I am against rewrites with foreign cultural references replaced by native ones. I don't expect nor want translated works to be the same as if a native English writer wrote it, as part of the appeal (to me) is the exotic differences in writing style and cultural views that can be gleamed through the words.

*** My opinion as of chapter 130, which should be noted is fairly early on:

Category-wise, I would not call this rationalist, and it feels more rat-adj than rational. Although the protagonist feels rational enough, the world doesn't feel like it has any real optimization pressure, and non-MC characters feel a bit ditzy. Klein's power set is generally busted in a way that is bafflingly underutilized, and the whole ‘Divination Isn't All-Powerful' thing feels like exactly the opposite of what a reasonable person should be taking away from the events of the story.

Entertainment-wise, it's good. It's better translated than most other Chinese web novels, and it's well-paced as long as you don't take that to mean fast-paced. The worldbuilding is engaging, the main character is methodical in a good way, and the story is progressing well. It's not a tense story, or one I've felt the need to rush through, but rather one that is just consistently filling.

/Author's Description/: What would you do if you woke up alone in a forest in nothing but your pajamas?

This is a story about a man trying to answer that question as he navigates a world of monsters, magic, adventure, and numbers going up. It isn't all fun and games, though. Survival is tough when you are alone, and the dangers of this world are not to be underestimated.

This is a world governed by a system of stats, skills, and dialog boxes. It is vital to know how the system works if you want any chance of having a life of meaning. Too bad someone forgot to include the instruction manual.

/Author's Description/: On the world of Marconen, your first Break determines the trajectory of your life. Calvin chose magic. Without proper schooling or a mentor, the boy is dragged by the whims of fate across the face of the planet, blending together different schools of magic and powerful abilities to create something new.

But there's a deeper secret behind his success. Why was he born an exile from his country? Why is his System so strange, and why does it keep talking to him?

And as the march of time continues, something evil grows in power across the ocean.

/Note: The author includes a 'Harem' tag, which I guess is kinda accurate? But the harem aspect of the story has decreased significantly as time has gone on, and I have not found that it is present enough to bother me. If, y'know, I was bothered by harem fics. No comment. This also applies to the level of sexual content, which was never a lot to begin with./

/Note: Murderhobo style "rationalism" can be sorta seen if you squint and look at it funny. Ends up being humorous, to me./

Fortunately, there are alternatives...

/Note: While the sexual content is relevant to the story, each chapter with such is clearly labelled before hand, and skippable. It happens to be well written, I think, but the more important fact is that sexual contact happens, rather that the content of said interaction./

/Author's Description/: *It's the most-watched game show in the galaxy!*

In a flash, every human-erected construction on Earth--from Buckingham Palace to the tiniest of sheds to all the trucks and cars--collapses in a heap, sinking into the ground. 

The buildings and all the people inside, they've all been atomized and transformed into the dungeon: an 18-level labyrinth filled with traps, monsters, and loot. A dungeon so enormous, it circles the entire globe.

Only a few dare venture inside. But once you're in, you can't get out. And what's worse, each level has a time limit. You have but days to find a staircase to the next level down, or it's game over. In this game, it's not about your strength or your dexterity. It's about your views and your followers. It's about building an audience and killing those goblins with style.

*You can't just survive here. You gotta survive big.*

/Most Relevant Tags (acc to me)/: Space Opera, Multiple Leads, Cyberpunk, Sci-Fi

/Author's Description/: Set in the far future when humanity has reached the stars and finds it is not the first to do so. Alien technology has been left behind by a long dead race. Ancient cities, abandoned starships, temples and fortified bunkers all contain artefacts and devices far in advance of what humans have been able to produce. Technology that feels more akin to magic, so powerful it can allow a single person to dominate a star system. But these relics of another time have been left well-defended and behind bewildering and impenetrable security measures. 

There are those who are compatible with the alien technology, who can augment themselves to face the evermore extreme protocols in the depths of the alien ruins, and by doing so attain greater power. And there are those who just want to sell what they find to the highest bidder.

The rewards are high, but you have to be prepared to go further and risk more to discover the greatest secrets of a civilization that vanished long before the first human walked upright. Secrets that could irrevocably change humanity's future, or end it.

/Note: I haven't read Book 2, so far, which is 64 updates in. No particular reason, there was just a gap in updates between books 1 and 2, and I haven't gotten around to picking it back up. The point being, I don't know if the quality has kept up./

  The Perks of Immortality
#+end_quote

I'm the author of this story, thanks for linking to it. I'm continually surprised at how often it gets shared on this subreddit. I certainly didn't set out to write a rationalist fiction. I'm not complaining. I like rationalist fiction and was aware of it before I started writing the story. Maybe I can't help but write something that has at least some rationalist appeal. But there are many ways in which my story breaks from other rationalist fiction norms:

1. The MC is by no means brilliant. He isn't dumb either. But he isn't going to make huge leaps in logic or outsmart his enemies.
2. The MC is a man with a hammer. The hammer in his case is fighting and killing. He is aware that not all problems are nails, but hes only got a hammer so what's he gonna do?
3. I explicitly avoid the MC trying to munchkin the hell out of his powers. Not because they aren't munckinable, but because his personality just isn't the type to obsess over every little advantage.

Perhaps the one rationalist thing I have going for the story is that I can easily avoid deus ex machina. The rules of the story allow him to get killed and come back. Unlike most stories that have to break their rules to save the MC, I'd have to break my rules to kill the MC.

Most particularly, Rain is Level 3 Intelligent.

**** It's a decent story that I enjoy even though it's lacking any semblance of plot or protagonist agency.

My main critique of the story is that the magic system feels so blatantly built so the MC will appear special. I just don't understand why any system would advance skills/spells depending purely on the amount on the amount of Mana that is spent on them. Really? Not any of a hundred better indicators of progression and familiarity, but simply the resource that it takes to use it? (And which the MC specializes in)

That's like getting better at math for every pencil you wear down to a nub, or getting stronger muscles the more calories you eat. No, it just feels like the author designed the magic class he wanted, and then worked backwards from there. It's hard to call something like that rational.

And I'm well aware that the protagonist is in no way op, bla bla bla. My point stands.

#+end_quote

It would be a dumb argument though. XP is perfect at what it was designed to do, which is to encourage a player to kill enemies/win battles/finish quests by quantizing success and showing iterative progress towards greater power.

What would gaining power by spending mana encourage any halfway intelligent person to do, do you think? Does it look anything like the world of Delve to you? Because to me it does not, not in the slightest. Not combined with the fact that:

- all the relevant skills are tier 0 or 1
- low tier skill trees can be unlocked by anyone of any other "class" by simply spending a negligible amount of XP
- XP requirements apparently increase on a gentle linear slope- Rain was able to max level and max skill in a month or so while homeless and destitute. It takes other classes many years to do the same, supposedly.
- mage classes can be very, very strong and their main downside is a slow and weak initial power curve. What if they could level up many times faster?

and so on and so on.

******* I don't get why this matters. Taking a few years to level is hardly onerous. Inconvenient, sure, but hardly worth chosing a bad build to avoid. The key currency in Delve is the level cap, not XP.

The relevant skills can't be trivially unlocked by simply paying XP for low-tier skills, because Channel Mastery is hidden and most of the rest of the relevant stuff (Prismatic Intent, Aura IFF and Aura Compression) is tier 2 or up. For traditional builds XP is a scarcer resource, which means those won't be discovered by many people.

People don't pick Rain's build because it's not that good before level 26 (and it's terrible if you aren't support for a good team), which most people won't reach, and because figuring out how broken it gets at level 26 requires having explored the tech tree.

******** You're thinking small. Theres a reason that it's very, very hard to get arbitrarily powerful in any given setting. Most who try it die because it's *dangerous* or fail because it's *immensely difficult*. Think 1 in 10 million, or even higher.

In Delve you can reach demi-godlike power by simply shooting spells into the air! Besides being present when a blue dies very seldomly (Rain got 18 levels for sneezing on a high level blue) you don't have to get more skilled, achieve any insights, fight reams of progressively harder enemies, or even risk your life slightly. You just have to *spend a lot of Mana*. So if you go a mage class like the dke guy and you hire(or enslave) someone that boosts mana regen then suddenly world domination is 50% easier?

Does a world where no one recognizes this shortcut to power despite the barrier to knowledge being so low(see last comment) seem rational?

This is the part that people who complain about Delve's system don't seem to get - Blue monsters are incredibly rare. Tamed dungeons can only produce level ~5 Blues at best.

The level 18 Blue that showed up just after Rain teleported in was the only Blue in the area; after all, the flare of mana from the teleport attracted monsters, and it's the only one that showed up. Without the flare of mana, the party wouldn't have encountered the creature at all.

Teams killing blues max out at fairly small numbers, and blues are rare, which puts a hard limit on how many high rankers there are. At /any/ rank, reaching the level cap is acheivable with non-exceptional effort. All a high mana recovery gives you is the opportunity to get to that stage younger, which is practically worthless compared to having a good build. How many people actually have the need to gain 18 levels in a couple of months?

Everyone is busted AF, because everyone has ridiculous synergies (243 firebolts, or was it 729? 2187?). Rain would lose in a 1v1 match against a level 18 enemy, and lose /horribly/ against a lvl 26 enemy. Heck, just look at his theorycrafting for the Passive build.

(EDIT: Look at the Umbral Charger fight to see how he did as early in level 18 vs. a Level 10 monster)

Of course, that might change once he ranks up and can start getting more out of Aura Synergy paired with Aura Compression. Scaling the effect of all of your skills with (max ranks)^{2} is pretty good, and what he has is significantly better.

At level 26 he gets Prismatic Intent, and with all his skills hitting level 15, he becomes completely busted. My ‘PrismInt f26' build, which has Rain permanantly using Focus in combat (Detection is used to navigate), has

- 200k armour against all elements,
- complete shutdown of magic use by anyone else in a 275m radius,
- permanant Detection with 525m radius,
- 11x movement speed,
- all of the above permanantly active with enough mana spare to recover from empty in 22 seconds,
- and when he wants to do damage he deals out >500k burst, mixed element, in a 62.5m radius.

Prec f29 is even more busted, when Precision starts letting him run around at 1500x speed.

#+begin_quote
  You cannot create recognizable, learnable intelligence by declaring that your characters use a technique and therefore win. Level 3 intelligence exists on the level of paragraphs, not whole plots. It is in how your character arrives at the next thought shown one paragraph later. The ultimate story outcome doesn't matter to how well that cognitive algorithm would work in real life or whether the reader learned anything by reading it. Deciding that a character will win using some technique is telling the reader about intelligence, not showing it to them; it is praising the skill, but not yet explaining it. This isn't to say that your characters can never win when they use techniques. It's just that the part where the plot says they win doesn't constitute part of the difficult work of showing good thinking (though how a victory plays out can be important to the illustration).
#+end_quote

Rain's thinking is out-loud and reflects the author's attempts to reason about the setting through the character of Rain. It's very deliberate about doing this, and although I don't think SenescentSoul has the same incisive clarity that Eliezer does, I don't think he needs to.

There is a small matter of degree since your characters need to have actual intelligence to show those thoughts out loud, but I think for the most part Rain gets by.

The story itself is unrelated (it's about a Khajit struggling with depression, prior to the events of /TES: Oblivion/), but the, ah, format is very clearly inspired by Homestuck. It's hard to describe, but really easy to grok.

Warning: the story is pretty depressing at first. My advice is, try to stick to it past the second blackout; it's the lowest point of the story, and things get better from there.

*** Have you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498][The Library Unpublished]]? It is inspired by Northern Caves and the primary setting for most of the story is a series of anonymous texts in which two people discuss a mystery relating to weird book torrents.

*** It's not exactly chatroom per say, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6692113][Bad Publicity]] by Unpretty is a batman fic of people gossiping about Bruce Wayne on a well formated twitter. It's short, funny, and finished.

*** So far I've only found a few.

Enlightened Empire is on Royalroad. It's basically the usual social-uplift story with a person from modern age uplifting medieval society, except this time the protagonist keeps his past memories and instead gains modern day memories. One thing I liked is that he faces a lot of political opposition in his journey, which he both flounders and excels on. Can be hit or miss on that part. Also it's pretty well written for a webnovel.

Release that Witch is the chinese-novel version of the above (These two aren't related stories though, just the same genre), this time with magic. Same basic scenario, but less politics and much more combat and technological development. Much longer though and finished at 1500 chapters.

The Hero's War is apparently also quite similar, although I've heard mixed opinions on it. I haven't read it, so ymmv.

The Dao of Magic has a lot of combat, but a lot of it is also about the MC settling and building his base, as well as experimenting with the magic system. There's crafting in it as well.

Wake of the Ravager also has a lot of combat, but it's going towards base building as well right now. Might be worth looking into in the near future.

Farming for Gold has a protagonist who becomes a farmer in a vrmmorpg, and it follows from there. Lot's of farming and crafting.
