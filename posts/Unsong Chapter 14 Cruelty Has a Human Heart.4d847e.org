** All according to plan. After all, everything will go well, and Ana didn't have a plan to actually /extract/ Aaron from UNSONG, just to get to him.

Ana's (first half of a) rescue is necessary so that the Vanishing Name teleports him from/to "imminent rescue" instead of from/to "imprisonment" or "interrogation".

Of course, that person used the Vanishing Name too, so they'll just switch seats.

** Does anyone else have problems reading this with a TTS engine? I kind of liked the first few chapters but feel like it would be really hard for someone just like, one step more blind than me to be able to understand it. Not sure there is anything you can/should do about it I just wanted to bring it to your attention.

** Idea for a nigh-unbreakable klipah: first, get a large set of words that start with each letter of the alphabet (or just random words, really). Next, use the "A" word to represent the first syllable of the Name, the "B" for the second, and so on. A sample Name would look something like this:

#+begin_example
  APPLE BANANA CANTALOUPE DRAGONFRUIT ELDERBERRY APPLE ELDERBERRY CANTALOUPE 
#+end_example

Use a /different/ set of words for each Name, so another one could look like:

#+begin_example
  ATOM BARYON COULOMB DECAY ELECTRON FIELD BARYON GRAVITY HADRON
#+end_example

If you want to be trickier, then throw non-klipah words in the middle of the pgrase as well, but make sure that /all/ of the licenced users use the /same/ filler words.

Anyone who knows cryptography want to poke holes in this?

*** That's kinda like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad][one-time pad]]. In theory unbreakable, but not actually much of an encryption because you would need a new key for each message, and if you're gonna distribute a specialized key you might as well distribute the message itself.

One of the requirements listed is "that the signal be separated from the noise; that the parts which represent letters are fixed in advance and not separated by other parts representing other letters."

So maybe there isn't much signal in that klipah? Your system is much closer to a random scrambling than an encryption.

*** The repetition of the same word for the same syllable means you could get the semblance of the Name. Combine that with some Kabbalisitc knowledge and you could get the name.

A better solution would be to vary the word exchanged based on both the syllable and the position in the word.

  The repetition of the same word for the same syllable means you could get the semblance of the Name.
#+end_quote

The same syllable doesn't show up in the same name very often (I used bad examples above). I don't think that it would meaningfully shrink the search space.

The (prospective) Names in Ch. 1 would look like this (Duplicates bolded, and I did something wrong, as I have too few letters in many of them):

- ABCDEFG (x3)
- ABCDE*E*FGHIJKLMN (x7)
- ABC*C*DEFG
- ABCDEFG*G*HIJ...ZZZZZZ

Other Names:

- ABCDEFGHIJL (SCABMOM)
- ABCDEF (Moon Name)
- ABCDEFG (20/20 Vision Name)
- ABC (Tetragrammaton)
- ABCDEFGHIJLKLMN (Vanishing Name)
