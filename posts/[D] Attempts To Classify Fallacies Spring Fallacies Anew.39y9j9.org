** I'll point out that appeal to emotion (aka pathos) is one of the three rhetorical appeals; it's not a fallacy, even though everyone seems to treat it like one. It's the weakest appeal, but that's no reason to disqualify it outright.

There's a similar confusion about ethos and appeal to authority, but I digress.

** u/TimTravel:
#+begin_example
  Person 4: No, really, I'm a physicist, I've studied what you're talking about for a living, it doesn't work.

  Person 1: Appeal to authority!
#+end_example

This is the only one I object to. Experts believe what they believe for a reason. It is better to explain those reasons than to simply declare that experts believe it.

*** Correct. When an expert claims X, there are three circumstances in which this is a fallacy.

First, the experts themselves do not agree about X. Second, the expert is not an expert in the right topic. Lots of examples here. Third, this was a response to an evidence based argument. So if I say "X is false because of Y", then an expert who says "No, it is not" has just committed a fallacy. There are no exceptions to this rule. (Yes, it applies to flat-earth believers. If your expert cannot refute the claims of flat-earthers he needs to go back to school.)

** Things might get a bit slow on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], but I still come here for rational fiction and fanfiction, not to discuss logical fallacies, or worse, discuss the discussion of logical fallacies, or even worse, discuss the discussion of the fallacy of using logical fallacies. Looks like a cool discussion overall, but I will be downvoting it to reduce visibility.

I'm posting, rather than just silently downvoting, in hopes of directing this subreddit away from things like this and towards other things.

**** No problem! And I know people disagree with me on this, and have different ideas for [[/r/rational][r/rational]], and that's fine, but I wanted to point out that this actually seems like a relatively interesting topic, and I'm not downvoting it because it looks bad or anything. Just downvoting because I have a certain view of what [[/r/rational][r/rational]] should be about. I know I've posted links etc in the past in other parts of reddit and when they get downvoted with no explanation I'm like à² _à²

** I'm not seeing how this relates to rational fiction. Am I missing something, or is this off-topic and should be removed?
