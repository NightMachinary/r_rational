Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Let's talk about playing defense on the Internet. What strategies do you take, as a writer or other content creator, to avoid being the subject of a witch-hunt by people who misperceive, misunderstand, or mislike your work?

Three obvious techniques are:

- to try to not write stuff that's controversial, preventing the controversy from forming in the first place
- to use a pseudonym in a way that detaches your creator-identity from anything that could affect your life outside the pseudonym
- to ignore controversy surrounding the things you create, denying controversy any power over you

But what are the other techniques?

*** Assuming you're dealing with a mob organized around a few or one persons, you can always counterattack. It is with hilarious regularity that someone blasting another for saying an un-PC thing will have very un-PC things themselves buried in their twitter history or whatnot.

While this doesn't directly eliminate the controversy, it poisons the well against that particular campaign against you and makes it likely your attacker will shut up for a while out of embarrassment or panic.

For a conveniently topical use of this technique, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/cxef7r/whats_going_on_with_funimation/eymgifp/][this comment]] or just the thread in general. In short, a voice actor was fired due to allegations of workplace sexual harassment. Old audio tapes of other voice actors doing blooper reels of homophobic/racist/etc jokes contradict the alleged victim's claim that their workplace was strictly professional, which is now being used to cast doubt on her other claims, and especially over the company's reason for firing him.

** Am I just really really stupid?

About five and a half years ago, I got my first pair of legitimately legit headphones, Sennheiser Momentum (rebranded sometime in the last two or three years as Sennheiser HD1). The HD1 is currently like $199. When I got them on sale back in the day, they were $300 after $50 off. They're over-ears. Definitively the best headphones I've ever owned.

About 2 years later I got the Momentum In-Ears, for like $150 or $200, can't remember. The in-ears crapped out after just under 2 years when one of the buds stopped working, just like most buds I've ever owned of any brand (I've had lots of cheap brands of buds, including Skull Candy - I've had several expensive brands of buds, including Shure and Bose and Sennheiser). This might be a case of me mistreating literally every set of buds I've ever owned, so whatever.

I've previously owned over-ears from Bose and Skull Candy in the $150 to $200 range.

The pleather ear cups of my Momentums developed a gargantuan rip on the right ear cup about 2 or 3 months ago, when I started incorporating Farmer's Walks / Farmer's Carries / Loaded Carries into my workout routine (basically just pick up a set of heavy dumbbells and start walking - problem is that I did it outside in +90 degree weather). I've looked on Newegg and found "Momentum 1" replacement cups for like eight dollars, but idk if they'll fit and they're fabric instead of pleather.

So I got some eight-dollar Sony earbuds when my over-ears crapped out. They're legitimately 95% as good as the $150 Sennheiser buds. I was sincerely shocked at the sound quality of them.

One of my four cats, the oldest at 8-years-old by name of Venus, is very skittish. She was sitting on my lap today and got spooked, and once she's been spooked she's unwilling to be calmed down, so she stuck one of her claws into my left testicle and I was like "OH MY GOD FINE GET OFF ME THEN" and she jumped out of my lap and ripped my earbuds out of my ears and they smashed onto the floor. Once I finished feeling sorry for my testiculars and picked my headphones back up, I noticed the left earbud was broken in half with nothing but wires holding it together. It worked, but there's no way that would work with lifting weights or doing outdoor cardio.

So I went out and got some $15-dollar Sony MDR-ZX110s for fifteen dollars. */FIFTEEN DOLLARS./* They're about 3% better than the Sony earbuds that were almost as good as the $150 Sennheiser buds, and they're at least 87% as good as the $200-$350 Sennheiser over-ears. These fifteen-dollar headphones are better sounding than the normal-priced Bose headphones I've owned. In the process of choosing every set of headphones I've ever owned, I've demoed at least three exceptionally-well-known brands. These are definitely the second-best sounding headphones I've ever used. $15 bucks.

Is audiophile bullshit just bullshit? Like, I definitely can clearly and distinctly tell the difference between these new $15 dollar headphones and the ~$300 dollar headphones I've been using for the last 5 years, but it's mostly just a difference of slightly less treble and slightly more mids in the cheap ones. It's such a negligible difference that it'd be almost impossible to tell the difference if you did the Coke/Pepsi challenge with these headphones.

I've heard about brands like Audio Technica and AKG that have lots of options in the $50 to $100 range. Sony has several options in that range as well that are supposedly extremely good.

I've been thinking about the Bowers and Wilkins P7s for over 5 years. Like, I've been thinking all this time that once my Sennheisers finally crapped out (and let me be clear, these things would have at least 5 years of live left in them if I hadn't sweat all over them) that the B&Ws would be the next set of high-end cans I went for.

Has anyone here at [[/r/rational][r/rational]] had enough experience with high-end audio to tell me whether or not I should start saving up for the P7s versus getting an equivalent under-the-radar brand for a fraction of the price?

*** As someone who listens to primarily classical music I find it's worth it to buy decent quality headphones/in-ears. There are a lot of caveats and things to keep in mind when you're looking into audio stuff.

The first is to have a very strong understanding of precisely what you actually need and are looking for. For listening to random music while you're exercising, the noise from your movement is probably going to prevent you from noticing a lot of fine detail, and you finding that $15 in-ears are nearly as good as $150 headphones isn't that surprising. In general, you want to avoid paying for any feature that you don't actually need, or that doesn't have a noticeable effect.

Regarding "well-known brands," when choosing consumer audio stuff (professional is a little different) the brand is not very important, and known brands can even have a premium that isn't justified by the product's quality. You have to look at each individual product model & how it performs & read reviews by people that know what they're talking about, and importantly, that actually do the tests with a decent methodology. And even then, at the end of the day the conclusion is going to be subjective.

I will say, looking at the brands you specifically mention having owned, they are all ones I personally would avoid in general (Shure, Bose, Skullcandy, even Sennheiser) due to either being low quality, overpriced or some other reason. If you read around (for example in [[https://www.head-fi.org/forums/][head-fi forums]]) you generally get an idea that there are a few standout models of headphones, IEMs etc that everything else is judged by. For example, my current set of headphones is the Sony MDR-7506 which [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_MDR-V6#MDR-7506][was introduced in 1991]] and is still on the market today. Audio is particularly a case where "new" does not necessarily mean "better."

In the IEM case when I was looking for a "balanced" sound type set the standard for comparison was Fischer Audio-DBA-02, a brand which you may not be familiar with. I ended up going with the Brainwavz B2 which is essentially the same driver but slightly tweaked to have a stronger bass. The only reason I'm not still using them is that the cable deteriorated (became stiff & tended to break) so much that it wasn't really feasible to continue repairing it. Partly for that reason I replaced them with the Audio Technica ATH-IM02 which is honestly probably slightly worse sound quality despite being over double the price (although it could likely become better if I bought a specialised amplifier) but have detachable/replaceable cables & substantially better build quality.

Your use case is that you're using the to listen while exercising. This has unique needs (as you note - your Sennheisers are wearing out due to this.) For example, you might think about - can you easily replace the ear contact padding once it gets worn? How's the weight/comfort? Sound quality itself is just one of many concerns you might have, and sometimes it's not the most important. You mention you like the look of the P7s - this is a legitimate thing to keep in mind as a consideration.

I could see two different strategies you could go for. You could get the best "value" headphones spending as little as possible and just expect to replace them fairly often as they wear out. This would likely be perfectly fine as you can usually find sound quality that's almost as good as the high end (especially when being driven by a smartphone & not in a quiet environment) for much, much cheaper. Alternatively, you could go for a higher end set that you intend to keep for longer, but you do have to make sure that it actually has the features it needs & you have the knowledge you need to be able to make it last. Up to you what you feel is going to be better.

Regardless, doing research pays off heavily in this area. Not only product research, but understanding what actually matters, how to translate your own preferences into the terms reviewers use, how to read reviews properly, and importantly, learning which reviews to actually pay attention to in the first place. People's opinion of audio equipment is heavily influenced by what they've been exposed to before and even people who know exactly what they're doing and have a lot of experience have their own subjective preferences. So it's pretty typical to see a lot of positive reviews for even gear which is objectively crap or not worth the price compared to other options.

If you don't want to do research, it's going to be more difficult to get good value and you might have to accept paying more. Still apply a skeptical mindset of course and you should still ask yourself exactly what it is you're looking for, but if spending a few hundred dollars more for something you use a lot is less of an investment than the time and effort of learning about your options then that could be the better choice. For someone with a full-time, decently paid job that's probably going to be the case, unless you enjoy the process of learning about & understanding these things for itself in addition to its utility to you.

**** I read your comment soon after you posted it, and I decided to take some time to run the experiment. It's taken time because I wanted to listen to a lot of music, and doing that with the messed-up Sennheisers was inconvenient owing to having to hold the right ear cup onto my head to maintain the seal.

I already know most of what I'm going to say. I'll type up the response in a few hours, but right now I have to prepare and then eat breakfast, then go outside and do farmer's carries / loaded carries for an hour (I'm doing a sort of HIIT-like thing where I alternate between the loaded carry and brisk walking).

**** Okay, so I wanted to listen to a bunch of full albums twice back to back using both headphones, but after I narrowed down my selection of music I wanted to use, I realized that it'd take a lot longer than I was willing to devote to the experiment, so I just picked a few specific individual songs. I listened to each of them once with the ZX110s, once with the Momentums, then once switching between them every 30 or so seconds.

Here's a list of all of them, in case you care to judge the quality of the test material I used.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYANAvwvPBg][Kylie Minogue - Can't Get You Out of My Head]]

I also listened to a bit of symphonic/orchestral stuff:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCp5XC2rsEM][César Franck - Violin Sonata in A Major]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryy2LzZgXpw][Antonín Dvořák - Symphony No.1 in C Minor]]

And I did some reading - I couldn't find anything official for some reason, but on Newegg the Momentums are listed as having 50mm drivers. The ZX110s have 30mm drivers.

So right off the bat, the ZX110s don't have much sub bass rumble for most songs even when they're cranked all the way up, and they're not quite as loud (though my iPod (7th Gen Nano - not the best audio processing of any iPod ever made but definitely better than most smartphones) has enough volume that I can just turn it up a few extra clicks and make up the difference in perceived volume). Also, being on-ears, the ZX110s don't have very good passive sound isolation and they're not the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. They're not terribly uncomfortable, but they're on-ears.

On the other hand, I was quite mistaken about the Momentums' mids. Now that I'm paying attention to it, their sound signature is noticeably v-shaped - it's not extreme, but it's noticeable.

My main headphones just before the Momentums were Skullcandy Aviators (which I'm going to assume had an exaggerated v-shaped sound signature because, y'know, people who listen to top 40 crap are the target demographic for headphones like that, and that demographic thinks an exaggerated v-shaped sound sounds good). And for two of the 5 years I had the Momentums, I also owned the in-ear version of the Momentums (I used them for working out until one of the buds just stopped producing sound, just like almost every other in-ear I've ever owned in my life), and those in-ears had an /unquestionably/ v-shaped sound. The little Sony in-ears sounded very similar to the Momentum in-ears.

So it seems that the mids in the Momentums /felt/ more pronounced in relation to what I'd used recently, but weren't /actually/ more pronounced. I'm pretty sure these ZX110s are slightly anti-v-shaped. Juxtaposing those contrasting sound signatures against each other initially made it feel like the ZX110s had boomy exaggerated mids, but after getting used to it and directly comparing it I'm actually preferring the overall sound of the ZX110s. They have a relatively flat-ish response that errs on the side of warm, and I'm totally cool with a bit less treble because that just means I can crank up the volume (probably a lot higher than I ought to) without it being painful.

So I was mistaken in my assertions that "it'd be almost impossible to tell the difference if you did the Coke/Pepsi challenge with these headphones" and that the ZX110s are "the second-best sounding headphones I've ever used," but I /do/ think the ZX110s have sound quality comparable to headphones from popular brands in the $100 to $200 range (which may say more about popular headphones than it says about the ZX110s - after all, Beats are in the $300 to $400 range and they sound like $50 to $100 headphones but with added bass). I'd bet they sound better than the stupid Apple AirPods that teenagers mistakenly believe are expensive status symbols at a $150 price point.

I don't know what my conclusions are, here. The Momentums sound almost unnatural switching back and forth with the ZX110s; mids really make a difference in the fullness of the sound. When I play around with the volume to get them as close to the same level as I can, they really /do/ sound very similar - except the ZX110s have /just a touch/ less low bass and /just a touch/ less sparkle, and the Momentums have a distinct lack of fullness. I feel like the ZX110s would bump up from "pretty great" to "legitimately awesome" if the driver were bigger and if they were over-ear instead of on-ear. Your 7506s have a 50mm driver, and they're over-ears. You obviously already know Sony is capable of making good headphones, otherwise you wouldn't have the MDR-7506s. Is it really that crazy to think the MDR-ZX110s could be surprisingly good? Even better than other brands sold at 10 times the price?

At the very least, these cheap Sonys have shown me that I need to be paying more attention to looking for a flatter frequency response when it comes time to replacing the Sennheisers for real.

*** Well, I mostly buy midrange and the differences between really cheap headphones and things like Senheissers are night and day for me. It may just be that these differences don't influence your experience as much as they do for me or some others who splurge.

And while I can't speak personally I do know many think extremely expensive headphones quickly start to hit diminishing returns so keep that in mind when buying $300+.

**** It could be an issue of the fact that I've mostly stopped spending my free time listening to music in the last few years. Like, in middle school and high school I'd go to bed an hour early every single night on purpose so I could lie there for three or four hours listening to multiple full albums in a row, sometimes relistening to a newly acquired album immediately after the first listen. But for at least the past five years, 95% of the time I've spent listening to music has been during workouts and the other 5% has been spending a few hours once a month going down the rabbit hole of clicking songs in the sidebar recommendations on YouTube looking for new songs to add to the workout playlist.

Most of the time I don't even know the names of the songs I'm listening to or the artist the song is by. It's just a bunch of random dubstep and trap and electro house and whatever other techno. That could be the reason I'm not hearing much of a difference, I almost exclusively listen to the musical equivalent of junk food.

But then it could also be that these super cheap headphones really /do/ sound just as good as decent-quality midrange headphones. I can definitely tell that the sound is just a little muddier and less clear than what I've gotten used to with the Sennheisers, just like the $8 dollar in-ears were definitely a little thinner than the Sennheiser in-ears, but it really doesn't sound like a huge difference in quality, it sounds like a balancing/EQ difference. And the Momentums don't have a perfectly flat sound signature as it is, they have more pronounced mids, just like these Sonys.

So that's two possible confounding variables, a similar sound signature combined with listening to nothing but techno.

*** My daily drivers are Audeze iSINE 20s ($600 MSRP). Audiophile bullshit is mostly bullshit. A lot of it is hobbyist enthusiasm and diminishing returns.

Lower quality headphones usually sound a little muddier to me but for casual day to day use it really doesn't matter because there's so much ambient noise anyway.

Have you tried the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x? You can find them on sale or used for under $100.

Re: P7s, I don't know, what do you want? If you're reasonably happy with your Sony's, I can promise you that spending another $200 won't bring you to a totally new level of happiness. But if you can afford it, why not?

**** It would appear that the P7 has been discontinued and replaced by the PX and the P9.

The PX is wireless so that's out of the question because wireless is unacceptable. The P9 is $900 whereas the P7 was $400. [[https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816KTZYOOaL._SL1500_.jpg][Neither of them is anywhere near as sexy as the P7.]] That was the main selling point of the P7s for me, they're just attractive as all hell. I'm kinda bummed out about that. I got the Momentums back in the day because they were a little bit less expensive than the P7s. I should've got the P7s when I had the chance.

***** Looks like P7s are going for around $200 used on eBay. That's probably worth a shot, audiophiles generally take unusually good care of their stuff.

****** Also, wireless isn't /that/ bad anymore. Bluetooth has come a long way and some audio companies are starting to take it quite seriously.

I have the Ciphers myself and they're quite nice for HQ audio on the go.

** I am a bit sad two web serial authors I enjoy decided to switch gears.

It has me thinking, as an aspiring author myself, how do other writers avoid burnout? Did particular writing habits trip you up that you plan to avoid in the future?

*** I think schedules and deadlines are one of the things that cause burnout for me most often. I treat writing like a job, but it's a job where I can take mental health days, or where I can start up new projects that are particularly tickling my fancy, and where I'm as minimally beholden to grinding through a lack of desire as I can be. I think what happens a lot of the time when people get burnout is that they get into this cycle of not wanting to do the project, then doing it anyway, which just leads to more and worse bad feeling toward the project. You can, to some extent, simply grind things out, but that doesn't fix the problem, it just makes it worse. Especially with serial authors, not getting at the root of the problem just means that the problem gets worse and worse.

*** I have some writing experience myself. The only way to avoid burnout (in my experience) is to never stop writing. Make it a habit and set a minimum period of time for writing. Clock in and clock out at the same time every day. Never finish a project without having started another. Never end on finishing a chapter without having begun the next one.
