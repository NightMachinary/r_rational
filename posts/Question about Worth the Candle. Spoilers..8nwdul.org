I blitzed through the series in the last couple of days but I've just been skimming the chapters since the house was introduced. With the mention of Arthur saying:

#+begin_quote
  “Perhaps better that he kills instead of rapes,” said Uther. “But if he was in despair, for hundreds of years while the world stayed exactly the same around him, thinking that nothing he did would have any effect at all, and nothing would change for all his efforts, I have to imagine he would try something heinous, just to see whether that was the thing that would lift his curse. And from there, where does he go? What redemption is possible for him, even if he does decide to go back to being good?”
#+end_quote

And this earlier quest:

#+begin_quote
  */Quest Accepted: Gone to Seed - There is a place on Aerb considered worse than the first four thousand hells. Fel Seed sits on a throne of living flesh, unable to spread beyond his domain, but with a rule of horror within it. You know his weakness./*
#+end_quote

How likely is it that they're the same person?


** Just so we're all clear: you know this is a reference to Uther recreating Groundhog Day, right? Whatever else it may be an allegory for, the description he gave is literally the plot of the movie Groundhog Day, and it was literally called by that name in his notes.

** Pretty unlikely. It would require for Arthur and Juniper to independently concieve the same entity.

**** Very unlikely, due to Fel Seed having a prior explanation as being one of Joon's creations after Arthur died.

***** I hadn't realized that. It's within the realm of possibility that the DM constructed the narrative in a way that pushed Arthur into fulfilling that role. Maybe.

***** Is there a reason why Arthur must have been pulled off at the moment of death?

He lived for a lot of years before Joon. For all we know Arthur was pulled at the same time and the DM just made the thing happen first and kept Joon in stasis or something. He is literally omnipotent afaik. There is no reason why the "real" universe couldn't have had heat death already.

** I thought that this was one of the best little inclusions. I had always thought the same thing about CaddyShack that Bill Murray's character, once descended into the depths of depravity would never be able to rise again. Loved that it was mentioned offhandedly.

** Off-topic: I love how little bits of info have been dropped about the Fel Seed subplot throughout the whole story, and I have full confidence in the author's ability to write a satisfying climax to it. It's going to be great.

**** Sarevok is the antagonist in the Baldur's Gate videogame. Sarevok is a son of god of Murder, Baal. He tried to become a god of murder himself by starting a war. Good guys chopped his head off.
