** I like this story and may be this is just a personality difference between me and the protagonist but if you're in a situation where there's a club of people offering to help you fix your time-warping super powers maybe you should hear them out, negotiate things. Now, I understand that psychological and physical stress and fatigue can make it difficult to make good decisions, and that's why I think the response is still realistic, but stupid.

*** Yes, it's incredibly stupid. Marc is a fallible, young protagonist, who has just been through easily the most painful ordeal of his life, he's dealing with a concussion and severe amounts of pain. So of course, in a different setting he'd most likely hear them out, but he isn't in the proper state of mind to do so currently.
