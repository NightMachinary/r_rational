Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** After years of reading fanfiction, I've become almost unreasonably angry about the Stations of Canon, canon rehash, and the authors' general blind adherence to the original material, even when it's detrimental to the kind of story /they/ want to tell.

So, with that in mind, please recommend me fanfics that /completely/ disregard canonical events (and optionally the canonical setting as well) and just do their own thing. Preferably plot-focused action stories with a lot of (fresh) worldbuilding, but I'll take what I can get.

A couple of examples of what I have in mind:

*** The first story I thought of was, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]]. It's a Harry Potter fanfic about Ron who goes back in time when he dies to his birth. He's from the canon series and thinks that's the world he lives in, but not only is he wrong and is in an AU, but he also starts changing things to be wildly more strange starting with him being sorted into Slytherin.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-trans-dimensional-overpowered-protagonist-harem-comedy-is-wrong-as-expected-oregairu-danmachi.367903/][My Trans-Dimensional, Overpowered Protagonist, Harem Comedy is Wrong, as Expected]] is also a good example. It basically takes a main character who is very unusual to the setting and he basically takes a hammer to the stations of canon. I mean, some canon events still occur, but every time the event starts they always proceed in a wildly different manner and the few exceptions just happen off-screen. (It's possible to read without any knowledge of the original works and still enjoy it).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]] is a RWBY fanfic where the author takes the cast and dumps them in a RPG-like setting which means the canon line of events are completely ignored. Some of the author's other stories ignore canon too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11809400/1/Arc-Reaction][Arc Reaction]] is another RWBY fanfic by a different author who usually ignores the stations of canon as well. It's set after the first three seasons of RWBY (the later seasons were aired after the story was published) with a Jaune Arc who never went to Beacon, but is basically Iron Man.

I think I can suggest even more, but I would prefer that you ask for ones from a specific fandom that I can search through.

*** [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/77470/the-lunar-rebellion][The Lunar Rebellion]] by Chengar Qordath(My Little Pony). Set I think 800 years before the events of the show, it's about an attempted secession of Pegasi from Equestria that balloons into a full civil war. It's set in the author's wider Winningverse, which is a massive interconnected fanfic My Little Pony universe. The Winningverse tries to follow show canon generally, but has a massive amount of lore built up in basically all the areas the show doesn't explicitly cover, from the lives of background characters to how the government functions to a variety of magical monsters. I think The Lunar Rebellion is a good place to start, just don't read the comments section if you want to avoid spoilers since being that this is set 800 years in the past a lot of the future events have already been spoiled by other works in the universe.

** I've bought a fair amount of ebooks on Amazon recently and I think most of them are books that a lot of people here would enjoy (heck I heard about most of them through here!).

The Preorders:

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NJ3B6HN/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o03_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Underlord]] - The sixth book in the Cradle series which is described as a Western Xianxia series. A lot of people here don't really like the Xianxia genre and I agree with their criticisms of how many main characters are very villainous, under-developed enemies and female characters, the economies of cultivation aren't logical, poor scaling in conflict as you go from one city to interstellar in scope, and awkward prose. But I bring up all of these flaws to say that the Cradle series completely avoids all of the typical flaws in Xianxia and has a very smart character who sets out to cultivate smartly instead of bullheadedly.

And the sixth book is coming out in March! (Get the [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076G8DVN6/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i4][box set]]. It has the first three books and is cheaper!)

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD46PQZ/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o01_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Exhalation]] - Who here hasn't heard of Ted Chiang, the master of short stories that perfectly appeal to the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] crowd? The same guy that we literally use as an introduction to rational fiction. Well, if you enjoyed his first collection, [[https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang-ebook/dp/B0048EKOP0/ref=pd_cp_351_1?pd_rd_w=K0v1f&pf_rd_p=ef4dc990-a9ca-4945-ae0b-f8d549198ed6&pf_rd_r=A80PQ3JHJEM220FS09DV&pd_rd_r=f9e1a320-33d7-11e9-b538-4f27c7c0f394&pd_rd_wg=krXnF&pd_rd_i=B0048EKOP0&psc=1&refRID=A80PQ3JHJEM220FS09DV][Stories of Your Life and Others]], you'll love hearing that the second collection is coming out in....May! (Ugh....really May? I don't think I can wait that long!)

The books you can read right now!:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ary2zx/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/][The Beginner's Guide to Magical Licensing]] - Has a similar start to Unsong where a magical college-graduate, minimum-wage, sweat-shop worker stumbles on a powerful spell and sets out to start his own business competing with the powerful. The parts of the story that follows afterward makes a whole lot more logical sense than Unsong however. (Used to be online for free, but now you'll have to pay the price for your ignorance if you want to read it! (Nah, I [[http://starterserials.com/active/the-beginners-guide-to-magical-site-licensing/the-beginners-guide-to-magical-site-licensing/][lied]].))

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NKBSZGF/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o04_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Six Sacred Swords]] - If you liked the [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XBFD7CB/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2][Arcane Ascension]] series, but wished there was more dungeonnering and less of school shenanigans, then look no further! In some ways it's a lot like reading a very good DnD session played by really savvy players who never follow the 'standard' way to solve problems.

The author of Six Sacred Swords made a recommendation for [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C75P1R6/][The Ruin of Kings]]. He said that it reads like a Locke Lamora-esque rogue protagonist, telling the story in a style similar to Kvothe, in a setting similar to Game of Thrones. I haven't bought the book yet, but the [[https://andrewkrowe.wordpress.com/2019/02/05/updates-and-a-quick-recommendation/][review]] was interesting enough that I wanted to include it in my list of recommendations.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074M62D7Y/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o05_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Senlin Ascends]] - I haven't read this yet either, but skimming through it, I see some fair bit of social manipulation/combat that I think people here would like. Plus the Tower of Babel setting is something that appeals very strongly to me.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M5MJY8B/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o07_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Polyglot: NPC REVOLUTION]] - A lot of people here seem to really like LitRPG and Artificial Intelligence, but almost no one seem to ever question the implications of the NPCs in LitRPG stories having human-level intelligence.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LDFSPFW/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o07_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Small Medium: Big Trouble]] - It's by the same author who wrote [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078KGS4V4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1][Threadbare]] that people here really liked. Similar to Polygot where the NPC is the main character who needs to deal with players, but smaller scale in scope. There's a lot of fast-talking to convince selfish sociopaths to do what you say.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074DYJTKN/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o07_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Q is for Quantum]] - I was going through my older ebook orders when I found this one. It's the single best introduction for quantum mechanics that I have ever read (not that I've read too many of those). It focuses on building an intuition for the subject and once you've read through the book, you will understand on a gut level what superposition /means/. Note that it's meant as an introduction for the subject, so don't expect it to cover everything, just what's need to get started learning about quantum mechanics. But I'd still recommend it to experts if only for a better way to explain their subject to their peers and laypeople.

** So I posted my romance/sex positive story recommendations in the Valentine's Day thread two days late. Therefore, I'm making a repost here for anyone who may have missed it.

These are all of the stories that I can find or think of where the characters deal with romance and sex in intelligent and reasonable ways (even if they don't necessarily do the same outside of relationships).

Note that I'm too lazy to write up summaries for each rec, so I'm just copy-pasting the summary descriptions directly from the linked story even if they aren't the best or the clearest.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/conduit-rwby.6471/][Condiut]] [RWBY] - Come for the kinky spirit sex and cool powers, stay for the responsible approach to polygamous relationships and deep philosophical dilemmas!

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.916/][Amelia]] [Worm AU] - Amy Dallon is pushed by the S9, hard enough to actually *fight back*. From there, things diverge from canon.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/][The Sins of Cinnamon]] [Original Fiction] - Everyone is born with a birth class and a gift, and everyone with a particularly dangerous class gets monitored and registered. Everyone gets a career class once they start working, but Artificer became more popular than Adventurer years ago. There are dungeons, but they've been sealed. There are dragons, but they were nearly hunted to extinction and now the nature preserves are well guarded. Prostitution isn't illegal, which is good, because Cinnamon Wallace likes being open about who and what she is. The gods left the world years ago, it is said that they will never return, not until all the world is dust, and the stars rain like fire from the sky. And so, when an Oracle prophesied that Cinnamon Wallace would one day meet a god, and be judged for her sins, the Oracle's words were dismissed. Surely, if the world was going to end, someone else would have also foreseen it?

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/monstergirlcity-ace-detective.3154/][Monster Girl City: Ace Detective]] [Monster Girl Quest] - You are Monstergirlcity's only human woman and detective, the legendary Ace. What bizarre mystery will you face? Here's a [[https://fiction.live/stories/monstergirlcity-ace-detective/ozWAGdPAACtkX4dJ5][link]] to the original site for the story.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/a-rousing-rebirth-veilfall-original.5813/][A Rousing Rebirth]] [Original Fiction] - /A Rousing Rebirth/ is the story of two magical girls and their origins, their adventures, and their intimate lives, in a near-future alternate history which presents them with challenges both familiar and exotic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11508537/chapters/25824003][My Completely Normal Parahuman: Tantric is Magic]] [Worm] - Being a Tantric Witch is harder than you think. First, dealing with the fact that you got it from your mother. Second, the trauma from finding the ten pounds of anal beads in the back of her wardrobe confirming that you got it from your mother. Third, it's pretty hard to be a hero when your power comes from sex, lust, and rock'n'rollin the boat. The fourth and most difficult part about the whole thing though? My name is Taylor Hebert... and I look like a fucking stripper.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)]] [Original Fiction] - So, after seeing too many harem series, I made a quest. A lot of IS and it's innumerable derivatives, a lot of Muv-Luv (very Ironic I know), a lot of Knight Run, some Sentou Yousei Yukikaze, mixed together with my personal antipathy for harem series, we get this. Battle-Action-Harem-Highschool... Side Character Quest. No Sufficient Velocity. You */are/* the waifu.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][Erogamer]] [Gamer] - The story of a human being who one day saw a status screen displaying her BOD, LST, SED, FUK, PRV, and ERO. "This is more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest." --- all of the readers. This is way more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest, even taking the previous statement into account." --- Sirrocco

[[https://www.asstr.org/%7EA_Strange_Geek/novels/PilferedPrincess/][The Pilfered Princess]] [Original Fiction] - An evil sorcerer kidnaps a princess in his bid for conquest, but gets more than he bargained for. A humorous sendup of formula fantasy stories.

I also have some romance-themed requests:

- Are there any other stories like 'Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest' where the main character is the member of a harem rather than being the protagonist-like individual that a typical harem tends to focus around?
- Are there any stories about a person who is asexual and yet lives in a porno-logic world? I've found one to read and after that, I've been craving more that plays with the same idea.

It's one of the stories in the list of recommendations that I posted above. I just didn't specify which one because the character in question being asexual is a major spoiler of an early plot point in the story.

The story that I was referring to is Monster Girl City: Ace Detective. After all, 'ace' can refer to someone who is asexual or to someone who is a detective. It's totally a cheesy pun that had me doubled over laughing when I realized it!

It is a fantasy VRMMO with a lot of great character development and world-building (if you have a bad connotation with VRMMO novels, I totally understand but I would give this a try anyway since I can't say anything to convince otherwise without spoiling). I can't link it right now, but if you google search it with literotica, you should be able to find it quite easily. There are a few sex scenes, but those constitute a minor part of the story.

Abercrombie has the best written characters in published fantasy except George Martin imo. The story is a great fantasy deconstruction though it sets itself up as a by the numbers fantasy before showing you otherwise.

Regarding closure, the trilogy is self contained but it doesn't resolve everything and there are further works set in the world.

** Codex Alera is a neat fantasy series by Jim Butcher, set in a world with a magic system that I think this subreddit would really enjoy. A lot of the setting is revealed over the course of the series, so I'll be deliberately vague here: magic works by controlling nature spirits called 'Furies' that come in six flavours: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Wood, Metal. Each has straightforward aspects (if you have a fire affinity you can control fire) as well as one or more subtler abilities (if you have an earth affinity you can amplify your strength).

The first book has, in a lot of ways, a more traditional and less interesting plot than the rest of the series. It's still good, but if you find it decent rather than amazing, I'd recommend reading the second one as well to see if you prefer it. Over the course of the entire six-book series there's geopolitics, espionage, military campaigns, clandestine missions, a bunch of interesting magic and some really really nifty munchkinned solutions.

If nothing else it might be fun to go see who the characters journey from humanity to whatever it is they become if only because fans like me were disappointed they barely appeared in the Nightmare stacks, or you could just jump into the Delirium brief but that would heavily spoiler some really good books previous books that get tied in.

Baru Cormorant first book was medieval fantasy/fiction exploring finance, colonialism, and politics in a world where something like China's bureaucracy is crossed with the british empire and focuses on a rebellious bureaucrat who wishes to destroy the empire that destroyed/civilized (ugh) her homeland by gaining power within it . There's a robust worldbuilding with some implausibly conditioned people. The second book is where more biopunk-ish elements cme in with one of the factions pursuing what may be cancer fueled immortality. The first book really impressed me and it's character is well described it's this discussion of what she'd say to other characters in fiction:[[https://www.tor.com/2015/08/27/how-baru-cormorant-would-overthrow-emperor-palpatine-kill-voldemort-and-stop-sauron/][How Baru Cormorant Would Overthrow Emperor Palpatine Kill Voldemort and stop Sauron]] The second book was kind of disappointing to me because it seems like it's abusing a lazy radiation trope but the rest of the world building is solid enough and there are enough hints that there will be an adequate explanation because this world seems to be quite old that I'll probably give it another two books to right itself, well that and I like to the main character.

I gave Semiosis a miss it looked like it might be fun, but it might be another Wool. My to read stack has been light lately so I might grab it some time soon. I've found it really hard to find suspension of disbelief satisfying biopunk stories after reading a lot of Watts, I've read most of Watts though and it's worth it.

** What are some rational short storys?

I would like some short storys in the rational sphere to recomend to people who might be intrested in rational fiction but don't have to time to read a 100k word internet story on my say so that it is good.

Something short maybe 10k words or less would be ideal.

**** Something like a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4yvx3c/rt_a_rationalist_in_the_zombie_apocalypse/][rationalist in a zombie apocalypse]] here on this subreddit. Something short that gets across a few rational ideas or is just a good short story.

I am a big fan of Asimov's collection of short stories FYI.
