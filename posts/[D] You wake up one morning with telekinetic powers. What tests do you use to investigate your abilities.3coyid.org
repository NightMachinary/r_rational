** How do I realize that I have telekinetic powers?

1. Do things start flying around spontaneously?
2. Is the knowledge magically in my head?
3. Is there some form of external notification? (eg, a note)

My next actions depend on the answer to the above:

1. If 1, concentrate on making it stop. Do I need to be calm? Do I need to consciously focus on each moving object and release some sort of mental grip? Do I just say "telekinetic powers, deactivate!"?
2. If 3 (it's a note or such) check that the apartment was empty, look for other evidence that someone was here.
3. If 2, holy crap. How do I just have this magical knowledge? Am I dreaming? Did someone edit my brain? Is this the Matrix? Test this!

Testing for case #2 would involve trying to break reality by simple effort of will (dreaming), or trying various actions that would require a lot of effort to render graphically -- spin-toss a book so the pages flap, whirl around and watch how my hair moves in the mirror, etc. These are, of course, things I've done before, but I was never actively /looking/ for flaws.

Assuming I can't determine an answer to the above, let's move on to the actual experimenting.

If I woke up with things moving, that suggests that my powers are at a level that can be experimented with indoors. That's good. If it was either of the other cases...well, the odds of the note or internal belief being true are pretty low, so I do a quick Uri Geller test and try to bend a spoon. (I have some junky spoons I'm not fond of.) If I can bend it smoothly and then completely restore it, that suggests that "there is no spoon" and this is the Matrix. If I can only bend it like a regular object (ie it gets creased) then that's reassuring. Presumably the test succeeds.

At this point, I know I have powers but I know nothing else, so let's stop and think about failure conditions. Here's the ones I get in 5 seconds; spend 5 minutes by the clock coming up with more.

- Lose control; things keep moving after I want them to stop.
- Clumsy; crush objects accidentally, slam them into walls, launch them into orbit, etc.
- Self-damaging (brain explodes) if moving a too-heavy or otherwise inappropriate object.
- Self-damaging on every use, like the dad in Firestarter. This would suck.
- Can't control the activation -- triggers automatically whenever I'm startled / frightened / etc.

I /really/ want the always-self-damaging option to be false, because then I can actually play with my new powers. Still, it's a hell of a risk.

I do one more test to make sure the power is actually repeatable. Then I call my doctor and the Randi Institute. The plan is to get an MRI, then do Randi's test, then get another MRI. Since I'll need to use the power at least once more between MRI tests in order to judge the "self-damaging" option, I might as well make a million dollars from it. Obviously there are coordination issues here -- I need to convince my doctor to prescribe the tests and then schedule things appropriately. Explain the circumstances to Randi and say that it's possible I will fail, but I was able to do this at least twice.

For the next several weeks, resist the nigh-overpowering urge to experiment. This would be an absolutely horrible period of time.

Once I have a million dollars and the assurance that using my abilities won't automatically kill me, it's time to have some fun!

Get some camping gear, rent a car, go off into the boondocks away from breakable things like people. Time to start experimenting for real!

- How much can I move? Start with grains of sand, work up to large boulders. Move each one just a little bit and always straight up. If I accidentally lose control and fling them super-hard, the worst I'll need to do is duck for cover. Well, or hole the ISS, but that's unlikely.
- Is there a counter force applied to me, or is it reactionless?
- How fast can I move a thing, in terms of acceleration, velocity, and jerk?
- Where does the energy come from? Does using the power make me tired, or is it just magic?
- Can I compress things?
- Can I apply force to part of an object?
- Does it always do what I tell it, or does it sometimes run wild? If I'm tired, is my TK clumsy?

Startle testing: hook up a really loud alarm that will go off sometime during the night and wake me up. What happens? Note: do this one well away from my car and the rest of my gear. Also, spend 5 minutes coming up with more safety protocols.

Okay, now the scary part -- living things! Find an ant, repeat all previous tests. Work up to lizards, birds, etc. It is possible that I will accidentally harm some of these creatures: I'm okay with that. Better a sparrow accidentally during testing than a person accidentally while eating a bagel.

Try to find a way to test the effect of anger. Does it make me stronger? Less controlled? Make my powers activate without intent? I'm not sure how to safely test this.

*** A year later at your yearly scheduled mammogram, you discover you now suddenly have stage 4 breast cancer.

You realize after some experimentation that whenever you levitate anything, you also cause the levitated object to emit radiation. The longer it's levitated, the faster it's moved and the larger it is, the greater the radioactive energies generated.

And you had spent almost the entire year showing off your telekinetic powers to audience after audience...

All of which are doomed.

*** Darn it that's way longer than my answer. Better, too. I would just recommend that you take a video of your abilities before you call your doctor. That way if the telekinesis stops working you something to fall back on instead of looking like an idiot. Also there's a few more things you could test

- how small the telekinetic field can be (can you manipulate a cell when looking through a microscope?)

- whether you have to know about or see an object to lift it

- whether field has any identifiable properties (light outside visible spectrum, electric field, radiation, etc.)

** 1) Stay calm.

2) Call a mental health professional.

3) Get a checkup from the neck-up.

4) If you /aren't/ somehow experiencing a psychotic break, look up the Randi Prize details. This could get expensive.

**** If you are having a psychotic break, that is really irresponsible. Ignoring the wilful endangerment of yourself and the public, the problem here is any /positive/ result sounds exactly like being crazy, as well as any rationalization for negative results.

No one can see what you see? Maybe Muggles rationalize your powers away.

You hit them with a floating object and they run away screaming? Maybe you /threw it at them like a crazy person./

They do see it, and run away screaming? Maybe it wasn't the powers.

They do see it, and get excited and want to hang out testing it? Maybe they think you're crazy and are going to steal your wallet, or they're just humoring you until the police arrive.

--------------

You can't win if you're working on this with disinterested strangers. The human brain can do horrible things to justify errors in perception and even high-level belief.

Paranoid disorders go along very well with this and you might not be in a position to judge your own environment, so wandering around poking strangers is not a smart idea. You need someone who not only is familiar with what is /almost certainly/ happening to you, but is able to deal with the consequences.

Remember, we're not looking for confirmation of our /almost certain/ delusions, we're looking for someone to examine the evidence of them calmly and professionally. If you don't tell the psychiatrist what you /think/ is happening before showing off your "powers", and they then jump up, knocking their chair over and go, "holyshit, you're floating that thing with your mind!" and the rest of the visit is /them/ trying to come up with ad hoc tests, you're probably in really good shape. And if they don't see it, you calmly listen to their advice and get your prescription filled.

Then you write down everything you think you know, including some physical tests for your abilities (like recording a ringing bell from inside a tupperware container across the room.) Then you take your pills and wait before reviewing your notes again. Then you run your tests.

And if that video recording /appears/ to have evidence of what you thought was happening, maybe you do have weird powers that warp minds that see it happening live. So time to hop on TOR and post that shit to a brand new youtube account. Watch the comments. I know of few mental health issues that leave people coherent enough to operate complex computer software and lie to themselves about rigging up a complicated special effect for a video without realizing it.

But the moment you start making excuses for your abilities, like they don't work when a disbeliever is nearby, or they only work with suspicious amounts of environmental requirements or preparation, that's the time to give up. The moment you start claiming things like "science can't study magic" you're lost.

--------------

Basically, don't act like a paranoid internet toughguy. Instead, get help when it looks like everything you know about physics, causality, and reality in general shifts violently, like an actually intelligent person. Because shit like this doesn't happen in reality, and that's where you're living.

In real life, mental health professionals don't lock people up by default when they are calm, communicative, and no apparent danger to themselves or others. Risks are minimal with talking to a professional about your perceptions and experiences. Risks wandering around in public with some heavy delusions are astronomical.

Uhhhhhh... isn't that actually /even more/ implausible than telekinesis? Human minds may be error-prone, but they're also much more complicated than Newtonian dynamics. A superpower that "works at the level of" exerting fairly plain blunt forces is much more likely to be real than one that has the highly specific, customized, fine-detail-affecting effect of warping minds to produce customized delusions /at a distance/.

****** Unless you are bitten by a unique epistemological artifact, you've gotta think you aren't alone in what's happening. I'd be afraid of supernatural daisycutters even before my personal testing began because of that. In fact, that's the only reason I'd hesitate to get professional mental help as a first step.

The Sunnydale Effect seems more likely to me than being a unique snowflake, to the point where I think it beats out Occam's Razor as, without it, things don't add up. Where are all the other people with telekinesis throughout history? Or just in modern times?

That would only require a shared psychological effect in humans, something akin to the glitched concept processing of people with dementia or other organic damage, as a secondary effect to a reality-bending power.

It's a stretch, sure, but whenever you appear to be in a unique situation, assuming that's in fact true is not the best course of action. This one is easy enough to test, and is an obvious enough possibility that I decided to mention it. The idea is a classic in fairytales and the supernatural, after all.

***** A mental health professional would be your best option, if you are okay with him/her knowing. You do bring up a good point about the dangers of walking around deluded in public, but you could just check with a trusted friend / family member in private. It would be very simple: float an pencil. If they go ''holy shit! You're floating a pencil!' and you can start having a rational conversation about it, then it's likely that you're sane. (though I suppose it wouldn't hurt to go to a mental health professional anyways, just to be sure)

That being said, if you have a family history of mental health problems, or feel irrational / paranoid, then I would agree with you 100%

****** I agree with quick, safe checks. Maybe make a Youtube video and send it to a family member. Something totally safe. Maybe levitate something in front of your roommate, who has to deal with your shit anyway. Just don't say anything. Walk into the room, levitate, wait.

The only problem is, you need to have pre-arranged decisions for what to do when they look at you blankly, or claim not to see anything. That's where mentally ill people fail, because their rationality itself is damaged, so they keep themselves attached through painful logical contortions to ideas that have no actual basis in reality.

Starting out with detailed personal analysis of /highly/ unusual personal phenomena is what I'm saying is a horrible idea.

** Does the power work on objects out of my line of sight?

- Do I have to know about an object in order to lift it?

What level of control do I have over the telekinetic field?

- Is it even a field? Is it just focusing on specific objects or can I apply the affect to an area?
- How many objects can I lift at a time?\\
- If it is a field, how large can I make it? Can it be different shapes?
- How small of an object can I manipulate?

How powerful is my telekinesis?

- Do I get tired?
- Is power linked to anything? practice, time of day, concentration, emotion, etc...

Does the field have any identifiable properties?

- Test for radiation, electricity, light outside visible spectrum
