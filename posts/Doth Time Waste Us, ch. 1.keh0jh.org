** Wasn't there just a story with this title posted about someone puking hippos?

** For whatever it's worth, this first chapter grabs me a hell of a lot less than hippo-cougher did.

** Hmm. Reading through this, it implies there's a good amount of time travelers stuck dying at the edge point for medical science, until they Polly Sue their way into inventing immortality.

*** I mean, by definition they all get stuck at the point of death over and over again til they figure out indefinite life extension. I don't think brute force counts as Polly Suing. And with 11 billion other pseudo-immortal time travelers to talk to, they can probably bootstrap it pretty quickly. Hard to see how this doesn't end up with 11B post-scarcity utopias within a couple millennia, since there's no incentive to screw over other time travelers.

**** Now I'm wondering how many end up pseudo wire heading, just repeatedly eating the same bite of Choclate cake or orgasming over and over again.

** I don't understand OP.... How can there be any amount of real earths, all based on a hypothetical earth that you say doesn't exist? Am I missing something? Surely the hypothetical earth AKA the one we think we know, had to be real at some point, for all the others to be delivered from it, wouldn't it?

*** Seems like the HE exists solely as a framing device for/origin point of all the other ones. It is the Earth that would have existed if nobody ever got to time travel, hence Hypothetical.

**** I understand the concept narratively, I just don't see how it works practically. How can these earths all have the memories of a default timeline that never existed? If time travel is normal in all the timelines, they shouldn't have any idea of what an earth looks like without time travel.

Sorry I like the story and the idea, I just wanna know how the author reconciles the above worth the idea of an HE cuz it's captured my interest.

***** I'm pretty sure they don't have a memory of the HE, nor any information about it (besides its hypothetical existence as "the Earth without time travel"). Like I said, it exists only as a framing device, and only the omniscient narrator knows about it, as far as I can tell.

****** Okay so its just a narrative concept, I.E. "Imagine a hypothetical earth with no time travel, and now look at these other worlds that are nothing like that" sort of thing. Okay thanks, it makes a lot more sense now.

******* Seems like it.

To be honest, I don't really understand why it's framed like that either. Best guess is that there's something special about the HE that the time travelers have to or want to discover, and have to approach obliquely by filling in the negative space of their own Earths.
