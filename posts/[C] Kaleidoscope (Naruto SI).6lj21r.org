** Heh, just finished this on the forum... the update rate at the time was phenomenal. 2 chapters a day and ending with a 4 chapter whammy. Anyhoo, here are some of my thoughts.

The premise was very interesting, especially since it somehow managed to take a typical OP Mary Sue origin and turn it into something that doesn't break much SoD / have terrible writing. Almost all the standard badly-written-naruto-fanfic-tropes (Uchiha-born, 'prodigy', reincarnated SI... etc) were used, but it somehow didn't diminish much from the story at all.

The ending was jarring... but I think purposely so. It meshed well with the particular neurosis of the protag' at that point in time. The way it leaves you feeling very unsettled at both the 'happy' and sad endings somehow matches the unsettling tone of the chaos that was present of the very first arc... especially since you almost feel like things are improving in the middle...

I do, however, feel that the ending itself - while great in concept - was not really well executed and came across as rushed. Then again, the author did state that they /did/, in fact, rush the ending since they didn't want to leave it unfinished, but was already exhausted with the story itself. For that, I am grateful. (reading a work of fiction only to find it is incomplete or abandoned kills me on the inside)

*** The pace was what really made this excellent for me. No dawdling around in fights or inside of people's minds, only informative beats and then a straight-shot finish.

*** Agreed. Readers should be warned to stop once the rinnegan is mentioned. But honestly, read Walk on the Moon instead.

**** I still think it's worth a read, but the ending is definitely not a point in /Kaleidoscope/'s favor.

Also /Walk on the Moon/ may be dead, 6P said they were 'taking a break' from it and hasn't posted anything since early June after the SB mods, in their infinite wisdom, decided to lock the thread.

** It's a story about an SI born into the doomed Uchiha clan and an attempt to leverage his knowledge into strength at any cost. From the story:

I must be strong.

If I am not strong, I will die.

Strength opens doors.

These doors will let me escape.

No pit is too deep to sink to.

No mountain is too high to climb.

Anything that I can do, I must do.

Strength is the reward for my effort.

With strength, I can be free from fear.

I must be strong. â€‹

*** Also he might go a little crazy while trying to munchkin his way to power, but who in Naruto is strong without being crazy?

**** ...a /little/ crazy? I think we was almost fully bonkers to start with and he only got better at maintaining the facade of functionality throughout the story.

***** He become better after he streamlined his ideology with logic. Axioms:

Hokage is infallible.

There could no be immoral or criminal order from superior. They are superiors therefore their orders always moral by definition.

From here MC derived:

If the orders /seems/ immoral that mean either you don't have full information, or their are not legitimate orders. If what /seems/ an order is really immoral or criminal it's not a real order but fake issued by traitor. Traitors should be eliminated.

If Hokage seems immoral either you don't have full information or they are not /real/ Hokage. If they are not /real/ Hokage they are triator. Traitor posing as Hokage should be eliminated.

****** It's not really rational and has a healthy dollop of deus ex machina and mary sue-ing but it is pretty gripping. Thanks for the link, [[/u/PeridexisErrant][u/PeridexisErrant]].
