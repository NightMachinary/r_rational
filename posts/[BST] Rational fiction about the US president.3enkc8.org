  A problem might be that the president and his team is already quite instrumentally rational,
#+end_quote

Are they? Even if, as individuals, they happen to be rational (and that's not even a given) they're beholden by bonds of gold to groups that impose irrational constraints on their actions.

Imagine a president who decides they're not going to worry about re-election, or even party loyalties, and decides to simply do the most good.

It's not clear to me that this would be an advantage - with the various checks and balances, the President has little power if not supported by his or her party. Revealing secrets can only get you so far, after all...

How's this for an idea:

#+begin_quote
  After the annual Intelligence Community dinner, the president discover's s/he's been poisoned and only has a year to live. Four months to prepare, and leave office with a legacy to be proud of. Four months in retirement, digging for the truth and preparing. And four months between the faked and real death, to get revenge...
#+end_quote

Featuring complex goals, many many layers of secrets and intrigue, and it can come in basically whatever flavour you want - Doctrow, Clancy, Rand...

Depends on what the secrets are. This is fiction, after all.

"Here we go again, another president, another mouth we have to keep shut."

"Don't worry about this one, he's a solid part of the machine."

"I know, but..."

I think this is generally what happens in years 6-8 of a president's tenure.

**** Re-election, no. Party loyalties, yes. And of course by then they're a lame duck.

  there are no irrational goals in instrumental rationality
#+end_quote

That's why I wrote "irrational constraints on their actions". If you're part of a group that (for an absurd example) abominates the color green, you won't be able to cast /Avadra Kadavra/ even when that would rationally advance your goals.
