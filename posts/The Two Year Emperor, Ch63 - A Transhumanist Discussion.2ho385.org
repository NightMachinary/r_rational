*** It wouldn't be easy. [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineRanksAndPowers.htm][Here]] is a list of the traits of a D&D deity, with Neklos probably being rank 16-20.

The only way I can think of is tens (or hundreds) of thousands of readied actions, each chipping away at his thousands of hitpoints, and carefully chosen to avoid his immunities and get enough natural 20's by sheer statistics to overcome his saves, AC, and/or spell resistance.

If Flobovia contains Complete Arcane content, I'd say [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/complete-arcane--55/orb-force--470/][Orb of Force]] is perfect, 10d6 damage with no save or SR. 1/20 casters would automatically hit the ranged touch attack, meaning that 10,000 castings (the most that fits in a 300' radius) would deal about 17k damage, enough to kill most gods.

Neklos has a billion worshippers in Anundj√• alone. He is most definitely a rank 20 greater god.

I would even believe that it could let you specify the physical characteristics, so long as they were within the norms of the species. I can't see any RAW evidence that it would allow you to specify specific details of their mental state, such as which deity they worship.

It works for Neklos because he's not creating worshippers via PAO -- he's creating humans, who can then be immediately eaten by undead in order to convert the PAO'd humans into more undead. Undead generally count as worshippers of Neklos (or, at least, they feed power to him, even if they are clerics of another deity or such), so this gives him a straight powerboost.

******* Yup, I had accounted for average damage in my calculations.

I assumed that they had access to enough level 20 Wizards or Sorcerers that it isn't relevant anymore, so they're all casting it at caster level 20.

Next, I calculated how many can fit in range (300' (60 squares) at caster level 20) using pi * r^{2,} which is 11310 people, rounded down to 10k for easy numbers. This can be increased to ~900k casters by making it a sphere (4/3 * pi * r^{3)} instead of a circle, but there's no need to go crazy (yet). This also assumes that casting past teammates is allowed.

10d6 averages out to 35 damage, with no resistance blocking it out, so that's simple.

Orb of Force is a ranged touch attack, which always succeeds on a natural 20, so 1/20 attacks will hit. Neklos' touch AC is likely in the 60's to 80's, so none will hit on a 19 or lower. There is no save and no SR, so there's no need to worry about that.

The final damage calculation looks like this: 10k people * 35 damage per hit * 0.05 chance to hit = 17500 damage.

A deity with 100d10 hit dice and a constitution score of 100 would have 5500 HP.

Of course, readied actions, foresight, celerity, timestop and other things make this more of an academic exercise than practical advice, but it's a nice thought experiment.

I was thinking that perhaps they were going to make a new version of /Mindscrape/ that only affected the spiritual component in order to flip his alignment, but you're right that this would create a number of problems with regards to his saves. I had also been thinking that they could just fire on him /en masse/ in the hopes that he would roll of 1, but on rereading the rules for divine ranks, apparently deities aren't subject to automatic failure on a 1 when making saves. And if he's divine rank 16 or higher, he's assumed to be taking 20 on the save, which makes it even more difficult. All that could potentially be overcome through incredible feats of optimization, but /Mindscrape/ is still Mind-Affecting, so they'd have to make a new version that only held the spiritual component anyway.

So I'm not sure what's going to happen now - I have no idea what kind of plan Jake has come up with that he's so sure will work.

** /Polymorph Any Object/ can be cast twice to make it permanent? I think it just edged into the lead as Most Broken Spell in D&D.

Jake's strategy is interesting. I see why he leapt to the "let's kill Death" plan: if Afi ever succeeds at getting his shard removed, Neklos is going to be pissed beyond pissed. Annoying the gods is never a good idea, so Afi can expect to be obliterated shortly afterwards... unless something happens to prevent Neklos from ever doing that. Killing him isn't the only way, but it is the most obvious.

Also /Mindscrape 2.0/ would be useful for purging Fragment, if Jake can get a copy.

It's getting hard to keep track of whose side we're on. Jake would like Afi to become a true puppet of Neklos, because then he'd only have to deal with an invincible god of death instead of that plus the greatest military mind of the last thousand years. Jake would prefer Neklos be killed and Afi be free of his influence, so Afi can dedicate himself to research and not scouring the living from the world. On the other hand, killing Afi is as simple a matter as yelling "Hey Neklos, guess what your avatar's been doing behind your back!", while killing Neklos is... rather more difficult.

Summoning him into a canyon full of level 60 casters under your command is probably a good place to start, though.

Yep. If you, say, PAO a pebble into a human then it lasts for 20 minutes...but if you PAO a human into a human, it's permanent. So, PAO the pebble into a human, then PAO /that/ human into itself. Boom, permanent.

Indeed. The problem with that is that doing it means giving away your position to Neklos, which tends to result in squishage. (Currently Shailos, Arros, and a few other gods are working together to keep Our Heroes out of Neklos's sight.)

The heroes actually have several ways to win, or at least better their position, at this point:

1. Remove Neklos. Afi will then /probably/ go back to doing research instead of trying to conquer the world.
2. Remove Afi. Now the other Lich Kings become much less engaged (except when Neklos is directly supervising), and Neklos is in charge directly. Good thing, because he'd be a crappy general.
3. Reduce Neklos's power enough that the Team Good gods beat him.
4. Cause enough dissension in the ranks that Afi gets tied down fighting internal battles instead of fighting our heroes.

Heh. Yeah. Although, you'd probably still lose. Neklos would use his Alter Reality power to simulate a Celerity, giving him a standard action before anyone else, even if it's a surprise round. He then casts Time Stop, giving him 2-5 rounds. He spends the first round of the Time Stop being dazed from the Celerity, then uses the second round to cast another Time Stop, which resets the counter to "2-5 rounds". He uses the first round to do something, then Time Stops again. Lather, rinse, repeat until you're all dead.

Although...if you got a surprise round on him and had enough firepower, MAYBE you could get it done.

**** Alter Reality takes a standard even when casting spells that are normally faster. But I assume somewhere in his 30-50 class levels he can cast foresight and celerity on his own.

Assuming casters are using readied actions and Neklos casts celerity, what I am trying to figure out is: who goes first?

Celerity's standard specifically states it goes off "as if you had readied an action" and a readied action "occurs just before whatever triggers it". Amusingly that means the standard action celerity grants actually occurs just before celerity is cast and this is just readied vs readied then. The immediate action and its "very small amount of time" doesnt even come into play until afterwards, even though its the immediate action feature of interrupting that lets him cast it in the first place.

I know the "readied action" bit in celerity is usually ignored and people simply rule it LIFO, but a stricter reading makes it a bit of a conundrum. If there was a clear trigger on each side it would be much easier to determine, but since celerity's trigger is celerity itself I have no idea.

***** Hm.

Celerity: "This spell works like lesser celerity, except that you pull even more time into the present. When you cast this spell, you can immediately take a standard action, as if you had readied an action. You can even interrupt another creature's turn when you cast this spell. However, after you take the standard action granted by this spell, you are dazed until the end of your next turn."

It's an immediate action to cast. "An immediate action is a swift action that can be performed at any time---even if it's not your turn."

The way it reads to me is:

1. Casters ready an action: "Shoot Neklos as soon as he appears."
2. Neklos appears.
3. Casters readied actions trigger.
4. Neklos takes an immediate action (which can be done at any time, even on not-your-turn) to pre-empt the casters and cast Celerity, giving him a standard action.
5. Neklos uses that action to cast Time Stop. Neklos wins.

...unless, of course, it's a surprise round and Neklos were not aware of his attackers, then he would not be able to act, at all. Hence he couldn't use an immediate action to cast Celerity, and therefore he would lose.

...unless, of course, he had used his Alter Reality power to cast Foresight some time in the last few hours. In that case, he can't be surprised, so he /would/ have the immediate action, so he would win.

...although, of course, even if he /hadn't/ cast Foresight, his portfolio is still Death. Since he's divine rank 20, that means that his Portfolio Sense ability is: "Greater deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios, regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses extend one week into the past and one week into the future for every divine rank they have." So, he's known for 20 weeks that he was going to be killed, and can therefore act to prevent himself from being killed. So, Neklos wins.

So, yeah. I think Neklos wins if you try to just ambush him and shoot him to death.

****** Readied actions explicitly occur before their trigger. So I would read that scenario as:

1. Casters ready an action "Shoot Neklos as soon as he appears."
2. Casters readied actions go off (trying to cast whatever).
3. Neklos appears (triggering Casters readied actions).
4. Neklos' uses his standard from celerity (casting Time Stop)\\
   4(a). Now in a 5 round Time Stop, Neklos does whatever he wants (including more time stops) until he returns to normal time and..
5. Neklos takes an immediate action to cast Celerity (triggering an "as if readied" action)
6. Neklos is now dazed

Since the casters spells actually try to go off before Neklos appears, their readied actions would fail. They cannot cast a spell at a target that is not actually present (unless they were aiming at his square with an aoe or casting a spell that didnt require a target).

Neklos then appears. He decides to immediate action celerity, but only /after/ he uses the standard action celerity will grant him to cast Time Stop. When he exits his Time Stop, his casting of celerity will finish and he spends a round afterwards dazed.

Stupid, but RAW.

If the caster's readied an action for whenever Neklos acted like a giant evil windbag, that would guarantee that it will go off and with a valid target in sight.

An immediate definitely trumps a readied action, as it can explicitly interrupt other actions. Thinking more on it, I am inclined to agree that if you are triggering a readied action with an immediate then:

(a) your immediate (ie your trigger) would go off before the other readied action

(b) your readied action would go off before your immediate action

and so (c) Your readied would come before your opponent's

I'd say you're right on all of this. Which just means that Neklos gets to freeze time and keep it frozen for as long as he'd like. So, Neklos wins.

Now, here's the interesting thing: two gods with Alter Reality. Both decide to use it to cast Celerity / Time Stop. What happens?

Note that I'm not entirely certain that Time Stop would freeze time re other gods. I think they would probably be able to enter the TS with you. Not sure if RAW supports that, but if not then I would houserule it in because otherwise it's too easy for one god to take out another.

God_1 does something, God_2 interrupts with an immediate action celerity<-time stop, God_1 interrupts the time stop with their own immediate action celerity<-time stop. (It feels so wrong to have those arrows that way, but easier to read.)

Following the same logic for why celerity lets you go before a readied action, the resolution order would be:

God_1 does something

God_1 casts time stop

God_1 casts celerity and is then dazed

God_2 casts time stop

God_2 casts celerity and is then dazed

Contingency spells add another layer to that and it can easily spiral out even more with more tricks, but still it should be LIFO in the end.

Without the spell stowaway epic feat, nothing I know of offhand lets you share another caster's time stop. Time stop is so very broken that once you come out of it, you've regained your immediate action and can interrupt your own celerity to do other things...and so can the 10 million ice assassins of your opponnent you made during your infinite-me-time.

1/2 ready for "When Neklos appears(attosecond?)" 1/2 ready for "When Neklos uses Celerity"

(Optional, split a third for "When Neklos casts Time Stop")

If he uses Celerity, then the second group goes before the Celerity goes off via the rules for readied actions. If he does not, the first group waste him.

The thing is, an immediate action uses your swift action for the next round. You only get one of them per character per round. You can't double Celerity.

Thus, readied actions between high level characters become an elaborate double bluff: Do you ready against their actual actions or appearance, or against their celerity? Celerity beats the readied against basic actions, and basic actions beat readied against Celerity.

The side with the ability to simultaneously ready for more different potential scenarios will win.

This is sort of a continuation of D&D optimization at it's most basic: The Action Economy is a harsh mistress. It is very very difficult for a single +5 CR or so opponent to threaten 5-6 optimized PCs for that reason, they have 500% more actions.

It's also why 3.0 Haste, Time Stop, and Celerity are some of the top spells in D&D - they give you more actions or let you take your actions first.

**** How to kill a god. Cast statue on a person (or a PAO insect if you want to be sneaky). They can now, as a free action, turn into a living statue or back, and their equipment and garments change with them.

Use true creation or whatnot to create a sphere with anti matter inside. Have the person take said object and turn into a statue of granite. Have a companion then smash up the object that previously contained antimatter.

As a free action the person can turn back into a human and an object that is made of antimatter and is mixed with matter and make a big boom.

Suppose instead you want to just kill the god.

Cast crown of flame, a spell with an emanation effect of 2d6 damage to evil undead, on 2000 commoners. Use PAO to turn them into lice or some similar insect. Tell them to stand on a spell component and put them in your spell pouch, which blocks line of sight and the emanation. Find Neklos and get within ten feet. As a free action, faster than the immediate action of celerity, draw out your spell component and do a minimum of 2000 damage per round.

  Polymorph Any Object
#+end_quote

from the SRD: This spell functions like polymorph, except that it changes one object or creature into another. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state. The duration is determined by using the following guidelines.

That's fairly clear cut to me. PAO causes an object to have two states, the original form, and the enchanted form. When you cast PAO a second time, you don't get a different original form, you're just changing the enchanted form.

A much more sensible spell to use would be Reduce Person. It can be permanencied, and each time you cast it explicitly halves the affected target's size. No mention of limits regarding original form or multiple use. Thirteen halvings reduces 2m to a quarter of a mm, and the only real restriction is that each casting reduces your STR by 2.

Getting 27 Strength to survive the 13 castings is possible in many ways, or using some other method to become 6 inches tall, which would reduce your need to only 9 castings and thus 19 STR.

But yeah, try not to overuse PAO, it's broken enough without skipping around that restriction by fast-talking the DM. It's much more fun to see the "useless" spells being cheesed.

If, as I believe, that's true, then the second casting of PAO would overwrite the first and reset the duration to "Permanent."

In any case, I'm not aware of any RAW that says a spell stops working if the target becomes invalid. It might be there is, but I'm not aware of it.

******** Second PAO totally trumps the first, but the original vs enchanted state wording does make it a bit debateable.

A rock polymorphed into a human, what is its original state when we cast PAO again? Can we make that permanant with another PAO?

If we consider original just meaning to refer to the state before the current spell was cast, then yes we can. But if original is taken to mean its natural, base form before magic was used to alter it, then no- it would just refresh the duration.

I would say either is a valid interpretation. I cant even guess which one is closer to RAI.

While I doubt the designers ever intended the gross violations we use, I could see the capability for permanent change being desired in this swiss army knife version of polymorph. Baleful polymorph lets you do permanent after all, so its not that far out there.

  Heh. Yeah. Although, you'd probably still lose. Neklos would use his Alter Reality power to simulate a Celerity, giving him a standard action before anyone else, even if it's a surprise round. He then casts Time Stop, giving him 2-5 rounds. He spends the first round of the Time Stop being dazed from the Celerity, then uses the second round to cast another Time Stop, which resets the counter to "2-5 rounds". He uses the first round to do something, then Time Stops again. Lather, rinse, repeat until you're all dead.

Could you beat that with readied actions?

Like, say you have a custom magic item that casts PAO, turning itself into antimatter, or something. (Maybe make it turn into anti-water and put it in a sacred vessel, just to see if you can get a holy antimatter explosion) You have one person ready an action to push the button upon Neklos performing any action. Then even if Neklos uses alter reality to subvert the surprise round, you /stll/ have the bomb go off before he moves.

I mean, overwhelming force prolly isn't the way you kill a god, but if you figure out something that /does/ work, then could you use a setup like that to get them before they could react?

My only conclusion here is that he intends to convince Neklos that getting lost is a superior option. Not sure how you'd accomplish that, but I did notice that involuntary banishment is explicitly impossible.

Actually, the other option I can think of is to convince the pantheon at large that it is optimal to put Neklos down right now . But that seems very difficult (getting any of their attention for a brief period seems reasonably easy, actually getting enough attention to convince them without being smited does not. Also IMO Jake and co. do not have any resources of a type that they would regard as a meaningful bribe, and finally, Neklos' rank implies that it would be very hard to do this organization without inadvertantly warning Neklos of it.)

Jake asks what would happen if Deadboy wasn't around any more which, combined with your subtle hints, seems less of a euphemism and more of a plan to get him to leave their planet or plane alone.

*** Well, even once the drauga war is dealt with, I still have a few things that I could write about:

1. What the other liches do once Afi / Neklos / both are out of the picture. Some of them would fade away, go back to research. Others would still try their hand at taking over the world now that they've gotten a taste of it. Not all of these would be straight up "kill everything" moves, either. cf Hammond's attempt at a mind-control plague.
2. What the lower-level undead (vampires, etc) do once they don't have a cohesive structure imposed on them from above.
3. The aftermath of the Drauga War -- how Anundj√• pick up the pieces in terms of their population and economy.
4. What it's like living in Anundj√• after they aren't fighting for their lives, but they've been packed-cheek-to-jowl refugees for the past N years.
5. What it was like living in Anundj√• /before/ the Drauga War.
6. Things that happened during the Drauga War that happened offscreen -- for example, I have a great idea for a short story about Albrecht defending the Legion camp when it was first attacked (see chapter 39 for a summary description).\\
7. The political scene in Flobovia -- Jake trying to administer the country now that Anundj√• is part of it, and the Conclave of Lords has gotten used to running things without him.
8. The end of Jake's reign, when it's time for him to go home, and what happens after. (I actually have some sketched-out plans for that.)

That said, 2YE has been a LOT of work. If I were going to continue it, I would move away from the D&D framework, convert the sequels to straight original fantasy, put it up with a Patreon or a Kickstarter, and eventually try to sell them on Kindle / Nook / iTunes / whatever.

I even have some ideas on the Patreon / Kickstarter thing -- letting readers help shape the story by voting with their dollars. I'd have final say, of course, but rewards at various levels would include cameos, addition of minor characters, introduction of plot points, etc.

I should add that I've done a test novella along these lines, which is available on [[http://GreenDogPress.blogspot.com][GreenDogPress]]. It's called "One Hot Night", and it's a story about Anundj√• before the Drauga War. It's on sale for $1 -- it was my MVP to see if people would buy my writing at any price. Sales have happened, which means I'm more comfortable with the idea of more writing.

Hm. Come to think of it, 2YE is very clearly satire, much like [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html][Order of the Stick]]. Rich Burlew has published compilations of OOTS, so I could probably publish 2YE as is. Hmm...
