** You've been confused by the English language.

"Nothing is something"

"But how can nothing be something if nothing is nothing?"

That's not as meaningful or paradoxical as it looks. In the language of set theory, it is:

"The empty set is a set."

"Sure, but the empty set doesn't have any sets in it, does it? How does that work?"

Then you go on to say that nothing is just something you can't see or understand. No, the empty set contains no other sets. By definition. This includes sets that I can't see or understand.

Just say "something incomprehensible" instead. That conveys the idea clearer. And by God, if you're going to tell me about higher dimensions and how they interact with our 3-dimensional world then tell me what exactly you are claiming these interactions are and give me evidence for them.
