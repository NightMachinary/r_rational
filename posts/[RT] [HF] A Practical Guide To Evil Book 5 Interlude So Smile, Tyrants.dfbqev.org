** Does someone remember where the idea of the trail came up? what does the tyrant want accuse the white knight of? Something that happened while he and his band were operating in the free cities around the time when the calamities were also there?

If anybody could link the relevant chapter(s), that would be amazing.

Hanno in the Free Cities is seen in the three Heroic Interludes and the three Calamity interludes of Book 3. He defends the cities of Delos and Nicae from the attacks of Kairos and the Calamities. The closest thing to an offensive action he takes is killing 15 magisters of Stygia in Heroic Interlude: Injunction, to prevent them from bringing their slave army to Nicae.

  But most importantly of all, on some barren shore, a knight in white stood with his sword high. A killer who had taken lives, but never at his own behest. Behind him, looking through a coin, something unfathomable loomed. The Seraphim, Anaxares thought. The Choir of Judgement. The angels who had judged and slain people of the League.

  The Hierarch smiled.

  For that, they would be judged in turn.
