** Wow, Cat being lonely enough to consider talking to *Akua* is a fairly poor sign.

Also, apparently goblinfire is made out of essence of demons? That has got to be an insane process- how do you even design safe working protocols for an endlessly diverse set of creatures like that?

**** Apparently, statistically within control. The fields of Stregis which its been implied heavily used munitions was how many years ago?

We might, have a first potentially linked fact to Chider's color considering she tossed munitions around like candy, if so I think that's where Akua learned the secrets of munitions

They contracted a certain Foundation to design Secure Containment Protocols for the task.

*** Interesting passage to consider with respect to goblins being a matriarchy. Does female mean leader in this passage, or is it a reference to a more savage time when female goblins were not treated with respect?

****** ...this is actually /obvious/ - If you have 100 human males and 100 females, and 99 males die - theoretically, the tribe could survive.

If 99 females die, the tribe is doomed.

(Unless goblin females reproduce like queen ants/bees...but goblin reproduction isn't explained in "A Practical Guide to Evil" as far as I know)

*** I wouldn't think so, any more than a promise not to use chlorine to gas opponents would stop you from having salt in your troops' rations. Demons and munitions are qualitatively different, even if one is partially sourced from the other.

** Goblins /probably/ don't have an actual demon down there to squeeze the ingredients out of, so they probably farm some kind of affected matter. Do you think they'd be able to make something out of an angel's corpse in Liesse? Masego did manage to reproduce its properties for the Ivory Globe, so it's not as potentially harmful to magic, at least.
