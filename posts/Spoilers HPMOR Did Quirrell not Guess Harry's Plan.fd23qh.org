In the culmination of the winter battles, the three Generals are brought on stage to make their Wishes of Quirrell.

As a prelude, Hermione and Draco make a surprising (to the audience) announcement - that as a result of the madness and chaos introduced by traitors, they will no longer be accepting traitorous offers, and will team up to smash harry if he does.

This outcome was anticipated by both Harry and Quirrell. Quirrell's plan was to make his point about Unity, and set up the children of Hogwarts to eventually accept Harry as their Light Lord, which would kick off their exciting game of cat and mouse once Harry reached majority, both staving off Q's boredom and fulfilling is plan to dominate magical Britain - and eventually the world.

However, Harry threw a few wrenches in the plan, both with his speech and, prior to this, with his announcement he will happily accept traitors, much to everyone's annoyance, Quirrell included.

Now, this gambit was part of Harry's larger plan for the Redemption of Draco. He wanted Draco to have to team up with Hermione to build empathy between them - there's nothing better than a common foe after all. Amusingly, this parallels and foreshadows the reveal of Riddle's original purpose for Voldemort - to create an enemy to unify magical Britain against. Harry even goes on to goad Draco into locking his own father out of opposing this odd alliance with some deft manipulation.

There's a ton of great and subtle political action going on in this scene, but one note interests me - Did Riddle know what Harry was doing re: Draco? He seems earnestly annoyed that Harry did not simply accept their proclamation and declare that he knew this was the solution all along, but wanted to let them figure it out. He later chides Harry for interfering in his own plans. Had he guessed at Harry's purpose in playing the Big Baddie to draw Draco out of his father's influence? Had he seen the echoes of his own mistakes, now from a more jaded perspective? Or did he miss Harry's intent entirely?


** Quirrel did know that Harry was redeeming Draco.

From Chapter 108: ""Don't be ridiculous," Professor Quirrell said. "If I had only wished to remove Miss Granger, I would not have brought the Malfoys into it. I observed your game with Draco Malfoy and found it amusing, but I knew it could not continue for very long before Lucius learned and intervened; and then your folly would have brought you great trouble, for Lucius would not take it lightly. Had you just been able to lose during the Wizengamot trial, lose as I had taught you, then in only two more weeks, ironclad evidence would have shown that Lucius Malfoy, after discovering his son's seeming perfidy, had Imperiused Professor Sprout into using the Blood-Cooling Charm on Mr. Malfoy and casting the False Memory Charm on Miss Granger. Lucius would have been swept off the political gameboard, sent to exile if not Azkaban; Draco Malfoy would have inherited the wealth of House Malfoy, and your influence over him would have been unchallenged. Instead I had to abort that plot in mid-course. You managed to completely disrupt the real plan in the course of sacrificing double your entire fortune, by giving Lucius Malfoy the perfect opportunity to prove his true concern for his son. You have an incredible anti-talent for meddling, I must say.""

*** Couldn't that have been just a lie, though? :p Do we trust the baddie?

**** At this particular point in the story, his reasons to lie are pretty far outweighed by what's already occurred, in my view.

*** I mean he seems to have suggested that the appropriate response here was for Harry to wait and hope for divine intervention. Was that really a response that Harry, or indeed any invested rational individual would have taken? Harry's actual action would have been much more difficult to predict (especially with Quirrel's minor blind spot concerning empathy), but unless he's totally wrong in regards to his predictions of Harry's values then he should have foreseen that Harry would not deem this loss an acceptable one.

**** The /actual/ lesson would not have been "wait for divine intervention," but rather "notice when you cannot win the immediate conflict and at least pretend to lose." This is not something Harry ever /really/ learns, because Quirrelmort doesn't understand how someone like Harry operates. If a life is in danger, particularly a friend, he can't just rationally look at the numbers and decide "yep, this is way too expensive a tradeoff, I have to let them die." If he CAN save them, he WILL.

** I think that, as stated near the end of the story, Quirrell has a blind spot in his rationality regarding altruistic motivations. So he probably couldn't conceive Harry intentionally handicapping himself in order to help Draco in a way that doesn't strictly help Harry.

EDIT: Or not. The other comment seems to disprove this.

*** Probably because in his mind, Harry is not doing it to help Draco - as far as he can see, Harry must be doing it to control Draco.
