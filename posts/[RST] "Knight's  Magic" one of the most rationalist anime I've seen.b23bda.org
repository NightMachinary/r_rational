** Hum, rather than a succession of "it's rationalist", "it's not really", "maybe it's rational", "the original isn't"... maybe actual arguments for why it is or isn't this or that would be more constructive ?

I guess I'll try, since I'm currently watching it (ep9)

One thing is certain : it's not "rationalist".

#+begin_quote
  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of *rationalist fiction*, a subcategory of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Characters from this story don't care much about being rational or not.

Now are they and the story rational ?\\
I suppose I can see how the main character could be seen as such : there is an apparent focus on him learning how things work and trying to deconstruct those to build new things never seen before. Though that attempt is very shallow and no amount of "how" is actually explained... especially how main character's original programming skills play any role in all this, aside from "magic is like programming, I'm a super programmer, therefore, I'm a super magician, poof" => well, thanks, I'm a programmer too, I would have liked to be able to relate to that part...

The story seems to be trying not to be too linear either, but again... shallow attempt, I'd say.

----

I personally find this anime quite nice and refreshing, but not very high on a rational-meter. (though probably higher than many others)

Could be interesting to see which anime are considered rational by the community.\\
Log Horizon is the first one that comes to my mind.

It's been a while since I watched [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest][/Zetsuen no Tempest/]], but if I recall correctly, it's the most rational one of those I've seen. Suffice to say that characters behave sensibly enough, not bound by their assigned story roles. Another interesting trope is a Good vs. Good conflict.

The highlight for me was (mild spoiler for Season 1) the final battle of Season 1, which consisted of four people standing on a hill and intensely arguing with each other about idiosyncratic magic mechanics.

Season 2 drops the ball a bit, though, but doesn't disappoint outright.

Some actually rational ones:

- Cowboy bebop\\
- Suisei no Gargantua\\
- The melancholy of Haruhi suzumia\\
- One punch man\\
- Mob Psyco 100

​

Not so strictly rational as the above but still close:\\
- the monogatari series\\
- Made in Abyss\\
- FLCL\\
- Code Geas\\
- No game no life\\
- Stien's gate

​

And most likely tones more I have just forgotten about since I watched them 4+ years ago or didn't personally enjoy enough to put on the list.

*** Deconstructing some of the rational(ist) things I enjoyed (that was a lot of show not tell):

- The gun type rod. Yes he has prior knowledge, but it's the obviously superior way to build something which must be aimed.
- Using rods to fly. He would have to think this one out, his prior knowledge is simply "flying is a useful tactical advantage". Figuring out how to do that within the magic system would be more interesting with more details, but we can see how he evolved the spell from the wind blast on the roof tops, and for propelling the dwarf.
- When the demons attack he isn't conflicted with bystander bias - this is also demonstrated earlier somewhat at his job - and while he has ulterior motives, it is borderline rational*ist*.
- When he points out that just because robots were designed after people to begin with they are just machines, tools, and we should add the functionality we need. Changing that kind of thinking in the people around him.

  - For example a couple episodes later, one of the people he is working with repeats his own wisdom back to him and finds the solution to a problem.

- (Elves Spoiler) When he learns the magic of creating the reactors, he works around the problems that limit it to elves only using the tools available to him. This is as close to a fair play munchkin puzzle as it gets from my memory, but it's at least there for like 5 minutes.
- (Edit) The first real villain and counter play with the villain is straight forward. She acts rationally, and he acts rationally in return.

  - Also the trope awareness of adding keys to the machines. Basically every mech anime involves people stealing other mechs multiple times over, and they only do it the once here.

Probably more that I forget, I only just re-watched the first two episodes the other night. It was only with the context of having re-read HPMOR recently that I even saw it as rational+ist+ at all. (Edit on re-watching more of it, I added some more thoughts).

*** You are right I screwed up the tags.

I had just read HPMOR again and this one reminded me of that very strongly. I agree that it is pretty anemic on the rational side, but the fact that it is there /at all/ rates it pretty highly. Maybe I just don't watch enough anime.

Honestly my goal was to start a conversation on it. I also added the condition "one of the most rationalist" on purpose, and I'm glad many people caught it. I was hoping people would try to one up me with better counter examples (so I could watch them).

And so far [[/u/Noumero]] has been the only one to have a potential better counter example.

**** I haven't watched the anime, but read enough of the manga and novel to get the picture and have been informed that the anime is the same, so with that in mind;\\
If K&M is the most rational/rationalist anime you have ever seen, then you've practically not seen any anime.\\
To just list of a bunch of good shows that are without a doubt leagues ahead in rationality:\\
- Cowboy bebop\\
- Suisei no Gargantua\\
- The melancholy of Haruhi suzumia\\
- One punch man\\
- Stien's gate\\
- Mob Psyco 100\\
- the monogatari series\\
- Made in Abyss\\
- FLCL\\
- Code Geas\\
- No game no life\\
While shows that are arguably more rational would be pages long. But those I would strongly recommend watching if you haven't, and if you have curious to what you liked about K&M?

***** I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b23bda/rst_knights_magic_one_of_the_most_rationalist/eir96ty/][another post]] about what I found rational-esque-tropes about K&M. (I've only watched the anime).

Of the ones you've listed, that I've seen, I'll tell you why I disagree (all of this is spoilers for anyone else probably):

#+begin_quote
  Cowboy bebop
#+end_quote

Maybe I am totally misunderstanding here, but this is a classic noir / detective / mystery-story at best. I don't see whats rational about this besides the characters not being total idiots.

#+begin_quote
  Suisei no Gargantua
#+end_quote

The main character doesn't really do anything to improve the situation of the people. Yes he uses his advanced technology to help them /directly/. But it's not like he is taking his other world knowledge to teach them how to build lasers or reactors or robots.

#+begin_quote
  The melancholy of Haruhi suzumia
#+end_quote

No clue how this has any rational tropes.

#+begin_quote
  Code Geas
#+end_quote

This one I would agree with as rational to an extent, especially because the main character is said to be smarter than the other people. But there isn't really any fair-play who-done-its, or like an ability to predict how he is going to munchkin things. The main character does smart stuff, but we can't really follow along with where things are going, or predict what he's going to do. There also isn't any genre awareness (like in K&M).

Like they tell us he's smart, but they don't show us how he solves impossible problems by letting us know why they should be impossible in the first place. They basically just make him smarter by fiat.

As a direct counter example, in K&M they figure out to use a key after someone steals a mech /once/. And the rationalist character sort of kicks himself for not thinking of it earlier. The entire multiple seasons of Code Geass involve people stealing mechs *multiple times* from the *same people*. Yes that one time he mind controls the person. But they do it multiple other times when it would be impossible for him to mind control people for the codes. Stealing mechs is a trope of mech anime (like every gundam origin story involves it) and one of the reasons K&M appears so rationalist to me is that they are very trope aware here.

As a broad counter example, Death Note does this /much/ better. It shows the situation and lets the main character think through his logic and solution. I would rank it as better than K&M, but I still feel like Death Note and K&M outclass everything on your list that I have I seen.

****** Ah, i meant (and assumed (wrongly i suppose) that you meant) rational, not rationalist. I agree with your statements, the characters and tropes are not one of rationalist shows. But I strongly disagree that they are not rational.

Those that i mentioned have some of the most internally consistent worlds, character and motivations out of most anime i have seen, -and personally i find this to be a bare minimum to be able to enjoy a rationalist show. (geas though i agree is at the bottom of the list by far, but is technically rationalist)

******* Incidental semi-review (of the anime, having greatly enjoyed the manga): the (animation-and-otherwise) quality of each chapter-section is good, regarding which I have no complaints. Each episode has three chapter-sections, and Wikipedia suggests that there are 12 episodes total; I feel as though this unduly limits the total animated chapters (compared to if there were more episodes), but this could easily be the nocebo effect if considering the possibility of a further season or two in future.

​

Or, to change the phrasing: "Question: Is the anime closer to a collection of 'highlights' than to its ideal form?" "Answer: Even if it were, isn't a(n excellent quality!) selection of the chosen-as-best chapters an amazing thing in itself?"

*** Why not?

Anime is produced in Japan, by Japanese people, and their main audience are Japanese people too. Most of them know English well enough to recognize and read most common words, but not well enough to spot obvious grammatical or syntactical errors. Therefore, anime producers have a market incentive to include gratuitous English in titles/names/places where it would look cool, whereas the incentive to ensure that it's grammatically correct --- or, indeed, meaningful --- is comparatively weaker.

That given, there is absolutely no reason to expect anime creators to sanity-check their use of a foreign language with someone who actually speaks it before including it in their work.
