Hi ya'll, I just finished my novella. I posted the first eight chapters and got some good feedback here:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4krzo1/rt_wip_fantasy_storyweaver/]]

I've gone over it a few times now and fixed up some of the stuff that was pointed out to me. It's not that great, really, but I think it can be somewhat entertaining during certain moments. If anyone's feeling bored then here's the full story:

There's two ways I've been thinking to pitch this novella. One of them is:

#+begin_quote
  In this action-adventure fantasy, Catherine and Arthur find themselves forced to go along with the schemes of their mad scientist friend, Emmet Wilfery, tagging along with him on a surreal, philosophical, and terrifying journey through a chaotic dimension of dreams to prevent the universe's destruction.
#+end_quote

The other is:

#+begin_quote
  The circumstances that led a bright, but naive, young woman towards deciding to become God.
#+end_quote

It's a 25k story so it's sort of a quick read. This is the first of a two part series I planned on doing. It's the first long-form I've ever finished so I don't really think it's anything special. Still, I felt like I needed to finish it before I moved on (even if I never revisit this again). Since I'm not really publishing this I'm mostly looking for general impressions. Anything that can help me better myself as a writer going forward! Someone also said that it's noticeable English isn't my native tongue. I apologize in advance for this! I'm hoping to fix that, but I don't know how :/

*** Well I'm hoping to make a career out of this once I graduate. I know it'll take me a few years before my skill gets to a professional level, but I'm in this for the long haul. Anything that can turn my writing from readable to decent will help me. A few things that worry me:

- Character empathy: I want to strike a balance between arrogant and likable. I don't want the reader to /love/ my characters at first, just understand where they're coming from. If no one likes them then I obviously need to fix something. Basically, I want them to feel like real people.

- Fight Scenes: I don't know if they're as gripping/tense-filled as I wanted them to be. Particularly in the climax, where it basically turns into an anime frenzy.

- Worldbuilding: Due to the nature of their journey, my characters don't really interact much with the world around them. I was planning diving deeper into the dimension's culture and stuff in the second part. My aim was to make the Dreamscape as amazing as possible but I don't know if I succeeded there.

- Dialogue: Anything that can make it less stilted. One of my main characters is a philosopher so I wanted to avoid sounding pretentious as much as possible. I think I made it clear that it's the character's opinions and not mine, but I don't know if I succeeded there.

- The ending: I want to know if the decision Catherine makes at the end makes sense from her point of view. It's insane, so I don't expect anyone to agree with her, but that's kinda the point.

Really, my only goal for this story was to provide something fun and interesting that would make people think. I don't think I achieved that, but if someone can finish it without feeling like their time was totally wasted, then I'll be satisfied. I know there's a bunch of things I could fix with a few edits and revisions passes, but I don't want to sink that much time into this if it isn't worth it.
