I wasn't sure where to post this. I saw at least one other thread here that seemed to be a "general question" rather than pertaining to any specific works of fiction, so I'm supposing this is okay. Let me know if there's a more appropriate subreddit or tag!

There are more than enough stories out there about time travel. It's common for characters to be warned not to change the past, and the reason usually has something to do with being unable to predict how that would change the future. The cliche is that you "shouldn't kill Hitler" because maybe you'll just end up making things even worse somehow.

The argument in FAVOR of killing Hitler seems kind of underrepresented. A rationalist could probably conceive of some plan a little more careful and surgical than just going back and putting a bullet in the guy's head. Someone familiar with history and politics might be able to fix Germany's economy, prevent the Holocaust and contribute to an overall "better" timeline. Doesn't it at least seem possible?

Now, most people can probably agree that the Holocaust was terrible. Killing is bad in general. But nations were founded on mass murder. Think of the U.S. or the Khans. The other major argument AGAINST going back in time to prevent large-scale atrocities is that the political makeup of the world could be changed. Your country might not even exist. YOU might not even exist.

So, that brings me to my main point. I agree that there have been horrible atrocities in the history of the world. It seems "right" to wish they had never happened. But I am very, very attached to myself, and so if it really came down to it and time travel were at my fingertips... I would probably be in the camp that says NOT to change the past... because I want to keep existing.

This "seems" like an okay way to feel on the surface... but is it really? Isn't it SELFISH of me? My brain twists in knots trying to explain how it's not exactly the same as being GLAD these atrocities happened. I begin to feel almost RESPONSIBLE for these countless lost lives. The only reason I can claim that I'm NOT responsible for all of that is that I don't seem to have the power to change the past. But what if I did?

What if I had the power to save trillions of lives, and didn't use it, because I was afraid I'd lose myself? It gives me a terrible guilty feeling just thinking about it. Would that make me a monster? Shouldn't I endeavor to be infinitely compassionate? What would an infinitely compassionate person do? I worry that putting myself before others makes me undeserving of the life I have.

I realize that this all seems much "safer" to talk about in the context of time travel being physically impossible. But morality isn't just your actions. Can't you assess morality just as well based on thoughts, beliefs and desires?

I realize this has been a bit of a ramble. Again, I don't know if this was the best place for these thoughts. But I really respect the rationalist community and would like some real logic applied to this conundrum if possible.

Thank you for your time!


** The /optimal/ solution for a would-be Hero of Time is to be patient and don't lose humanity until we get our stuff figured out (as in, we won't accidentally go extinct and we can't be killed by biological disease and aging processes).

Time travel should be reserved for reversing humanity-ending crises - note that any major backwards time travel is a moral travesty for erasing an entire timeline, so it should only be used in extreme cases.

When our species is ready for the End of Times, we put the entire population into a gigantic time machine. Then we go back in time, second by second, and save each soul right before they are lost.

Once you've gone sufficiently far back and there's no beings you want to save left, you and every other person that ever lived has been saved forever.

#+end_quote

Note that any choice is an equivalent travesty (see [[http://dresdencodak.com/2009/04/19/onald-creely/][related Dresden Codak]]).

It is unclear to what extent the past "will not have happened" if you time travel to before that point, and less clear still what kinds of "will not have happened" we should be morally offended by.

If timelines with time travel are retroactively erased, then if you flip a coin and only time travel if it lands heads, you will always see it lands tails, because heads-timelines are erased. By extension, you will never be in the position of choosing that your timeline disappears. Either you go because this doesn't cause a paradox because the time travel is already part of your universe, or you don't go. (This would be the mechanism of GR wormholes through time, probably).

If futures from the moment of time traveler are erased, non-time travellers will always see would-be time travellers fail, in a way which is exactly homologous to quantum immortality. And like with quantum immortality it's ambiguous whether we should care (especially since there will be no-one to mourn us): it's physically identical to zero subjective probability of time travel succeeding according to people who don't time travel.

If time travel does not erase the past or the future, then it is not so much changing the past as traveling to an alternate one. There will be a universe where you leave, never to be seen again, and a world where you arrive and are never born. Both universes are mechanically identical to ours and thus contain qualia as much as ours. We can therefore create universes, and have a moral duty to create every possible universe which has positive utility. (A subset: sending fAI with every possible to every GR::event in the universe).

** Honestly, I'd say killing hitler is a waste, for a number of reasons:

- Its debatable whether it would avert the holocaust, or even WWII
- If a time machine can transport you physically through time, you can do so much more. Like preventing the fall of rome, preventing plagues, or even pulling [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ow4hy/you_are_now_the_monarch_of_a_small_european/][something like this]] off.

*** It depends on when you do it, of course. I will say this, though. Having recently read a lot of history about the Weimar republic, there are a few main points:

1. The treaty of Versailles had everyone from the communists to the conservatives frothing at the mouth with hatred against the injustice of the treaty. In retrospect... Yeah. Just about no one even tries to defend the treaty these days. It was incredibly unfair, and did a lot of damage to Weimar Germany. Which... was probably the point. France wanted Germany to never be a strong power again.

2. Germany's economical disasters during the 20s, from the French occupation of the Ruhr to the hyperinflation that followed the German passive resistance (Germany paid workers not to work in French-occupied areas, and paid by printing money -> exponentially accelerating inflation) and the accompanying wiping out of all life long savings and pensions to the world wide effects of the Great Depression (Which hit especially hard in Germany because they were dependent on US loans which were cancelled when the depression hit) to the never ending war reparations... The German economy was fucked, leading to incredible political turmoil, and a total of 40 political parties being represented in parliament over the course of only 13 years. None of them ever really having enough power to push strongly for the reforms they were arguing for, since everything required broad alliances. Leading to:

3. Rising discontent-voting on both the right and the left led to a very polarized parliament that couldn't agree on even fundamentals, leading to Rule By Emergency Decree, first rarely, then increasingly as a substitute for the parliamentary process. Between 1923-5 the social democrats invoked Emergency Decree on /136/ different occasions.

Was then dictatorship inevitable? Maybe. But the way it played out, it took a long series of perfectly aligned circumstances for the NSDAP to take over. Hitler never 'really' got a majority in the parliament. The November election 1932 gave the Nazis 33% of the vote. They formed a coalition government with the German National People's Party (Conservative/Nationalist), which still failed to achieve a majority. Hitler immediately called for new elections, but this time with one crucial difference. He gave many seats in the government to the Conservatives, but he kept for the Nazis the Minister of the Interior (Law enforcement) and GÃ¶ring as Chief of Police for Prussia (60% of Germany). The Nazis used these positions to harass communists and social democrats and sabotage their campaigns, arrest people in the middle of the street and then release them the same day, failing to investigate violence against the left. Etc, etc.

And then came the Reichstag Fire. The Nazis blamed the communists. The communists blamed the Nazis. The truth is probably that one insane communist with a documented history of mental illness set the fire alone. The coalition managed to push through an Emergency Decree to ban the communists, and worded it in such a way that, since the Nazis controlled the police, they not only shut down the communists completely, but also managed to justify shutting down large parts of the middle ranks of the social democrats, who weren't even accused of having any part in the fire.

Having banned the communists and knee capped the social democrats, they proceeded to cheat in the election (By forcing people to choose between voting anonymously for the sitting government or to proclaim their intention to vote for someone else, and other nice tricks). Thus they managed to get a majority in the parliament.

They didn't want that, however. They wanted /absolute/ power. And for that, they needed a two thirds majority to bypass the constitution. They achieved this, known as the Reichstag Fire Decree or the Enabling Act, by allying with the Vatican and the Catholic Centre Party. So yes, the democracy in Weimar Germany was looking pretty frail by the tie the Nazis emerged on the stage, but they also had to work pretty hard to wipe out the left and bypass the constitution.

The final speech exchange between Hitler and Otto Wels (Leader of the Social Democrats) before the death of German democracy is available with subtitles on youtube. I find it horrifying, depressing and extremely interesting to listen to. The catcalling and jeering as Wels holds his last speech, and then the incredibly well spoken Hitler and the thunderous applause. (Can't find it both with subtitles and without the background music, but [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SimPsL7LYHs][here is part one with subtitles.]])

***** My understanding is that the Black Death was mostly responsible for the end of feudalism.

Before the Death went through, there was such an oversupply of labor that it had basically no value -- you couldn't run from your lord because there was nowhere to run /to/ that was really different, and another lord had no incentive to accept you and piss off your current lord. There was also no incentive to come up with labor-saving devices, and not enough leisure time to do it anyway.

When the Death went through it killed off something like 30-50% of the population of Europe. In its wake there weren't enough people to get everything done, so technology started advancing in order to make people more efficient. People moved into cities to put together the population density necessary to get work done, and the resulting creation of a middle class meant that serfs suddenly had a place to run to, as well as having value to their lords.

Despite all that, I don't advocate releasing a plague.

******* On the one hand, the population of Europe back then was much smaller and the death of feudalism meant that many, many more people were born into much better lives than actually died. From a utilitarian POV it was probably a good exchange.

There may well have been better ways to achieve it -- the Mongols might have done. They killed a lot of people in the sense that they wiped out entire cities, but they did that so that other cities would surrender peacefully instead of fighting and getting lots of people killed. At the height of their power (under Ghengis) the Mongol Empire was a very safe place, with something that looked a lot like an appellate court system and at least some tech development. I don't know how much room for advancement there was for non-Mongols, which might have been difficult. The only problem is that it was mostly a cult of personality and when Ghengis died the place went downhill fast. Four generations later the Empire was gone, although the Ottoman Empire (one of its successor states) lasted for a goodly while.

Alternatively, if one lord had decided there was advantage to himself in developing industry that might have worked, maybe. It would have been very much a company town setup, so I don't know how much it would really have let the serfs advance.

I'm sure there's other ways, but that's what springs to mind.

Now, there are reasons to consider this to be a necessary price to be paid. You don't want to meddle with time willy-nilly after all, and if you aren't darned sure that your actions will result in an overall future then you're having to weigh these millions against those billions.

Don't worry though, people from the future will soon begin showing up to help /you/ out, using the theoretically infinite resources of the indefinitely distant future.

***** Causality is....odd. The butterfly effect is potent, and there are so many things we can't predict. It's quite possible that every step you take changes who lives and who dies over the next twenty four hours. That doesn't make you any more or less responsible for those deaths. Does being aware of which step does what really change this? Of course, all we can do is use what knowledge we have to be the best people we can be, so I suppose it does. But what do we say to uncertainty then? You have this machine, and going back may change things. Or maybe Germany, without the bad PR generated by some of Hitler's more radical movements, is made stronger by allies that don't turn on it, leading to a larger, more devestating war? Who can say? And if this time machine thing is a one time only option, then it becomes very dangerous. You'll feel guilty for the rest of your life, if you go back and cause the deaths of even more millions of people, but you may also usher in a utopia? Who can say? Personally, from a practical viewpoint, I don't believe it's sensible to go back and change things. As of right now, the world isn't perfect, but I think we're trending upwards, overall, and we are much improved from even just the last few years. Who's to say what changes you will enact? And while the Holocaust did suck (understatement of the century), the billions you erase from existence by changing the course of human history would make you, ironically, much worse than Hitler, depending on how you choose to view human life and what it means.

** Well, that depends on what you consider changing history to /be/, ethically.

In most fiction, changing the future literally /changes/ individual people into their alternate-timeline versions; if it's a film, you can often physically see them transform into another person. Of course, they don't remember being another person; indeed, you kind of get the impression that there's no causal connection between them. It's arguable that turning a person into a different person and wiping their memory is the same as killing them.

And then there's the risk of butterflying away entire people so they're never born. It'd probably be the most realistic for every change to the past to completely erase /everyone/, but in fiction this is usually not the case. But there /will/ be some people, and fiction generally agrees that this should be treated as murder. (But the protagonists pretty much never notice this possibility unless it happens in front of them.)

Of course, it's difficult to have a consistent system where you can erase /yourself/ from history without creating some sort of crazy paradox shenanigans. But still, all your friends and family would be gone, at least for a certain value of "gone". They *certainly* would not remember you as you are.

In short: yes, you should absolutely figure out which enormous number of people you'd be murdering before changing history *at all*. But, at least in fiction (where timelines are "sticky" and tend to look the same unless forced otherwise) it might potentially win out in the utilitarian calculus.

(Oh, and if you want to preserve your home for whatever reason, visit the future and find out where Space Hitler will be born or the Space Zombie Plague will be unleashed.)

But I don't think that going back in time to kill Hitler, or to stop any single atrocity. /Hitler/ probably isn't the target if you want to find the single biggest points of intervention, but maybe you have emotional reasons for doing so, or maybe your utility functions are arranged differently from mine such that stopping someone else is what's important.

** The biggest reason not to kill hitler is the risk of global thermonuclear war.

If it's a "reality get's overwritten, whatever change you make stays put" situation, then I'd avoid most such large-scale changes, regardless of my own self's existence, even if I knew the expected net benefit was a solid positive.

The reason is I'm risk-adverse. If I could flip a coin where heads would prevent 8 billion deaths (and safely and comfortably allow the world to support the population), and tails would kill all humans on earth, I wouldn't do it.

If I made such a big change, even if everything would /probably/ be better, there's still a small chance they'd get MUCH worse. If europe wasn't ravaged by WWII, then who knows how the cold war would have played out? We'd have LOTS of world powers with the resources to pursue a nuclear weapons project, not just 2 parties, and it's much harder to cooperate with 5 parties than just 2. It might have been just fine, but ANY large scale change could shake up the powderkeg of the cold war, which I'm disinclined to do.
