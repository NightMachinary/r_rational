** This was a chapter where /things happened/ and I really like that.

It seems that Rain is way too often just reacting to bullshit. The story gets bogged down from it.

But here, we see plans for the future. Invitations are extended, decisions are made, and I want more chapters like this where characters move /forwards/

Does anyone have any guess as to what link sight was trying to tell him?

*** With Ameliah? I interpreted it as detecting romantic feelings or something close to that.

**** Probably works with human connections in general, like family, friends, etc. Not just romantic but whenever there is some sort of important connection with somebody.

** Oh God I hope the Ameliah tension does not become a new cave-in arc. He spent so long separated from his friends, with the survival of an entire town on his back, and almost died in a fight. He could open his mouth and tall about how he feels.

** Ah, Rain has been promoted from random to Custodian. Almost as good as being promoted from employee to customer.

Hopefully this means Rain will increase his level soon, personally this arc wasn't to my liking. I really do wonder what the deal is going to be with Dozer, he's gotta have some major story purpose right?

*** I feel like there have been a dozen things that gotta have some major story purpose like that. Honestly kind of frustrating how such things get introduced and then aren't used (much).

**** I really like Delve but it's pretty clear if it was ever published an editor would cut a lot of material. Almost the entire stuck underground segment could be cut w/o affecting the course of the story for example. /But/ that's web serials really. Overwhelmingly they're learn to write projects so it's to be expected that mistakes are made.

***** It's not "learn to write" so much as "basically unedited". Given the opportunity, people ramble. Basically every web serial (even well-regarded ones like Worm) is way longer than it has any reason to be. Though to be fair, books are not immune to that either (my hardcopy of /Oathbringer/ is /twelve hundred pages long/).

** Someone in the Discord came up with a very interesting theory based on the fact that there is an exp cap from monster types. I'll put it in spoilers in case others don't want to know about the Patreon discussion: Monster exp caps are a clue towards there being a cap on exp from resource usage. So Rain is going to run out of exp from mana usage which will limit his ridiculous leveling speed later in the story.

  Rain looked up, wiping his forehead. /Where did he come from? I need a more specific version of Detection, already./ “Hi Bartum, uh, look, I'm sorry. I'm not going to say who did it, but it was an accident. We didn't mean to set the gatehouse on fire, and we put it out as soon as we---”

Kettel should still be within the city instead of anywhere near Rain's group. So it's totally Ava's fault. Lol.

*** The question is whether wasted exp while capped counts towards that limit.
