*** Care to elaborate why? I thought it was a pretty good example of fictional rational thinking, considering, yknow, reincarnation don't real. A look at how someone in a fiction would rationally react to discovering a past live, except with some cool history.

***** Their [[http://www.reddit.com/user/Abydosfan101][profile]] says they've been a Redditor for 7 hours, so certainly this /specific/ account did not create this sub. (Could be the same person with a different account, of course...)

On a related note, the sidebar says "created by centipeed" and "a community for 5 years". Pretty sure the latter is false so I assume the former is also false and the code was just sloppily copied from some other subreddit, but I don't know that for sure. [[/u/eaturbrainz]], [[/u/PeridexisErrant]], you're listed as this sub's mods; care to comment?

****** Sticking to the sub's history, I believe it was created and then abandoned by [[/u/centipeed]] about five years ago. [[/u/eaturbrainz]] took it over via [[/r/redditrequest]] in the gap before the last arc of HPMOR, and invited me a co-mod thanks to the [[/r/errantry]] connection.

[[/u/centipeed]] is still active, and will get a username mention from this. If [[/u/Abydosfan101]] is an alt, maybe this could be confirmed?

******* That's more-or-less accurate. [[/u/centipeed]] had meant it to be a place for redditors to rationally discuss things, but it had never gotten any attention, so he didn't mind forking it over when I ([[/u/seraphnb]]) asked him for it about a year ago. Actually, probably a bit more than a year -- however long ago [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1ryed3/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality/][this post]] was. When I decided to try to kick my lingering reddit addiction by deleting [[/u/seraphnb]], I handed it over to [[/u/eaturbrainz]]; idk when he decided to get you involved, but it was quite a while after I left.

Anyway. This is a lot of irrelevant, and not at all the point of my comment. I'm still waiting for a good explanation of why this submission doesn't belong in this sub.

****** That's not how reddit works. Subreddits are defined by data, which reddit runs through its page-generation algorithms. Creators of subreddits have no hand in code, though they can add CSS to change the default theme. The "created by" and "a community for" snippets are taken directly from reddit's database of who made which subreddit when.

****** IIRC the sub was defunct and simply repurposed for its current use back when [[/r/HPMOR]] wanted a specific place to recommend stuff to each other.

Ah, you're right. I skimmed down the page to see if it was there but didn't notice the tiny little font. Thanks for pointing it out.

**** Honestly, could you just keep the damn account this time so we can keep track of you? Seeing you make new usernames and then kvetch about these things like a common spammer isn't exactly pleasant.

***** For the record, I only kvetch on one in every 30 accounts. And this wasn't even a kvetch; I've got no idea why everyone seemed to fixate on it. Besides, coming up with new usernames is fun ðŸ˜ˆ

I won't do it again, I pwomise

** This does not belong in this sub because it's not fiction. It's a competent scholar who had delusions of reincarnation, but made sure to develop her delusions into plausibility through research and wit.

While the sub name is "rational", the "fiction" is implied.

I mean, it's cool and all. [[/r/todayilearned]] would probably enjoy it.

*** Good enough! I suppose if I intended it for brainstorming, I should have stuck it with a [BST] tag, or maybe put a discussion question in the title. Thanks for the meaningful feedback!

** As mentioned in the most recent SSC Links Thread. She (supposedly) recovered memories of her past life in ancient Egypt, so she did the rational thing with this discovery and became an Egyptologist, using her supernatural knowledge to aid her archaeological work. Whether it's true or not, she certainly had a much more [[/r/rational]]-style reaction to reincarnation than most!
