** Chapter 26, actually, though since I made the mistake on my wordpress before editing it I can hardly blame you.

** So Winter!Fae didn't completely fill the third Aspect slot, just... heavily suggested for it. *Fall* is super thematic on multiple levels, with the reference to seasons/winter, as well as Cat's propensity for smiting proud assholes. Certainly useful for The Girl Who Would Climb The Tower.

  I wanted to crush him under my boot, and the bone-deep hatred I'd felt when first entering Summer well up in response.

  I didn't set it aside, this time. I took it, owned it, carved it into a weapon. It was mine, and it would answer to my will like any other aspect.
#+end_quote

It's clear in the short term, it's 'just' a powerful aspect. However, It sounds like the source is still Winter Fae. If she permanently loses her Winter Fae powers, I could see it going either way in terms of her keeping it, or the slot being open for a new aspect. I don't know if we'll ever find out that subtlety, though. Cat's "always had this power" so she may not lose it when the seasons turn / she gets her heart back.

Love the aspect for this narrative moment in the story though.

**** Should be interesting to see if her title rotates with the seasons.

**** I don't think it's an aspect, but rather a Speech-like open-ended magic.

** Fall as an aspect seems incredibly powerful but also very strange. Every other aspect up until this point works in some form of "I Blank": I Learn, I Struggle, I Seek, I Take, I Break, I Rise, and so on. But Fall seems to be used on an opponent - "You Fall". This means that when it works for Cat it should work incredibly well, as an Aspect imbued with Winters power. But it also will likely lead to her demise. At some point "I Fall" is going to happen and it's going to be Bad.

*** I'd argue it already has by the time she used the aspect. It's I Fall...from grace. As much as she isn't in the side of Good, she has been trying to tip toe the line ever since the dream Black gave her. But step by step she's been going in the villain direction. Now she is at least subconsciously willing to fall down to the deepest gutter if her opponent comes as well. So it's also I Fall...and take you with me.

*** Well, she did just go full rational!Monster, exactly like her teacher. That probably counts as a fall.

It would be interesting if she has to sacrifice something every time she uses Fall.

  “Fall,” I said.

  The world went dark. A boundless night sky spread above us, without a single speck of light to break the back.

That's a hell of a thing. Though I can't be the only person drawing parallels to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrlymHW0qU8&ab_channel=billysponGemonKey][the Lich from Adventure Time]]

** Continuing to love the Cat / Harkram dynamic.

#+begin_quote
  “Been a while since we were in a scrap side-by-side,” I said.

  “Liesse, I think,” Hakram mused. “Learned a few things since then.”

  “So have I,” I said. “Try to keep up.”

Possibly, all three.

** I find it interesting that her first three aspects seemed to be related to her trying to find her place in the world and how she could deal with all these assholes who kept telling her what to do- she had to learn fast, had to struggle to deal with more experienced enemies, had to seek solutions.

Now she's got experience and a MO, and her aspects describe it. Neat! Brutal, too.
