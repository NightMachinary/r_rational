*** Also a nice demonstration of how horror lies in tone rather than content. As [[/u/CaptainLoggers]] commented, plenty of scifi has taken the same premise and turned it into adventure rather than horror.

Mind, I really liked the statement that the Machine(s) simply /did not care/ enough to exterminate humanity. They just built themselves spaceships and /left/, post-haste.

*** The third rule specifically is a reminder of what came out of the Butlerian Jihad: Thou Shalt Not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.

Warhammer 40k too, as a result of the war with the Iron Men, has a similar rule.
