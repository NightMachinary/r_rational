I'm in the planning stages for a world where magic involves setting down runes in order to warp and otherwise manipulate space. I'm hoping that you folks could help me to see some unconventional ways of taking advantage of the system.

If it has to do with bending space then runes can do it, but:

- You have to actually make those runes.

- This can be both difficult and time-consuming: bigger tasks require not only more runes, but greater precision in your runes.

- Runes that are carved into rock will, naturally, last longer than runes that you made with water calligraphy.

- Runes start working from the moment that the system is complete, but it is possible to turn a system of runes off by erasing the "capstone" or final rune of the system. Even if you want the system to last for centuries it might still be a good idea to just draw that last rune in pencil if you don't want it to be on for that whole time.

A few general rules:

- It is easier in every way to do something that is simpler, than something that is more complex (obviously).

- It is easier to do something small, than to do something large. Doubling the internal space of your wallet is so, so much easier than doubling the internal space of a police box or tripling the internal space of your wallet.

- When transporting things, it is again easier to send less than it is to send more, and to send things a shorter distance than it is to send them a longer distance. Because you are only transporting air, it is easier to "throw" your voice to someone a mile away than it is to throw yourself that same distance, and it is also easier than throwing your voice five miles.

- Each function requires its own set of runes. If you are throwing your voice a mile away then your target needs a set of runes on that side to do the same to you so that you can hear a response. Either that, or you need a second set of runes to go to in order to "pull" from that location. No matter what, though, you need some coordination if you are "throwing" and "pulling" from the same patch of space, making it like a push-to-talk radio.

- It is easier to transport something that is stationary than something that is moving. For example, you can conceivably assassinate someone from a mile away from shooting them with a bullet that you transport into someone's heart, but this is pretty hard to do.

- Inside a warped space (like a bigger-on-the-inside house) it is possible to create a sort of hammerspace that can be accessed from anywhere. This is immensely hard to do, however, because you are effectively required to make hundreds of invisible access points that can be interacted with only from a certain position.

- Yes, you can send your space colony to the Andromeda Galaxy in an eyeblink. But this is also very, very hard. /You need a knowledge of relative distance/: Sending someone a town that is a mile away from your location requires the same set of runes today as it will ten years from now because that town will always be a mile from your current position. If you want to go to the Moon, though, then the runes you need will change based on where the Moon is relative to your present position.

Does that work? Could someone else not make a rune targeted at the inside of your panic room? If you can throw your voice five miles without needing a receiving rune on the other end, what prevents you from teleporting into a closed space that you don't physically have access to?

Similarly for the inescapable prison, if you have the materials you ought to be able to teleport yourself out. Drawing runes in your own faeces is gross, but it makes it effectively impossible to keep anyone imprisoned anywhere.

*** People have to make runes.

Magic, at least as magicians understand it, is about the human will setting bounds upon and bringing order to the world of chaos that is around us. This is expressed through runes because it is through language that even non-magical humans are able to organize the unorganized world.

But of course that might be a load of malarkey. Some magicians think that runes are the original written language despite that almost certainly not being true. They're also not sure if this or that legend (Odin, for example) has anything to do with their traditions or is just coincidence.

So it is possible that they've hit upon the true metaphysical reasons for magic taking the form of runes that have to be intentionally written down, but it's also possible that they've just come up with a nice Just So story.

An array is a group of runes that have been inscribed in order to work together to achieve a particular effect. Other people have used the term "system" or "schematic" elsewhere.

#+begin_quote
  Runes have different functions depending on their context?
#+end_quote

That will at least be a thing in the more complicated arrangements (especially when you're trying to inscribe a set of runes that are intended to interact with another set of runes).

It may also likely be a thing in general, so that you might place the same rune in two locations but it means something different in each. In the first location it is interacting with the rune that says "do not work perpetually, but wait to activate until X occurs" and may govern what X is, or may in turn say "after X occurs, wait Y time before activating." In the second location it is interacting with the rune that says "Send things in the affected space to Z" and is one of a number of runes that help to govern where, exactly, Z is.

This would make it harder to learn the system, possibly, but it would also reduce the total number of runes that one must know.

******** You seem to be thinking that people will mostly be doing this kind of inscribing on the spot for their magic, but if you can have if X then Y triggers then it basically becomes prepared at will magic.

You want lethal gravity manipulation in a 15ft cone in front of the rune? Hold it out and think "activate". It's programmed with that trigger and does so. You want to warp and shred the space all around you in a 5ft space? Think it, it's done. Teleport? The same. You just have to have the magic prepared ahead of time.

Depending on how intelligent and sophisticated your triggers are (how the hell do runes sense what's going on?), you can be invincible fairly easily by carrying hundreds of pebbles inscribed with tiny runes that all have triggers for every conceivable type of attack (e.g. teleport away bullets, create a plane of exceedingly high gravity, implode someone's fist, teleport YOU away, move you sideways 3ft, etc.).

The system feels rather loose. What defines a large versus a small task? How do you define exactly what is to be done? How do you adjust for the rotation of the earth/planet in teleportation? There are a lot of things undefined here, which is a lot of room for you to use cheesy author fiat. If you want a system that can't be munchkined, it needs to be extremely specific.

That said, you could keep it loose, as long as you don't use it to solve problems. As some intelligent author said, the extent to which you can use magic to solve problems is inversely related to how vague it is. Very vague = solving problems is deus ex machina. Very specific = it's a tool for your characters, just like a sword or bulldozer - the reader knows exactly what it can and can't do.

Mostly I'm still tinkering with and refining the system as I talk with people (you'll notice a fair amount of "I never thought of that!" or "Here's a detail I'm considering after you said that; how do you think that would work?") just responding to comments as I'm multitasking, so I'm not always catching all the implications of an idea when I first propose it.

I think that I could figure out some ways to make triggers not quite so much of a problem, but after thinking about it I'm not so concerned with the concept to do that. Goodbye, triggers, we hardly knew ye.

Someone else said that the system felt a lot like programming, and you're using the runes to describe exactly what you want to happen. A "large task" is literally a large task: it is simpler to affect a square inch of space than it is to affect ten square feet.

I'm actually very cool with it being munckined.

Right now, there is definitely some vagueness, but as I am talking with people I'm getting food for thought and thinking of things that I would have stupidly overlooked. It is good that I did not make it incredibly precise already, because there probably would have been a lot of wasted effort then.

********** One thing I would add to the system is the physics concept [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference][frame of reference]] where all motion is relative. Pick some object to act as a point to measure all motion of other objects by and account for other objects' motion as relating to the 'observing' object. This way the rotation of the planet/sun/moon doesn't matter unless you are working with interplanetary distances. This could be *the* reason why it's so hard to work with increasing distances. You need greater precision to keep track of the motions involved as the runes affect a larger and larger area. Of course this would basically mean that all of the first few miles would be equally easy to calculate concerning the difference in motion between multiple stationary objects.

  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics][physics]], a *frame of reference* (or *reference frame*) consists of an abstract [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system][coordinate system]] and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.

  In n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates, a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes.

  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity][Einsteinian relativity]], reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(special_relativity)][observer]] and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes "*observational frame of reference*" (or "*observational reference frame*"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics)][origin]]. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_time][coordinate time]], which does not correspond across different frames [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_motion][moving relatively]] to each other. The situation thus differs from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_relativity][Galilean relativity]], where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.

The capstone is such not because you make it any differently than if you weren't using it as a capstone, but because the whole system fails to function at all if that rune is missing. So refraining from adding certain runes won't turn those into capstones, but simply cause your rune system to work in a way that you didn't intend.

************ This would mean that you can't make certain systems subsystems of other systems without that subsystem activating. Computers have millions of logic gates and if each logic gate activates before I finished soldering in the other logic gates into the circuit boards, then it would be extremely difficult to create the entire system without electrocuting myself. Even if I could make the same rune integral to both the simple and more complex versions of the system that would only work if every part of the system depended on that rune. With more complex systems, there would be entire subsystems which have nothing to do with each other and therefore one would have to activate before the other. This could be part of the dangers of being a magician, having a series of systems activating to get the final effect you want. Also it would up the difficulty, since minimizing the number of capstones makes the system non-modular which is more confusing to understand.

**** Okay. You're scaling everything inside this space. You can make empty space, but you can't have it automatically filled with anything.

It's cheap here to make tunnels. This means that trade is easier. No more hunting for passes; less blockage due to weather. It's also cheap to make canals -- similar effect. This applies even if you can't make point-to-point portals.

Mining is safer. You can make a tunnel that's internally 1cm long and goes to arbitrary points inside the ground. You can still cause collapses, but that's not likely to hurt the miners much if they're just moving their picks through the tunnel. (What happens to something that impacts the sides of the tunnel? You should probably add a spatial warp so that things effectively warp around or across the tunnel without interfering...but the simple way of doing it might end with a high risk of people getting crushed. Hrm.)

Interurban transportation is trivial, if you have portals, but it won't help your daily commute as much. A rich person's house will have each window looking out on a different scenic area and a door leading to each major city. A sufficiently becapitaled business can have a single depot containing goods, with each retail branch having a portal leading there.

Oh, back on the "material entering the side of a tunnel" thing -- have an externally large, internally short tunnel and shove a giant mass of rock through the side. Now you have giant hunks of rock forcing themselves out each end like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wwwPJJoJPg][the hammer of god]].

It's easy to steal things; warp space to get through walls and just walk in and out. Human guards become more common. Shops with hidden locations and portals to retail storefronts, closing their portals at night, become more common.

Intrepid young lovers don't throw rocks at windows; they project the ground upward to give them a staircase to said window. Similarly, instead of constructing a building, you can project the ground upwards and create a hollow area for each room using runes. Or just create an underground house plus an above-ground portal / tunnel. This will probably create a bias for shapes that are easy to construct with runes -- you might find most houses have spherical rooms, for instance.

Everything is moving. There's the (optional) movement of the planets (or equivalent), but there's also the blood through your veins, the brownian motion of, well, everything... Particularly hot things. And if I make a large effect, stuff moves through it... So can you elaborate on what's known about doing this to moving things?

Sound isn't air, it's compression. You can certainly do that by sending air, but there are other ways... What forms of energy can be sent? Do hot or cold things take different runes? What if I have runes for only a subset of the thing I'm trying to send? Say, water with ice in it, but only runes for water, or ice?

For that matter, can you add or remove energy from things during transport? (I mean, strictly speaking, you're going to be adding potential energy - but what about thermal and/or kinetic?)

What observations are there about the power consumption of runes? Let's say I make something that transports an apple a kilometer directly up. Is conservation of energy conserved, as far as people can tell, or am I "creating" energy? (If you're creating energy... is the world slowly heating up due to waste energy from all this?)

Maybe? To simplify, runes say "Send THING from X to Y." You have to describe what X is, as an area in space, and the same for Y. So that description of space is standing, but it's not generally visible as an Aperture Science-style portal.

#+begin_quote

It's more that if you want to send /only/ that one moving thing, instead of constantly sending through anything that is in Area X, then you'd have to insert a timing mechanism, and the faster the object is, the more precise your timing will have to be.

I should have made that clearer. Sorry.

(Though if I wanted, I suppose that "motion" could just be one of the things that runes have to deal with, and it just so happens that some of the "default" runes that everyone has to include in a transport spell, no matter what, are involved with the small amounts of motion that most people overlook, and then some of the runes that are involved with, say, bodies, account for blood, and so on. That would also be interesting. It would also affect the next answer, since accounting for heat would now be more important. Actually, the more that I think about it, the more I like it, but I won't call it a sure thing just yet.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They don't necessarily require different runes (since you can simply go "SEND: Everything in X"), but you can use different runes to specify, say, "SEND: Only things in X which are between 45 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit."

The runes don't care much for human labels, so rather than saying "ice" you would have to use runes describing "H2O at or below 32 degrees Fahrenheit."

  For that matter, can you add or remove energy from things during transport? (I mean, strictly speaking, you're going to be adding potential energy - but what about thermal and/or kinetic?)

Not through the runes themselves, except through the manipulation of space.

  Is conservation of energy conserved, as far as people can tell, or am I "creating" energy? (If you're creating energy... is the world slowly heating up due to waste energy from all this?)
#+end_quote

You will be creating energy. This would be a problem, except that there are not many magicians. They're very worried about somebody DESTROYING EVERYTHING, and have a sort of Bayesian Conspiracy with respect to the rest of the world. It helps that you need to think in a particular way (essentially get yourself in an altered state of consciousness, but more meditative than drug-induced) so you can't pick up magic just by seeing some runes and copying them, but they are actively concerned with keeping magic secret until they can figure out a better solution.

**** This is fantastically abusable, but it will take me some time to figure out why...

So one of the first tricky bits you're going to run into is the same as in programming - runes sound like they describe things exactly. In software, you then build up layers of abstraction - there's a great Djikstra quote on this: "The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise"

So, can you "build" "new" composite runes from the existing runes? That would make sense - like learning letters and words, you'd learn the core runes as well as known "formula" runes that do specific things, but are really just a collection of the basics that have been worked out.

I also like to put programming like this: You describe an idea well enough that it is now happening. Sounds like Runes do something similar.

One last thing on this note: Are runes turing-complete? That is, can you do computations with them? If you can't, and they're purely descriptive (the "where" part of a "select" query...) what are the specific action runes that are known?

Now, onto some known exploits...

There's a hell of a lot you can do with standing portals. I haven't yet thought up much to do with volumetric portals, but surface portals can get pretty fun.

Side question there: What're topological limits to the portal surface / volumes? Can I make a klein bottle portal surface?

All my currently known double-portal exploits work in the "infinite tube" orientation:

|>>>>|

If placed vertically, a dropped object will fall forever. This is a great fundemental experimenting apparatus, particularly if you add vacuum to remove air resistance and thus maximum velocity. (In the system I first explored portals in, we used this to discover that you could cast gravity shadows, gravity was absorbed like light, and there was a universal maximum velocity beyond which things degenerated into mana blobs. Wacky!)

Vertical double portals is a classic, but here's a weirder use: If you anchor the portals to a pair of rocks, such that the rocks can go in the middle: |*..*| then you can "slide" the volume through space as if it was only the mass of the anchor rocks. Everything else gets scooped up on side and shows up out the other!

You can also start doing some wacky experiments with pushing on yourself through a portal, and see what happens. Is the force transferred to the anchor objects?

However, industrial use of portal magic get mundane and awesome - You basically get to replace your entire infrastructure with portals! Water mains are portals to the reservoir, sewage pipes are portals to the recycling / waste facilities...

Given your setup, you could probably do Niven-style transportation pads - "Take people carrying X token to Y, and Z token to W" - although, what happens in a telefrag situation? (where the transportation effect would cause two objects to try to coexist)

Hmm, hmm - Can I cut things by creating space inside of them? Can I fuse things by removing the space? Can I do a crazy fuzzy teleportation that lets me blend two things together, like that trick for pixel art to "create" more colors?

Come to think of it, living organisms may not do very well with anything but instantaneous transportation (no standing portals). Sending from X to Y at the same time that you are sending from Y to X can turn out very badly, so standing portals are one-way, with no exactly-symmetrical counterpart. But unless you're being /very/ precise about how your standing one-way portal is working then if you put your arm through then sure, blood is traveling down through your arm and being transported, but... there is nothing sending your blood back to the rest of your body on the other side, so you've sort of, just... got a disembodied arm on the other side, with all the problems that implies.

#+begin_quote
  Water mains are portals to the reservoir, sewage pipes are portals to the recycling / waste facilities...
#+end_quote

And in the cosmology of the setting there is an "Outside" of the universe (or rather, a place which is not this universe, and where the laws of physics break down, that the magicians /think/ is Outside the universe but might actually not be), so you don't even have to teleport your pollution to a containment facility. Just dump it in the twisty chaos-hell of Outside, and... hope that there isn't anything over there that might get mad.

The Earth's orbital eccentricity isn't big enough that distance is a problem, and if direction matters, the fact that runes work on a rotating planet means you could just have a device which always points the runes at the sun.

*** 1) Warp space making things bigger to make it trivial to get more precise runes once you let it shrink again

Everything gets messy when expanded space collapses.

2) Warp space so that a single rune occupies multiple positions in a rune setup? Thereby allowing arrays that make other arrays more powerful.

Probably. Definitely not something that you would want to do as a novice though.

3) Shrink rune arrays for easily transportable abilities?

No. The size of the rune appears to be important. Some scaling is possible in relation to certain runes, but they are not infinitely shrinkable.

#+begin_quote

No. You need a human mind to inscribe the runes, and that mind needs to know what it's doing or (in the case of experimentation) what it's trying to do.

** If you can use control runes which sense an environment and make the appropriate changes to the space-bending runes to accommodate those changes, you can do so very, very much.

Portal to the moon? Control runes tracking the moon, or runes on the moon which measure the distance and direction to the corresponding runes on the planet.

Indestructible infinity-tanking armor. Anything which hits the surface of the armor falls into a two-mile-wide hollow sphere where gravity is set to point away from the center. If something wants to hit the wearer, it has to pass through the armor's 'surface' and then manage to fly a mile straight 'up'. At the centerpoint there's a complex knot of space with the only opening being the size of a marble. Anything which flies directly into that marble comes out the other size because the internal space in it represents a straight tunnel with a giant loop coming off it which is where the wearer's physical self is located (and linked to the outside armor via magical sensors and motion translators).

Suitably shaped portal under the feet - you no longer technically have a planet underneath you, so you're not affected by its gravity.

Suitably sized portals in all directions around you - you now have a planet located in whichever direction you like, giving you up to 1G acceleration in a direction of your choice. Free flight and being able to walk up walls!

The same portals surrounding an object of your choice? Be a Jedi and move it around with thoughts or gestures.

Be able to reach into a portal and pull out anything you have stored in a remote warehouse or cave. Super-large bag of holding which is also unstealable.

Link a portal to a remote environment and point it away from you. You can now summon/shoot anything from blizzards to sandstorms to water to lava to clouds.

Put portals at either end of any weapon in your warehouse. Cast back-to-back portals in front of you. You can now reach in, fire the weapon, and the result comes out where your hand/wrist would normally be. Small arms fire, flamethrowers, crew-mounted weapons, a Dobie-O-Matic...

Never have comms cut off again! A portal can go to anything from a radio receiving station to a scribe to someone who is just standing by waiting for you to tell them what you need.

Shopping - never have to cart around shopping bags or push a cart ever again!

Trade - never have to travel with goods!

Choosing where to live - why compromise, when with portals you can put your house in literally any picturesque or low-cost location and have doors leading to all the places you normally visit?

** So you can warp space and teleport things? Is there anything else you can do? Those don't seem related.

Your examples sound like they're locally Euclidean, were everything is normal except the boundaries. This should cause problems on the boundaries. You know how prisms bend light because they change how fast light goes through it? If you just magically increased the volume of space instead of sticking glass there, it would have the same effect. Only now it would operate on everything moving through that space instead of just light.

Are we abandoning special relativity? Or can I teleport to Alpha Centauri, change my reference frame, teleport back, and arrive a year before I left? Also, you'd be able to alter time as well as space, since which you're altering depends on the reference frame. And altering time means creating gravitational effects.

**** It's possible to make it so the only real boundaries that you'd see messed up when you stretch space are inside walls. Although if you build the walls before you stretch space, it will just destroy the walls. And if you don't stick walls there, the border will destroy anything that passes through it. I guess you can just stick walls on both sides of the border. Or you can claim that if the space puts too much stress on an object, it's space that gets bent. You could even make that the way the spell operates. You make a space malleable, and then you make it bigger on the inside just by pushing on the walls. And you move a rigid object through the space to get rid of all the anomalies.

If you allow any noticeable changes in time, the gravitational effects would be enormous, so I'd just say it's too difficult to use it for more than altering gravity.

If you're changing physics anyway, you're allowed to abandon relativity and use Newtonian physics. There's nothing wrong with Newtonian physics. It's not like taking special relativity and breaking the symmetry. It just has a slightly different symmetry.

You can also just make it so spells are limited by their reference frame. You could make a prism spell and move it in such a way to push any stationary object in a certain direction, but you can't have it stay still and push objects around.

What bugs me is the whole locally Euclidean thing. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tX7KQSKMtQ][This is what you get when you break Euclid's fifth postulate.]] You don't get the TARDIS.
