Based on the way you put this forward, I highly recommend you give it a try.

Although the premise 'player transported into another world' does apply, Worth the Candle doesn't really adhere to the format you're probably expecting, although, iirc, it /does/ appear as though it's going to in the beginning. I'll try to elaborate on why.

WtC is driven by characters and deep world building. It's not driven by the glorification of game mechanics or portal fantasy tropes. There's a small tradeoff between story and world building where parts of the world seem disconnected from each other. And they kind of are. But you end up with a lot of well fleshed out places that each have their own themes exploring interesting ideas.

Not only does story frequently play around with and subvert the standard tropes of the format, but the characters are not blind to the implications of the premise. They comment on it, air existential concerns about the implications, make plans and so forth.

The POV character's advantages don't generally grant them unique power nobody else has or can match. It does give them ease of learning which translates into versatility, but they're not a one-person powerhouse.

The main characters have to put thought into how best to leverage these abilities or solve problems and they don't always do so perfectly.

That said, it's perfectly reasonably to still consider WtC part of that overall format or genre and to feel like it's still too close to reading more of the same. The MC /is/ given game mechanic based abilities and /is/ transported from another world and these both /do/ give them some advantages over others in the setting.
