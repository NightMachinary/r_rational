** This is the last time I'll post a weekly update of this story here. From now on, I'll try to space it out a bit more to once every 2 or 3 at least.

I'm starting to feel like this might be out of place anyway - while I'm definitely shooting for what's defined as rationalist fiction here, I think this might be a little too esoteric for people's tastes. The readership here seem to be more oriented around around higher-brow progression stuff than straight mysteries. (That or the story is just a bit weak. It's hard for me to tell, lol.)

Either way, I'd still appreciate any feedback.

*** You should keep at it! Whenever a beginning serial writer needs motivation, I bring up [[https://i.imgur.com/thRv4ks.jpg][this image]] of worm's readership progression. He only got 13 readers in the first month! Imagine if he gave up then.

**** Oh, I'm not planning on giving up! I'm just questioning if this community has much inherent interest in content like this, I suppose.

****** I'm planning to set a firm schedule soon. I was playing it a bit loose for the early updates to try to ease myself into a rhythm for it first, with one roughly every couple of weeks.

Unfortunately, a close relative passed away last week, so I'm pretty thrown off at the moment. Hence the delay. I'm glad you're into the story, though!

** I'll definitely still be following this even if every chapter isn't being posted here. This first arc has done a great job of introducing the setting so far. I think you're striking a good balance between which information about the world to reveal and what to keep hidden. I'm interested in things like what a phylactery is or getting more information on the compromises that go against the spirit of the Oaths, but keeping the information to things relevant to the current case is working well.

I liked the musing on interviews. I hope the attention to the social aspects of getting testimony continues. I tend to get too caught up in clue hunting to notice things like Anna calling for desert early, so it's nice having a viewpoint that catches that sort of thing.

And the bit about preemptive theories... definitely something to watch out for. Sasha's working without the meta-knowledge that she's in a mystery story, but the point still stands even with that. Being warned about trying to make text fit theory is probably a reminder I needed.

  But after the Q and A, she told everyone that she'd decided to *little while off* appearing over the Orator,

  The mind hardens in such a way that it becomes blinded by preconception, and the truth can be placed out of your *(line ends there)*

  “If you *as* me, there isn't.”

*** Thanks for pointing those out! I really need a proper proofreader to help with my typo-blindness. I found tons of issues with this one on passes after I posted.

**** I just binged read the story so far and I really liked it. I'm not any good at solving puzzles, and there are a /lot/ of hints that maybe there isn't a puzzle after all.

I wonder if her father's book ends the way I think it does.
