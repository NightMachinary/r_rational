Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** There is very little remaining land in the world and most societies reside on large ocean fleets. The first ships themselves may have originally been built on land but it has to be possible to expand the fleet without having to be on land. What is the maximum level of technology this fleet can maintain & what would its social structures look like/is this possible?

Some obvious things that come to mind:

- materials would have to consist mostly on things you can find in the shallower parts of the ocean floor & biological material (bones, fish leather,etc). Mining can be a pain depending on technology level

- power is a problem since in order to have electricity you need a conductor (which is hard to find) and have to extremely through with insulation (since there is so much water). Additionally coal/steam powered stuff need fire, which needs a source of fuel (possibly animal fat, but that is incredibly inefficient). Also having a fire on a ship is not generally a good idea if you have no easy way to rebuild.

- storms. They can avoid most of them by sailing in calmer places that are less likely to have storms. I guess they can mitigate storm damage slightly by spreading the ships out so they have earlier warning & aren't as likely to hit each other but I can't think of a good solution to this.

*** If it's post-apocalyptic, it may be easier to recover metals from the ocean floor than it would be to mine anew.

Hopefully you can find a way to grow trees on your ships. Unsure of the chemistry/biology here (acquiring and maintaining nutrient-rich soil sounds hard), but in addition to wood you're going to need pretty reliable and plentiful sealant to be able to manufacture boats. Rubber trees might be able to do this?

An interesting social consequence is that it's a lot easier to sink a ship than it is to destroy a building. So terrorism/military strong-arming from violent factions is probably easier.

*** Could you do anything interesting with plant-based rafts?

I'd try to find some fast-growing woody shrub. Grow a bunch of it, harvest the shrubs, and then lash them together. If you're lucky, you might be able to build a self-sustaining "field" of the stuff that you could use to grow more woody plants.

Repeat, and you might be able to make flexible, self-sustaining "islands".

They'd be at risk during major storms, so you might not be able to use them for permanent habitation. But they'd be a neat way to get extra living space for between storms, or just somewhere to walk around.

/Maximum/ level? Are we allowed to assume that they started with potentially possible technologies that we haven't worked out yet?

Because things get a /lot/ easier for the Ship People if they've mastered matter-to-energy and energy-to-matter conversion, doubly so if energy-to-matter allows you to duplicate objects in the manner of a Star Trek replicator.

--------------

Even without that, though, mining minerals from seawater is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine_mining][quite possible]] - including uranium, so using nuclear energy for power may be plausible. Mind you, it's not at all easy to do. The other option, given the possibility of submarines in the fleet, is of course [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_mining][underwater mining]] for minerals. And a bit of googling suggests that rubber made from kelp is not only plausible but has been done (or at least claimed) before, so the ocean can provide insulators.

For food, the people will have to eat fish and/or other seafood. A world-spanning ocean should be able to provide enough for a decent population; more once people figure out how to cultivate the ocean properly.

Wood would be incredibly rare and valuable. Metal would be kind of expensive but replaceable and maintainable.

*** The bigger your ocean society gets, the less land you'll have available. Every kilogram set afloat in the water will cause the water level to rise as if a liter of water had been added to the ocean. The mass of Manhattan has been estimated at around 100 million metric tons, which, if floated, would displace 100 million cubic meters of water. Of course, that's not much on the scale of Earth's oceans, only about enough to cause three ten-thousandths of a millimeter increase in the average ocean level. However, once we're talking about transforming the oceans into living space for an entire civilization, the issue of sea level rise could quickly become a problem.

You have four possible options. 1) Construct dikes around dry land and shallows, 2) Build upon piles, 3) Disregard land, use floating infrastructure, or 4) Trap a lot of the water above sea-level to lower the sea level.

Dikes are simple enough in concept. You just build them around your remaining land area to ignore a few meters of sea level rise. You can even extend these dikes out into the water and turn seabed into viable land. Obviously, the strength needs to be greater as you deal with greater pressures (deeper water), but at least in shallows you may achieve significant land gains at comparatively low cost. Note: You will need pumps to drain water, and you'll need to plan for water that flows under the dike and gradually rises up into your land from the soil beneath it. Power outages = floods. You will also need to gradually reinforce the dikes and build them up to accommodate gradual sea level rise. Storms should not be a problem if the dike is built properly.

Option 2 is also fairly simple, but would need to be done in shallows to be cost-effective, so this is not an overlapping strategy with option 1. You sink rebar-reinforced concrete piles into the bedrock beneath the seafloor and then build heavy cities and structures upon the piles. You'll only displace the volume of the piles, not the weight of the structures you build upon them, so sea-level rise will be minimized. This is also not a flood risk during a power outage, and storms should not be a problem if the structures are made properly. Nearby [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_farm][wave farms]] could simultaneously generate energy and reduce the force of waves against the structures.

Option 3 is problematic. The more you build, the deeper the water gets, increasing the cost of accessing the seabed for resources. Flooding is a potential problem if your floating structures bump into each other and develop holes. Pumps will be needed to bilge out water on a regular basis, and prolonged loss of power will result in sunken ships. Storms could potentially flip the ships as well.

Option 4 is essentially a form of terraforming. Essentially, it would involve building massive dikes in climate zones where precipitation exceeds evaporation and minimizing evaporation, e.g. with floating reflective ping pong balls. The surrounding ocean would gradually evaporate and get trapped in the dike, causing the sea level to drop. Let's say our goal is average precipitation (about 1 meter per year), and about half of that in evaporation.

On Earth, if we built a circular dike with an area of 90 million square kilometers (25% of the ocean's surface area) and made it 200 meters tall (2/3rds as tall as the tallest dam in the world), it would need to be about 5,360 kilometers in radius, or about 16,800 kilometers long, around twice as long as the Great Wall of China. A huge project, but maybe feasible with international cooperation and many decades of construction. Built in the ocean on Earth right now, it would likely take about 400 years to drop mean sea levels by ~67 meters (~218 ft.). This would increase the land surface area of the Earth by about 21 million square kilometers, a little more than twice the land area of the United States. It would also serve as an immensely powerful hydroelectric dam, likely producing an average of 6.7 terawatts over the course of a year, or about 37% of the world's average power consumption in 2013.

*** The biggest ongoing resource problem you'll face will (ironically) be desalinating water for drinking and agriculture. Provided you can do that at scale you can grow plants hydroponically which solves most of your other critical resources problems up to wooden sailing ships. Though it'll be an engineering challenge to put together a boat on which a tree of desirable size for planks or masts can grow. At the very least your boats will have to be designed to deploy large tarps to collect rain as relying on the surface area of just the deck is unlikely to cut it.

I expect whale oil will make a return as fuel of choice. Presumably with so much more ocean there'll be more whales, and less people so it might even be sustainable.

Unless there's a better source (say shallows full of pre-apoalylse cities) It should in theory be posible to extract iron from blood. It'd be exceedingly inefficient by our standards so steel tools would probably be objects of extreme value but I doubt they'd ever become a lost technology.

Not sure how practical it would be but tall ships with live (possibly fruiting) trees for masts with the roots grown around the keel certainly has a visual style you could build a setting around IMO.

** Alright, so I wouldn't be surprised if this has been brought up here before but what would a rational Hell look like. Assuming it has a population equivalent if not (and most likely) larger to that of The Land of The Living (TLoTL) comprised entirely/mostly of suffering-maximizers, how would this work.

I keep trying to flesh out this idea but get hung up on trying to figure out the behavior of creatures that probably don't have primary or secondary drives remotely similar to humans. For example:

- Do they need sustenance?

- Can they procreate or derive pleasure from sex?

- Are they social animals? Maybe an ability to empathize with their own kind? Would these creatures have any sort of innate sense of fairness like that which has been observed in primates?

- If they're not social animals, would a unified inter-species goal be enough to get them to work together? Or would they just fight each other to improve their personal ability to induce suffering?

- Can they feel die or feel pain at all for that matter?

- Basically, what would the demon version of Maslow's hierarchy look like?

Which brings us to our next point, one interesting part about demons/devils seeking to maximize suffering I've seen discussed before is how they would go about it, but I'm more curious right now with why.

- Is suffering something they feed off of for sustenance?
- Are they rewarded for causing suffering with some sort of pleasure, status, money?
- If they are rewarded with pleasure, is it a relatively fixed amount of pleasure, or does it scale such that more suffering equals more pleasure incentivizing them to play the long game for bigger payouts? If so, how does the brain recognize how much suffering has been caused and allocate pleasure accordingly (such that these creatures wouldn't find a way of tricking themselves)? Like how would their brains know that convincing a person to be a suicide bomber results in a specific amount of suffering based on not only every killed/hurt individual but the amount of suffering that ripples out to society through those individuals' interpersonal connections, contributions to society, etc?
- Do they only seek to maximize the suffering of Homo sapiens, if so, why?

Next problem, civilization. Assuming the denizens of hell manage to form some sort of society what would it look like. So for this section of the thought experiment, I'm going to lay out some potential ideas for resources and rules that might exist in Hell. Let's imagine demons/devils can only influence TLoTL by projecting their minds into it and communicating with humans telepathically and certain areas/rings of Hell are easier to astral project from. Let's also assume that souls exist and if they talk a person out of their soul, that person will become the demon's/devil's personal slave in Hell once they die.

- What sort of monetary system might they have in place? (I was thinking they could manipulate people to set up a disaster and sell their plans to other demons so all they have to do is knock over the dominos, also slave trading.)

- What do they do for entertainment?

- Technology?

- Intellectual pursuits? (trying to figure out interdimensional travel to get to Earth)

Bit of a brain dump here, probably missed a fair number of obvious questions that need answering, but I'm just curious what some of yall might come up with.

*** Imagine infernals as feeling the opposite of empathy. This isn't /quite/ sadism, and would take some emotional mapping to get the full thrust of, but ...

- When they see someone in pain, they feel pleasure
- When they see someone sad, they feel happy
- When they see someone angry, they feel ... er, something. Love?

So basically, seeing a person having good feelings makes them feel bad in various ways, and seeing someone have bad feelings makes them feel good.

A natural consequence of this might be that they feel about The Land of the Living the same way that we might feel about Hell, or slavery, or the worst parts of the third world; it's a huge injustice that all right-thinking people know needs to be rectified, but that's not necessarily going to compel them to actually do anything about it. Demons and devils falling for the same scope sensitivity and time sensitivity as humans is, I think, interesting in its implications.

**** Would this anti-empathy (not sure what to call this) be directed towards all creatures, including other infernals? How would any sort of social hierarchy arise from this? I'm not sure civilization is necessary within a hellscape, but it would certainly lower the overall threat level of infernals if they're incapable of coordinating. This is what I'm stuck on, predicting what might arise from a large population of creatures with alien psychology in comparison to anything on Earth.

Also, what about morality? For simplicity's sake let's say human morality can be summed up by the golden rule. If demons treat others as they would like to be treated does that mean they're all a bunch of masochists (or, more correctly, creatures that enjoy all forms of suffering)? In which case, what is to deter them from dangerous or disadvantageous behavior, if not suffering?

Maybe I shouldn't be coming at the whole social side of this from an anthropological angle, and relating their behavior and communities to social arthropods would be more useful. I'm fairly sure there isn't a whole lot of empathy in that phylum, which might solve the problem of forming social structures when you can't rely on empathy or morality.

I could see infernals struggling, due to the addictive nature of pleasure they feel when causing suffering, with denying themselves immediate rewards to pursue long-term goals. This would explain why a group of beings with centuries/millennia of practice in the art of verbal manipulation hasn't taken over TLoTL.

More and more I'm thinking a God of Hell might be needed to answer some of these questions. Which makes me feel like I'm falling into the God of the gaps fallacy but then again we're talking about a supernatural realm so a God might not be the most irrational conclusion.

***** As a baseline:

- Infernals have internal feelings that are much like humans, and responsive to many of the same things. They have biological needs that need to be filled, but suffer more psychologically than physically for not having them met. Without humans around, most of their sensations are rather muted.
- Toward humans, infernals are anti-empathic. Sensations and emotions are mapped against each other, and subject to many of the same scope and time sensitivities that humans have. This functions as a multiplier on their own internal feelings.
- Toward other infernals, infernals are mostly indifferent. They aren't incapable of rational cooperation, but they don't bond from it, have no friendships with each other, and feel no camaraderie, protectiveness, etc. except so far as it furthers their rational self-interest. It doesn't make an infernal happy to see another infernal happy.

And some other random assumptions:

- There are limits to how much pain and suffering a person can actually take. If you make life too miserable, the hedonic treadmill will take effect, returning them to baseline, or they'll simply adapt to their new, miserable existence.
- Similarly, there are limits to how much pain you can inflict on someone before they stop feeling it, and sensory satiety results in dulled sensations if there's too much repetition. There's also a point at which you can "break" someone, making them no longer very good for an infernal's use.
- Infernals have a good measure of the emotions and sensations that they're inflicting on others. In part, they've developed this because it allows them to get more from feeding off the emotions and sensations of humans, and in part, they were just built that way.
- Suffering can't be faked very effectively.
- It doesn't really matter that much whether humans are mortal or immortal, how quickly they can bounce back from being hurt, etc. It /does/ change assumptions about scarcity, which impacts infernal society, but that's part of demographics that we'll sweep aside for a bit. Eventually you'd need information like how many people die each day, where in the hell they go when they die, how large the population of humans in hell is, and how many infernals there are.
- Humans are weaker than infernals, not necessarily to the point of not being a threat, but to the point where a human uprising is effectively nothing that anyone would think of as possible.

From this, we can probably answer a few early questions:

- "Suffering" comes in a lot of flavors, all of which have some purpose to the infernals. An infernal doesn't make someone eat something disgusting because they're trying to be creative in the suffering that they inflict, they do it because they want to enhance the flavor of their own food. They want humans to be afraid so that they can feel brave. They want humans to feel pain so they can feel pleasure. All the variety of suffering, from the perspective of the infernals, serves some purpose, otherwise they wouldn't be doing any of it.
- Infernals /aren't/ suffering-maximizers. All they really want to maximize is their own pleasure, contentment, etc., all of which comes most efficiently at the expense of some human feeling the opposite. Psychologically, most infernals can't conceptualize and don't care about suffering on the large scale, or in far-away places, or far in the future, in the same way /people/ don't tend to, unless they're the infernal equivalent of effective altruists.
- Infernals care most about the suffering of those humans around them, which they can palpably feel. To this end, most infernals want as many humans immediately available to them as possible, all as ready for fruitful use as possible (i.e. not insensate or insane).
- Self-interest forms the basis for infernal civilization. Infernals might not actually care a priori about other infernals, but they /do/ care about what other infernals might be able to do to or for them. From this, infernals might come together for mutual defense, enslave each other, make trade, make war, etc.
- While the infernals might have an economy based around their needs and satisfying them, that's the agricultural/labor aspect of their economy. The other end of their economy is in the form of humans, which are graded, traded, and managed in order to get the most use out of them, again, out of self-interest rather than any actual maximizing.

Some notes on a possible infernal society:

- The underpinning for infernal society isn't mortality or empathy, it's a combination of raw power and game theory. Infernals pay their taxes because if they don't, someone is going to come along and injure, torture, or kill them (to whatever extent that's possible). Infernals cooperate with each other in the hopes that both will be able to reap the rewards. One infernal pledges service to another so that both might benefit. Trade takes place because both parties benefit from it. Laws are created for the good of those who can enforce them, and followed by those who don't want the hammer of the law to come down on them. Infernals don't internally care about status, they only care about it externally for what it signals about power. They don't care about keeping to a contract except for what will happen to them if they don't.
- For the lower classes, infernal society probably sucks. It might be a surveillance state, since the upper classes and governments (such as they are) can't trust people to act in their interests unless there are mechanisms of control. If the infernal/human ratio is high, then the lesser infernals only get access to burnt out, communal humans, or maybe they have to go to giant coliseums to see humans tortured there. Their food tastes bland without human disgust to go with it, they don't feel much happiness without human misery and depression, and overall, they're kept at just the right level that they won't try to revolt.
- The middle class infernal has a human or two, as well as a place to keep them. When they eat their meals, their human is there, being gorged on rotten fish eyes or bull semen, enough variety that the human can't be inured to it. Torture has to be rationed in order to be effective, but how good infernals are at that varies. A lot of the infernal's wealth goes toward their human, usually in the form of new experiences for them. Humans get swapped too, because any individual human gets old after a while, and if an infernal has particular tastes, it's easier to keep those tastes sated if you can rotate out a human.
- The upper class has lots of humans, all of them (paradoxically) well-cared for. This care is viewed by the infernals as sort of like how a southern belle on a slave plantation might turn a blind eye to the mistreatment of slaves because that's what keeps the finery flowing. When the upper class infernals have need of a human, they're going to get one that's not at all prepared for whatever misery is going to be afflicted. (This care is either done by infernals who are following incentives, or by humans who get mildly preferential treatment.)

******* You need /so much more/ though to actually flesh out a society of infernals though. The notes on a possible infernal society assumes that the ratio of infernals to humans is high enough that humans are scarce, but the actual scarcity of humans isn't established, and needs to be before you can start building up a picture of first what it means to be an infernal in hell, and second, what it means to be human in hell.

There's also nothing noted in terms of what hell is actually /like/ as a region. If infernals need food, then they must have some way of getting it. The lazy worldbuilding method would be to just have it be Earth-like but reskinned, with red leaves on the trees, animals that drip with blood and have muscle but no skin, red skies, yellow clouds, or maybe just some generic horrors, but that /also/ seems a little bit too mundane for me, and not "rational" enough.

(Maybe hell has an ecosystem that's built on human suffering in some way? For example, we might imagine the designer of hell creating plants that feed on human blood, assuming that humans constantly regenerate blood in hell at a slow, steady rate. Those plants then form the bottom of the food chain, which gives neat knock-on effects like infernal farmers spreading a human apart so that they can be used most efficiently to "water" the crops (obviously in the framework we're using, this would be done using only the most used-up humans, those who were taken too far in the direction of insanity).

You could actually build up several different competing ecosystems, each of which produces or feeds on human suffering in a different way, which would in turn provide infernals with building blocks in their economy. Plants that grow from patches of human skin? Plants that feed off the screams of humans? Plants that respond to the psychic sensation of pain? Some of these would have to be constructed in such a way that they don't get short-circuited by technology, unless you /want/ the foundation of infernal meals to be plants that are grown with the assistance of screams played from a loudspeaker on a loop.)

We also haven't defined any of the actual /ideology/ of the infernals, nor the schisms that exist within their society, nor the range of preferences or beliefs that they actually have.

I can see infernals having very human-like sentiments toward the systems that their society has in place, lamenting the fact that so much human suffering is essentially getting left on the table, arguing over coordination problems, etc. Of course, an infernal doesn't want society to be well-organized and efficient for the sake of other infernals, it wants that for its /own/ sake, so maybe that ideological division is really just a class division between "Fuck you, I have mine" and "Fuck you, I want what you have".

Or maybe the ideological division is between the long-term and the short-term, which is probably /also/ a class division. If you're safe and secure, you have more leeway to think toward the far future. If you're just scraping by, filled with uncertainty, then you focus on the short term. Short-term thinkers seem wasteful to long-term thinkers, and long-term thinkers seem wasteful (or too extravagant) to short-term thinkers. You could throw some differences in risk aversion in there too, since that tends to be related.

Or maybe the ideological distinction mostly exists among the upper class with regard to the lower class, and is more a matter of strategic preference or a difference in interpretation of the internal motivations of the lower class. All infernals are imperfectly maximizing for themselves, but it might be possible for one infernal to believe that crushing force is what gives power while another infernal believes that maintaining a baseline of living gives power. I don't really see a reason that axes of human political thought couldn't be adapted, with some alterations. An infernal might legitimately believe that a rising tide lifts all boats, while another might view reality as being closer to zero sum.

But that's before asking even more basic questions like geography. If the dead outnumber the living, and infernals outnumber the dead, then either hell needs to be bigger than the Land of the Living, or it's very crowded. And we haven't touched on infernal lifecycles, whether they /can/ die, whether humans can die a second death, whether infernals have genders, whether there's a classical demon/devil split, etc.

******** Not to mention factions. If Hell is anything like earth, there's a good chance that those that do work together for mutual benefit might eventually form very large groups like villages and nations. At which point the most practical way of gaining more resources (humans to torture and/or land that is easier to manipulate TLoTL from) might be forming large collectives (which best cater to infernal needs) and fighting each other. It seems almost inevitable that intelligent beings with scarce resources would result in tribalism and interspecies warfare.

I wonder if it's possible for some sort of veganism or human rights activists to arise from the infernals. Even if it's not in their nature to care about the rights of humans, if they're intelligent enough they might still come up with some sort of moral system that includes other sapient beings (I suppose this might be even more plausible if you believe objective morality is a thing). Much like veganism or animal rights activists in human society this would probably still make up a small percentage of the overall infernal population.

Even if, unlike humans, there is no alternative source of sustenance for them, there may be more “humane” ways of causing suffering. Like only inflicting impermanent suffering then removing the human's memories of the torture (which could also prevent them from getting used up). Depending on what exactly suffering is (in a materialist sense) and how they are recognizing it as authentically human suffering, there may be ways to pursue artificial substitutes. I imagine this might work similar to the artificial blood from the True Blood series in which it is less satisfactory but more pragmatic. Perhaps these aren't even things that have to exist but simply be something like a technology/magic more progressive infernals are working towards.

It seems like there's a never-ending number of questions that need answering to create a rational interpretation of hell. Like explaining there existence/propagation, is it: a creator spawning them out of nothing, fallen angels, sexual reproduction, parthenogenesis, growing from some other organism, or humans in hell slowly becoming demons over long stretches of time/torture? This only gets uglier if angels and god get involved with the worlbuilding.
