** Aw, way to boop that snoot Athos. Really putting the team on your back haha.

Eugene seems like he genuinely just wants to help Athos, dubious methods aside. It sucks that he's getting such a bad rap on RR for having a bad first impression (and second impression (and possible third impression (ok, so he doesnt seem like the greatest team player, but he's at least doing things that help the team, so i cant bring myself to hate him))).

Wait, im confused, so Athos and Boy Muckface both got healed when spirit was transferred? How does that work? Shouldnt Athos have gotten worse by giving up spirit and Boy have gotten back to around his initial condition after the spirit transfer?

*** Athos didn't actually get healed. He shrank and his body reset itself, meaning that the skin is together again, but he didn't regain any HP or anything else. As to the kid, he got his Spirit back but the only physical effect was that his vitamin deficiency was cured.

*** Eugene seems to both be a self absorbed prick, and repeatedly engaging in standard abusive relationship tactics with a sentient creature too naive to realize. If the literal dog fighting ring doesn't put you in mind of Michael Vick levels of scumbag, I hate to think what the author is going to have to do to get you there.

**** tldr: Eugene seems young, dumb, and looking to get rich quick, and he is absolutely abusing Athos' predisposition to help humans. But I don't think he's doing it out of apathy or malice. I think he might genuinely care about our doggo, but his ability to gauge threats is way off (due to character and possibly culture). I think a big heaping serving of life experience is all that Eugene needs to become a functional part of society.

Definitely a prick, he strikes me as the young, ambitious, jerk adventurer type. I mean, the guy was gonna get eaten by a giant lizard and thought he was fine--he needs a serious calibration to his threat assessment, which I think is where the biggest problem with him lies (again, young and stupid). (Although, I think this might stem from living in a world where killing things literally makes you stronger and richer, so the moral misalignment might be an issue of culture as well as character)

He is totally abusing Athos' morality by guilt tripping him into participating in prize fights, but I think Eugene isn't doing it out of a lack of empathy or a sort of malice. Up until the first arena fight, he saw Athos help kill a big ass fire breathing lizard, and drive off a pack of wolves solo and bounce back from serious injuries time and again. I'm willing to bet he figured the super dog was nigh indestructible, so entering him into a team fight would be little risk to Athos and they'd both make a huge profit from it (threat assessment, young and dumb). The guy does imply afterward that he doesn't want Athos to actually get hurt when he admits that running from the cops when that headhunter comes around was for the best.

With the most recent pit fight shenanigans, let's not forget that Athos basically asked him if he can spot him half a million dollars. Obviously Athos isn't making that kind of money that quickly through safe or legal means. Even after a night of brainstorming, Eugene was the only guy that was able to come up with a plan to solve Athos' problem.

** DKS, thanks for continuing to work on this excellent story. I've attempted to write up a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcWtlDrhEbMtt-tkt5Xkfx5bFByglHaEhDoQ0cPdeoI/edit?usp=sharing][brief rules primer]] for the world, as much as I could deduce from what's been covered so far. If you could comment if I'm on the right track, I'd be very appreciative.

From my review, I found a few things that I'm unable to answer without a little Word of God:

- Do Recovery/Restoration normally help Physique and Spirit return to max if reduced, or is this only a function of Spirit Transference?
- If/when Recovery/Restoration bring Physique/Spirit back to max, at the established rate of 100:1, does it apply to both Physique AND HP, or get consumed first for Physique then remainder to HP?
- Does the stacking 1.5x cost for additional same-day attunements and unlocks count only attunements (as suggested in all the math), or both attunements and unlocks (as suggested by Chapter 3's Skillweb infobox)?
- Does the 6x cost for Uncommon vs. Common, continue up the rarities with each tier costing 6x more?
- Somewhere in the story, Athos got 10 more Essence (113 vs 103) than MrFloatyBox told him about, either from HP or MP. As he's an unreliable narrator, can we assume these might be related to the unexpected Ding he experienced when opening his character sheet?

I am fully aware I'm over analyzing the math behind an excellent narrative, but I think that's very much in the spirit of this subreddit.

Yep. Recovery / Restoration regenerate your HP / MP first and then any leftover points go towards regenerating Physique / Spirit.

Attuning a node always costs the same as it did to unlock it. That's true even if you buy it on a different day. This absolutely does not have anything to do with the fact that it was easier to program my spreadsheet that way.

Yes.

That's probably just bad tracking on my part.

Hey, I'm delighted! Feel free to overanalyze.

Also, wow. Your rules doc is remarkably accurate.
