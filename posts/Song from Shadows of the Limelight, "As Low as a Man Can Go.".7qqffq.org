I've been rereading some stories lately, and upon reaching chapter 5 of [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]] found a link to this:

[[https://soundcloud.com/ben-friesen-3/as-low-as-a-man-can-go]]

It's really good, complete with extra lyrics and crowd reactions! Thought I'd share it for anyone else who missed it too :)


** Fan-works!

** I remember catching this on my recent re read too. I particularly enjoyed the â€˜ad libs' and the flavour they add.
