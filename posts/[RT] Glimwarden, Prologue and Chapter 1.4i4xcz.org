** /Glimwarden/ is about small town politics in a fantasy land where magical lanterns are the only thing stopping an incursion by vile creatures. The glimwardens are powerful magic users who have made a sacred covenant with the city of Light's Hollow and pledged themselves as protectors. The story follows three people -- two boys and a girl -- during the construction of the town's eighth lantern.

I should be posting chapters three times a month from here on out.

****** That's something none of those series even hint at, which is a wasted opportunity to me. It'd be so easy to throw in the implication that the world wasn't always as brutal, that something changed in the past- which makes it a mystery story as well. If you've ever read The Games We Play, that's one of the main draws in my opinion, but even in canon it could fit well- the Grimm themselves don't seem like a natural phenomenon, and what happened to shatter the moon? Given the way the world works on myths, it seems like it's easy to theorize and fill in the gaps for yourself.

Attack On Titan has the same implications to me, it seems hinted that the Titans were created by humans and finding out what happened is more of an incentive than the action, imo.

But Hunters aren't guardians - we don't see them defending borders. We see them /hunting/ - offensively, in small groups of people and far from civilization. Only exception was when Grimm invaded city because of human fault. And Ironwood said that only Atlas has any military besides Hunters...

(I've lately been trying to get better at managing my writing efforts so that I'm producing things at a steady pace, and one of the ways I'm trying to do that is in recognizing where that effort will get the most returns.

** I wonder if the forcefield means people build vertically more. I also wonder what the effect of a highly-concentrated field is - if two fields overlap, is the effective field strength at the point just the higher value, the additive value, or something else? If it's additive, then it might be more efficient to build in rings, so you get a good deal of area too far from any given lantern to be safe consecrated by the influence of overlapping fields. Especially if the lanterns are moveable.

The other thing I'm curious about - do smaller darklings spawn more or less easily than larger ones, or is it the same? If smaller ones spawn more easily, and a trained professional with tools can dispatch them fairly easily, then working on the peripheries of the field is probably pretty safe, so long as there are guards. You wouldn't want to sleep there, maybe, but arable land is arable land. Also, if you have a hill or mountain with inhabitable or arable slopes, putting the lantern inside it might consecrate more surface area than otherwise - just as a lantern tower in a valley would, come to think of it

*** I don't think there's a strong incentive to build upward. Here's my reasoning as to why:

The UN FAO says 0.5 hectares per person. That means that if you want to feed all 11,000 people within Light's Hollow, you need [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=11,000+*+0.5+hectares][55 km^{2}]] of land. Average American household size is 2.5 people, average American [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home][single-family detatched]] lot size varies greatly, but Seattle DCI [[http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/cs/groups/pan/@pan/documents/web_informational/dpds021570.pdf][has a great PDF]] that shows /their/ range, from 5,000 square feet to 9,600 square feet. If we're being pessimistic, that means [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(11,000+%2F+2.5)+*+9,600+square+feet][roughly 4km^{2}]] to house everyone. R/C/I ratios vary a lot, but let's say 2:1:1, which means a total of 8km^{2} in order for everyone to have space to live.

In other words, with a lot of unfavorable assumptions, we've got a 7:1 agriculture to living ratio.

If you perfectly selected a 63km^{2} plot of land, you might be able to get better than 87% arability, especially if you could convert non-arable land to arable land through chemistry or landscaping. But eventually you're going to reach a point where you run out of farmlands to feed the people, and I think in most cases you're going to hit that point far before space is so precious that you're pressured to build vertically. This does mean that proportionately more buildings would probably be on cliffs, hillsides, etc.

***** I looked around for the paper, but all I know (from other sources) is that it was published in 1993, which is a problem since the FAO puts out about two hundred papers a year and I don't know the title (and their website only has the papers from 2007 forward as searchable).

However, [[http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/newsroom/docs/en-solaw-facts_1.pdf][this factsheet from the FAO]] [PDF] shows the following:

- Average number of hectares of cultivated area needed to feed one person in 1961: 0.45 ha

- Average number of hectares of cultivated area needed to feed one person in 2006: 0.22 ha

I'm taking a little bit of liberty in just thinking of those as "before the Green Revolution" and "after the Green Revolution".

Also, I'm pretty sure that +these numbers+ the first number takes into account food security and reasonable diversity, since you can get a lot lower if you go monoculture and assume an optimized farmer who never makes mistakes.

***** Building downward works as well. The sphere of influence for the lanterns is large enough that you would run into some massive engineering problems before you reached a place where the lanterns' shine doesn't reach. But the economics for building down are roughly the same as for building up; even in the real world, whether it's better to build on a second floor or build in a basement is largely a matter of geography. People have basements, sure, but probably not second basement levels, especially if they're close to the water table.

The less land you use for housing (and other things) the more available for farming, but eventually you run out of arable land and using less space for housing doesn't actually get you much more farming. Even that's assuming that you're running up against your space limits /really/ hard, which probably doesn't happen if it's possible to expand your area with another lantern.

** Question regarding the prologue:

#+begin_quote
  Eventually a second lantern was constructed, doubling the available area and making the town more secure.

If a Lantern's sphere of influence grows over time then how come the second Lantern immediately doubled the available area? Or is the growing hava thing only something that was true for the first Lantern? In which case it is still interesting that a new Lantern apparently is immediately of the same size, indicating that the original was somehow diminutive at first?

*** Lanterns have a permanent ball of hava sitting in the center of them that grows or shrinks in size as darkling hearts (which are really just balls of hava themselves) are added to it and shrinks in accordance to the burn rate and evaporation effect.

The process for building a second lantern usually involves something that looks a lot like mitosis; grow the ball of hava in the center of the first lantern, then when it's grown large enough, quickly split it in half and carry it over to where the second lantern has already been built and slot it into place. This obviously takes some engineering efforts in order to make sure that service isn't interrupted for long enough that the darklings attack.

In this case the original /was/ diminutive in size, since it was a travelling lantern only engineered to allow for a caravan to travel west relatively unmolested by the darklings. The first thing that the glimwardens and engineers did when they founded their town was to begin increasing the size of their lantern, which made it more efficient, which gave the glimwardens some breathing room because they didn't have to collect quite so many hearts to feed into it.

(There are other rules and engineering concerns involved, but some of that is to be revealed later and some of it is just worldbuilding wankery.)

***** As Sander says in the first chapter, gliminance follows the inverse-cube law. Since surface area increases by the square and power needed increases by the cube, that means their relationship is given as power^{2/3} = area.

Or to put it another way:

| Power | Area | Radius |
|-------+------+--------|
| 100   | 21.5 | 2.6    |
| 200   | 34.2 | 3.2    |

... or for that same 200 you could instead have /two/ circles that give you 42.5 area. Except they're not actually circles, that's just useful for doing math. Instead, they're fields. So if your safe field strength cut-off is /x/, then making a second lantern of equal strength to the first doesn't just double your available area, because there are going to be places where both lanterns would individually be below /x/ but sum to above it.

I haven't actually done the math to see what the result is, but I think doubling is close enough, especially since every writerly bone in my body resists putting something like this in the prologue.

(There are other reasons not to build lanterns /smaller/ in order to get more coverage, namely the evaporative effect which dominates cost-benefit analysis at the low end.)

Hopefully I haven't screwed up the math anywhere here, if any of this makes it into the text itself I'll have to take some time to triple-check my numbers and actually do some field strength calculations.

I notice that the set up is similar to what I proposed, but with the seventh lantern in the middle which sounds like a waste of lanterns for more farmable land, unless they are very cautious of darklings breaking through any one lantern and devastating twice the area.

** Great story so far! If you're taking typo's, I found:

#+begin_quote
  but he'd taken to thinking of Merry a his honorary replacement mother.
#+end_quote

*** Fixed, thanks! I've been thinking about how to set up some kind of system for typos that works a little better than using comment threads. I don't (necessarily) want an e-mail alias like [[mailto:typos@alexanderwales.com][typos@alexanderwales.com]], since maybe that's an extra cost, but perhaps something like that.

Also, I was thinking of having some kind of bounty for typos, but don't really know what that would entail.

(That e-mail does work though, if anyone would like to use it.)

Edit: I'm now using Mistape, which is a Wordpress plugin. Highlight the offending text, hit Ctrl+Enter, and you can send an e-mail to the above address for processing. If you have ever placed a comment on my site, it will include your identity and I will give you credit on a future "People who helped me" page. I'm not a hundred percent on this solution, because there's no way for the user to include explanatory text, but I think it probably will help A) reduce the effort needed for people to report typos and B) help me with typo correction workflow.

**** Just something like adding a comment to the next chapter thanking everyone who caught a typo would be enough for most, I imagine. You could also list the number of typos each person caught. People like it when their imaginary internet numbers that everyone can see go up; I know I do.

**** If email is too cumbersome, PMs could also work if that makes sense from your end. Edit: just saw the other suggestion, that looks good too!

Whatever you do with bounties, I'm just happy to help out : )

*** All that will come later on. I mean, don't hold your breath, because it's not going to become relevant for quite some time, but you might be able to draw your own conclusions before any of it becomes explicit. (I have a buffer of four chapters right now, and I think you could make a good stab at both of them by the end of chapter 5.)

I don't mind the questions at all, but will probably hold off on explaining anything that's going to have in-text exposition at some point, because I think that's the better way to learn it.

**** I strongly approve of that last part. I'm annoyed when authors answer many questions about their ongoing stories in forums or comments because it often means they're not going to address the underlying ambiguities. Drowtales comes to mind.

** Quick note on the "handsome soul" part, I think I've better identified what I liked about it: it allows the imagination to fill in how his personality can make his features more compelling. Now that I've noted that though, the phrse itself "handsome soul" rubs me the wrong way. Maybe better worded as "lively soul?" "Kind soul?" "Bright soul?" Handsome just isn't a word that usually rolls well into a remark about someone's soul, but maybe that's just personal preference.
