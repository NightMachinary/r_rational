** Do people still appreciate that I'm posting this here? If not, I'd be glad to stop.

There's a subreddit for this at [[/r/YakusokuNoNeverland]].

*** I appreciate it. Started reading this thanks to you. I don't know much about mangastream, but do they routinely delete the first chapters of manga? I kinda remember going there and being able to see only the most recent stuff...

**** Yeah, it's a concession to prevent them from being taken down.

If you go to a manga aggregate site (like Kissmanga), it should have all chapters.

Of course, you could just get it legally off of Viz.

*** I appreciate it. Started reading when you posted chapter 5. I like the story, for now none of the characters are stupid and it's a cool prisonbreak kind of story.

*** I'm grateful that you started posting this (and were consistent about it, too, because I only started looking at it starting from the second update). I wouldn't mind weekly notices, but I can understand why some people might want fewer updates.

** The thing about the eldest girls being the only ones allowed to bathe the toddlers seems like a definite tip off. Though for what I think it's too early to say.

It does give me the impression that there will not be any "papas," and moreover the girls have purposes other than being eaten. Sort of like how male bulls are for the slaughter, and female cows for the milk.

** Just started this from the beginning

So, Mama is definitely secretly on the kid's side for dropping them all these hints, right?

*** It's possible, but seems highly unlikely that she would be able to survive losing an entire batch of children. Even just losing the three protagonists would probably be enough to secure her execution based on their apparent importance for the ceremony.

The story suggests that she has been diligently sending children off to be killed and eaten for many years, which doesn't sit well with the idea that she's a secret ally.

My hypothesis is that she's baiting them with specific information to (a) impress upon them her reach and knowledge, (b) encourage them to investigate solutions of her choice (knowing they lead to dead ends or pitfalls), and (c) keep them constantly reacting to her moves and not proactively planning.

**** Sacrificing yourself for children you raise is totally something humans instinctively do. (to the point where for this farm to work the "mothers" would likely be nonhuman or specially chosen for sociopathy)

Sacrificing children for years could be for the greater good or due to a change of heart / infusion of bravery later in life

Playing social cat and mouse if your life is at steak, less common.

The thing which gets me is that she always tells her superiors that there is nothing unusual or suspicious to report even though their clearly is.

****** If Krone is brewing up her own take on how tackle Isabella, I can almost guarantee Isabella is doing the same: the level of deviousness she's shown so far makes it a pretty safe assumption.
