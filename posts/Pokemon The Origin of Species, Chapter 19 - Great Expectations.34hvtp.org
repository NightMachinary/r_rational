** Hey all! Super rough draft out for super late chapter! Life's been crazy lately. Good, but crazy. I'll do a major edit wave tomorrow. Enjoy, and all feedback welcome, as usual!

Also, apparently FF doesn't allow less than or greater than symbols in text, so just pretend there's a less than symbol in front of the "333" when you see them. You'll get it.

** Sweet chapter. Showed the aftermath of the fire, how everyone was coping and a bit of worldbuilding about how pokemon are healed. I particularly liked the suspicious nurse asking after the limb-less Shiftry, as that /would/ be a very suspicious event. And still kinda is, even with the explanation from Blue.

** This is still being updated? Woo! I found this story a while ago and could not stop thinking of it since, I'm so glad it's still being actively written and wasn't abandoned. Keep up the great work, can't wait to see where the story'll go next. :)

**** Great! When you write, do you generally have an overarching plan of what's going to happen or just throw your characters into situations and figure out their reactions to it?

***** A mix of both: I generally know the major plot points of what I want to have happen, but inevitably there are situations or new ideas that pop up while writing, where there's no time to plan and the characters are essentially "writing" themselves :)

** How are you planning on dealing with weather moves?

Rain Dance as cloud-seeding? Hail and Sandstorm as chucking a load ice or sand into the air? Sunny Day as I-have-no-idea?

*** I'm changing a number of moves to create a sliding scale of power that's more realistic.

So if say a dewgong uses "blizzard," its range and affect is very localized: some cold wind and shards of ice flung around in a limited area. Compared to, say, Articuno's blizzard, which can affect a whole city.

Same goes for the more traditional "weather abilities" like Sunny Day. Those used by "regular" pokemon are pale imitations of the originals, which are pretty much restricted to the few extremely rare pokemon that have weather effects tied to their abilities: Kyogre and Groudon and Rayquaza being the main three, and then say one in a million Ninetails or Politoad or Tyranitar or Abomisnow (even though those latter two have it as regular abilities rather than "hidden" ones).

Does that makes sense?

**** Sure.

Another thought: how are you dealing with the "-sport" moves?

Because it occurs to me that Zapdos would be rendered powerless if you had a few hundred geodudes using mudsport at it.

***** The effectiveness of covering oneself in mud to resist electric shock is actually highly dubious, as soil is quite capable of carrying electric current, and wet soil even more so. As for the reverse, Zapdos rarely deigns to fly low enough for people to hit it with thrown rocks, let alone mud :)

****** And now the million dollar question: Why don't they just shoot it?

Why don't they just get a bunch of snipers and pump zapdos full of lead?

Or if guns don't exist in pokemon, why don't they coordinate their attacks, to have a bunch of psychic, dark and ghost pokemon throwing an imperial fuckton of mental attacks at it all at once, while rhyperiors use their rock blast thing to shoot it out of the sky? Why don't they have a bunch of koffing float up to it and- actually I'm gonna stop right there, that would wipe out whatever city it was attacking, but you get the point.

The legendary birds aren't exactly endbringers. They're /birds/. They don't have physically impossible durability or bullshit immunity to 99% of powers. The only problem with beating them seems to be the logistics of raising and training an army capable of overwhelming them.

This is actually exactly what they try to do. As for why it doesn't always work, well... you'll see ;)

This is kind of like saying blastoise is a turtle :P Remember, birds in the pokemon world can carry people on their backs and summon hurricane-force winds. If you go up against Zapdos expecting it to have fragile bones and ligament-thin muscles, you're in for a bad time.

And then get that army up in the air, of course. Also keep in mind that these birds summon and maintain natural disasters around them, so have fun flying through a thunderstorm or blizzard or around [[http://www.glennbeck.com/publish/uploads/2012/11/firenado.jpeg][firenadoes]] :)

But I would still expect it to be made of flesh rather than endbringer-core.

I would still expect physics to actually /work/ on it.

If I took a chainsaw to it, I would expect the feathers to break before the chainsaw did.

It's that sort of thing, you know?

In pokemon, I expect even the legendaries to be made of cells, not space-whale shards.

And cells are pretty easy to break, in comparison.

A good solid hit with a ranged attack should at least cause some minor injury rather than "lolnope Zapdos is Behemoth, only +Scion+ Arceus can touch him".
