*Synopsis*

What if you really were transported to a fantasy world and expected to kill monsters to survive? No special abilities, no OP weapons, no status screen to boost your stats and no cheat mode. Never mind finding the dragon's treasure or defeating the Demon Lord, you only need to worry about one thing---how to stay alive.

** This looks really interesting!

I'm kinda surprised they still have all the chapters online with the ebooks also being sold.
