** I wish I was as good a writer as you were, so that I could find the right words to compliment this chapter. I'll just list the things I liked the most:

Goku being on the receiving end of Tao Pai Pai's killing intent.

Differing effectiveness of HEP II chips.

Yamcha's problem solving.

I also see you recommended another fanfiction in the review notes, and I'll definitely be reading that.

Thanks for the update!

*** Thanks a lot! I really care a lot about the Goku vs. Tao fight, so I hope to do it justice and will only be happy if people enjoy it (well, happi-er than the average).

About the other fanfic, a word of warning - it's not precisely "rational", or rather, it makes things a lot easier for the protagonists and it seems just focussed on making them OP. It's definitely a good read though if "Bulma being a badass" is your jam (as you might deduce from my story, it's definitely mine).

** Is it just me, or Rational!Goku behaves a lot like a young Canon!Gohan ? If so, more please :)

*** I never thought about it that way but it makes sense, since canon Gohan is quiet, introverted, smart, and fundamentally pacifistic - though he does learn in time that he can't always avoid fighting. Recently I've watched ATLA for the first time and I think Aang has also affected me a bit (though he's more extroverted and upbeat than OWP!Goku).

** Now that we know that only Commander Black and Bulma knew the location of all seven balls, I wonder how the insurgents managed to find their locations so quickly. Perhaps they had already known from the start as well?

*** Wait, is this a comment for this chapter? It sounds like you're a couple chapters behind. The answer was revealed at the end of chapter 31, it was by using Baba the witch, who helped the Instruments.

**** ...I don't know how I missed that. That's honestly rather embarrassing.

***** Don't worry XD. Also, I've been so slow at posting recently that it probably gets pretty confusing to read.
