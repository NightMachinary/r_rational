*tl;dr: this is the companion thread to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8ndzk3/biweekly_challenge_shipping/][the weekly challenge]], post ideas, recommendations, idle thoughts, etc. here.*

TVTropes [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping][defines shipping as]] rooting for fictional romance to happen. My guess is that the /main/ reason shipping happens is because:

1. romance is usually a sub-plot
2. that sub-plot is a source of tension
3. unlike the main plot, there's honest question of how or whether that tension will be resolved
4. unlike the main plot, parts of the audience with different preferences get driven into conflict with each other, which allows for entrenched positions, vociferous argument, etc.

(Naturally this can also happen when the romance is the central plot, but it's somewhat less common for romances to have multiple potential ships, at least of the main characters.)

I personally enjoy the character-study aspect of shipping, though I've read very few pieces of fanfiction that are shipfics. To me, there's something quite interesting about taking two people and doing a sort of counter-factual "okay, /if/ these two people got together, how would it happen and what would they see in each other?", an impulse that's at the same core of what I like about fanfiction in general.

Question of the day: *Who do you ship?*

(Alternately, I'm also enamored with the worldbuilding aspects of transporting goods across large distances, but find that it's somewhat less fun to talk about.)


** I'll continue to carry water for a royal wedding between the First Prince and Cat in Practical Guide to Evil, but it seems a bit unlikely.

What I don't feel like we see enough of are positive, long term relationships in rational fiction. I don't think I've read a rational-adjacent fiction in which the main character is already married or in a long term relationship.

In real life, many people draw comfort, support, advice, and assistance from their significant other. Even for young people, a steady (noun)-friend can be a huge asset.

I think this is in part due to difficulty in portraying such a relationship, and in part due to the literary usefulness of crushing, propositioning, and dating.

*** Have you read the [[http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html][Dark Wizard of Donkerk]], by Alaxander Wales (OP)? The relationship between the MCs parents is wonderful (although I'm not 100% sure if it's romantic or not). I don't want to spoil too much, but the romantic subplot with the MC is important and rational enough.

*** It's not just rational-adjacent fiction. If protagonists are married, they're probably unhappily married. If they're in a long-term relationship (romantic or platonic), it's probably on the rocks. If a character has a relationship with their family, it's usually tense or distant... or, far too often, not a part of the story at all: orphans /de facto/, whether or not any lives have been lost.

Narrative runs on conflict, the more the better. Not that happy relationships are impossible. When it works, the positive long-term couple (or family) are written as joint protagonists, together against the world. Even then, though, it's more fun (and familiar) when they fight a little and make up than when they're 100% compatible and supportive.

Shipping, though? That's about UNRESOLVED TENSION, and resolving it isn't nearly as productive as keeping it suspended.

*** The self-promotion is probably bad form, but I'd like to mention my own story Delphic as another example here.

The main character's closest friend is his older sister, and the two of them are supported by their parents, who are themselves retirees in a loving long-term relationship. The Donnells are a pretty straightforward nuclear family (although biracial and with one kid adopted) and I have no plans to disrupt that in the near future.

****** It seems to me that you work hard to make sure that the story is about real people, not just characters floating in the void until they need to fight or fuck.

You include details down to but not including bathroom breaks, which is the perfect place to stop.

I did feel a little bit spun around with the last chapter. Seemed like it was missing some connective tissue between it and the previous one.

Thank you so much for providing a high quality rational cape-fic that can be positive and affirming as well as dangerous and dark.

** One thing that irks me in many stories is that first other sex character the MC meets usually ends up as the love interest/long term SO/soulmate of the character. Either that or the first few characters they meet end up being MCs best friends/allies new family. I get why it's done for narrative purposes, you introduce the main characters early and get as much character development, screen time, and maybe world building with them as possible, but it seems so silly that in the big wide world the very first people you meet end up staying forever.

*** I imagine irrelevant meetings occurring outside the narrative: before the story starts, or concurrently with the story but just not shown.

It would be nice if more stories introduced multiple potential love interests, then had the MC actually have to make decisions about it. If fiction is simulated experience, we have way too much experience of things just working out on the first try, or things never being resolved.

*** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/advice-and-trust-nge.8768/reader][/Advice and Trust/]] is a heart-warming romance, about a few healthy relationships embedded in the grim setting of /Neon Genesis Evangelion/.

Highly recommend if you're after a long and fairly rational romance.

*** No.

The point of the challenge is to give people come incentive to write and to share that writing, to provide constraints that might help with creativity, and to get some community feedback for short stories or experimental fiction that might not otherwise get traction.

The problem with long-running, in-progress works is that most of that doesn't apply. Not only that, a long-runner isn't really playing on a level field when put up against short (or short-ish) fiction, which I'd anticipate would have a chilling effect on people writing for the competition.

If you want to share a story you've been working on that fits well within the theme or prompt of the challenge, one of these companion threads would be a good place to do it.
