Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** [[http://noisyowl.com/spacetrains/spacetrains.html][Space Trains]] is coming along. Thanks again to everyone here who's provided feedback! The game has two core mechanics that have been confusing in the past, and I think this version fixes confusion about what hops are in a stylish way. I think I can fix the last confusing element, how resource requirements work, with [[https://imgur.com/a/7PpFhlf][alternate ways to display project boxes]]. I think the last treatment in the album is probably the winner, but I'll have to sacrifice some goats to make a real version of it, so I first want to check, do people feel like this makes more sense? (Especially if you haven't seen the game before, especially especially if you have but didn't understand how it worked.)

I've also done some background work that'll let me add new kinds of mysterious planets, so a bunch of those should crop up over the next week.

Also: new train graphics.

**** When you click on a planet, it puts out resources. In order to put out more resources, it needs to take in some resources. Eventually you can get tech upgrades that give you more options on upgrading planets, even one terraformer, another grey goo that lets you reset planets. You can build spaceships and wormholes and things of that nature. There are a couple of different win conditions, but the game doesn't appear to track them and tell you "You won!" yet.

There are other recent events that mirror, say, the Hanson-Yudkowsky AI-Foom debate (AGI vs ems).

** I've been reading about the topic of "learning to read" for about a year now. Apparently, "common knowledge" /and/ expert consensus both say that kids should begin to be taught how to read at around six or seven years old. That sort of makes me feel sick in the pit of my soul. Like, any faith I may have had in the ability of cultural transmission to properly propagate the stuff that actually matters? Gone. Something major has to be going wrong somewhere for the world to look the way it looks.

So I have a few questions:

- How old were you when you learned how to read?

- How did you acquire the ability to read?

Secondarily (this is not my main concern but it's somewhat related and I'm curious):

- How much of your early childhood can you legitimately remember?

I've got more that I've typed out over the last two weeks (and I guess there's a doc from like 6 months ago from the last time I intended to make a post about this topic but didn't follow through), and last night I turned on the light a few times to jot down some thoughts in the notebook I keep on my bed, but I'm thinking I should just leave it at this for now and see if anybody even bothers responding.

*** Two points of personal experience:

- I was a late reader. My parents read to me every day, more than one book. When we went to toy stores I could get one toy or two books. But I wouldn't read on my own.Nothing seemed to take, and I was behind in Kindergarten. My parents were distraught. They tried experts, they did hooked on phonics, and tutoring. In first grade, around 6.5 years old, I started to read. I never knew this until he was dead, but my uber-masculine father broke down crying in the parent teacher conference. Three months later I was reading on a third grade level. Two years later I read more books than anyone in the small school, except my sister. When we had reading competitions, I started to throw them because I didn't think reading should be a competition and other people seemed to care about winning. I'm still an avid reader today, even if /Worm/ has eaten up my reading time like nothing before.
- I'm a teacher. I see kids forced into stuff their brains literally aren't ready for all the damn time. It's incredibly harmful, especially to those without a strong support system. Many buckle under the pressure and give up. A few become obnoxious in their ignorance; in High School that metastasizes into prideful ignorance. At the same time, I see some kids that are ready for more advanced materials held back because of lack of institutional resources. Out of 75 or so students, 5 should be finished with High School level material in Freshman year. 20 should spend an extra year or two going over different 5th grade material until they hit puberty and their brains can handle the extra abstraction. 10 should basically do 3rd grade level material until they can master it at around 14, and then go on to career track.

Education is incredibly individual. Stages of brain development are very, very, very real. And the educational trauma that comes from heavily pushing kids too early is just as real as the educational trauma from kids getting bored. Some people can and should be reading by the time they're one, others seven. This is a problem that teacher AIs will ameliorate, but not solve.

​

As for your loss of faith: did you assume your perceptions were wrong or experts were wrong? In education "experts" are frequently non-scientific, but in this case, it's probably your perceptions that were wrong. That should lead to curiousity, not a lack of faith.

Actually, this comment became too long, so it's now going to just be me giving my own answer to the "early childhood" question. I guess I'll cc you lot again once I've made a comment that actually has a point.

*THIS COMMENT IS SKIPPABLE, IT HAS NO REAL POINT*

I guess I'll start by recounting my own memories. People might think I'm delusional, but whatevs. Around 8ish years ago I had a series of conversations with my mother about all this stuff and she corroborated everything, whatever that's worth.

I can remember the first time I walked, a few weeks after my first birthday.

I was on my grandmother's lap in the play place of a McDonald's. The toy that came with the Happy Meal was an inflatable rubber ball, like a mini beach ball. I can /feel/ the spatial orientation of where we were sitting in relation to the play place and the door and the big glass wall. She dropped the ball and it rolled away from us towards the big glass wall, and I climbed down off her lap and ran after the ball and picked it up and turned around and brought it back.

I recounted this memory to my mother, and she confirmed its accuracy. She said that, because I was the first grandchild born on her side of the family, she and my relatives held me all the time and carried me everywhere and didn't give me much of an opportunity to crawl around on my own. She also said that I pitched a fit and /told/ my grandmother (because I never really "babbled," at 8 months I started saying words with the intention of communicating and by 10 months I was speaking in coherent/articulate grammatically correct complex/compound sentences) to let me get down off her lap so I could get the ball.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation]]

I've thought about the concept of "remembering remembering" for years now. [[/u/jtolmar]], it blew my mind that you mentioned that using the same type of wording. It's like, if you remember something from infancy when you're a toddler, it strengthens that memory so those connections aren't [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_pruning][pruned]] or something, and then if a few years later you remember having remembered you can remember directly again because rehearsing the memory strengthens the connections that were spared from pruning.

I think we were in that McD's again when I was two or three (most Fridays from like 6 months old to like 4 years old were "outing with grandma" days and by age four the outing meal had shifted from McD's to Pizza Hut so the latest this could've happened was age three). We normally went to one closer to home, but I guess we went to that other farther-away McD's again because it was near a particular shopping center, and we sat at the same table and I think I mentioned the fact that I remembered that this was /the/ table. Whatever adult(s) I was with might have reacted with surprise, presumably my mother was present.

I'm almost /certain/ that I can remember "practicing walking" by holding the bars of my crib and walking in place at night in my crib, with the intention of surprising the adults by going directly from "not walking at all" to "walking perfectly." I'm not going to elaborate about this here or argue about it later, don't @ me about this.

Moving on.

I remember my third birthday. The memory begins while I was asleep, dreaming. A waterfall, with a thin wooden bridge parallel to it. The viewpoint is pointed about 70 degrees to the right, and pointed down at the bridge. The bridge and the edge of the waterfall both extend infinitely into the distance, no end is visible. The waterfall goes down forever, there is no bottom visible. There is no one on the bridge. Then the viewpoint shifts to a first person perspective. I am looking directly at the face of Geppetto from Disney's Pinocchio. He is holding me by the arm, and I am looking up at his face and my arm and his arm /and the bridge/, because he is on the bridge and I am not, I am suspended over nothing. He displays no emotion. I feel no emotion. He lets go of my arm, and I wake up. I am in my parents' room alone on their bed, and it is day, and I can hear my mother and grandmother talking [I'm assuming I took a nap and had the dream during the day]. I walk out and see them in the kitchen. My grandmother has somehow put together a cake shaped like a train (3D like a toy train but bigger and made of cake instead of plastic, not a 2D cutout of a train), and it has white frosting and she's decorating it with those trashy orange candy peanut things. My grandmother picks me up and places me on the edge of the counter. My mother is making a salad, and I take notice of the salad preparation. I ask something about it, and someone hands me a piece of lettuce to try. I desperately hate it with a fiery burning passion and I probably cry. That is the end of the memory.

I took violin lessons from the ages of late three to early four. This next memory happened near the end of that period.

I had a poster on one of my walls, a photographic image of Disney World with a bunch of characters in costumes in the foreground. My bed was situated... you don't need spatial information. I could see the poster in bed at night.

I was not born with a "lazy eye." I might bring that up again later. Basically, there was about a week-long period where I would look at the poster while I was lying in bed and notice that there were two slightly separated pictures, and I discovered that I could cross my eyes /even more/ to get the images further apart from each other. To entertain myself, several nights in a row I kept on seeing how far apart I could get the images and getting them further and further apart each night.

The last night I did that, I felt something weird, like a snap or a pull, and then my left eye was stuck and the images didn't go back to being closer together anymore. I think I thought something similar to the feeling of "oh shit" and decided to just go to sleep and see if it went back to normal in the morning. I woke up and looked at the poster and the two images were split by a large and noticeable amount and they weren't resolving back into a single image. I walked out of my room, down the hallway into the living room. The living and dining rooms were separated by a couch, and my mom was walking around in the dining room near the kitchen counter. I can almost see it, looking up at her with the couch between us. I said "mommy, I see two of you." And she said something like "Michael, don't say things like that, you're scaring mommy."

That's the discrete memory, walking out and looking over the couch at my mother.

Obviously the problem didn't go away on its own and obviously I had a frame of reference for the "before and after" and was unwilling to accept this as the new status quo. So fast forward a week or two to the next violin lesson, and the teacher was always a bitch so of course she said the reason I fell over backwards during the lesson (I'm pretty sure I did that on purpose to make a point to my mother along the lines of "/holy shit my eyes are all ducked up, acknowledge the reality of the situation/") was because I was a naughty and lazy little boy who didn't want to do his violin lesson. I can remember the layout of the room and where I was standing in relation to the door and my mother and the teacher and all that. Anyways, mom took me out of there after the teacher was a bitch, and I said something in the car about falling down because of my eyes to manipulate her into /doing something/ and she made a doctor's appointment and they were like "yep, he's cross-eyed" and then I had a surgery to straighten my eyes back out which probably cost my parents several thousand dollars.

My grandmother on my father's side died of early onset Alzheimer's shortly after my second birthday. I have vague memories of running around the peanut-shaped pool in the backyard of the house she and my grandfather lived in. That would've had to have been June or July or August, so this memory's from age 13/14/15 months. There was some sort of pool toy (I wanna say it was a short 6-inch-long colored plastic stick?) and one of my older cousins threw it into the pool and I can remember looking down at it, gone forever sitting at the bottom of the pool, and I believe I made a fuss and an adult retrieved it with a long net.

I also remember having a Chapstick and walking up to the grandmother with Alzheimer's while she was sitting in a rocking chair at the house of the other grandmother. I showed her the Chapstick, she thought it was funny and may have said something about candy, and I may have giggled because I was aware by then that adults often talked to children by saying silly things that weren't true. She took the lid off and looked at it, twisted the bottom to push the Chapstick up, /kept twisting and twisting until there was a solid two inches of Chapstick/ and I was mildly concerned because /that was/ *my* /Chapstick/ and then /she bit off the Chapstick and straight up ate it and I was straight up shocked./ My mother is flabbergasted that I can remember that. Apparently, according to my her, that would've had to have been the last Christmas for the Alzheimer's grandma so she went to both family Christmases and I guess I was about ~19 months old. As recently as this year I've gone to the spot by the window where the rocking chair was and got down on my knees and bent down further and looked up to orient my field of view so everything spatially lines up with my memory. I might have a weak "mind's eye" and not be able to picture things very easily, but I can feel them volumetrically.

I actually have more discrete memories from the ages of 1.5 to 4 than I do from ages 7 to 14. But that's enough.

*** I learned to read when I was 3-4. I learned because my mother would read books and had explained to me that they had words in them, then I would sit next to her and ask "what's this letter?" "what's this letter?" and after enough asking I got the hang of it. Later my mother found me scribbling those same letters on paper and pointing at them, calling them by name, so I basically learned to write too that way - only block letters, TBF. Some of my first books were the printed volumes of "Once Upon A Time... Life", the educational series on human anatomy by Albert Barille' (which taught me at the same time the rudiments of biology) and "Pinocchio", which was my first novel, when I was 4, and so still holds a special place in my heart for that. Took me a while to work through it, also because its Italian was a bit antiquated, but I overcame it in the end.

So, yes, I think it's entirely possible to learn earlier than six years old. I wouldn't say I find that consensus sickening - a couple years of headstart don't make that big of a difference IMO - but yes, in general, I believe we /severely/ underestimate what a child's mind can do if properly stimulated and prompted. I have a brother 12 years younger than me and I always made it a point to never treat him like an idiot, no matter what he asked - if he asked me about quantum mechanics and was willing, I'd happily give him as much of an explanation as I could muster by moving from his existing knowledge onwards.

***** IQ is a malleable thing and it's not only genetic, at least if we're talking toddlers. Stimulating people in their childhood goes a great deal towards making them smart. I mean, you're right that it's not probably a universal thing, but as I said, it's possible, and I think we systematically underestimate just how much children /can/ grow and understand if given the chance.

****** I'm significantly aware of that, given that it's the problem I confront every day. Can children grow and decline? Of course! Significantly so, within the boundaries of their genetics, their current education status, and SES. What happens if you systematically try to push past those boundaries? Burnout, dejection, and educational trauma lasting into adulthood for little to no effect.

Education is /individual/; assuming that what worked for you will work for everyone in the same degree and proportion is foolish. I think most people on this board have no idea what the system actually looks like, because they don't engage with the system or process of education as adults.

******* No, I agree that there's an individual element, don't get me wrong. My point was that it's possible to learn before age 6, not that everyone necessarily can. A few examples are enough to prove that. So I guess I'm saying I believe we underestimate, on average, the potential of children; that doesn't mean their potential is literally unlimited, or the same for everyone. Certainly you don't want to push it to the point of burnout, but that happens already sometimes, and perhaps more because of the methods than the timing of education.

*** According to my mum I first started reading around age 2, but it's unclear how credible that claim is (my early childhood was quite tumultuous, and I'm otherwise skeptical just on prior grounds). In this account, I was taught to read by one of my great grandmas, bouncing on her knee in the kitchen of our small apartment (where my "bedroom" often was, either the kitchen table or the bathtub). This was all in Russian, too -- supposedly when I first came to the US (age 4) I'd already taught myself English somehow, and a placement test (since I'd attended Russian, Georgian, and French daycares / kindergardens) put me in the 1st grade (so e.g. I finished 12th at age 16, though personally I wish they'd have let me skip a few more). I was also fluent in and reading Georgian and French, but who knows. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I have no real memory of this time, just ones I've constructed from stories of my infanthood. Don't think I really have any real memories until age 5 or 6 or so.

Is the expert consensus disheartening because it's a later age than you'd anticipated? Why would it seriously impede cultural transmission?

*** My parents would read to me while pointing at the words they were reading and I'd follow along, and at some point when I was three or four I started being able to read. But someone told me I'd learn to read in first grade, and I believed them, so I didn't "know how to read" until the first day of first grade, then I knew and started reading whatever, mostly The Hobbit, which took all of first grade.

When I was very young I spent a lot of time trying to remember what it was like when I was even younger, because some of my memories were very alien to me. So I remember remembering being fascinated by one of those boards where you put the matching shape through a hole, because I remember trying to figure out how that was so interesting, but I don't actually remember that far back. The earliest actual memory I have is trying to walk to my parents' room in the middle of the night, having to touch the wall with a fingertip to be confident in my walking, and being frustrated that I had to switch to crawling when I passed the fireplace.

*** I was something of a late bloomer and didn't really put effort into reading until I was six. I may have been able to a little before then, but I didn't put much effort into it until I discovered Harry Potter books.

However, I remember my childhood pretty clearly. I have vivid memories of my fifth birthday, the day my brother was born when I was four, and a few 'snapshots' of events which my parents never described to me, but must have happened when I was three. I have nothing earlier than those, but I'm told remembering anything from that young is unusual.

And we don't really start to become people until we're 2-3 years old. Before then the brain is still too disorganized to support personalities or discrete memory recall. It's less that we forget our early childhood than that we were not capable of remembering at that time.

*** Hrrm. I would have been reading by kindergarten (~5) for sure as I can recall writing simple books around then, and I recall reading encyclopedia entries for things somewhat after. I was reading Lord of the Rings well before I was 8. Without querying my parents I can't pinpoint much more beyond extrapolating backwards. As for methods, I vaguely recall my mom trying hooked on phonics for me briefly, but I honestly remember the damn pre-movie ads for them on my VHS tapes more than I do the program itself.

EDIT: my mom says I was reading simple chapter books by kindergarten, and she thinks I learned to read around 3 or 4.

To answer your last question, I can't remember much beyond specific impactful events. There's a lot of things in my head bucketed in the "before I was 8" section because it was then that we moved out of my grandparent's house and my dad joined the Navy. It's all very much a blur. I have exactly two memories from before I was three, and everything from then to ~8 is all mixed together.

My son (3) can read very simple books a notch or so below Seuss and can write a very distorted version of all the letters in the alphabet. He could name all the letters on sight by the time he was around 2 or so. I credit the letter recognition to YouTube videos, and the reading/writing to a few different apps that we got for his tablet when he was also around 2. The ability for him to control the endless repetition has been a huge help, I suspect; neither me nor his mother have the patience to have repeated the sounds of each letter or word the thousands of times he's heard them by spamming taps on the tablet.

  How old were you when you learned how to read?
#+end_quote

Fuzzy on the details, but I remember having read Eragon in kindergarten or maybe early 1st grade (6 years old; it was around summertime), but didn't start to learn reading much earlier than kindergarten. I believe my reading education was fairly conventional; I'd had some exposure to letters beforehand (I have memories from when I was about 3 drawing cursive letters with chalk and asking my parents if they spelled anything) but other than that it was just the standard kindergarten exposure to language.

As for how much of my early childhood I can legitimately remember, I start having concrete memories at about 3 years of age, and remember more and more of each year for every year thereafter. Most of my memories are information based-- I remember that I did something in some place at some time, and then any visuals I think up are probably synthetized after the fact. I don't remember sound, smell, taste, or touch virtually at all, with a few notable exceptions, but it's relatively easy for me to place specific events on a timeline because my family moved around a bit so the environments I was in are distinct.

Personally, I think the general consensus on reading age is probably right. The responses you're getting to this post are all coming from [[/r/rational]] members who started earlier, but I have a feeling we were all a very particular kind of child. Since intelligence is highly heritable, any kid you have can probably stand to start early, but my gut feeling is that most kids are poorly suited to be taught reading any earlier than 6ish years old, either due to lack of comprehension or childish hyperactivity. They're technically capable of learning to read, but being forced to could poison them against reading in the future, in much the same way that you see a lot of kids hate reading books because of what they were forced to read in english classes.

Around 3 or 4 years old.

  How did you acquire the ability to read?
#+end_quote

According to my parents, my older brother had just learned to read, and I was frustrated that he was able to do something that I could not, and taught myself to read. Their first guess was that I had just memorized a book, rather than actually reading, but were satisfied after having me read the book in reverse order.

#+begin_quote
  How much of your early childhood can you legitimately remember?
#+end_quote

Relatively little. A few mental images have internal inconsistencies, or otherwise contradict the known sequence of events. (For example, tricycling down a hallway to visit my cousins, when in actuality we had never lived in the same city, let alone the same apartment complex.) I don't have any distinct memories of learning to read, though I do have a few consistent and confirmed memories that date to when I was about 3.

*** My first fragmentic memories are from around the age of one. From around the age of 2,5-3 memories got more substantial - prolonged series of events in contrast to few emotional scenes I remember from earlier age. I remember that period of life quite well, much better in fact than my 7-13 y.o. period.

I was a late reader, I think I started to read only when I was 7-8 years old, in 1st-2nd grade (Russian school, it is on the "late" part of spectrum but nothing too unusual). And started to read casually for ones enjoyment only when I was around 10,5-11 y.o.

*** Alright. I wanted this one to be snappier and organized more coherently, but it's still long.

First, my own experience.

My mother didn't know any better, so she began teaching me how to read when I was basically fresh out of the womb. We've had conversations about it in the past and I mostly remember the broad strokes... but I just stopped typing and went and asked her directly and she said that she started when I was about 3 or 4 months old, right when I was able to hold my head up while in a sitting position. She would have me sat in her lap and read to me slowly and clearly (basically "[[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200203151158.htm][parentese]]") while she traced her finger under every word she was saying, pointing at the relevant pictures associated with the words after finishing every sentence, acting things out and such. She would finish a whole book in one sitting, so 15 to 20 minutes, and that would happen three or four times a day.

She says that at about 8 months I started becoming actively involved, trying to turn the pages on my own, and she would redirect my attention by holding my body still and telling me "no" gently but clearly then taking my hand and putting my finger out and using my own finger to point at a picture of something like a ball after asking me where it was, stuff like that. I have an unfounded suspicion that feels like the fringes of a memory telling me that by then she had repeated all of the books many times each and I already recognized the words by sight and was getting impatient and reading ahead of her. That's probably not accurate.

By 10 months, it was still three or four times a day, but two or three books in one sitting, so 30 minutes to an hour at a time.

By two years, it was only two or three times a day, but an hour at a time, plus one to two hours at bedtime. Around two-and-a-half she had a relative visiting from out of state and my "bedtime" was 7pm (I guess relatively early to give reading time) and I kept asking her for "one more story" until almost 11pm. That would've been the Hans Christian Anderson collection of stories.

And of course through all that period of time, whenever we would be out in public she would point out words. Like if my dad went into the grocery store and me and mom were in the car, she'd say something like "look Michael, that says 'Food Lion', f... o... o... d... food... l... i... o... n... lion. The two 'o's together make an 'oo' sound." And she was always there in the play room where I had blocks with letters on them and magnetic letters and stuff. I might mention here that she quit her job when she had me and took care of me full time until I was two and she started working again. That wasn't something we could financially support, but she did it anyway.

She had my brother a couple of months after I turned three, so for a while I was in a situation where my dad would read to me for thirty minutes a night but he didn't do it right, he thought the point was the narrative and not the reading itself so he just read to me without involving me in the process. So shortly after I turned 3 years old I was reading the Hans Christian Anderson book on my own. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13514088-andersen-s-fairy-tales][It was this version]], which is about 330 pages. I would read one or two stories at a time (twenty to thirty pages each) multiple times a day. I'm pretty sure there was a period of at least three to five weeks where I read that entire book once a week.

[[https://archive.org/details/fairytalesfromha00ande3/page/2/mode/2up][Seriously, look at the text of this book.]]

So that's where I ended up, capable of reading something like /that/ on my own at age three, reading all seven Narnia books the summer between kindergarten and first grade, and the gap between was filled with things like the "Wheeler's Adventures" series when I was four and five years old.

[[https://imgur.com/DpF0rny][Example screenshot of text from a Wheeler's book.]]

But let's go back to the process that got me there.

My mom used several different series. At the beginning were things like Golden Books and Magic Castle books and Richard Scarry books, lots of "just one or two short simple sentences per page" stuff.

Shortly before I turned two, she transitioned to the Sweet Pickles books.

As an adult who knows a little bit about psychology and the development of the brain from casual research over the course of more than a decade, I'm looking at all these books now and I think the books themselves might've boosted the efficacy of what she did.

A Golden Book:

[[https://img.aucfree.com/b382408524.2.jpg]]

And probably most importantly, Sweet Pickles:

So it's not just the "tracing under the words with a finger" that does it, it's all the repetition of sounds and having pictures corresponding to the words. It's 2am, I'll have to come back tomorrow and get to the point because I don't think I'm physically capable of making a point right now.

  [[/u/--MCMC--]] - Is the expert consensus disheartening because it's a later age than you'd anticipated? Why would it seriously impede cultural transmission?

  [[/u/SimoneNonvelodico]] - I think it's entirely possible to learn earlier than six years old. I wouldn't say I find that consensus sickening - a couple years of headstart don't make that big of a difference IMO - but yes, in general, I believe we /severely/ underestimate what a child's mind can do if properly stimulated and prompted.

  [[/u/somerando11]] - As for your loss of faith: did you assume your perceptions were wrong or experts were wrong? In education "experts" are frequently non-scientific, but in this case, it's probably your perceptions that were wrong.
#+end_quote

My revulsion to the general consensus stems from the fact that I am genuinely convinced that the experts are mistaken (and I think I've said enough in the previous three comments to support the idea that even if you disagree with my conclusion you should be able to see how I came to be convinced of it). Literacy training should be taught differently and begin earlier than people believe it should, the consensus is /wrong/.

And that mistaken consensus has real effects on society. It's been shown that "a head start of a few years" /does/ actually make a /significant/ difference. It might not be that children become readers because they're intelligent, it could be the case that children's intelligence is boosted by exposure to reading.

  I should've gathered better sources but this makes a close enough point to the point I'm trying to make - children's brains are literally being physically wired differently due to the mistaken consensus.
#+end_quote

From an article I linked in the previous comment, "More than 60 percent of American fourth-graders are not proficient readers, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and it's been that way since testing began in the 1990s." American fourth-graders are /9 years old./ I think that pretty clearly shows that there's something /fundamentally wrong/ with the way things are being done.

And my lack of faith in the efficacy of cultural transmission when it comes to important stuff stems from stuff like this:

#+begin_quote
  Wiley Blevins, an author and educational consultant who has written about 15 books on methods for teaching early reading, says the earliest he has ever seen a child learn to read is 4 years old. He defines reading as analyzing words letter by letter and sound by sound and putting them together into a word. He says very early “reading” is more likely babies seeing words as pictures. They see a squiggly line on the page or TV screen and associate it with a specific word, which is a very primitive form of reading, Blevins says.

  "It's not what we in the academic community would say is reading because it's not transferable. It relies on what you've memorized," Blevins says. "It could be a smudge on the page reminds them that it's the word 'cat.'"

  [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/teaching-babies-to-read-is-it-possible-several-companies-say-yes-but-study-says-no/2014/05/05/ead52d82-b5d6-11e3-b899-20667de76985_story.html?noredirect=on]]
#+end_quote

That is not a fringe view. Somehow, despite the fact that a non-insignificant number of children exist who learned how to read by naturally absorbing the written word similarly to the way we all learned how to speak by naturally absorbing the spoken word (basically by watching their parents' finger trace under words while reading aloud from a book), not only is that learning method generally not recognized as existing, but experts in the field doubt those children's very existence. Like, I'm not the only person whose parent(s) read to them while tracing along below the words with their finger. It's an extraordinarily simple idea, and yet I can find barely any trace of it being discussed casually, let alone in any sort of research papers.

#+begin_quote
  [[/u/jtolmar]] - My parents would read to me while pointing at the words they were reading and I'd follow along, and at some point when I was three or four I started being able to read.
#+end_quote

And I found this on an [[/r/AskReddit][r/AskReddit]] post from like 7 years ago... I was planning on just linking to the comment, but it would probably feel pretty surreal to be cc'd into a random discussion because of a throwaway comment you made 7 years ago that got basically zero engagement at the time, so I'm gonna ping 'em:

#+begin_quote
  [[/u/woollufff]] - My dad used to sit me in his lap while he read science journals and astronomy books. He read out loud tracing along with a finger. Reading came naturally as talking, and was reading by age of 4.
#+end_quote

So "kids can learn how to read without being explicitly taught, just absorbing it based on pattern recognition facilitated by an adult reading aloud and tracing along with a finger to establish an association between squiggly lines and vocalizations (and if done with fanatic zealotry like my mother, also word meanings/definitions and phonemic awareness)" is something that is factually correct.

And it honestly shouldn't take much time or effort (relatively speaking) to accidentally sneeze a remarkable amount of literacy and onto a child's brain. Because of the ease with which this extraordinarily simple idea could be implemented by spreading awareness to day care workers and parents (pediatricians already tell parents they should be reading to their kids every day, this would just be a slightly more specific message) and the dramatic effects it would have on cognitive and [[http://www.psychology-criminalbehavior-law.com/2015/01/risk-factors-for-criminal-behavior-preschool-experience/][behavioral]] outcomes, the fact that this idea seems to not even be on the radar of the experts who have devoted the past half a century to studying how children learn to read makes me, personally, feel like it /must/ be the case that something is blocking the transmission of this idea.

Someone who replied to my first comment said something that appears to have been edited away, about how the mere mention of precocious reading ability sounds like bragging even though it's just a statement of fact that you read a book that you read at the age that you did.

#+begin_quote
  [[/u/LiteralHeadCannon]] - My kindergarten teacher took a bizarrely antagonistic stance towards my reading level, repeatedly attempted to prove that I was lying about my ability to read, and essentially treated me like a freak until the end of the year, at which point my parents transferred me to a different school as I'd requested.
#+end_quote

My mom says that for a few years before she knew any better, she would mention things about my reading to other parents and to teachers (she was a teacher, but for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education][special education]] so strict phonics was the only way to reach them, she never experimented with trying to teach reading to students the way she taught it to her own kids). Reactions would be along the lines of "oh, uh huh, okay." Sort of not really engaging and dismissive, and she realized after a time that most people just didn't believe her, they thought she was making up a ridiculous hyperbole so she could brag.

And of course one of the more common complaints about HPMOR is that HJPEV is characterized as having read things like The Feynman Lectures on Physics and Godel Escher Back before the story begins, and that's "unrealistic" because an 11-year-old isn't capable of that, much less a kid younger than 11.

So that one bit was just my own cynicism - I think most parents think you're an arrogant know-it-all who's bragging about imaginary accomplishments if you happen to state a fact about your child's abilities, and so knowledge of how to make your child smarter doesn't spread. The early childhood memories bit was mostly a waste of time, it wasn't relevant at all to the main point that reading should be taught differently and earlier.

*** [Part 1]

Unlike the last two comments, there's actually a point to this one and the next one. Since people generally expect a thesis statement of sorts to occur near the beginning, and I've already missed the beginning by a full 10 pages, I should probably get to the point /right now/.

Basically, I believe that literally every single child who physically has the neurological capacity to learn how to read could do so at a much earlier age and with far less difficulty than what's generally accepted as both common knowledge and expert consensus.

--------------

Most of the people who study this stuff for a living seem to acknowledge "phonemes and phonics" and "whole language learning" as the only two methods of learning to read:

#+begin_quote
  In his internationally acclaimed analysis of the effectiveness of teaching methods, Professor John Hattie assigns “effect sizes” ranging from 1.44 (highly effective) to -0.34 (harmful). Effect sizes above 0.4 indicate methods worth serious attention.

  There are two main schools of thought about how to teach children to read and write, one focused on meaning (whole language) and one focused on word structure (phonics). Hattie's meta-analysis gives whole language an effect size of 0.06, and phonics an effect size of 0.54.

  [[https://theconversation.com/the-way-we-teach-most-children-to-read-sets-them-up-to-fail-36946]]

  --------------

  [R]eading researchers have done studies in classrooms and clinics, and they've shown over and over that virtually all kids can learn to read - if they're taught with approaches that use what scientists have discovered about how the brain does the work of reading. But many teachers don't know this science.

  What have scientists figured out? First of all, while learning to talk is a natural process that occurs when children are surrounded by spoken language, learning to read is not. To become readers, kids need to learn how the words they know how to say connect to print on the page. They need explicit, systematic phonics instruction. There are hundreds of studies that back this up.

  [[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/opinion/sunday/phonics-teaching-reading-wrong-way.html]]
#+end_quote

Basically, some people believe that if you throw enough books at a child and tell them to guess all the words then the child will magically absorb the ability to read (a method which seems to have been shown to be functionally equivalent to not teaching them at all), and the actual scientists believe that you have to systematically force memorization of phonemes (by breaking down individual short words like "bat and cat and rat and hat" to get kids to recognize the "-at" phoneme) and then force memorization of a bunch of common words and then have the child struggle through a phase where they "read" by using memorized phonemes to sound out syllable by syllable every unmemorized word the encounter, without much (if any) comprehension of the meaning of what they're reading.

#+begin_quote
  Difficulty linking letters with sounds is the source of reading problems for many children. Their reading is hesitant and characterized by frequent starts and stops and multiple mispronunciations. If asked about the meaning of what has been read, they frequently have little to say because they take far too long to read the words, taxing their memory and leaving little energy for remembering and understanding what they have read. *Unfortunately, there is no way to bypass this decoding and word recognition stage of reading* [emphasis mine]. A deficiency in these skills cannot to any meaningful extent be offset by using context to figure out the pronunciation of unknown words. While one learns to read for the fundamental purpose of deriving meaning from print, the key to comprehension starts with the immediate and accurate reading of words.

  [[http://www.reidlyon.com/edpolicy/4-WHY-READING-IS-NOT-A-NATURAL-PROCESS.pdf]]
#+end_quote

They believe that a phonics method is the best way to teach a child to read because, out of the two methods, the "expect children to learn to read by teething on books" method has been shown to not work and the phonics method has been shown /not/ to not work, and obviously the method that doesn't not work is the best method.

I'm going to be responding to some things from this article:

[[https://www.apmreports.org/story/2018/09/10/hard-words-why-american-kids-arent-being-taught-to-read]]

But the whole thing is worth reading. I'd be especially interested in a take on this article from [[/u/somerando11]].

#+begin_quote
  The basic assumption that underlies typical reading instruction in many schools is that learning to read is a natural process, much like learning to talk. But decades of scientific research has revealed that reading doesn't come naturally. The human brain isn't wired to read. Kids must be explicitly taught how to connect sounds with letters - phonics.
#+end_quote

That is a true fact. You can't just throw a book at a child and expect them to learn to read.

Important facts:

#+begin_quote
  We are born wired to talk... but... reading is different. Our brains don't know how to do it... To be able to read, structures in our brain that were designed for things such as object recognition have to get rewired a bit.

  --------------

  Another big takeaway from decades of scientific research is that, while we use our eyes to read, the starting point for reading is sound. What a child must do to become a reader is to figure out how the words she hears and knows how to say connect to letters on the page. Writing is a code humans invented to represent speech sounds. Kids have to crack that code to become readers. Children don't crack the code naturally. They need to be taught how letters represent speech sounds.

  --------------

  What's also clear in the research is that phonics isn't enough. Children can learn to decode words without knowing what the words mean. To comprehend what they're reading, kids need a good vocabulary, too. That's why reading to kids and surrounding them with quality books is a good idea. The whole language proponents are right about that.
#+end_quote

So, the whole language method is absolute garbage and shouldn't even be qualified as a teaching method. It's wonderful that teachers are slowly beginning to be forced to teach based on facts rather than based on their personal "feelings and beliefs." It's undeniably clear that learning to read can't happen without knowledge of phonics.

But if you look into the way they teach phonics, you can see why its effect size is only only 0.54. 0.54 is certainly better by an order of magnitude than 0.06, but it's still a far cry from 1.44. You can see it in that article - in a picture of a teacher holding up a single flash card with a single word on it, and in the quote:

#+begin_quote
  If the curriculum says today's the day for kindergarteners to learn words that begin with the sounds "wuh" and "guh," you can walk into any kindergarten classroom in the district and see the teacher doing that lesson.
#+end_quote

So now I feel like I can make a point that I couldn't figure out how to make last night at 2am.

[[https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YUUlaM4M-qY/UlkFiMFVMWI/AAAAAAAAEGM/v7CfU1wnVro/s1600/A+dragon+in+a+wagon+2.jpg]]

#+begin_quote
  Megan opens a Word Window.

  Guess what she sees?

  A dragon

  in a wagon.

  "Hi," says the dragon.

  "Let's go for a ride."
#+end_quote

You should've read that more slowly than normal, clearly enunciating every syllable, running your fingertip under every word as you said it.

Don't turn the page. Start talking to the child about what's in front of you, and pointing at pictures and words and letters, and asking questions.

#+begin_quote
  "Do you see Megan?" put your fingertip on Megan. "She's sitting in a chair" put your fingertip on the chair "and holding a book... Just like this one!" take the physical book you're holding and present it to the child as evidence.

  "See how it says it's a 'Word Window'?" put your fingertip under each of the three syllables as you enunciate them. "That's because it has words in it" run your fingertip over all the words on the page. "Isn't that silly?" Laugh.

  "/W/ord /W/indow. Can you hear the 'wuh' sound? /Wuh/ord, /wuh/indow. Do we see any other words that start with the 'wuh' sound?" If the child points at either the 'wagon' or the 'what', that is genuinely impressive and you should make a big deal about it by saying like "Wow! Good job!" but that probably won't happen so pretend to search for any Ws and then pretend to find either 'wagon' or 'what' and make a big deal about finding them.

  Reinforce the narrative of the story by re-reading those 23 words again at a normal speed and then turn the page.
#+end_quote

Obviously "double-u" is a complicated idea and you'll need to reinforce things like that later with other more alphabetically oriented books like Lowly Worm's ABC:

[[https://www.bibdsl.co.uk/imagegallery2/BDS/201838/9780008304966_2.jpg]]

[[https://www.bibdsl.co.uk/imagegallery2/BDS/201838/9780008304966_4.jpg]]

Though that sort of thing should probably have already come earlier to familiarize the concept of individual letters having names distinct from the sounds they make.

If you do it like that every day for an extended period of time, kids /can/ crack the code naturally without forced memorization of how letters represent speech sounds.

And a curriculum for kindergartners has an entire day for words that begin with the sounds "wuh" and "guh" and has an effect size of 0.54. I wonder if maybe it's because using flash cards to memorize phonemes from randomly selected single words divorced from any context or meaning makes it harder to remember since there's no meaning or context to associate the words with. Hmm.

*** This anecdote is coming in a bit late but I figure it can't hurt:

I learned to read around kindergarten, which if memory serves was around four or five. We had a little book section of the classroom that you could spend time in, and I have a distinct memory of something that happened about that.

In my first year of kindergarten, I wasn't much interested in the books. I could read them, so I probably picked up a lot of the knowledge around 4y/o, but I didn't care much. Around the time I started my second year of kindergarten, I got a lot more interested in them (which is what I remember: me noticing the shift in behaviour).

I don't have reading-based memories earlier than that (though I do have one around the same time about learning how to read silently), though, so I can't say when my parents started reading to me. But it can't have been later than four, since I already knew the basics of reading in my first year of kindergarten.

*** I was about three when I learned to read. I might have understood some simple words and phrases at two, but three was when I started reading books. Hooked On Phonics was involved, but I think our family's extensive collection of Seuss was also a critical factor - yes, my parents did want to teach me how to read at an early age, and yes, I did want to make them happy, but I was more concretely motivated by my appreciation of Dr. Seuss's work, which I could read at any time so long as I first /learned how to read/. The appealing and unusual illustrations helped - yes, I could get some enjoyment out of them even without reading, but that just gave me some idea of /the real experience I was missing/.

A couple of years later, at age five, I was reading children's chapter books; the thickest was the first Harry Potter book. My kindergarten teacher took a bizarrely antagonistic stance towards my reading level (which might partially have been the result of her fringe-right religious beliefs not taking kindly to the aforementioned Harry Potter - she also explicitly taught antisemitism, and although my parents were disgusted by that, I'm not sure why it never blew up into a big scandal), repeatedly attempted to prove that I was lying about my ability to read, and essentially treated me like a freak until the end of the year, at which point my parents transferred me to a different school as I'd requested.

The school I was transferred to for first grade specialized in gifted children, but it didn't set the bar especially high - I still had the highest reading level in the class, but that was seen as a good thing and I had serious competition for it. I began looking down on other children for their poor academic performance - one girl in particular, I held in contempt because she was the last student in our class to learn how to read, and I saw this as symptomatic of some great deficit in her character. In retrospect, I have extremely fond memories of her, and this failure to empathize with my age peers (realizing that things like their literacy would mostly be a consequence of factors outside their control) is one of my greatest shames from this period of my life.

I have extensive memories of my early childhood; the memories get scarcer and blurrier earlier in the timeline, but only somewhat, and there are still definitely legitimate memories there, not just imagined scenes reconstructed from others' accounts. For a long time I thought my first memory was my third birthday, but I gradually realized that some of my formative memories actually happened when I was two (particularly during a business trip in Europe). My third birthday was just my first /solidly positive/ memory; an incident during my father's business trip in Europe when I was two, which taught me that /it was possible to lose things/, was my first /solidly negative/ memory.

** Real talk - I feel quite a bit stressed about this all and I need to vent, plus any experience/advice would be welcome.

The recent Coronavirus situation has made me rethink a lot about my health situation. I'm not panicking about this virus specifically - it's just that it made me realise how in practice I'm likely to be quite vulnerable from a respiratory point of view, be it any new strange diseases or the good ol' flu. I've been living in the Oxford area for years now, and apparently this is quite the polluted zone. This has taken a toll as now I've got adult onset asthma, albeit a relatively light form, that has me on preventer inhalers all the time. My doctor says that it's unlikely to ever go away as long as I live here. This kind of thing can't be good - no one has ever mentioned the C- word yet, but I doubt frankly breathing in pollution all the time does wonders for my long term chances in that sense either. I've been considering moving away for a while now. The problem is, to move I would likely need to change jobs, and that's a bit of a toughie.

I'm a scientist and currently I work in a research council. Job wise this might be possibly the best position for me - it's not perfect, but I have no teaching burdens and get a lot of freedom in my projects and managing my time, which is something I cherish. If I were to leave here, it'd be unlikely I could find another job in a similar position while staying in the UK. So it'd be either the private sector, or trying for academia. Thing is, the first option worries me that I might find myself frustrated with a job where I'm much more constrained and have less opportunities to actually apply my knowledge in full; the second option seems far more attractive on the face of it, but it means throwing myself into the whirlwind of crazy competitiveness that universities have become as of late, and in the end working my ass off and suffering through a lot of stress I'm not sure I'd be able to take in order to end up becoming almost only an administrator, writing grant requests all the time, which seems to be what most professors do once they progress enough in their career.

Does anyone here have personal experience of either environment? What is your take on their pros/cons? Mind you, both options would likely be better paid than my current job, so that's not the issue. It's more a matter of long term satisfaction and happiness. I may be underestimating for example the level of stress I can take because in these last times I felt very weak/lethargic. Maybe a job that interests me more could energise me. As I am now, I have a really hard time imagining that in 10 years I'd have the strength to cope with a very stressful job that I could barely handle now, but that might be a wrong impression.

  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the top five air quality problems in the U.S. are all indoor air problems.

[[https://smarterhouse.org/ventilation-and-air-distribution/indoor-air-pollutants]]

I'd imagine this is almost certainly also the case in the U.K.

#+begin_quote
  Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids. VOCs include a variety of chemicals, some of which may have short- and long-term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than outdoors. VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the thousands.

  Organic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products. Paints, varnishes and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing and hobby products. Fuels are made up of organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds while you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored.

  EPA's Office of Research and Development's "Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) Study" (Volumes I through IV, completed in 1985) found levels of about a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or highly industrial areas. TEAM studies indicated that while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is completed.

If you haven't already taken steps to reduce your own indoor air pollution, moving away from Oxford won't have as much of an effect as you think it will. Like, it ought to be common sense to not spray things into the air, but people do it anyways. If you haven't already banned Febreze and scented candles and perfume and cologne and sprayable deodorant and sprayable Lysol from your home then do so.

And as far as lethargy/fatigue, you should be taking creatine. I've finally convinced my mother to start taking creatine and she's been taking it for a few months and she's noted a significant reduction in fatigue.

I bet that's at least 70% of your problem right there.

#+begin_quote
  Moisture is one of the most important and least recognized indoor pollutants, affecting both human health and the health of the building. The most common moisture problems arise when warm moist air encounters a cool surface such as a mirror, window, or the wall of a cooler space. Cooler air can hold less moisture, so the excess condenses in droplets on the surface. Where moisture collects, so do mold, mildew, and dust mites, which can cause asthma or allergies, destroy wood products, and accelerate the rusting of metal building components. High indoor humidity can also facilitate “off-gassing” of toxins in furniture or cleaning products.

[[https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/take-action-climate-readiness-and-indoor-air-quality][The EPA recommends using a dehumidifier to control indoor moisture levels and mold.]] [EDIT: A good dehumidifier will probably cost you a couple hundred bucks.]

I didn't think you needed to move, but you actually might. Buy a dehumidifier to tide you over until you can get someone to come inspect your house and see if your moisture problem can be resolved. You might also want to consider getting someone to inspect your HVAC system. If your moisture problem can't be resolved, then you definitely ought to move.

I accidentally got in the habit of wasting time by watching youtube videos of text-to-speech bots reading reddit comments. Terrible habit, I know.

My mom drives 55 minutes to work every day.

So I took a break from this comment and I've been on Google Maps for like 15 minutes finding all the cities big enough to register when zoomed out to a reasonable level, taking a random sampling of air quality at intervals of cities separated by about 45 minutes of driving, and, um, /it appears that the entire flipping country of England kinda sorta sucks shit,/ especially the southern half/three-quarters. Like, it doesn't matter where you live in England, pollution is higher than it should be in just about every city big enough to qualify as a city and not a town, so you really can't even make your decision on where to move based on air quality unless you're willing to live in the middle of the countryside 30 minutes from the nearest grocery store in a town with more sheep than humans. Why the hell is your country's air quality so terrible?

I realize this isn't addressing your question - others seem to have already done this - but I did want to chime in specifically about the infectious disease angle.

Both SARS and MERS are coronaviruses, and the current outbreak looks likely to go the same way, if the same protections are kept in play.

These, as well as influenza, spread in a very similar way - hand to hand. Use gloves when opening doors, and knuckles rather than fingertips to push elevator buttons. Frequently clean your hands with soap and water by vigorously scrubbing for around 30 seconds. Try to keep your hands away from eyes, nose, and mouth unless they've been recently cleaned.

Clean hands will not entirely protect you, but they do greatly reduce exposure.

If a vaccination becomes available, by all means get that done as well.

*** For the pharmaceutical researchers, I'd encourage the rapid development of safe and effective [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic][nootropic]] drugs which can be shown to measurably improve results on IQ tests and/or to accelerate work performance at creative or intellectual tasks. There's no guarantee that such a thing could even exist, but if it is feasible, it would have the potential to greatly accelerate all other fields of research.

For education researchers, I'd like to see focus going into establishing learning aids (like educational videos) to help reduce reliance on lectures in classrooms. Lectures will vary in quality; some good, some bad, but most can be improved with visual aids. We can try to identify the best lecture approaches/presentations and then include visual aids with that to produce educational videos which teach concepts as quickly and as effectively as possible. Variations on these educational videos can be presented to groups of students to see which ones yield the best results (in terms of both student enjoyment as well as ability to correctly answer questions across various timescales after viewing the video). With rapid development and improvement of these learning aids, we could possibly start accelerating school/college programs and then have spare time for more advanced topics. Improving education could also help to improve our ability to get capable researchers for promoting scientific advancements.

As far as how science is practiced overall, for any kind of randomized control trial, I would want to ensure that all such studies are registered with whatever journal they'll publish with, and that they undergo pre-publication peer review to ensure that the basis of the study is sound. The pre-publication registration is important to ensure that we don't miss negative findings. It's easy for published research to create a bias towards doing/using things that are actually ineffective if all or most of the negative results don't get published. This has created significant problems in drug research and psychology, although many other fields are not without their problems in this regard as well.

With those in place to accelerate our progress, there's still the big topics with potential for revolutionary socioeconomic impact: friendly GAI, nanotechnology, genetic research and engineering (including genetic screening, gene therapy, and GMO crops), viable nuclear fusion power plants, neural interfaces, and self-replicating robots (which could be sent to the asteroid belt or other planets).

** Here's an unpleasant thought experiment I thought up this last week. Not sure how I'd respond to it, myself:

Suppose in your care is a small, defenseless child. Maybe picture them a daughter, 8 years old, for whom you're the world's greatest parent. You love and care for them deeply, as they do you. You're a widow(er), but despite many struggles you've managed to eke out a small island of comfort and stability: flexible middle-class job, finger paintings on the fridge, long bedtime stories, the works.

You're driving down a forested road one day when a Scientist turns on a Machine and causes the universe to shudder and split. The momentary distraction makes you swerve and crash, killing your daughter instantly but leaving you miraculously unharmed.

One funeral and no small amount of mourning later, the Scientist comes to you and remarks that they've managed to contact and transfer matter between one of the alternate universes, identical in all respects up to the moment of shudder. In this universe, the shudder happened a split second later, bestowing upon the alternate /you'/ that much more opportunity to sacrificially direct your' swerve so that /you'/ died instantly, orphaning /your' daughter'/ but leaving her at the mercy of a cruel and inefficient foster care system, with nothing but horror and inconvenience before her.

The Scientist offers you an opportunity to connect you and /your' daughter'/, that she may live with you and be cared for and loved. Do you accept their offer?

If you don't, the Scientist leaves, never to return. If you do, the Scientist leaves, but returns some weeks later, after you've settled into some semblance of normalcy, beginning to truly love /your' daughter'/, who you've now accepted as if she were your own (which, under many perspectives on personal identity, she is). The Scientist tells you that it's not just one alternate universe they've managed to contact, but trillions! And it would appear that across the distribution of alternate car crashes, an unharmed orphaned daughter was left a million times as often as a living, breathing "/you/". Each of those orphaned daughters finds herself on the cusp of a series of deeply unfortunate and tragic events, every one a unique blend of sorrow and tragedy. You may transfer as many or as few into your care as you'd like. How do you proceed?

*** If you're doing the naive-utilitarian thing and just trying to be better than the extra-tragic foster system for the largest number of daughters, then you can safely aim towards the dozen+.

Of course that's not going to be a very fun rest of your life, or very rewarding (your daughters' childhoods will only be pleasant in a relative sense). And if you're a saint out to maximize utility you could just buy malaria nets.

*** Seems like you should sit down and think about your food budget, ability to multi-task, available family/social support network, and your daughter's ability to care for herself (herselves). You could take care of anywhere from three to a dozen alternate-universe clones of her depending on the answers.

*** Can you transfer, say, copies of legal docs to a million other worlds? It seems like you only need to solve the "procedure" aspect on one planet, then dry-run and fixup the "blind document delivery with no further interaction" approach several times before you can attempt to move into some form of mass-production. Perhaps you would have access to a sympathetic charity-case lawyer who could bootstrap funds access from your'-to-daughter' if funds are needed.

Side note: Reaching a million worlds can be done in twenty doublings, so it's not like you need to fax a million copies from the first world.

*(edit) Also: I wonder how much real value that old "identical twins A/B testing" joke has. I would guess probably not enough to privately fund the 8-to-18 childhood of every participant. But perhaps some (sane) governments would be interested, as a public investment into the future of the nation and humanity. **(edit2) Ah, with inter-universe communication, there might not be all that much need for doing such experiments same-universe (ie, universes can collaborate).
