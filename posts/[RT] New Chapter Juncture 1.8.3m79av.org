** This may benefit from longer chapters at longer intervals. We're 8 chapters in and it feels to me as if the plot barely advanced over where it started in the first chapter.

I'm still enjoying the story, though, and I like the premise.

*** Hey, thanks for the comment.

I know this chapter wasn't that great, I was trying to make the first arc longer, which wasn't necessarily a smart move. But the pace is set to speed up quite a bit in the next few chapters.
