** Something that I really liked about this piece of fanfiction is how you emphasize the existence of consequences for the decision to avoid unpleasant topics and tasks. You did a great job with Kakashi when he talked about how one of the reasons why his team died is that he was just to embarrassed to point out an obvious mistake made by Minato and in this chapter you did a similarly great job of showing the consequences of Shikamaru's laziness.

*** Thanks! I really wanted to drive home the point that a lot of things go wrong purely because of small and totally unnecessary mistakes, so I'm glad I got that point across. It's sort of a "banality of evil" argument, except for irrationality.

This chapter was also meant to show why Shikamaru couldn't be the main character of the story. A lot of people asked me when I started writing why Naruto should be the MC, and not someone smarter like Sasuke or Shikamaru or Sakura. And the explanation for that is, well, intelligence is simply not enough to make you rational. You also have to care, and be creative, and *want* to save the world. Shikamaru fails as a rationalist because he does not start thinking until the fight has already started, and that is simply way too late to make a difference. Like the Fourth Hokage said, battles are decided by the time swords are drawn, not when they are sheathed...

**** You're describing the difference between being /proactive/ and being /reactive/, or when it's applied to a main character, the difference between an /active protagonist/ and a /passive protagonist/.

Setting aside the obvious benefits of the former from a rational perspective, /proactive/ characters are far more interesting in a storytelling sense, at least when the story follows them continuously, because they have goals and ambition to accomplish something, and set out to do it the best they can. Things don't just 'happen' to them, they happen in response to their actions.

You never want your main character to be a passive protagonist, as it almost always comes across as less interesting, if not outright boring. You see this a lot in YA or kids fiction, like in Hunger Games or the Series of Unfortunate Events. Great for their age category, incredibly dull for older people as you really don't /care/ for the characters. But for side characters with a high mortality rate, like these? It's great, because you give a contrast to the main character that shows why the latter /is/ the main character.

Sophronius is totally right. Intelligence is just an attribute, its how you use it that counts. Shikamaru is about as far on the passive side of the active-passive spectrum as you can get. He did well because of his intelligence and powers, but he never really had much motivation to use them. This is a far more likely ending for even the /original/ character in its universe.

Also, I think people vastly exaggerate the number of people who genuinely have zero empathy - I think that most people who are called psychopaths just have some kind of mental illness or brain damage, or care about some people but lack the imagination to extend that caring to others, and such a person could hardly be called rational.

I think humans are really bad at imaging things of a vast scale, whether it's the size of the galaxy or the suffering of humanity as a whole, but I don't think being physically or mentally unable to feel empathy for everyone on the planet means that those people are not included in your utility function.

******** The real reason you care about your friends and family probably isn't their qualities, in the sense that you logically should then care equally about anyone else with those qualities, because we, empirically, /don't/ equally care about strangers that are similar to our friends and said friends. If their qualities were the only reason we care about them, we would already care about strangers that much. Unless you mean "qualities" in such a broad sense it includes identity, in which case you're just saying "you should care about them because you already care about them", which is kind of pointless. Emotion-driven goals have too much context about them to apply that sort of logic and still be correct about what the reality is. I don't think that's a leap you can/should make.

And anyway, this is a tangent. We've gone from discussing the definition of "rational", which doesn't say anything about what your goals are/should be (just how to go about them), to the expected qualities of a normal rational human being from our culture. I take exception to the idea that every rational person will inevitably come around to some given goal. For one thing, self-aware AI count as people (according to most people on here, I'd think) and you could have a hypothetical AI with /any/ goal, or lack thereof, while still being rational in how they go about their goals.

** Hmmm. What an amazing (un)surprise that the people from another village you share your deepest secrets with (despite only having previously met them as antagonists) could /ever/ possibly use that against you. A shocker for the ages.

I'm unsurprised it backfired on these guys so easily, but I'm still curious as to why R-Naruto and R-Sasuke would be so eager to include the Sand Duo, earlier, especially as they live in a world full of paranoid killers.

I find it unusual that the guy who works with extreme body-modification would fall so easily to poison. Even if he didn't mess with his metabolism or alter his body at the physical and chemical level (all possible ways for his size and mass-manipulation to work) that could interfere with foreign chemicals, it seems reasonable that his increased size would result in a thicker layer of body fat (or empty space between the layers for when he goes into 'balloon mode'), which would serve to prevent attacks from small poisoned weapons from delivering their payloads to anything but his capillaries (which would be one reason to do it in the first place). I mean, his schtick really isn't helpful against these guys on his own, so he'd probably die anyway, this just seemed an unusual way to go.

Also, since when is the puppet that strong? Both Kiba and his dog are super-charged with some 'savage' chakra that vastly increase the strength of their already impressive muscles, but the guy that uses telekinetic strings is somehow able to move them with greater strength? I'm surprised this guy bothers using puppets at all. If he can move objects with such power, he might as well just use their universe's equivalent of really thin piano wire and move it so fast it could cut through limbs while being barely visible. He could thus have physical 'strings' that most people assume he needs to control and manipulate the puppets by maintaining a chakra connection. If anything, this serves as a layer of deception to his powers that gives him an advantage, as people tend to focus on the puppet as the real threat, only to find out too late that the strings themselves are far more deadly. A rational Kankuro is NOT an enemy I would ever want to be forced to fight, ninja powers or no.

*EDIT* : Also, amazing update to an amazing story. Thank you for continuing this series.

It's not body modification - that would be ridiculously powerful when taken to its logical extreme. I didn't have time to explain it yet in-story, but Choji's technique works by creating a shell of chakra around his body; essentially using a modified version of the shadow clone technique to create a second, larger body around himself. You can see that this is also how it works in canon, like when Choji takes a hit and his giant body 'pops' just like a shadow clone.

Two chapters ago, Naruto and Kankuro discuss the puppet technique, and they mention that it's a two-parter which uses chakra strings to 'project' the puppet technique (this part is also canon, I think). In other words, Kankuro uses chakra strings to cast a kind of spirit-projection technique onto his puppet so that he can move it like his own body, and with much more strength than the strings themselves. Otherwise there would be no point in making a humanoid puppet, just like you said. (Naruto also points this out in Kankuro's fight with Tenten, back in the chunin exams)

You're right that this still shouldn't be enough strength to rip Akamaru apart, but remember that Kankuro's puppet has saws and blades installed. So he did not so much pull the dogs limbs apart as hack them off and then toss them back at Kiba.

I hope I didn't upset any dog-owners with that description. :c

In the case of Sasuke? Well, as the great Emperor Palpatine once put it, "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg14jNbBb-8][POWAH! UNLIMITED POWAH!]]"

Sasuke wants vengeance. He is up against a ridiculously powerful opponent who he *knows* he cannot beat using just his own abilities, so he'll take any opportunity he can get to become stronger. He was perfectly well aware that he was endangering the Leaf in the process, but who cares when it helps him achieve his real goals?

As for Naruto, if you go back two chapters, you can see how he was originally dead-set against the idea only to be played by Sasuke like a schmuck:

#+begin_quote
  “You want to trade techniques with us?” Naruto looked around at the others, searching for any sign that they thought it as mad as it clearly was. “But we fought each other during the chūnin exams. How can you possibly want to trade with us after I ki-”

  Sakura yanked Naruto back by the shoulder, nearly causing him to stumble and fall. “What my friend is trying to say is that we wouldn't want to get you into any kind of trouble. Surely the rest of your Village would not be too happy if you shared your secrets with us?”

  Sasuke and Sakura glanced at each other, though Naruto was honestly not sure what the glance was supposed to convey. His teammates might both consider him ‘unbearably naïve', but when it came to trusting ninjas from a foreign Village whose sibling he had murdered he was hardly about to disagree.

  “All right,” said Sasuke. He turned towards the Sand ninjas. “In that case...”

  “Hold on,” Naruto protested, “this whole meeting was /my/ idea. Don't I get a say in things?”

  “Fair enough,” said Sasuke. “What do you think?”

  “Uhm,” said Naruto, realizing that he now had to come up with an opinion. “I mean, I kinda agree with Hinata-chan that the whole thing seems... weird. But if they really do wanna work with us, it could be a very good thing. Uhm, meaning the benefits outweighs the risk, as long as we don't reveal our biggest weaknesses to them or anything.” He absolutely /had/ to get his hands on that puppet technique, and so did the rest of the group, whether they knew it or not. Besides which, this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity to try and mend the mistakes of the past and maybe even prevent a war in the future.
#+end_quote

As Sasuke hinted at when he was training Hinata, he can get Naruto to take just about any position just by pissing him off and playing on his lingering feelings of resentment, and then taking the opposite position:

#+begin_quote
  The illusion crossed its arms. “I refuse! I stubbornly refuse to follow your perfectly sensible suggestion even though it's exactly what I would have done anyway. But since I know that's what you would /expect/ me to say I'll instead do the exact opposite of what I just said purely out of spite. So there!”

  “See,” said Sasuke, “that whole process would have taken a lot longer with the real Naruto. I think I keep making him too self-aware by accident because he has access to my brain instead of the noodle-fuelled mush inside of his own skull.”
#+end_quote

Add in a little Sharingan genjutsu like you saw in the last chapter, and yeah, Sasuke can pretty much play him like a flute.

***** Shadow clones can also hit things! Sure, you can damage your knuckles punching someone, but it hurts the other guy a lot more or else you wouldn't be doing it. Also, there's a reason why NTBS!Choji prefers to increase the size of his weapons instead of making his entire body a bigger target: If you have your technique take on the properties of hardened wood or steel rather than flesh, it's much less likely to get damaged and therefore disrupted. Naruto also prefers to have his clones fight by using techniques or throwing explosives for exactly that same reason.

It's also possible that your technique is less likely to get disrupted if you know its about to get damaged, because you can adjust the flow of chakra accordingly: I.e. when one of canon!Naruto's clones intentionally gets stabbed to trick the enemy into thinking he's the real one.

Still, this is one of those situations where one has to wonder why they had such a limited variant of a technique, and why it wasn't developed to be more useful. But that's on the original show. I can accept this explanation, it makes sense.

  You're right that this still shouldn't be enough strength to rip Akamaru apart, but remember that Kankuro's puppet has saws and blades installed. So he did not so much pull the dogs limbs apart as hack them off and then toss them back at Kiba.

This explanation, not so much. It is still predicated on the assumption that projecting chakra at a distance and enhancing the puppet will provide /more/ strength than an already physically strong opponent using chakra to boost their own muscles /directly/, which seems really hard to believe.

There was also no 'hacking' or 'sawing' going on in the original description. Within an instant, he was drawn and quartered before he had time to mount any sort of response whatsoever. It seems rather unbelievable, honestly, especially as this requires Kankuro's projections to be both faster and stronger in actions than Kiba's. It's your story and all, I just find it really hard to believe that it would be done so quickly and effortlessly.

I can picture the entire battle in my head as I read it, but this part always just brings me right out. Still, it's your story, and my nitpicks don't mean I don't appreciate it. I enjoy the rest of it immensely and its been a great read, so thanks for that.

See, I guess I get the Sasuke thing, he just seems super reckless about it. If I simply go with him not being a Rational character (or one whose failed at a key calculation), then it's less of an issue. He's in a hurry and wants his power now, and really doesn't care who else suffers for it. So I'm good with that, because it makes sense with the character development he's gone through.

I just don't get why Naruto has all the same emotional and inferiority baggage as the original. He's supposed to be the Rational protagonist, and he's overcome some of his other issues while logically having others (his drive to learn more about the system tends to blind him as to many of the implications, and he rarely pays attention to the complexities of social interaction), but this version has the same fears and neuroses toward Sasuke as the original. And it doesn't quite make sense to me as to why. Why does he have these negative feelings toward Sasuke in this version?

***** Kankuro's puppet doesn't have to be faster than Akamaru in order to take him down with blades, first off the puppet is probably strong enough to take a hit and keep going so even if Akamaru got some good bites in before the blades came out it wouldn't make a difference. Secondly the puppet is not a human, the blades that cut apart Akamaru wouldn't come from the arm area, where they would have to move a sizable distance before they could help, the blades would come straight out of the chest area, barely having to move at all before they could take Akamaru out.

Your other point about why R!Naruto made such a stupid mistake is pretty interesting. Firstly Naruto hates Sasuke here because during their spar way back in the first few chapters Sasuke was pretty sadistic towards Naruto. That kind of intentional infliction of pain is the sort of thing that colors your opinion of someone forever. The reason why the hate is so deep is because despite it being clear to Naruto that Sasuke is a psychopath, no one else takes his concerns seriously, even when theyre presented with the same evidence. Because of Sasuke's ability and predilection to manipulate people, and due to Naruto's experience in the land of waves where he took Sasuke's stated motives at face value and got burned for it, Naruto is subconsciously assuming everything Sasuke says is a lie intended to manipulate him, if he were doing this consciously he would realize that reverse psychology is a possibility, but this is just a dumb reflex Naruto learned after things going horribly wrong every time he took Sasuke's advice, so right now he's pretty easily manipulated.

The other reason why both R!Naruto and R!Sasuke were okay with the sand technique trading scheme is that while it is very dangerous and probably a bad idea, I don't think it's as bad an idea as you seem to think it is. They clearly prevented the sand siblings from looking at every technique they shared, unless more trades happened off screen the only effect of the trade was that the leaf knew about the chakra string technique, and the sand knew about the poor man's flying thunder God technique. If we look at this fight, I don't think the result would be appreciably different if the sand were turned away. The main reasons the leaf lost this fight was that the sand were prepared, they got knowledge like how to counter Shino and Tenten, not from the technique sharing but from the chunin exams, and shikimaru used all his actions to stop Tenten from doing stupid shit. I mean in this fight most of their opponents werent even a part of the technique sharing session.

Cheers, I really appreciate the feedback. I did actually worry in this part that I was doing a disservice to the characters by having them beaten so easily, but I kind of figured I needed events to happen quickly to keep that saw shock value of Shikamaru losing his allies one by one right in front of him. So maybe I do need to edit that passage to make it more clear what's happening.

In my defence though, I also think its easy to forget how scary Kankuro was in the first half of Naruto - he literally slaughtered every opponent he fought the second they came within melee range of his puppet:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTHgHKAUMUI&feature=youtu.be&t=50]]

He even managed to beat Shino to a draw, and Shino had a perfect counter to his chakra strings AND he had already managed to place a queen on Kankuro before the fight started. The Sand Siblings were no joke.

For the rest, @GreatSwordsmith pretty much has it right. The characters in NTBS may be smarter than in canon, but they're still human: Sasuke is traumatized and cannot think clearly where his brother is involved - Itachi is even scarier than in canon and unlike in canon Sasuke *knows* how utterly outmatched he is. So he's desperate. Naruto is indeed driven nuts by the fact that everybody in the Village dismisses him out of hand, even when he is repeatedly proven correct like when he said there was a war coming, while the guy who tortured him in chapter one pretty much gets a free pass for everything he does. Naruto's resentment to Sasuke went up to eleven though because Sasuke mindraped Hinata, who was one of Naruto's only childhood friends, and the only person who ever expressed something like romantic interest in him. So yeah, Naruto has every reason to be pissed off.

It's funny though: I originally intended this to be a lesson for the audience to show that just because a character really *feels* unreasonable because nobody listens to them in-universe doesn't mean they actually are. Instead, however, I ended up learning the lesson that anything that is not made explicit in-universe is assumed not to be a thing: I.e. if Naruto is called stupid by other characters, then the reader will assume that he is in fact stupid unless stated otherwise.

​

Edit: I have now changed the passage to the below. Hopefully this will make it more clear what is going on:

#+begin_quote
  The pair circled their enemy with perfect synchronicity, Kiba pouncing towards Temari while Akamaru leaped onto the back of Kankuro's puppet and began to tear into its wooden frame. Before Shikamaru could react the top half of the puppet spun around and its four bladed arms each grabbed hold of one of Akamaru's limbs. There was a sound of whirling blades as the wooden arms spun in four separate directions, and with an almost casual motion tossed four separate bundles of crimson fur back at Kiba.

****** Oh, I'm not saying Kankuro isn't a badass. He's my third favorite character in the entire series, and I do love watching him win. It was just odd that it was so easy and fast against Akamaru when it seems that, realistically, it wouldn't be. Even the change doesn't really address that.

The puppet has more than just the four arms, right? Maybe something along the lines of "four of its arms grabbed hold of one of Akamaru's limbs, mechanisms locking into place with an audible /click/ while both body and limbs extended blades. Akamaru struggled with the restraints for a moment and had just begun to howl in fury before being silenced by the sounds of whirling blades and tearing flesh as the remaining limbs spun in different directions. With an almost casual motion, the bloodstained puppet tossed four separate bundles of crimson fur back at Kiba"

I can't really see it doing what was said with just its four arms, but if they /also/ work as manacles to hold an enemy for capture while the other limbs can be used to kill them?

I'm cool with the characters all being 'smarter' but still limited in their views. I didn't even really think of how the trauma would affect Sasuke beyond the 'power at all costs' bit, but with or without that, he's working exactly true to both character and how one could assume he would react.

I never assumed Naruto was not smart. If anything, he's very smart, he's just bad at expressing it, and social skills in general. It just seems odd to me he still has the 'hate Sasuke' fixation carried over from the anime, or is somehow angry at the entire village after all this time to where he can be manipulated.

I had figured the 'killing Gaara' moment was a major character building part for him where he realized that not only do the 'adults' understand exactly what he is saying, but they see it as a desirable goal, and why even normal people wouldn't want to accept what he says. They don't want to listen, because if they accept it, they will be killed.

I don't know, I still like it, and still enjoy the story, it just seems like he's backslid a bit from where he was. The logical conclusion to "the entire nation, if not world, is set up as to such a way that magic-using child killers is a desirable or necessary outcome to survival" isn't to rage at random people for not listening or enabling it, but to either find a way to survive, adapt, or change it. Or, you know, at least rage at the people who perpetuate the system from above within limits that don't get you killed.

Still, love the story, please write us more!

*EDIT*: OK, I have to point out one other, very good thing. I like to focus on storywriting and the flow of it, Properly laid hints or details that later come to fruition are the signs of good storytelling, and they are a joy to see.

So when I read /this/ at the beginning:

#+begin_quote
  " In truth, they should not even be wearing those jackets: Their team had failed the chūnin exams miserably, and all of Shikamaru's supposed genius had done exactly nothing to change that. But in the end, family ties and politics had achieved what genius could not.
#+end_quote

And then saw the result at the end? *VERY* well done. He was proven correct, that such a decision to 'pass' them was foolish, and it was shown in the most brutal of ways. Properly foreshadowed, demonstrated well, and makes good logical sense.

I love this stuff, and find it often in your stories. Thought I should bring that up.

**** Huh, I was under the impression that Naruto was willing to go through with the risky play in order to get his hands on the chakra strings technique.

***** Well sure, that's the reason as far as he's concerned (that and trying to fix his mistake of killing Gaara). However, that doesn't change the fact that he was staunchly against the idea until Sasuke took over his whole enterprise and was about to decide the matter for him :P

****** Its weird that he sees it as a mistake. At least in the fight, he came to the realization that he was really given no choice, and it seems he accepted that. I give it a pass since he is a child who just killed someone, and all that, but from his own perspective at the time--as well as an outside perspective or rational one, he made the right choice.

******* Naruto was not wrong from a moral perspective - he certainly had every right to defend himself after Gaara tried to kill him in Jiraiya's apartment, and even before that it was clear that Gaara was a psychopathic lunatic. But Naruto definitely made a mistake in the sense that he never considered the political ramifications of killing the Kazekage's son. And more broadly speaking, he was foolish for even entering into a fight with a psychopathic lunatic in the first place, especially considering he had no real plan for what he was actually going to accomplish there.

******** Political ramifications?

Did no one consider the political ramifications of allowing the Kazekage's son to murder children of ninja families in the Leaf village on a lark during what was supposed to be a non-lethal tournament? Did everyone go into that going "Nah, this is totally cool, let's let him kill our kids for no real gain"?

Because it looked to me, whether you wrote it that way or not, like the Hokage (and Leaf Village leadership in general) was totally cool with it... like having Naruto kill Gaara was the *ONLY* politically acceptable solution, as they were both Beast hosts and the descendants of village leaders. If some common kid had done it, there'd be an uproar, and if no one had done it, Leaf would be out quite a few ninja and possible heirs.

Naruto stepped up to the plate because he knew he was the only one /capable/ of stopping him in that scenario, and because (more importantly to him), he thought maybe he could talk Gaara down or knock some sense into him. He was at least trying to be rational. I'm good with that, as I'd much prefer him to be rational that politics-savvy.

*** A powerful enough poison can kill with a drop, altering his size wouldn't help with such a large dose; and there's such a wide variety of ways they can mess up your body it's unreasonable to expect anyone but a medic who could modify every metabolic process on the fly (which would be an insane amount of skill) to become immune to all poisons.

** Oh- I just realized the potential consequences of the jutsu exchange if anybody makes the connection between Naruto hosting it and the Sand Siblings being there and part of it Shikamaru was surprised to see them there, so perhaps the clans weren't aware of the Sand Siblings' participation... Naruto could get in some serious trouble
