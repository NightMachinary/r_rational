** I'm assuming this is an alternate universe version of Cincinnati that has this restaurant, because I've never seen it in the city, and it honestly sounds a bit adventurous for Cincinnati cuisine, but I don't necessarily have a better suggestion that isn't just a major metro city like New York or Chicago.

*** Alien Eats does not exist (same goes for the Grand Star of Kuwait, shown in the previous chapter).

**** Alien Eats is the most Peter Watts-y concept I've read outside a book that wasn't written by the man himself.

***** What? Really? Well, I can't claim much credit for it. Invasivory is an actual practice. The only bit that I added was realizing that it would make for a really neat restaurant.

I'm glad that you like it though.

It's got that same feel of some bizarre, futuristic pop-culture you'd get by boiling down cyberpunk into crusty bits.
