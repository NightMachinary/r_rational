** Hey everyone! I also put this in the Discord

Years and years ago I happened upon Orson Scott Card's Intergalactic Medicine Show, a scifi/fantasy literary e-zine that was full of great stories. My very first issue had my favorite story, and I've been sitting around for years occasionally lamenting how I couldn't talk with anyone about it.

Well, the IGMS facebook page just mentioned that they opened the entire library up for free, and what better way to let people know than sharing this little story with an idea that I thought [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would eat up: *Tediomancy!*

*** Ferrett's a fantastic writer, and he actually has a trilogy that expands on the idea (though not tediomancy exactly, the lead is a bureaucromancer).

Flex, The Flux, and Fix is a series that can accurately be described as Unknown Armies meets Breaking Bad.

** It mentions intent. Will it work if he has a goal in mind? Or does it require the creation to be the goal in and of itself? No external connections, thought boiling down to a set of actions, perfectly aware, choosing, again and again, the same choices, not repetition precisely but a single event that just happens to turn up several times over time. Like how people can live the same day for years. Does it just apply to objects? What about other sorts of repetition? Does it have to be the same person if the next's is faithfull enough? How old can they be? Can the oldest even be stopped? How has it affected human nature? Evolution? Those who do something well again and again are highly respected after all.

*** If these rituals can be passed down then a prime suspect would be [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffington_White_Horse]] sometimes frequently, sometimes rarely people of one sort or another have been placing and pounding chalk in the same pattern with care and focus for millennia. Though people haven't always been consistent, there have been attempts to change the pattern, would the pattern flow cleanly over these interruptions.

** Reminds me of mundane skills in Worth the Candle that have supernaturally powerful effects once they're high-level enough, like carpentry or the farmer that was mentioned once.

** The effect here is great; both demonstrating boring writing whilst, somehow, being compelling. The hook of magical bookcases being buried under the insistence of telling the story chronologically supports the protagonist's qualities rather than detracting. I want to keep going, even if it seems off.
