Examples: Just a Bystander or any Otome/Villaness lightnovels (Even if most of them are not rational). Stories that the MC is against, what in any other book, would be the Protagonist.

One hilarius idea could be a story where the MC is a Warlord in Terra, trying to stop the Emperor.

The theme is exactly what you are asking for, and I haven't noticed anything in the story so far that would disqualify it from counting as Rational.

**** My problem with this story(at 1.29) is how pathetically small scale/time he is being the chosen hero of one of the worlds largest pantheons. As a hero he was growing steadily in personal strength and power which I loved and then it suddenly pivoted to base building/micro management. I don't mind the base building but all of the things he is implementing or doing will never affect him in a global scale(debatably). Basically feels like a filler arc.

** [[https://archives.erfworld.com/][Erfworld]] features a protagonist who gets summoned into a fantasy wargaming world to bail a side that's down to just their capital city, having angered a bunch of other sides into trying to wipe them out.

In this story, Fate is an invisible but very active participant, using Predictamancy and Luckamancy to serve its own inscrutable ends. The characters talk and philosophize about it with a depth I haven't found anywhere else.

Fair warning: the comic was discontinued a couple of years ago. But there are six books worth of excellent storytelling. It's one of my favorite stories anywhere.

***** Personally, I got through the second volume. And while I enjoyed parts of it, the use of meta-narrative concepts to resolve conflict sorta turned me off.

It's clever in its own way, but sometimes feels too convenient for me. Something about a story that's too aware it's a story kind of ruins things for me. It's almost the opposite of why I read rational fiction, in the way that it relies on nonsense rules to deliver some of its biggest moments. To be fair, those nonsense rules are at least consistent and are exploited in interesting ways. But there's only so many times something silly like "The rule of threes" can come into play before it makes the world feel like a silly place to me.

****** Eh, to me all magic systems are arbitrary and fairly silly to begin with. I enjoy reading about them so it's fine, but I fail to see any significant difference between "this character can bend reality because they lost twice earlier" and "this character can bend reality because they drank mercury earlier." Mistborn is loved by many for a reason, but you have to admit that the premise of eating a bunch of metals, some of which are toxic, to gain magical powers is pretty silly.

Read (or drop) whatever you like for whatever reason you like obviously, but for me as long as it's consistent and engaging I'll roll with it.

******* Yeah, that's fair and i see where you're coming from. It just requires greater suspension of disbelief for me when the magic is meta-narrative based.

I think it's because of the complexity of an idea like "the rule of threes". Whith something like Mistborn you can write metals granting supet powers off as some weird property of their reality. Once you get pass the initial silliness, it's almost like science the way each metal interacts with the world.

The rule of threes is more messy. Because you can't really treat it like a science. It's not direct cause and effect. It's more like some invisible hand is guiding events to reach certain outcomes. And in order for those outcomes to consistently stay the same, That invisible hand must be constantly working in ways unseen.

It makes the magic feel more like another character, rather than a natural process that exists in the world. And i think i wouldn't mind this if the character's thoughts, motivations, and limitations were explored in greater detail, but (at least in the first two volumes) that character is ill defined, despite how important they are to the events that unfold.

It's almost a litteral Deus ex Macina (sorry for spelling. On mobile). Though it's better than that, because at least the characters are aware of it, and deliberately exploit it.

******** I mean the meta magic /is/ a part of the reality. In Mistborn, you eat mercury and get powers. In APGTE, you lose twice and win once. It's cause and effect, this thing happened so this other thing must happen. It works like how gravity works in our world.

I can understand it turning you off though, it's a difficult concept to properly pull off without coming off as too smart for its own good. And it certainly toes the line between cheeky and irritating. It's an overall great novel though and the other meta magics aren't nearly as forward as winning after losing twice if that's what turned you off from the novel.

*** I'd like to second this rec. Reverend insanity has the most self-consistent world building I've ever seen in any xianxia. Fair warning though, the mc's fight against Fate doesn't start until the chapters hit 1000. For the majority of the first and second books, the mc isn't even aware of the existence of fate, much less the manipulation of fate. The concept of “fate” is masterfully interwoven with the world's canonical history, which is revealed in snippets throughout the entire work as passages from the world's scripture. Overall amazing read, translations are understandable, but the work is on indefinite hiatus at 2200+ chapters

**** It's also got the standard xianxia problem of the main character has no motivations beyond the continual pursuit of power and additional lifespan, and is also basically an amoral monster (minor spoiler: Literally murders a woman who falls for him because she's inconvenient, feeds a young girl to a bear for a minor offense, etc. It's not bad, and it's definitely cleverer than comparable works like I Shall Seal the Heavens, but don't expect character development. Also the fact that all his male rivals end up either turning into woman or being revealed to have been women all along is kinda weird.

***** You're right that it's made abundantly clear from the beginning that the mc is unapologetically evil, so for potential readers, if you expect a hero turned anti(fate) hero maybe pass this one up.

I agree that the mc's reasoning behind his pursuit for eternal life is not made clear at the beginning, but over the course of all 2200+ chapters the motivations behind his actions are gradually explained. The lack of character development in the mc is made up for by the sheer complexity of the mc's initial character, which is gradually revealed in flashbacks over the course of the novel.

Additionally, there is a huge cast of supporting and secondary characters, so some of them are inevitably less well constructed than others. The minor trope of genderbending can be off putting at first, but due to the general lack of focus the novel places on romance, it doesn't really detract from the overall plot.

I think it's a deconstruction of a number of mistakes even rationalist stories often make. People don't forget what others have done, people question whether a given means was really the only way to achieve a certain end or merely the most convenient. Morality does not adhere to what side you're on, often bad people work in the name of good causes and good people do good in the name of flawed ones. I think it's a good idea to read it.

Well. In another universe, one with magic, the protagonist would have starred in /Luminosity/. In this story, Tyler's van slips on the ice in Forks High parking lot and there's nobody to rescue her. Instead of dying though, she finds herself as the Summoned Hero in a world where everyone knows that means she's responsible for fighting the Demon Lord.

She would really rather not.

Her companion would, in a universe with different magic, have been raised by a biochemist and star in another famous work of rationalist fiction. His magical school nonetheless features a remarkably confusing headmistress and an incredibly competent professor/mentor.
