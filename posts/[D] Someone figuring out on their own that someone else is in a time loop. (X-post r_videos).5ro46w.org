** There's plenty of ratfic and semi-ratfic with someone time-looping and purposefully convincing others of this fact. But the only instance of an outsider figuring that out on their own that I have witnessed is a single ancient and alien spirit doing so.

Mostly I just posted this here because I thought the whole video could lead to several interesting discussion though.

*** Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: Endless Eight.

Eight episodes of the same shit happening, and the main character /eventually/ realizing that he's a bystander in a timeloop. Although to be fair, he does have the advantage of being able to feel that /something/ off is going on.

Edit: Also... Melancholy isn't exactly rational, although I think I can fairly say that the main character is at least /sensible,/ even if he's probably not explicitly /rational./

**** Endless eight, I should think, is rather specifically non-rational. Whereas the series in general is indeed sensible, EE appears to be an exercise in doing the least useful things possible.

In all loops, characters have a good idea of what would end the cycle, but not how to achieve it. They also have access to an individual with persistent memory across resets, perfect recall in general, the ability to edit reality as code, and no particular inhibition to use these powers when specifically requested. Yet, no serious attempt whatsoever is made to utilise any of these resources, for the duration of the arc.

Not by /any/ means.

From a conversation with my girlfriend, when I binged the series:

#+begin_quote
  in the latest display of "making up the rules as we go along, even if they ignore previously established rules," we find out, two episodes before the finale, that "battle magic" is really hard to do, and unless you've meditated daily for ten years you can only do it in extreme situations

  even though, 1) battle magic seems to consist just of telekinetic blasts, and there's a whole fraternity of telekinetics, *whose members include several of the main characters*, and 2) two of the characters previously used battle magic in an earlier episode and nobody saw fit to even *mention* "wow this was crazy you normally can't do it, must have been extreme for you"

*** I can recommend a work where this happens if you don't mind the fact that just knowing it happens is a bit of a spoiler. (The POV character is the looper, so the fact that time travel is happening isn't a spoiler in itself.) Do you want the name?

**** I appreciate the recommendation, but had a quick question for you.

I haven't ever read a Naruto story. I generally have very western themed preferences, the translated works I have read are generally too large of a cultural gap for me to bridge. Do you think the story would be hard to recommend to someone like me?

****** Seconding this. The only experience I had with Naruto before reading this story was watching some of the first few eps years prior, and I still really enjoyed it. Just be aware that a "jutsu" is essentially a magic spell. Google any terms you don't recognize (genjutsu = illusion spells, taijutsu = mundane fighting techniques, etc.), and you're good to go.

I will warn that there's some sexual scenes that might put some people off. It's not the main focus, but it's there.
