** Contingent upon if you weren't you and were replaced with a replica of you who was identical to you in terms of intelligence, mentality, and shortcomings with the sole exception of being injected with endless motivation for maximizing the human existence...

The overall goal is straightforward: Make lots of money and use said money to maximize human existence. Whether the money is through hiring other individuals or direct donations to organizations that align with your cause it doesn't really matter. Money makes the world go around and this includes any efforts of philanthropy. Everything requires money. I say money is the goal due to you currently not possessing any unique intelligence or specialized skills such as being a cancer researcher or once in a century intelligence.

So, how do you go from where you start to making lots of money? Slowly and methodically over time. You have 25 hours a week and you've already budgeted time outside of this 25 hours for establishing and maintaining friendships and relationships. So spend the 25 hours to learn a skill with the $180 budget.

Usually, time spent to maximize your primary income is the best way to maximize your income for the spent time. However, there's likely quite a hard cap on how much and how fast you can rise through the ranks as a manual laborer. So the 25 hours should be spent learning a new skill which would eventually replace your primary income source. Whether it be programming, business, or some other trained skill, you would select a profession which gives you a reasonable expectation of stable increasing trajectory of making more money.

Eventually with said accumulated money, you would either invest it to make more money, buy real estate, or something else. But the point is to spend your 25 hours trying your hardest to maximize your income. At a certain tipping point, you would start hiring or start donating your money. It really depends on how much you can make. If you become mega-rich, then you have a personal political influence. However, this is unlikely. The more likely conclusion would be being within the realm of a millionaire. There's... not a lot a millionaire can do. But there's also a lot a millionaire could do.

However, you've also mentioned that you suffer from "occasional crippling anxiety and self-doubt under pressure." Which would surely hinder your efforts to maximize your income. Thus you would initially spend a portion of the 25 hours attempting to fix those issues. Whether through therapy or self-help or putting yourself into uncomfortable situations where you conquer your fears. This time spent would be heavier in the beginning to more quickly put into motion your plan to maximize your income, if not all of the 25 hours and $180 budget being spent in the beginning.

*** I greatly appreciate this detailed response. A few follow-up questions:

- How do I handle the possibility of such a long-term plan to completely fail due to unexpected injury, disease or death? If I die in one year without any actual progress towards the two maximizations (which is a non-zero possibility), only self-care, my utilitarian worth under the proposed value system remains zero. This would be utter failure.

- Any opinions on specific in-demand, scalable and marketable skills that could be self-taught or funded within my budget?

- A great number of capitalist folk attempt to spend their lives making more and more money, whether for themselves, their descendants, or charitable giving. Following from that, a great number of people are /already/ millionaires, or more. What is the opportunity cost of attempting the same long-term strategy as these people, when budget could be spent influencing those who have already done the hard part and accumulated the resources?

If I convince even one multi-millionaire to fund humanitarian efforts to the tune of 1 million or more, I get the /entire/ benefit of this strategy without as much of the above-discussed risk of early death and the general risk of failure in capitalism (which is so common it's essentially ubiquitous, and I have no reason to believe I will be more successful than average, being an average or even below-average intelligence myself).

There are a lot more current millionaires than there are reliable opportunities for me to become one myself, in my quick estimation. It would be more scalable, and once I have one, the infusion of funds allows my efforts to convince others to grow, creating a scalable and even self-sustaining maximizing force.

You weigh the probabilities against expected values. What is the probability of you dying within a year? Within two years? Within 20 years? These probabilities have general answers and more specific answers for yourself. Then multiply that against the measured "good" that you can do, considering each path for your future. Then select the path with the highest expected value. Thus if you /currently had cancer/ and you expected that you would die within a year, then the route of trying to learn a skill to maximize future income would be very unlikely. On the other hand, if you have no health problems and the probability of you living a long and healthy life are high, then taking the route of maximizing income means that the expected good that you can do is higher than the expected good you can do if you continued down the path of manual labor.

I don't recall how to do the math on calculating these expected values but there's a lot of online resources on learning how to do them. And for your hypothetical self, spending the first of the 100 hours a month on learning statistics to calculate the maximized path forward such be the very first step. Planning is always the first step. Sometimes you also have to learn to even be able to plan.

The internet is a free resource where you can learn anything. You can learn to be pretty much anything, learn /about/ every field, and learn about the expected probabilities of advancement. Selecting the best possible path forward would again, fall into the initial research time.

I personally do not know which field would give the best probabilities of advancement as this would also be highly dependent upon your own personal proclivities. As even if you had infinite motivation, a person learns and advances what they like significantly faster than what they don't like.

The first career transition is likely to have significant impact on lifetime earnings potential. But it's also possible to have a transitory first career from which you would generate seed money to transition to a previously unobtainable career (such as learning programming, becoming a developer for 5 years to earn money to go into medical school). Again, this would fall into the initial research phase and would have to be weighed against each expected value.

I would say, that earning money is *still* the first step. If you achieve financial freedom, or never having to work again, then you free up an additional 45 hours a week that you can spend towards convincing others to part with their money for charitable causes. Again, this goes into probabilities. If you expect to live an additional 50 years, then spending 20 years to achieve financial freedom allows you to spend 30 years at your quoted "I spend around 45 hours per week working" to "convincing others" with an additional 45 hours a week (for a total of 70 hours a week). This would overshadow the 50 consistent years of continuing your current work and spending 25 hours a week of "convincing others."

This to nothing to say of the calculus of the situation. If your expected lifetime changes in 10 years while in the money making phase (say you develop diabetes), then your expected lifetime decreases. But at that point, you can also pivot your plan, as you can "retire" as you don't expect to live as long and don't need as much money. But again, these probabilities of events can and should be calculated at the beginning phase. I know I'm front loading a lot into research, but that's just how it is. Step 1: Learn statistics. Step 2: Apply statistics to probabilities for best expected outcomes. Even if you're not extremely good at math, it's a necessary first step to learn for maximization.

***** I like you a lot. This is exactly the sort of thing I was hoping for with this post, and I once again greatly appreciate your effort in responding.

All I can say is that I will carefully consider these comments.

The only thing I will mention off the cuff is that of the number of people who attempt to reach financial independence /to the level of not working for their income/, I do not think any reasonable percentage of them manage this in 20 years, even if that is their single goal and their primary expenditure of time in the range of 80 hours or more per week.

This could be considered a primary goal of every true capitalist, and I will still contend that that level of success in capitalism is waaaaay more based in starting from lucky circumstances or lucking into opportunities and then capitalizing on that luck with as much effort and skill as possible.

With my meagre 25 hours and $180, there's no way I will manage financial independence in 20 years. 200 years, maybe.

They don't reach it because of spending. [[https://www.thesimpledollar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/earlyRetirementGrid_CORRECT.png][Financial independence can be roughly approximately estimated between spending and earning to years.]] The problem most people encounter is that as they earn more money, they spend more money. So called "lifestyle creep." But an individual can achieve financial independence in 20 years if they continuously cap their spending at roughly 3/5th of their take home income while saving and investing the other 2/5th. Or even faster than 20 years if they don't spend as much.

I don't disagree that luck is the *primary factor* for determining success. Birth is the ultimate lottery. If your mother happened to live in a tiny tribal village in the rainforests of Nigeria, then I don't think you'd even know of the opportunities available, let alone be able to take advantage of them. On the other hand consider X Æ A-12, Elon Musk's son. He's already won the game as soon as he was born. Hard work is a necessary but insufficient condition for success for the majority of individuals. But it's still necessary.

#+end_quote

Again, I would say it's possible. It's even probable. 25 hours a week is enough to learn a skill to transition into a different higher paying career. Again, it's about transitioning and increasing your primary source of income. For a motivated individual, I don't see how they couldn't transition into a higher paying career within 5 years. Then that's 15 years of a high salary and ever increasing pay. If you have /zero/ lifestyle creep, then that's financial independence.

Consider an average manual laborer's salary of $30,000. It's literally impossible for this laborer to spend more than $30,000 a year (barring going into debt, but that's completely unsustainable). If this person transitions into a white collar job, most white collar jobs make a starting salary of ~$50,000. *Very roughly* this is already financial independence in 20 years if this individual does not increase their spending from before they transitioned jobs. Yes, they'll live like they make $30,000 for the rest of their live, but they can stop working in 20 years.

All of this being said, I never mentioned the ease or difficulty. It's all extremely difficult as you'll be constantly putting yourself into situations that you don't want to be in and doing things you don't want to be doing and thus will take *endless motivation.* Which was the very first thing I said.

Planning the path is not hard. Actually walking it is. Most people know what they need to do but lack the motivation to achieve it. For example, I know my path forward to be able to double my income within 5-10 years, but I lack the daily motivation required to put in the focused hours to actually achieve it.

******* I am of course interested in what you believe your path to doubling your income might be (only if you are willing to share). I will look more closely into this concept of lifestyle creep, and see what I can determine from it. It does seem like it would be an obvious effect to see in hindsight, and a difficult effect to avoid in practice for a person with social responsibilities and a career which comes with opulence costs to maintain forward progress and respect within your field.

As for the motivation problem, as you say, that is certainly the difference between this hypothetical person and the real person behind them. Even before the planning phase, training my discipline and my ability to accurately budget and use my resources to /effectively plan/ has been my primary goal for several years, with predictably low levels of success.

******** The path is easy. Work hard and get promoted. Twice. But the path is hard. It requires lots of hard work and putting myself into uncomfortable situations and placing stresses on myself that I currently do not go through. On the other hand, I can take it easy, put in my work, go home for the day, and not worry about work until the next day.

There are a couple of careers in which the presentation of yourself through both expensive cloths and car is actually important, such as being a lawyer. That's not lifestyle creep because those are actual soft requirements of the job. Lifestyle creep is changing nice-to-haves to must-haves. It's buying the artisanal bread. It's going out to dinner every weekend. It's upgrading your 40" TV to the 55" model. It's going to Hawaii for vacation. It's treating yourself to better things when you don't necessarily need it. It's you buying more because you can afford more.

That's just motivation. Doing what you plan to do. Even planning to plan is something that requires motivation. That you haven't done so in years, not to be insulting, is quite slow. It shouldn't have taken you longer than a weekend to get a rough outline of a plan and then another week or two to hammer out the details.

Again, it's easy to say, hard to do. But in terms of *real hours* it actually doesn't take much at all. How long does it actually take to learn about potential careers? Maybe 10-20 hours to find something that's feasible? But those are excruciating hours where you want to be doing anything else.

********* No insult taken at all. I am well aware of a myriad of shortcomings in myself, and those are of course only a subset of the true list. I was probably being flippant, though. I do know how to plan on a basic level, I have made considerable pre-planned progress in improving my mental health over the past few years and I do actually have long-term plans that I am currently implementing. I just know those plans aren't good enough, hence my wondering what people think is possible. I would like to be able to write a realistic character who began in my position and achieved some level of success in these goals.

The difference between then and now is the difference between complete hopelessness / suicidal ideation and a comfortable, forward-moving life that I know I can maintain as long as I am alive and relatively healthy. This was not a sure thing at all only a few years ago.

One primary and remaining reality of my brain function is that those excruciating hours are like literal torture. Maybe I'm just normal, only with very poorly developed coping mechanisms, but good god have I seen other people supposedly go through the same stressors and not react in the same way I do.

Edit: and there is research that increased stress throughout a lifetime leads to a shortened lifespan. So that's a compounding and frightening factor.

Very straightforward - if you have a 10% chance of earning $100, then your expected value is 10% of $100. The tricky parts are (a) estimating those probabilities, (b) making sure that you check all 100% of the timeline (or at least the most probable outcomes), (c) the value of money is /not/ consistent over time ($100 now is worth more than $100 next month - there are more complex formulae that can handle this time-difference in value, but they require predicting the interest rate(s) in advance)

*** For writing purposes, I really really dislike the "hoard X resource" trope; it can be money, time (immortality), influence, etc, but it reduces things to a single dimension that you never have to trade off against.

Money in particular is incredibly multifaceted: it has power because taxes are paid in money. It can operate as a store of time or resources, or be leverage for manipulating even more money. Hoarding it makes sense to a certain point, but not nearly enough to carry a story to the singularity.

**** While I agree that such a singular focus is not interesting for a story, given the constraints this is the answer I came up with (which may or may not be correct).

A story can work around this by tweaking the constraints and/or requirements to diminish the need of a singular resource as the focus.

e.g. This is where flexible super powers come into play. Something like say if OP has the ability to discern the true intentions of any individual. Then OP could work on reliably recruiting individuals to his cause and growing his team through multiple avenues.

Or, say the constraint is not "within his lifetime" but, "I have 1 year to live, what can I do to make humanity better in the time I have left?" Then money would no longer be the focus as it loses feasibility as the means to the goal. OP's impact would be significantly diminished, but it would be significantly more interesting. If anything, the value proposition of taking high risk high reward options actually becomes viable if not necessary. That gamble would add suspense as there's a chance of failure.

That all being said, the core of the matter is that in our society reliable upward social mobility is difficult and not very exciting. The story of an average person's life is not going to be terribly interesting, even if they have a focus of improving humanity. Because the best way (for an average person) is going to be a well trodden path.

**** I think that's a really important point here. There should be a strong motivation to take risks with your existing money. You could play it safe and grow your money slowly, but then you don't have a story, you have a trickle of water slowly grinding down dirt until it forms a stream. Boring. Or you could take a calculated risk, invest $X in a project that might pay off, then be faced with unexpected difficulties that you have to resolve. Bet $X against Nemesis Y that you can do something, and maybe Nemesis Y knows something that you don't.

Or, you might be called upon to spend some to solve Local Area Problem, but it will cripple your income infrastructure. But if you don't do it, people will suffer! Is the long term benefit of your money worth the short term suffering of, say, not replacing the water treatment facility? Can you figure out a stopgap that will alleviate the suffering long enough for you to close the income gap?

If you put off short-term human benefits too long for the sake of amassing great wealth so you can do more good later, is there a point at which you become the very thing you profess to detest, a soulless billionaire who doesn't actually care about improving the human condition?

1. Become one of them
2. Help educate or otherwise support these kinds of folks
3. Draw more of the general public to seek careers in these fields
4. Attract funding for technical organizations working on those fields
5. Get a high-paying job to donate funding to them yourself
6. Improve the public's appreciation for these fields
7. Organize advocacy groups to remove political blockers that prevent the technical pipeline from flowing as quickly as it could

That is the beginning and the end reason for risk mitigation, your last 100,000 is almost worthless compared to the first, the value of money drops off very quickly.

The world as a whole usually doesn't have diminishing marginal returns regarding the moral value of the altruistic the actions that you take, not until you're a huge enough force that the global scale seems small. If you make 30,000 vs 36000 and donate to save 5 vs 6 lives, or if you make 6000 vs 12000 to save one vs two lives, it isn't that the 6th life is less valuable than the 2nd life. No diminishing marginal returns.

If it matters how much of it /you/ control or achieve and you do feel diminishing marginal returns on /that/, then that is different, and a common way to feel - but that is driven by motivations other than altruism.

** A relatively simple, and doable plan:

*Monthly Hero:*

*Each month find ONE person that you could realistically help with their problems*. Rather than going after extremely difficult cases (ie: kids with cancer etc) find someone who's life sucks but can be un-sucked by the efforts of a motivated individual. Then sacrifice 100 hours and 180$ to fix as much about their life as you can. By the end of the month, ask the person to help you out help another person, within their capabilities. If they decline, that is alright.

Example:

June:\\
Betty lives a few blocks from you. She is a 75 year old frail bodied widow. She lives off her meager pension of a former school teacher.\\
100 hours means you have enough time to fix her leaking roof, help her clean out her yard, fix the sink, and un-clutter her phone so it is functional again. Help her connect with long lost freinds from work (if they still live). Assist her in signing off to a Book Club. Drive her to a doctor to see about that knee pain.

July:

Billie is a good kid, but he is not doing very well at school. The combination of being from a very poor home, and a clear case of ADD means he spends more time in detention than he should, and his grades are a forest of Fs.\\
You and Betty can help the kid straight out his grades. You could spend your money to get the kid to a competent doctor to have the ADD medicine prescribed.

August:

Cliff is dying, and that sucks. He has spinal cancer, and there is nothing to be done about it. But he would love it if his final few months were around people, not alone in the hospital bed. Every once in a while you and Betty and Billie can visit him. Play monopoly or something. Cliff has no close family, and a house that will be left vacant. Billie and his Mom live in a single rum slum hole. Can you connect these dots?

** You sound like a clone of me, except slightly younger and with more experience in social relationships with others.

I personally believe that none of the problems currently destroying the biosphere we live in will or can be solved under current economic conditions. Continuing to pump carbon into the atmosphere, plastic into the oceans, and lies into people, is too profitable to a set of people who fully plan to be either dead or on Mars before the seas rise to claim us all, for humanity to stop playing Chicken with Death before it is far too late.

Which means the only way to save humanity is to restructure society and the economy. Unionize your workplace, and have the union give an ultimatum: sell to us, or have your business sabotaged. Restructure your workplace into a democratically owned and operated enterprise (co-ops are, on top of being better at business in every way, also better at environmental stewardship). Convince others in your town to do the same. Get enough unions together that you can run your town independently of the traditional government, and be an example to others on how to do it themselves.

*** Has a peaceful local communist shift like this ever actually happened?

In any case, for my particular situation, effective unions are crippled in my state through right-to-work laws. Anyone I tried to get together would get fired and our workplaces would be immediately filled with scabs. Remember, I live in a college town. A large percentage of the work force are transient 18-22 year olds who aren't going to stay, and next year there will be a new crop of them ready to work.

This might work somewhere else in the USA, but not for me. And I promise you that the methed-up / pill-popping rednecks who constitute the true underclass in my area would start lynching minorities in the streets if they took political power from the bourgeoisie. The previous statement is not a joke, either, it is a realistic expectation.

**** It has worked before. On a more local level, there are loads of worker co-ops all over the country. If you work for, like, Amazon that's obviously way more difficult, but it definitely can be done even in unionbusting states. Hell, the largest worker co-op in the world, Mondragon, was founded in Catalonia (the part of Spain which has always been more socialist) literally during the fascist Franco regime.

As for the rest...yeah. It's a big problem, and I don't have most of the solutions. You could check into union history in your area. The original rednecks were Appalachian coal mine unionizers, after all. Show people that the families they profess loyalty to were more like you than they thought, and some of them might come around.

I know that I'm probably not smart enough to design a realistic character who follows from this prompt, so I'm seeking the input of other writers.

**** it's not you, don't take this personally. the fact of society is that there is literally no meaningful change that you can make in your current circumstances. given that you have stated that you have flunked out of higher education multiple times, and have less than 200$'s worth of assets free each month, literally the most measurable amount of benefit and happiness you can bring to humanity is to yourself. See a therapist- fix your social neuroses, try to advance in your job, find a hobby, find some friends. Rationality does not somehow make you a supergenius capable of ending world hunger. The only person you are capable of helping in any measurable way is yourself. You can increase a single life's quality by incredibly, shattering amounts or donate all of your 180 dollars to some bugnet charity or something and share the equivalent increase amongst dozens of others, which will not be noticeable by anyone. Stop trying to help the world, help yourself if you truly are so utilitarian.

***** Oh, this is perfectly fair.

My past self of only a few years ago is much worse than the mere incompetent wage slave version of me presented in the prompt.

I'm happy (and lucky) to still be alive, and my primary focus in real life will probably have to include a heavy focus on mental health maintenance for the rest of my life. That's just how it is.

#+begin_quote
  I'm more interested in fiction-ready approaches to the problem, things that a normal person probably wouldn't think to do, but a rationalist protagonist in a ratfic might.
#+end_quote

A fictional protagonist will often recognise something /odd/ about the world. Maybe they discover one minor magical ability, have a unique superpower, or begin to gain some form of XP to buy abilities with; they leverage this 'odd thing' and then use it to somehow Win.

A fictional protagonist who obtains None Of The Above still has one thing going for him, though; he is a Fictional Protagonist. This means that he has a /chance/. One of the following two will occur:

- He realises that he is a fictional character, and breaks the fourth wall
- Something drops into his lap, and kick-starts the plot

In the first case, he can try to find ways to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitingTheFourthWall][/exploit/ the fourth wall]], using it for personal profit in some way. In the second case, he can - well - /react/ to whatever kick-started the plot. In whatever way seems most sensible.

--------------

But let's take this on the hardest mode of all - that the plot is kick-started by the fictional character posting a comment on Reddit (or similar) much like the one above, and that the story is the story of how well he follows - or fails to follow - the advice given. In such a case, the optimal path is clear; the fictional character needs to /gain skills/. These skills are then used in some way to advance his agenda. There are many ways to gain skills - and, being fictional, almost any skill that he feels he can gain will be useful /somehow/. Even if they merely increment his potential earnings (which can be pretty powerful on its own).

So, for a fictional character, I'd start be having him take classes - perhaps online classes. Maintain his social relationships, because that's a good way for more Plot to tumble over him; don't go for /massive/ course loads, but just grab the low-hanging fruit that looks interesting, one low-hanging fruit at a time.

The next steps mostly depend on what he has been learning...

** The very highest impact you can have per cost is to go vegan. All it costs is a bit of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X5RyaEDHNq5qutSHK/anti-social-punishment][antisocial backlash]] and the inconvenience of breaking old habits, and you stop 10 years of suffering every year, per person: [[https://faunalytics.org/animal-product-impact-scales/]]

Here is another chart using the same data on the Effective Altruism subreddit: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/EffectiveAltruism/comments/iupktv/costs_in_total_days_of_suffering_and_total_deaths/]]

This also ties into existential risk via the impact on the environment. As an average individual, it's the biggest individual change that can be made to reduce consumption of land, water, CO2 production, and even plastic usage, and beyond the individual scale it is also the biggest opportunity for effective activism: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production]]

*** I understand why this might gain traction in EA circles, but in this case it does not follow the prompt. Human healthy life hours, not vertebrate. It's more important to me to have a robust global agriculture system, with the broadest possible range of calorie sources in case of rice crop failure and such. Any tiny advantage in such a scenario would be preferable to a greater impact on human populations.

I /do/ already support efforts to cut animal life cycles out of meat production and replace them with vat-grown meat, algae farming, insect farming and other non-vertebrate options. Veterbrate suffering is not zero cost in my particular system, but it is considerably lower priority than even a single human life's worth of healthy human life-hours. (Edit: in this vein, I'm also interested in reducing reliance on the big monocrops, creating failure-resistant variants, that sort of thing)

As for the environmental impacts, that very well may be, but the individual effect I might have is so minuscule that I would rather buy bugnets and call it a day. At least with the bugnets I provide a noticeable improvement in life chances for some percentage of people who receive them.

And, for the purposes of this prompt, it simply isn't fiction-ready or sexy enough. Is there anything particularly clever that can be done in this direction?

** If one wants to go this route (get rich to be useful) they would have to be careful of a possible obstacle that is isomorphic to a cognitive bias. (It would be more accurrate to call it a social bias but whatever)

Pierre Bourdieu (french sociologist) calls it "structuring structures". It's the phenomenon where an agent tends to internalize the incentives and utility functions of any system they thrive in.

Imagine a smart idealistic agent that wants to become a politician. They are smart so they do optimal things to be successful. But optimal things often mean lying and empty promises and lots of other compromises.

Soon power is not a mean to an end anymore, but an end in itself. (After all, more power always means more utility, they may rationalize) Before they know it, the game has shaped them into a smart not-so-idealistic-anymore agent.

The same thing can absolutely happen with money - I've seen it happen a bunch of times. Some people even end up working for the very thing they wanted to fight, swearing that soon they will leave and use their money AE-style - but they never do.
