** Second the recommendation. The author even had a one month or so block because the second Grindelwald movie contradicted elements the author planned to introduce; the author said they realised their qualms were silly in the end, but I think that shows just how committed they are to the consistency of their worldbuilding.

*** Harry's situation gets less bleak later on as the plot advances, and there are some moments of levity mixed in.

** Wow, this is really fucking good. Refreshing is a good way to put it. I really like the in-depth approaches to explaining the magic we see in the original series.

I do feel like Harry lacks a lot of agency especially at the point I'm at right now (chapter 32) but I can wholeheartedly recommend the story even with its flaws.

** What's the update frequency? 37 chapters over almost 6 years doesn't seem very fast.

(I'm not one to talk, but...)

*** Over the past year the author has posted about one chapter per month. In my experience that's a rather good rate for a fanfic.

*** The author constantly complains and apologizes about their slow update rate in the author's notes over those six years, so I really don't think this will ever be finished. What's already there is worth reading.

Hey, I do that too! And I'll totally finish! At some point.
