** So, the rules of narrative are in full effect here, right? Malia won the placebomantic duel because she had a cooler speech and origin story than Dylan's. Then she died anyway because Erica had her own dramatic, defiant moment that acted as the culmination of her personal arc. Given that narrative logic is king in this chapter...can we pretty much assume that Mark, the one guy whom we didn't actually /see/ die, miraculously survived?

Also, a lot of people have theorized that Robin West is TOK. Does the reveal that she is in hell--or at least that she was at the time of Malia's birth--joss that theory? Is it possible that she escaped? Does anyone remember what the timeline was re: when she died and when TOK showed up?

*** To be more specific: Malia won because she managed to present herself as an underdog. Dylan's story makes him come off as a spoiled brat. Given his mastery of the narrative, I'm surprised he didn't realise it.

Now that I think of it, it looks to me as if he actually /wanted/ to die. Remember when he swore the oath to Mark? He didn't hesitate /that much/, and it may have been mostly to maintain character.

Wait... don't we know someone who's tried that before...?

  “Would you like to get this over with and kill me now?” he asked. “Or do we have to do it the hard way?”

  “Good,” said Thamiel. “I like deals. But just so you know, my BATNA is *killing you, wearing your body like a suit, and slowly poisoning the lives of everyone you have ever loved* until they scream for death.”
#+end_quote

Wait, wait, wait...

#+begin_quote
  And all my life, I wanted, needed, to convince people that the world was on fire all around them. *Well, now it's the apocalypse, and I couldn't be happier. And before I walk into the flames with a giant grin on my face*, I'm going to kill the figurehead of the old order, Ms. Follow-The-Rules-And-Ignore-The-Human-Cost herself. So come on. Give me your best shot.

Wait, wait, wait, wait...

  And as the flames climbed high into the night

  To light the sacrificial rite

  *I saw Satan laughing with delight*

So here goes my crackpot theory: Malia's story is true. Thamiel was inhabiting Dylan's body, and wanted to die and get back to Hell; but he also wanted to bring Malia back under his control. For some reason Dylan/Thamiel couldn't just assassinate her on his own; but when he met Erica, he realised she would be capable of doing it. Everything went just as planned.

**** Great point about Malia being the underdog! The Dylan-is-Thamiel theory seems farfetched--I'm not convinced that Thamiel couldn't just kill himself, the reason he wanted Uriel to do it was to make him use up divine energy--but hey, we'll see.

***** After helping Robin summon Thamiel, the real Dylan Alvarez, curious to know what she wanted, decided to summon him on his own. The summoning ritual trapped Thamiel in Dylan's body. Or something.

Yeah, it is somewhat far-fetched. But still, there's something fishy about Dylan being defeated this /easily/.

**** Haha! The thought that Dylan = Thamiel has occurred to me too. Several times. One is a powerful psychopathic terrorist with mastery of names and a talent for lying. The other is also a powerful psychopath who inspires terror with a mastery of names and a talent for lying. Something about the way he manipulates good people into doing evil things on his behalf and being stuck serving him whether they want to or not...coincidence?

**** The timing might just work then, assuming that TCK died not too long after TOK showed up. All we know is that Robin was in hell up to a year after Malia was born. If Malia was born right after Robin died, then Robin could still have returned from the dead as TOK shortly after Malia left Hell. Or am I missing something?

** I don't know how to feel about this chapter. to be honest.

I feel like we've recently gotten a couple of backstory things (e.g. Malia Ngo and part-demons) just thrown at us without sufficient buildup. Maybe it'll make sense in the end, but if there's an eventual rewrite of Unsong then it might be good for some of this stuff to be more spread out.

**** This chapter resolved a lot, but in a somewhat unsatisfactory way... as others have said it felt like we just got an interesting backstory dropped only for the character to get killed off. Dylan also got killed, but he was annoying enough in the first place it felt like we were owed his death as an audience... except he finally got interesting in the chapter or two before he got killed off... so even that felt off.

**** I mean that I don't see how this ties into the main story of Aaron. How does any of this affects the apocalypse that's going on? If the character of Dylan had never been introduced, would it change anything? I'm reserving final judgement until the story is finished, but right now it just feels like we wasted a lot of time the Boojum storyline.

***** Well, Malia and UNSONG were part of Aaron's story, so her death is relevant to him. And Erica was his friend and now she's dead, and weren't they kabbalistically-married-once-removed?

I might just have a different outlook on this, though, because I don't especially care about Aaron or his storyline. I like pretty much every other major character more than I like Aaron. So I don't usually think about plot elements in terms of how they play into Aaron's thing.
