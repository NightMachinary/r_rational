** I don't like this story that much. Nikki is pretty much an infallible genius, which is intolerable. MOR Harry on the other hand has the good sense to fuck up from time to time so that he remains interesting. I mean, you need to have some kind of weakness somewhere that really could lead to your destruction. Even Superman got this right.
