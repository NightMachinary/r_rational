Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So I initially planned to post this to [[/r/MakeYourChoice]], but they don't allow WIP text posts so I'm posting it here.

I've decided to make a CYOA. The general premise is pretty simple, and even kind of derivative: a ROB is going to transform you into something different (in this case, a magical creature), and you have a point-buy system to determine what changes get made.

The twist I'm putting on this is that there's no explicit upper limit to how many points you can spend (although there's the implicit one of there being a limited number of options.) There is, however, a lower limit. This is because points aren't an abstraction of "power used", they're an abstraction of how far from human you've diverged. Meeting the absolute bare minimum point limit means you're basically still human, except with a few quirks of varying in/convenience. Going nuts with points means you've lost much of your humanity, and are subject to penalties inspired by traditional supernatural creatures (i.e., cannot cross running water while conscious.) There's a bit more too it, but I don't want to spoil my own work.

Anyways, is anyone experienced with CYOAs (filling them out or creating them) willing to betaread/test it for me? I'm about halfway done with the specifications document at 2,000 words. My remaining steps are:

1. Finish the last three sections -- I'll need mostly betareading feedback here, plus brainstorming help
2. Balance pass -- betatesting feedback will be necessary here
3. Make the actual visual CYOA image. -- this will mostly just be on me
4. Typesetting pass (reducing sentence wordiness so everything is readable.) -- more betareading.

*** I'd be happy to help beta, though I don't know how truthfully I could be said to be 'experience' with CYOAs per se.

I'm designing play across what I see as the three main play types. The first two types of player shouldn't see /too/ much of a difference with my system, but the third kind (hopefully) will.

- "Risk Adverse" players will minimize their drawbacks, both by picking as few points as possible and by not picking options that have inherent drawbacks. These are going to be the players that want to be a bit more special than in real life, but not so much more special that it's inconvenient.
- "Goal Oriented" players will have a specific task or tasks they want their choices to accomplish, and optimize accordingly. They'll take drawbacks necessary to reach their goal, but seek to minimize how many they take.
- "MOAR POWER" players take as many drawbacks as necessary to pick every option they want. However, CYOAs typically run into a balancing problem where either drawbacks are cheap, so "MOAR POWER" players are perfectly OK taking a whole bunch of options, or drawbacks are too expensive, which makes "MOAR POWER" players not have as much fun because it's agonizing to fit all the stuff they want in their point budget. I'm hoping my system changes that up a bit by not having players worry about a point budget if they're already planning to take a whole bunch of options, but "punishing" them by making them fit in worse with society.

By the way, I've PM'd you a link to the google drive file with the CYOA. I'm mostly looking for brainstorming help and error-fixing during this phase.

** /Out of the Violent Planet/ is a really obscure RPG supplement for the game REIGN, [[http://www.gregstolze.com/downloads.html][available for free here]], about modern-day humanity making first contact and discovering that we are the only species in the galaxy where innate psychic powers aren't commonplace. Aliens don't even have a spoken language.

The ideas are really interesting, but I personally found what I read to be bit shallow in terms of worldbuilding and plot hooks. Aliens have no concept of using tools to kill things because they can just rewrite less powerful minds /however they'd like/ when they're in range, which virtually all humans are immune to. One in a million humans are psychic enough to talk to the aliens, but not immune to mind control.

Psychic power is conferred by a genetic lottery that varies between species, so half the galaxy is ruled by the species that's best at mind control while the other half is ruled by the species most resistant to mind control. Neither have FTL travel or communication technology because some telepaths have interstellar range (more common in the former faction) and others can create wormholes (more common in the latter faction).

Warfare and social organization are described as being based around controlling information and positioning psychics based on their individual power. No one fields armies because that would risk putting more people in range of a stronger psychic, and aliens don't need to group up into large communities when they have dedicated teleporters and transceivers.

That is all the information I found, the book has some more details I considered superfluous, which is insufficient for me to create an interesting story or a fascinating fantastical society on my own. I don't have any plans to do something with this, it's just an oddball high concept I thought some of you would be interested in.

*** I've wanted to do something with /Out of the Violent Planet/ for a while, and I realized that, I think in order to draw the setting out for a broader story rather than just the personal tales of some human schmucks, you need to shake it up.

The two things I've considered focusing on are:

- The proliferation of human technology (and human fighters) in the galaxy at large, and how this challenges the political and socioeconomic status quo. In particular, how the fact that not all species are equally poised to benefit from humans or human technology.
- The way that a human perspective on science and engineering leads to developments in fields of various psychic abilities. Rigorously analyzing what aspects of a species' physiology gives them stronger or weaker talent in a given field, developing cybernetic and organic technologies to simulate or enhance psychic powers, etc.

**** The former is something the game suggested for a plot, there are even references to aliens trying to get human soldiers since we can get close to enemy psychics without getting detected or attacked by usual methods. However, I'm unsure how interactions with these alien mindsets work.

Aside from a suggested plot twist of the aliens developing a gene therapy that can make more humans psychic, the latter is something that the designers seemed to actively avoid. Aliens already know how psychic powers work and developed biotechnology to enhance it.

***** That's fair. The interactions are kind of the point of taking it in that direction. The game goes over the broad strokes of what aliens in general are like, but IIRC it takes quite a shallow take on exploring the particulars of any one species, since for the ordinary game, they aren't supposed to be the main characters.

And, that's true, but. I don't know how to phrase it precisely. The aliens know how psychic powers work, but they don't know /why/ I guess. They can't have applied the same mindset that prompts humans to deconstruct reality and understand not just how it works, but how anything /might/ work. Maybe I am misremembering, but if I'm not, the aliens are characterized as broadly lacking technology beyond the intuitive in general, not just a lack of weapons. It seems like a waste to say that isn't a space, in intersection with psychic powers, isn't something even humans are allowed to explore.

** You're in charge of all firefighters for a city which is primarily built of wood on top of wood pilings in a shallow lake. (Laketown if you know LOTR.)

One day, an allied military command arrives at your town and informs you that your town may soon be the location of a large battle, possibly involving flaming arrows and crude gunpowder weapons.

The ally simultaneously implies that your town will be attacked by a firebreathing dragon in an unrelated incident at an unrelated time, either before or after the large battle.

What are the differences between your dragon-response and battle-response plans? When you receive orders from your local civilian command to not let on that there's a dragon about, how do you disguise preparations for the dragon as battle prep, if that is necessary? And seriously, whatthefuckadragon?

*** I'd start by making sure it was possible to create fire breaks.

On a lake, that means I'd want an ability to pull out a building's pilings and drop it into a canal, if necessary.

To make sure that's possible, I'd have building owners wrap some heavy rope around the top of their pilings and use the rope to anchor some standardized iron rings (/rope loops if iron is unavailable)

Then, issue all of my fire response teams a winch and a 20' hooked pole. If a fire can't be put put, use the pole to hook your winch onto the relevant pilings and bring the building down.

That should keep fire from spreading via contact with adjacent buildings.

The other concern is that fires can spread when burning stuff (/arrows/dragon fire) lands on someone's roof.

To address this, I'd have building owners get a bunch of rolled up reed mats. We'd keep these in contact with the water, just under the sides of the canals

When the fire bell goes off, civilians should get their mats and unroll the damp reeds into their roofs.

*** well, I must say buckykat has the right idea, if battle and dragon means many deaths. I wouldn't leave if it is more likely to survive in the town.

So that said. I would try to make the town safer. Should have done that earlier.

- enforce a minimum distance between buildings if possible, for battle make a ring of houses around the rest, as walls.

- put on every house a big barrel to catch rainwater. To be used for washing and putting out fires. If already there tell everyone to not waste it.

- if possible, use fire-resistant paint, or put mud on roofs or put wet clothes on roofs.

- force everyone to make flightpaths clear, remove textils

- try to make it less likely for dragon/army to attack. Like lights out. Putting candles in buckets and put them in remote but visible area. Send out diplomatic group to find out what we could do, to make peace.

** I hope it's okay to post here even though it's not Wednesday anymore.

How would an intelligent species develop differently under true mind-body dualism? Say that instead of being controlled by a brain, the organism is animated by a complex matrix of magical energies that we'll call the "soul" for sake of discussion. During reproduction, a new soul is created based on the attributes of the soul(s) of the parent(s). Since souls are usually considered eternal, assume that they need no input of energy to keep going.

It might be more appropriate to describe such a creature as two organisms in a symbiotic relationship, with the magic half using the meat half for locomotion and reproduction, and the meat half using the magic half for information processing. I can think of a few consequences of this arrangement off the top of my head.

- The species would be liberated from the huge energy drain that a brain represents, and therefore would have more energy to devote to other things.

** This would make increased intelligence a much more attractive adaptation, since it removes the main drawback.

- There's really no reason for the gradual increase in capability that we see in biological organisms, except maybe learning by experience; such an organism could be fully conscious from budding/fertilization/parthenogenesis.

** Some of this "learning by experience" might even be skipped by souls coming "preloaded" with useful information, though that seems statistically less likely to evolve.

- The creatures would likely be less malleable than humans, not having to worry about brain damage or degenerative neurological diseases but also incapable of making use of mind-altering chemicals (be they psychotropics or antipsychotics).

*** so the soul is the brain. And doesn't need calories. But the soul is still subject of evolution. (honestly, that's not how soul's are supposed to work in mythology, but I can play with that.)

I assume you mean with intelligent species human. Cause elephant bodies or bat bodies would change many things. (Mainly elephants would benefit less, and bats probably more.)

I guess attributes of the soul are something like how nice, how smart someone is and what character they have.

I don't think we would get infinite/super intelligence. Since the species/individuum wouldn't get more information and at some point a higher IQ will not give a better result. Just think you could program a phone to be as good in tic-tac-toe as a super computer. So selection would not prefer higher IQ, but would sort out lower IQ.

The species could be more malleable than humans. If the body/soul connection is easily attacked. Maybe heart massage can't work. Maybe a huge shock (like a dragon looking at me) would mean the soul leaves the body forever. Maybe being depressed is a death sentence.

The only thing that changed, is that the species can outsource the energy cost of information processing. So over a long time it is more likely to have bodily functions reduced and replaced with brain functions, that would normally have higher energy cost. And that only to a finite limit. If hearing isn't selected for, their ears and sound processing will degenerate, since an individuum with bad hearing will be as likely as one with to get children. Maybe no ears is better, since it saves energy. If hearing over 100m distance isn't selected for, they will not hear better than needed.

Like weaker eyes, but better image processing software. Or no eyes instead echolocation (if that is now efficienter).

Let's say they would get the same energy with brain or with soul. They would either store more energy (fat), have a higher population or grow bigger. The last one could increase the avaible calories. (Could get fruits higher up. Kill bigger animals...)

That is called instinct. Toddlers fear snakes, spiders and dark alleys. But not guns. I don't see a reason why that shouldn't evolve similar for them.

So what would change:

They would evolve to have less costs for body functions and instead increase the processing.

They would either increase the population (likely) or get bigger bodies with the avaible energy. If it is the second one, the body change will be exaggerated, since with a changed body they will get more energy than before.

Wouldn't the childhood development stage change too? Or would the gathering information and forming conclusions ultimately end up mirroring a human infant's brain development? It seems like there'd be at least some difference between an infant with a brain that's still developing and lacks even basic self-awareness and an infant who's fully conscious but just very naïve and uneducated.

That's probably a difference that'd manifest more in culture, though, and I'm not sure whether [[/u/SevenTrillionNipples]] meant to include cultural development, or just biological differences. If things like empathy and impulse-control are innate in the soul, children might be held more accountable for their actions. Then there's the fact that just porting in a standard human mind would probably result in everyone being born insane from nine months in a sensory deprivation chamber, though that's just speculation.

If I knew how our brains worked together with the body in detail, I would give options how the mechanics of the soul-body interaction could work. Since I don't know shit about that, I assume it works like brains, except no energy needed.

btw heads could be smaller since there would be no need for big brains (except if they are needed for the connection). And many other little things, that will produce more changes.

** How might an animal lineage evolve if the animal magically doesn't need to eat for energy?

Say that by chance, some lizard is born with a pattern of scales which happens to form a simple summoning circle. It can eat demons, except the demons provide usable biological energy instead of infernal wishes or something.

The lizard and its descendants still have to worry about injury, disease, and eating for non-metabolic reasons. (To grow larger or produce a baby requires matter. Sweating requires water.) But a limitless freely acessible food source is a huge advantage. What kind of selective pressures might that cause?

Some ideas:

Is breathing still important?

Adaptations like large size and high intelligence become more advantageous without an energy tradeoff.

The demoneater lizards would probably be good at endurance hunting.

Arctic environments are less dangerous with the ability to infinitely shiver, but scorching deserts still pose a threat.

Just think wood has the energy, but without oxygen (or another electron acceptor), it wouldn't let the energy free (=burn)

This sort of brings up a separate issue that the body doesn't run on some "pure" form of energy like electricity, so getting it to work without food and/or oxygen is going to require you create physical matter ex-nihilo to act as fuel for the bodies chemistry. Which would of course mean that since it's already creating matter, eating demons should be plenty capable of giving you the matter needed to grow.

What energy do you get from food? Nothing without oxygen. It is the same mechanism. I would say OP doesn't know enough biochemistry to say what he/she means exactly. And yeah, the more you know about body functions, the more you understand, why superpowers couldn't work in our world -.-

Still if we say demonic biological energy is the energy needed to make the right enzymes deform in the right way, we wouldn't need food or oxygen. If we say it is only for those enzymes that need food (fat, sugar, protein) we would have a problem, because there are enzymes that need the degrading(?) products. If those enzymes are also powered by the demonic energy, than we don't have that problem. (But the pH will not be good.)

Which would of course mean that since it's already creating matter, eating demons should be plenty capable of giving you the matter needed to grow.
#+end_quote

Did you meant to say, that we would need atoms to grow in mass? If not why discuss this?

But if you want to bring up a separate issue, make it specific, tell me an example of the bodies chemistry that would need more than pure energy? And why the hell bring it up, where I talked about creating matter? I totally miss the context. If the demon just create food in your stomache and oxygen in your lungs, we wouldn't talk about anything.

  What energy do you get from food? Nothing without oxygen. It is the same mechanism. I would say OP doesn't know enough biochemistry to say what he/she means exactly. And yeah, the more you know about body functions, the more you understand, why superpowers couldn't work in our world -.-
#+end_quote

Yeah this is probably the fundamental problem, that it's super unclear what exactly the demon based energy /does/. If it is supposed to take the place of food then it would serve as a magical nutrient IV which would not negate the need for air but would also negate the need to ever consume extra mass.

On the other hand having the power just "make the right enzymes deform in the right way" instead of inputting any matter (which seems to be your interpretation) seems vaguely plausible but would likely have more wide ranging effects than negating the need for oxygen or food.\\
For instance a normal circulatory system would be unnecessary and if you're just telekinesis'ing chemistry into doing what you want then it's easy to imagine that there would be little need for many organs. So it's increasingly easy to imagine that the creature would probably evolve to be a herbivore (since energy density of food is irrelevant) or even just evolve to eat dirt. Similarly since energy isn't a constraint it seem rather inevitable that it will evolve to be extremely fast moving and likely evolve to fly as well (unless it evolved other defensives first). Then if its offspring only need relative safety and some dirt to grow then it would be incentivized to go for an extreme R-type reproductive strategy..

So it seems like freed from needing external sources of energy the lizards would evolve into (potentially flying) swarms that would pretty much overturn the whole ecosystem by consuming all the topsoil (or just causing sinkholes due to constantly tunneling through the ground laying eggs and eating dirt) and over long enough timescales could threaten basically all other life on earth.

*********** Yeah, many things would change. The circulatory system could still be needed if there is only one organ that converts the demonic energy.

Since I assume OP wanted a possible evolution path for dragons from lizards, I tend to answer most question that come up in a way that would make dragons more likely.

As long as the dirt has carbon atoms and the lizard can digest them, that should be fine. The lizards probably will not be eating trees, since the cellulose will not be able to be broken down. (And since dragons don't eat trees, they will likely not evolve that, unless OP changes that. The same for dirt.)

Well, we assume it gets unlimited demonic energy. It will probably move faster, but there could be limits how much demonic energy gets transferred. Since dragons are normally killing sheep and cows, I would say they should still need external sources of energy (besides demonic energy). Maybe they evolve slowly to have better summoning circles to get more energy.

I still see not a clear way to make the lizards fly unless we start with a small gliding lizard. And the demonic energy is causing more mutations. And the selection is more based on being able to run away for a million years.

Breathing fire could be just throwing up demonic energy. Or an unwanted product that burns with oxygen contact. And after some generation evolves into fire-breathing.

*** You might find [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUWUHf-rzks][this]] relevant.

Based upon that, I'd predict that the lizard evolves to be a lot smaller: higher energy dissipation per mass, and faster reproduction when mass is the only limiting factor. Further, I'd expect it to paradoxically grow very slowly and take its time reproducing. Without the necessity of eating for food energy, the lizard expands into areas like deserts, where encountering something edible is rare. It can afford to wait a long, long time between meals.

Its ideal environment might be deep in the ocean, actually. It could swim around vigorously to look for things to eat despite food being otherwise quite uncommon.

On the other hand, it doesn't /have/ to wait a long time between meals. It might drive all other life extinct by eating everything in the oceans, and everything else for that matter.

*** Argh, its complicated, because we/lizards use the Electron transport chain. Basically, we use food (sugar) as electron donor and oxygen as electron as acceptor. And the flow between them powers our system. The chain is basically a number of enzymes that use one reaction (sugar breaking down) to power another one (NAD^{+} to NADH and AdP to ATP) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme#Induced_fit_model][mostly by the enzyme binding with one of the substances and because of that deforming and that presses molecules together]]. I think some hydrogen atoms go from the sugar into other molecules (like NAD^{+} ). But from there they go sometime later to the oxygen. There are also some enzymes that need O2 react to H2O, so it can pump H^{+} ions around.

1. If the demonic energy acts as electron donor (and the chemistry still functions), it wouldn't need to eat. The lizard would still need oxygen (or something else) as electron acceptor. But we would have a problem since we would need the hydrogen atoms for producing water and our cell would get a higher pH (because OH^{-} gets produced) which messes with reactions. (The body can buffer that, but not forever.)

2. If it acts as acceptor (and the chemistry still functions...) Long story short we should end up with too many H^{+} ions. which messes again with the pH of the body. The lizard would still need food for energy and water. But doesn't need to breath.

3. If the demonic energy acts as the reaction powering the enzyms. There shouldn't be any molecules be overproduced. It could still happen, that some functions are limited (for the first 100k generations), because some reaction need temporary atoms from the food (sugar, protein, fat) or it needs the oxygen for some enzymes that aren't powered by the demonic energy. But evolution would produce fast (I would guess in 10-100 generations) lizards that have a big reservoir of the chemicals needed.

So I think case 3 has the best potential to produce a lizard that doesn't breath without messing other stuff up. By the way we regulate the pH of our body mainly by breathing. (H2CO3 goes to CO2 and water and H2CO3 acts as pH buffer) But in all cases it should be possible. Even in case one, something else could act as electron acceptor. And since demonic energy could be a stronger electron donor than sugar or fat. That would mean more stuff would be forced to accept electrons. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity][Look up electron negativity and redox reactions]]

There are still bodily functions that use up specific molecules. I think the brain needs some amino acids (protein). That would be still needed to be eaten.

Some other cool stuff that could happen:

- The lizard could evolve to produce sugar and fat from the CO2 from the air and water from drinking. Like plants. It wouldn't really need new biological processes, since each biological reaction is reversible (but we/they evolved to minimize the reverse reaction). They would just need a high concentration of the products (which is normally kept low) and a low concentration of the starting chemicals. Proteins are more complicated. They need Nitrogen and not many things can use N2. (With the right materials, they could still build all aminoacids and then protein the normal way.) But they would still need to breath and have an atmosphere around.

- They evolve so they only need food for growth. (For eating they would probably still need to breath oxygen.) They would evolve to have a closed system that they feed demonic biological energy into and get mechanical work (muscle movement) back. They could live in space or an 'closed' system. (not really closed, since they would get demonic energy.)

I hope I could explain it to you, why it doesn't have an easy answer. Just for the end: We only need to breathe, because we can't store enough oxygen. If we used a solid/liquid electron acceptor we could walk around without breathing. Just keep in mind we would need to store it too, like electron donors (fat).

Now what would mean free energy for the lizard?

- It could waste energy for defense (like fire breath) and running away (flight)

- nearly everything that it eats will be used for growth, making it big, and it wouldn't care, cause it can't starve, only stagnate and being big means, nothing will eat it. (except other lizards)

- it couldn't be fat, since energy reserves are not needed and also no insolation. (except the demons cut it off) (maybe it has other reserves for molecules it needs.)

- If it has to live in hot environments, it could use energy, so it can cool itself like a freezer. (Have a closed air bag organ/lung. Compress it with muscles -> compressed air gets hot. (lets say 90°C) -> cool the bag with outside air to outside tempreature 40°C -> stop compressing air in lung -> air in lung cools down (lets say to 10°C) and let body cool down from the cool air in the closed bag organ. And restart) Okay, that will never evolve, forget it. And who knows how effective this could be...

- I don't get why it would hunt at all, it could just wait until something comes along and eat it.

oh man, that does sound like a dragon would evolve out of a lizard with free energy device.

Ancient lizards instinctively horde seeds because it attracts delicious mice.

Modern dragons instinctively horde gold because it attracts delicious murderhobos.

Hah. I like that idea. And I guess I did somewhat have dragons in the back of my mind when writing the original comment. But the main thing was that I read about simulated creatures evolving the ability to exploit floating-point rounding errors as a source of free energy. Magic is a huge source of energy, but the only story I've seen where it significantly shaped the ecology of the world is The Stormlight Archives.

If I ever use this idea in a tabletop game, I might add a stipulation that the summoning-organ requires animal souls as a micronutrient. (But then why don't the demonovores just eat their own babies? Unless the demonovores just don't have souls.) That should plausibly encourage predatory behavior, limit their population growth, and prevent outbreaks of Vakusdrakian Von Neumann Moles.

** Here's a question: You magically end up with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation][/Hypercomputer/]] and you want to use it to create simulated civilizations so you can use them to work on AGI/AI safety at arbitrarily accelerated speed:

- *Firstly* is there a faster way you can use infinite computing to get FAI (assuming you don't want to risk UFAI because you aren't sure how the computer works well enough to be sure it couldn't take control of your hypercomputer once created)?

- *Secondly* do you think you can improve upon the plan outlines below (assuming you aren't willing to increase the amount of egregious mindcrime)?

The best plan I can come up with so far is to use brute force methods to figure out the laws of physics. Then once I can make simulation of universes like our own I'd create many artificial virtual chambers with different biochemical conditions until I got abiogenesis to work. Once I'd done that I'd create some large environments to let life develop then run that at insane speed and have it slow things down and alert me once some animals managed to pass the entire breadth of tests I put into the world to test intelligence and tool use (which also dispensed food).

Once I'd created a suitable target for uplifting I would take precautions to make sure I'm not causing them unbelievable suffering in the process of getting human level intelligences. I would remove all diseases and parasites from them and put them in a new environment which was designed to artificially select them for intelligence and prosociality. This would work by controlling their fertility artificially so they were forcefully committed to a K-type monogamous strategy (since selecting for them to be similar to humans seems probably useful) and also having their fertility only be able to be turned on by competing procedurally generated cognitive tests. Similarly I would have other procedural tests which controlled fertility that were group based team exercises potentially against other isolated groups of the species which would select for prosocial behavior. In addition I would automatically have the computer detect creatures with physiological signs of dying and have them taken to a virtual environment where they're ran at such incredibly slow speed that they won't die before I get FAI and can have it fix their ailments.\\
Still while I have protections from death the creatures would have plentiful resources, no sources of danger and all the selection effects would be from their artificially controlled fertility.

Then once the creatures can consistently score at human levels on the cognitive tests I'd give them access to human culture (but still no way of creating tech) and look for the ones who ended up with the values closest to my goals. Those one's would be copied into a new simulation (the old run no longer being run at accelerated speeds) where they would be given more cognitive tests controlling fertility (in order to get them up to consistently genius human levels) however I'd also keep copying the ones with my intended values into new sims and leaving the old one's running to slow to matter.\\
The idea would be once I had my population with genius level intellect and roughly my values I'd give them access to human tech and get them to work on FAI at accelerated speed. However I would need to interfere a fair amount of tampering in this stage in order to make sure all such research was being done with my knowledge by a single coordinated group who was being as slow and careful as possible with their research.

Plus I will be running many parallel experiments; so if some of the species that pass my coordination and intelligence tests (which will include being taught english either typed/read or spoken) are just to damn creepy it's no loss. Then the remaining who passed will get exposed to human culture and I can view many iterations of this and pick the groups that end up with values I agree with.

Basically since I'm not dealing with a superintelligence I expect that evolved biological beings aren't going to pull off a multigenerational ploy over millenia to hide their species true nature, so I can trust their behavior to be somewhat determined by their goals.\\
Plus I expect there to be some convergence in mind-design among social alien species.

More abstractly though I sort of figured the evolutionary approach is the only one that lets me create biological intelligences through a process that requires no active oversight by me (thus allowing me to speed it up such that it instantly skips to the next time my automated system alerts me of something).

For example: A "magical box (TM)", of weight N log(N) gram. You feed it with a number k < N, wait log(k) seconds and, tada, it outputs the longest-running terminating Turing machine, with number < k (when interpreting the description of the machine as an integer).

Awesome, you can now compute the uncomputable and know the unknowable! Also, useless. Also, the magical box of size "N" is a book with N log(N) pages (but in our universe, this book can only be written on human skin by mad Arabs).

Presuming you want to use the computer to instantiate a FAI into the world as quickly as possible, how much do the details (beyond what's obviously the case based on my initial descriptions) really matter? If you're already talking about a infinitely powerful classical/quantum computer does adding any other types of computing power actually speed up your goal of creating FAI here?

  Which capabilities do you add? "All of them" is contradictory: No hypercomputer of capability C will be capable of predicting whether a program written for a C-hypercomputer terminates. Therefore, you need to specify.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure "all of them" is so contradictory if you relax you definition of what counts as a single computer and count a whole system rather than one processor. For instance I would say that the hypercomputer interface can be called a single computer but actually connects to an infinitely powerful version of every mathematically possible computer. So thus by definition the system as a whole can do anything any logically coherent computer can do because it includes them all.

  For instance it could instantly solve all version of the halting problem for itself.
#+end_quote

Suppose you have a magical super-duper computer. Because it is super-duper it definitely can run python. And because it is a vakusdrake computer, it can solve the halting problem for its own programs. Let's call this the vakusdrake-analyzer: It takes a program (python function) and tells us, always and in finite time, whether the program halts. All the super-super-hyper-magic is in the vakusdrake-module. What does it do on the following:

#+begin_example
  def barber_of_seville():
      if vakusdrake.analyze(barber_of_seville).halts():
           while true:
                pass
      else:
          return
#+end_example

Now suppose that barber_of_seville() returns (instead of running forever). Then the vakusdrake-analyzer tells us this fact, and barber_of_seville() loops forever. Suppose barber_of_seville() runs forever (instead of returning). Then the vakusdrake-analyzer tells us this fact, in finite time, and we return. The barber of seville must shave himself, and he must not (and giving him more shaving supplies does not help him in this conundrum).

Hence, infinite computing power does not allow you to implement the vakusdrake-analyzer: Saying "assume a vakusdrake-analyzer" is just like "assume 2+2=5", that is, useful only for showing that, in fact, two plus two does not make five.

You can of course assume a computer that tells, instantly, whether an ordinary (Turing) program terminates. That's one step up in the hierarchy. There is theory about the ordinal hierarchy of the power of these various machines. And your hypercomputer must sit somewhere.

In more fancy words: Undecidablity of the halting problem relativizes.

I'm not really sure what the point you're making is. I was saying that because it can operate at infinite speed any program which halts for the computer /eventually/ will halt instantly.

If you're saying that there are some hypercomputer functions which no mathematically/logically coherent computer can run then I'm fine with excluding those. However the idea is that any computer which /is/ logically coherent is bundled into the system which you could technically consider to be an infinite number of computers bundled together by a shared interface.

***** Encode computer programs as integers, e.g. just interpret their bit-sequence as an integer.

Now, some of these programs terminate, while others run forever; only the Old Ones, from outside reality itself, know which ones will terminate. The mad Arab Al'Hazred received this list in a fevered vision, and wrote down, in ascending order, all the terminating programs that run longer than all previous programs in this list. Because Al Hazred was totally nuts he just had to write the book on human skin and call it the "Necronomicon", the book-that-names-the-dead (programs) [*].

This book, if you can acquire a copy, plus a steady supply of assistants for looking up pages, is a hypercomputer. For an alternative explanation, see [[[https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3531]]].

[*] Back in the day, the book was also known to the god who rules over the Platonic Realm of ideas, as taught by the high priest Hilbert. Alas, the heretics Goedel and Turing climbed Mount Olymp, violated the sancticity of the Platonic Realm and set fire to the divine library. Today, only the old ones remember; and some fragmentary copies of Al'Hazred's Necronomicon are said to remain in possession of various cultists.
