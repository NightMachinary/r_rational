I am a philosophy teacher in Brazil, and I teach kids from 7 to 11. Our classes are more about learning how to think and express yourself than about reading philosophy texts. Most of our classes start out with a story (a short story, a cartoon, a narration, a song, etc). It is very important flr me to try and help them think in a more rational fashion: to understand one should change his mind given evidence, to understand you can test you ideas about the world to see if they proceed, to exercize questioning and curiosity, etc.

Can you suggest me any story as such that I could use with my students?


** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_You_Want_to_Be_a_Wizard][So You Want To Be A Wizard]] by Diane Duane is a great series I read as a kid that still holds up well as YA books. They explore space and alien perspectives well, and has an interesting magic system.

IIRC the series got a direct reference in HPMOR too.

**** Give it another read some time! I love finding old books I forgot about and diving in for a re-read for nostalgia and new perspectives on the characters and settings and whatnot. Sometimes there's even a sequel waiting for you when you finish.

Honestly the only part of SYWTBAW that I remember wearing on me the last time I read books a handful of years ago was the YA romance stuff. All in all it's a fantastic series for kids/teens, much better written than /some other/ magic-fantasy series that swept me up as a kid in the 00's.

The problem may be that the stories are not translated to Portuguese, sorry if it is critical. There is also one " fuck " in the last sentence of the story, so it may be not as child friendly as I thought.

** It's a bit long, but the animated series "Avatar, the last airbender" has many elements of rationality. The characters have internal lives and motivations, which guide their behavior throughout. While there isn't so much scientific-based reasoning the way there are in some rational stories, both protagonist and antagonist characters are forced to reevaluate their beliefs and actions as the story progresses and many challenging philosophical questions are touched on in a way that does them a surprising amount of credit while still being accessible to children.

*** On the same note, the netflix animated show [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCojP2Ubuto][Hilda]] is also pretty great, it's one of the few kid's shows that I think could rival Avatar in quality, depending on the quality of the second season(due this year!).

It has less of a focus on relationships and character arcs, instead focusing on plot and setting, and it knocks it out of the park on wit and charm and wonder and whimsy.

edit: the source material is a [[https://www.amazon.ca/Hilda-Troll-Book-Luke-Pearson/dp/1909263788][graphic novel]] that is also unusually good.

** I wouldn't call them rational, but the Sideways Stories from Wayside School series often had elements of trying to think through a problem rationally, usually with irrational results. There was also a book of lateral thinking math puzzles, which encouraged that kind of thought.

Of course, Star Trek is full of those kinds of stories, you might be able to condense something there.

There are lots of great science series that encouraged that kind of thought for me as a kid. Bill Nye, Magic Schoolbus.

You're right though, that can be hard to find.

** In first or second grade we read "The Big Orange Splot." I always loved that book. It isn't really about rationality as much as self expression and not conforming just because everyone else does.

The main character, Mr. Plumbean, lives on a "neat street" where all the houses look the same. A seagull flies over his house and drops a can of bright orange paint on his roof, but instead of repainting his house to look like all the others on the street, Mr. Plumbean paints it to resemble his dreams. His neighbors send people to talk him into repainting his house to look like theirs, but everyone he talks to ends up painting their houses like their dreams also. In the end, all the neighbors say:

** Hmm, I think a lot of the things on this sub are fine for children, they're smarter than people give them credit for and a lot of stuff on this sub is dumber than we like to admit. I think something on the lines of morality tales but the morals are usually "it depends". Off the top of my head there's The Sword Of Good or the whispering earing. [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3p2yup/the_whispering_earing/]] "Cordyceps: Too smart for their own good" Would be effective but probably also give them nightmares.

Brave New World is not a short story but it is philosophically interesting with the setting being simultaneously a utopia and distopia, it also doesn't have "sides" or "answers" a world is described and within it people do things, whether these are good or bad things is something left up to the reader to judge. Though it does have themes some might not consider apropriate for children. Although it might not really be relevant I find Bogleech's story competitions attract stories that aren't so much horrific as thoughtful and deeply strange.
