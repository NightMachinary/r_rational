** Well if you're looking for something that's probably the opposite of rational but nonetheless a valid deconstruction of a crazy lady in a magical bus, I'd recommend the Iris Wildthyme series(es) of books and audios. I think Big Finish Productions actually just released a new boxset of her adventures; if it's the same quality as their other Iris work, I'd recommend it.

** Yes, and it's been running on the BBC for over 50 years.

** I believe we determined that a level of effort for posts here higher than "How about rational _____?" was desirable. Therefore I am downvoting.

That said, rational Magic School Bus would be pretty sick.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8812095/1/Return-of-the-Magic-School-Bus]] that's probably the closest you're going to get to rational.

*** If we're thinking of the same topic, then it was a /particularly/ bad case. Requests for recommendations are generally okay IMO, and there was a plausible chance something might exist, as evidenced by the fact we got two different links. :)

**** The open thread, though [[/u/ancientcampus]] reminded me that this was more a request for stories, so I possibly overreacted.
