  Fortunately, Zorian had gotten lots and lots of insight into the inner workings of the soulseizer chrysanthemum during the last six months of the time loop...
#+end_quote

Calling it right now, Zorian's workaround for Mind Blank works by attacking the mind through its link to the soul. Soulseizer had an trick that attacked mind, body, and soul at the same time, and Zorian realized that it wasn't three separate attacks combined: it was one attack that could hit all three somehow.

I don't know how many of you are familiar with Worm, but Zorian is gradually revealing himself as a classic [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/S-Class#cite_note-17][S-class threat]]. His combination of golem creation, warding ability, knowledge of the mind, and simulacrum expertise allows him to grow in power practically exponentially.

His only limit is his own relatively modest mana reserves. Unfortunately for the world, the best mana battery in existence is right in front of him.

In a lot of ways, he rivals the threat of the ancient necromancers that a war was fought over.

His growth will be a lot slower now, and with more eyes on him it will be harder to mass produce golems. He's still a serious threat (there's a reason Eldemar has laws against making big golems) but he's not an exponential threat.

He's a major threat, but if you threw enough powerful mages at him you could crush him.

Even if Zorian acts completely above board, the real threat is his knowledge. And Zorian is going to share his knowledge with the world. He's an idealist that way. Imagine what a less than scrupulous Lich could do with these novel ideas...

****** Nah, Thinker 6 or 7, or possibly 8 I would think. His mind reading with his range alone is 5. 6 with his mental calculator, clock and other upgrades. 7 or 8 depending on his abilities with divination. Considering he was able to search half a continent with a week of preparation, I would go with 8.

Tinker 7, with the golems and artifice abilities he's shown? Yeah, 7. Wards probably go under that one too.

Master 8, or 9. He is capable of complete rewrite of a mind, and is capable of controlling pretty much everything with a mind that isn't shielded. (Which on the PRT rating system is pretty much no one.) His Simulacrum also go under here, as well as being another boost to his Thinker rating.

Blaster 8 or 9. Dimensional blades and artillery magic are good enough for that.

Stranger 5 or 6, illusions and ectoplasmic shells capable of looking like anyone. Then he can use his mind control to prop up the category even more.

Honestly, Zorian has ratings in all the categories. So the simplest would just be calling him a Trump 8 or 9 or something. Which in PRT rating systems just means 'run for your lives'.

And the Angels pretty much provived him with a solution for his mana issues - shaping ambient mana directly with the help of a magic item designed for the purpose. Either Zorian can create such an item - something he can research or do already - or maybe even just learn the ability on his own.

*** He's good, but he's not S-class. If you look at that bracket, it has entities like the Endbringers, Slaughterhouse 9 and Nilbog. Endbringers are literally unkillable if you don't happen to be a vengeful quasi-deity, Slaughterhouse 9 has a long track record of indiscriminately destroying locations and killing anyone they feel like, and Nilbog can multiply exponentially if he's allowed past a certain point.

S-class is reserved for those situations where you have to get all hands on deck to even contain the problem. In 1v1 fights he has pretty good odds in most matchups, especially if he can scheme and prep beforehand, but a lot of the big-name mages out there would hand his ass to him in a duel without a need for backup.

** Hell ya. another great chapter that evokes such vivid battles with good contours. I love how in the middle of the battle Zorion still has side thoughts and tangents on things which really add to his character and showcases quite subtly his multitasking and changing mental state.

No wonder Damien was a great adventurer when he can go up against some of the best mages in the world and survive longer than a moment. Though it has been shown previously that he was a badass. That time travel reveal to Damien is likely to bight Zorion in the ass later on. Simply revealing that information on a large scale would likely make any of Zorions plans severely crippled.

The fact Zorion had to work for the angels definitely makes it less of a literal deus ex machina.

Zach and Zorions class is likely to be decimated after all this to keep the stakes real.

I also intrigue about Zorian technology, his golems are very advanced as noted by QI, surely broken golems still hold some mechanism, some mages who discover those golems most likely will try to reverse engineer to learn how to manufacture them, that also apply for Zorian magical rifle and magical bullet and any other broken devices he left in war zone area.

But by now Zorian is filthy rich with money that can finance a small country. If Eldemar force him to submit into authority Zorian can flee another country outside Eldemar influence. He's a Tony Stark equivalent of MoL LOL

Ognjište is a fireplace, oganj could be used for fire but not really (vatra is fire).

Dveri is also older name for castle, i have no idea what knazov is but sounds slavic. Zoran is quite common name.

Most of those stuff is seldom used words in modern language but still aplicable.

While I speak a different slavic language, my guess is knazov is formed from a noun "knaz" which could mean "prince" and a suffix "ov" that is equivalent to the "'s" in English. So it could literally be "Prince's Castle". I used to think that "Dveri" part was meant for "Doors" but the castle makes more sense.

I honestly don't know for how many years I have followed this story, but it was sure the first online published novel, that showed me this great side of the internet. 

I will really miss it.

******* Doubt it. I think it's just a natural result of the time loop giving him more perspective on things, gaining power over his psychic abilites (thus forever protecting himself from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error][Fundamental Attribution Error]]), and just maturing in general.

Going from a teenager to an adult can make 90% of people realize what shitheads they were as a teenager.

** The world itself was constructed out of a dragon, right? This chapter may be confirmation of the angels having looped through this battle in their own version of the restarts. Angel tree knowing when the right moment to fight is, appears to be a typical time looper thing. They undoubtedly have a plan for Zorian & Zach at the end too.

**** Oww that actually makes a lot of sense! That might be why the gods can't be contacted anymore.

Theory: Postulating that the gods exist on a plane outside the spiritual planes where angels and demons reside, and that they set up a black box around the universe that includes this lesser spiritual plane, then that would result in all communications between gods and their lessers to be cut off.

*** While the story is obviously Naruto inspired and Time Braid inspired (in part since the author favorited Time Braid) the ending isn't time braidy. As I remember it, the villains summoned a bunch of clones of the main character, and the heroes used their extreme combat skills and mind magic stuff with clones to beat them up.

Here, the Sakura analogue Zorian is using his item creation skills and the aid of his brother to defend him while he summons minions and the Naruto analogue Zach fights a dragon.

**** It's not a blow for blow repeat (and couldn't be, since it's missing the mind control themes), but it's pretty similar. The heavy squares off against a dragon (in TB the dragon was a hero (Naruto), here it's a villain). The main nonlooping villain (IQ, Pein) focuses on sabotaging the efforts of the backing cast and stopping the protagonist from asking Heaven for help. There are several fights happening in parallel, neither side being entirely clear which is the 'true fight' and which are feints, until they merge as the bit players are taken out and only the main fighters on each side are left. Lots of prep time happens on each side with the end result of the heroes negating most of the villain's prep, at a substantial but lower cost than the villains needed to set it up.

It's its own thing, but the ending has so far looked much more ripped from TB than the middle did.

***** Fighting a dragon is a common enough ending that I'm doubtful it counts as just a common thing to Time Braid.

The non looping villain was around, but he was mostly trying to punch Sasuke to death, and she punched him to death. Where did he show any concern about her talking with heaven? QI's main focus here was summoning a demon, not sabotaging the backing cast or stopping the protagonist from summoning angels.

Having multiple fights happen in parallel is just a thing for big fight scenes.

Preparing for fights is... well, I can't think of any stories where that doesn't happen. Notably, most of the villain's prep is just summoning more monster- they don't have any large scale elaborate anti city weapons. The final fight is in the villain's stronghold.
