** Three grammar mistakes in as many sentences. I bailed by the end of the second paragraph.

*** I really need a beta, but I never found any longstanding volunteers to give the feedback as I needed, in the times that I asked for one.

It's going to take ongoing feedback to get my technical writings up to notch, and I am afraid that's too much time for the vast majority of people.

So I write blind. And it will continuously annoy the hell out of people.

**** Even without a beta, tenses and spelling aren't so hard to notice by yourself on a second draft/readthrough. Unless you're a non-native speaker?

***** Yes. I am a non-native speaker.

Yes, there are things I am going to go miss. Otherwise, I would not need a beta.

****** No. .you would still need a beta, just not as badly. Finding people to edit your work should be easy though, at least of you only ask for a small amount at a time.

** Anybody wants to volunteer as beta?

I constantly get complaint from people who bailed out on my stories because of my lack of technical writing chops and poor grammar.

*** Currently betaing your first post of the reboot on SB - Going to send it as a PM message when I'm done.

If you like it, I might be up to beta more. It's not like I have more productive things to do while waiting for calls at work. Reading nonfiction can get draining after a while.

Edit: Done, with a pass-through that took around half an hour. Check your PMs on spacebattles. The most 'comma-en'(hue) mistakes are misuse of commas(mostly overuse) and incorrect tense/word choice(Had/have/has, etc.). The early parts of the chapter have a higher incidence of mistakes than the later parts.

Make whatever changes you desire, then strip the color formatting I used.

*** I do actually, certainly interested to see a Stargate rational story. That said you probably want to find someone else too, english isn't really my first language

*** Recall the episode in which General Carter and his daughter utilized what they learned in /A Matter of Times/ to make the local star implode in a supernova.

Presumably, this can be done with any two stargate and a black hole....which is super duper scary.
