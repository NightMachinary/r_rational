** So I'm going to be honest here. I clicked through, determined that reading your website would hurt my eyes through the combination of text colour and background, then closed the tab. Do with that information what you will.

** I thought I remembered that name...

The first chapter was posted in September 2015. It's still at chapter 5?

*** Yes. School has dominated my attention for the past few months, and since I make money off my job, and none off of this, my job and education have taken precedent.

Mostly more about the setting.

*** Well basically it's set in an alternate timeline where magic exists and has existed since well, ever and is common place.

Jeremiah (the protag) was a hunter, and got caught up in an attack that killed his brother and father. He followed a few leads and made a deal with a god (Fate) to go back in time, to stop Caine. the big bad. Caine wants to absorb massive amounts of magical energy and remake the world in his image. The fact that this would probably turn the entire world into a wasteland isn't an issue in his opinion. He is unhinged to say the least. Now something has happened and Fate has decided she wants her payment.

As for the setting at large. When the industrial revolution happened, it was magical instead mechanical in nature. Most of the world's problems (global warming, food, water, poverty.) are non issues. There are some "Normal" technologies running around. Cellphones are a thing. So is the internet, and silicon based computing. It has gotten to the point where Mars is slowly being terraformed and the moon is semi-settled. FTL is still out of reach.

In the early 2020s (roughly twenty-thirty years before this story goes down. I haven't quite nailed the down the exact dates), a group of human like aliens discovered earth. I'm not going into that for spoiler reasons, but they're pretty advanced. But basically it's a race of people that have macro and microkinesis over many classical elements. (Earth, Water, and etc.) who have long since mastered FTL travel. They like to meddle in earth affairs.

Also running around are the Fomor, a race of undersea sentients who think that it is high time the surface dwellers are put in their place.
