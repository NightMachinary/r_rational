** (I confess, my primary emotional response at this time is strong dislike of the sole embodied character shown. I will be amused (and intrigued) if the protagonist turns out to be the psychiatrist, linked together in a network interacting with nearly all of humanity!)

*** An interesting thought, but (from the author's note on the first comic):

  Our protagonist, Lee Caldavera, prefers subs to dubs.

**** Alas! Thank you for that! I read the sentence a day or so ago, but failed to retain that crucial detail.

** u/ArgentStonecutter:
#+begin_quote
  As for me, though, I do get annoyed when I see people misusing and appropriating psychological terms. "Depressed" does not mean "sad". "Triggered" does not mean "made upset". "ADD" does not mean "feeling antsy". "OCD" does not mean "I like it when things are tidy". Words have meanings, damn it, brainsciencey words doubly so.
#+end_quote

Me too, and yet I'm also guilty of this, and if /Leftover Soup/ is any guide this is going to be a mighty interesting ride. Thanks for the link, Xam.

*** When I read the same paragraph you quoted, I knew that /Forward/ would be a worthy successor to /Leftover Soup/.

***** Not to mention that, if the updates never become quicker, and his past comics are any indication, it'll take about twenty years for us to get to the end.

**** Yup, I think I enjoyed Leftover soup for the thoughtful comments from Tailsteak. The other comic that also makes me think in this way is Strong Female Protagonist. I don't always agree with either of their view points (although I tend to) but it's always interesting to read viewpoints on society from thoughtful people and sometimes they lead me down a path that makes me update my beliefs.
