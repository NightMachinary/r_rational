** There is nothing to get me interested enough to continue reading past the first couple of chapters.

*** Totally valid. It's definitely a random enough story to not please everyone! Thanks for checking it out though!

**** I mean, it's not bad on a technical level or anything. It's just that there is no good hook to pull me in and get me interested right away. I'll probably return to it if I ever re-watch/re-read mushishi and get into the spirit of things.

***** That's pretty kickass for you to say! Thanks! I'm glad it's not a technical nightmare (definitely an improvement from my early writing days), but it does develop slowly, I'll admit. World building for a bit then the actual action-action begins around Chapter 9. I'm planning on changing the delay for canon characters too (inserting new chapters) which should be soon. Like the "spirit" pun though ;) You do you and feel free to read it if you ever have an interest again!

*** Haha love your enthusiasm. Let me know what you think! If you don't like it, definitely don't force yourself to read the rest!

*** Ah thanks so much for the support let alone stopping by to read it! I've noted the awkward Japanese too (remnants of first drafts), and my recent editing purge is hopefully remedying the worst of it! Props to you for bearing with it though!! Glad I offered some semblance of an entertaining plot!
