** Of course.

Because even for The Greater Good, I don't think the Phoenix would have stayed.

**** Likely referencing an earlier chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Fawkes circled Minerva McGonagall three times, feathered wings brushing around her as the tears began to creep down her cheeks; then the bird flew out a window above the Hall, and was gone.

***** I thought they were saying that D didn't kill N was obvious. That could have been predicted as soon as it was mentioned, plus after we hear about the pheonix rules.

****** From Dumbledore's cagey answer to the "did you kill her?" question, I'd always assumed he hadn't.

** Talk about having a cake and eating it too. I'll tell you everything to soothe my conscience, but then I'll erase it back, so it wouldn't create any inconvenient consequences.

**** The expression is really eating your cake and having it too: after you eat it, it's gone.

TIL?

***** No, with memory charm you can have a (self)delusion. You can /pretend/ that even if you erased the memories afterwards (sealed of, same difference in the foreseeable future at least) it still counts that you told him.

****** Nope, it's not delusion. He really did tell Draco. The point was to see what he will say, not for him to know the truth.

He now knows how Draco would react, and he didn't endanger the secret.

******* But you see, Harry and the narrative seem to think that Harry is doing a nice thing. Harry even said "I won't manipulate you", etc. But if telling someone something to see their reaction and then making them forget to avoid the consequences is not a (pretty horrible) manipulation, I don't know what is.

It's like in canon you have a horrible story about Tom's mother and Riddle Sr., but then Hermione says with a straight face that "love potions are not dark or dangerous" (real quote).

Edit: missing word.

******** That's a real quote, but horribly out of context.

She says that in response to a question about the legality of the use of love potions. In context it is obvious that she is explaining the attitude taken by wizarding society/the ministry, not endorsing that attitude.

********* I wouldn't say that it's /horribly/ out of context. Hermione certainly speaks /as if/ it's her own opinion. She doesn't use any qualifiers like "the Ministry doesn't consider love potions ..." or something, like a person who just relates a government's policy they don't agree with would.
