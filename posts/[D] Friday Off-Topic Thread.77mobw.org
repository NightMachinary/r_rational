Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** CGP Grey and Kurzgesagt collaboratively posted videos about old age and death today, and I don't know if I've ever seen sister videos where I completely agreed with one while the other...offended me. Kurzgesagt frames the issue as about improving the length and quality of life, which we're already doing and I'm totally on board with, while CGP opened by calling the acceptance of death a form of madness similar to Stockholm Syndrome and I instinctively felt attacked.

It's not that I'm opposed in any way to what CGP wants to do, I want humans to live longer and don't have any arbitrary limit on how long I think life should last, I just hate the way he derogatorily describes my mindset (not belief system). He doesn't even refer to it as if it's a mental illness or institutionalized ideology that people are victims of, but simply calls people out for thinking that way at all. This is an effective a technique for persuasion as when atheists tell theists they're idiots.

I was introduced to the idea of immortality as a /good thing/ by HPMOR, and the reason I was accepting of the idea at a time when I devoutly believed in New Age pseudoscience was because Yudkowsky took care to portray Harry as the smart weirdo who wasn't always right in a world of sympathetic people who who at least thought they had good reasons to believe what they did. It placed rationality in a similar social situation as it is in reality.

I loved how Yudkowksy seemed self aware of how most people do or would think he's weird, how his moral convictions conflict with so many other people's, and the potential negative outcomes of that situation. It was a humility that I see too rarely in a time when empathy for people who believe differently from you is in short supply, including in myself. I can't help but see CGP's statements as hubristic in an eerily similar way to religious fundamentalism.

*** I can come up with more, hm, polite ways of talking about popular attitudes toward death without saying "stockholm syndrome," but I don't know if I can come up with a more succinct way.

You don't find people arguing that we ought to die at forty, or that we ought to still die from smallpox. If we lived for a thousand years, I don't think we'd have people saying that we ought to live for only five hundred years, or a hundred, or seventy.

Somehow, magically, people seem to believe that the current human lifespan is good enough, or, if it isn't good enough, then it's just a little bit short of good enough. This, among other things, suggests that our "death is ultimately good" attitude is a coping mechanism, and "Stockholm Syndrome" seems like a pretty good shorthand for "coping mechanism which works by causing us to like the thing that is causing harm to us."

I think you're conflating death with the cause of death. Death doesn't cause harm, it is the end of all harms. Try telling a terminally ill patient in intense unending agony that they want death because of some Stockholm Syndrome-like mental defect.

Hmm... I've always considered this way of approaching a disagreement to be a sign of respect. If I attributed what I believe to be your false belief to mental illness or institutionalized ideology, I'm not really taking your beliefs seriously. I'd be being dismissive of you - effectively telling you that I don't think you can handle a real conversation about this. You're just a victim. You can't handle the truth. On the other hand, if I straight out tell you that I think you're wrong for reasons x, y, and z, that suggests I think you're capable of engaging in a discussion.

Having said that, I think the opposite of your statement here might be a fair summary of why you didn't like the video. Grey didn't say, "I think you're wrong and here's why." Instead, he said that he thinks that you're wrong but you probably have Stockholm Syndrome so you can't handle a real conversation about it anyways. He essentially /did/ refer to your belief as a mental illness, and that's annoyingly dismissive.

I expect my place in the universe to be small and finite so I feel less dissatisfaction with the life I am able to live. I will continue to work to live the best life I can, but I need to remind myself that there is a limit to it.

If I believe that people can become truly immortal and that preserving life the /penultimate goal of existence/, then that will give any other life I choose to live less value according to my worldview.

Second, I don't think coping with fear of an unknown future outside of my control should be directly compared to a mental illness that afflicts victims of abuse out of respect for them.

Third, while I agree that it is a coping mechanism I do not see any reason to stop utilizing it if it is working and doesn't prevent me from pursuing the same goals as anyone else. The only negative consequence of it so far is that I feel offended when people refer to my mindset as “madness”, implying that I am lesser than they.

I need a way to cope with anxiety and despair because I cannot relieve myself of it and believing that I can will distract me from directly confronting it. I will not stop fearing death as long as it is a possibility, so I need to accept that fear is something that I can live with so I can focus on mitigating it instead of vainly trying to remove it.

Much has been written on this topic, and it would be wise to read it.

--------------

I don't know if you've ever spent much time with people on their deathbeds, but it would be instructive to do so. Broadly speaking, people separate into two groups when the moment of their death is upon them: those who accept the imminence of their death, and those who reject it. It may seem an arbitrary distinction, but it is in fact profound. This distinction characterizes everything else about the two groups.

This is something you can try for yourself. Find out what the difference is, if there even is one, and report back what you discover.

******* My comment was intended to point out that you are conflating two different definitions with the phrase "accepting death". There is the first, which means "acknowledging death as a thing that exists", and the second which is "treating death as acceptable". You are pretending for some reason that we here use the phrase "refusing to accept death" as if we are somehow forgetting that it exists or failing to take it into account, when this sub is probably one of the few places where that is emphatically not true.

Thus, the folks here /acknowledge that death exists/ just as one attempting to fly must take gravity into consideration, but they /do not approve of the existence of death as acceptable/, and choose instead to fight gravity and not live in its shadow forever. We hope to find our anti-death Bernoulli Principle and use it to combat it and defeat it, not sit on our thumbs and decide that since no such principle has been utilized since the beginning of time, that we are trapped in this gravity well forever.

/You/ are putting words into my mouth.

I mean that there are many who refuse to understand that death is an acceptable outcome. Of course I don't mean that people somehow forget that things die. Anyone who has had a pet knows this. And I'm sure we also all know that death of a beloved pet, friend, family member, idol, etc, brings pain to others. And I also mean that the existence of grief is acceptable.

What I mean, and what many here "forget", is that the existence of a thing (death) can be both acceptable and undesirable. The two are not mutually contradictory.

I'm not saying one should not "rage against the dying of the light". By all means, work on life-extending medical technology. Maybe you'll reach "escape velocity" and discover a cure for entropy. And I've seen some models that can allow for both immortality and entropy. But none that seem to work within this universe with physical laws compatible with those we currently understand. I wouldn't want to bet against the possibility of immortality, but betting for it sounds suspiciously like pascal's wager, complete with it's religious undertones.

I believe you misunderstand. By "accepting death" we don't mean accepting the inevitable expiration of a particular terminally ill person given current medical knowledge, for that would indeed be delusional, but believing that the general phenomenon of death can't (and sometimes shouldn't) be prevented in the face of continuously advancing medical science and tech.

Perhaps you don't. I can't really say. But it's important to make that distinction. A lot of discussions about this issue conflate the two, with egregious misunderstandings coming from both sides.

I wonder that people still take this sort of reasoning seriously. I suppose the world has always been full of dupes.

The search for the philosopher's stone, holy grail, fountain of youth, etc. has been going on for thousands of years... for as long as humans have been around, I imagine. The arguments I'm hearing today are exactly the same as those we've always heard. Only now they're framed in terms of machinery, AI, uploading, and in general /science/. And throughout, the arguments are still riddled with magical thinking. "A superintelligent FAI will work out the details for us," is not a solution. Or like those idiots paying to have themselves cryogenically frozen when they die. "Eventually scientific advances will allow me to be resuscitated," is the epitome of magical thinking.

Definitely. The problem is, we don't actually know which "impossible" desires are /actually impossible/ until we've put a solid effort into trying, and sometimes, despite the desire itself being impossible, we get something useful out of the attempt. My 8th grade science teacher, back in the day, made sure we understood that historically, before atomic physics was a thing, chemistry came out of alchemy.

We never found a chemical process to turn lead into gold, and nowadays, we understand that nuclear processes to do so are uselessly expensive. We also found an entire primary physical science unto itself, with endless applications at work all around us every day.

So consider, for instance, whether maybe we can't push the upper limit of lifespans above 120 or so, but we /can/ beat the dementia and fatigue of old age, we /can/ keep people healthy, alert, and active for many decades longer before they just hit the limits of the human body and die. I'd kinda /like it/ if my parents, relatives with degenerative diseases, and remaining grandparent weren't suffering quite so many ailments. I fully expect both them and myself to actually /die/, but dying with, say, Parkinson's disease or memory loss doesn't seem quite so /necessary/.

Again, you never really /know/ until you've done the science. This doesn't mean we should search for Philosopher's Stones. It means we should make sure to do lots and lots of basic science on topics that matter, because the most medical and technological mileage comes out of fresh, paradigm-building findings in fundamental science rather than out of technologically- or clinically-focused R&D pipelines.

I mean, I buy into the whole "embodied mind" thing, so I have what I think are strong neuroscientific objections to most beliefs about mind uploading. On the other hand, neuroscientifically speaking, /our brains and bodies really work/, so I can't see why you can't bypass those objections by re-engineering your mind-uploading system. On the gripping hand, I'd bet that mind uploading is intractably difficult or expensive, and that we'll all look back at it the way we now look at the idea of using nuclear forces to change lead into gold.

I agree, and in fact, this is the kind of insight you tend to achieve within a few hours of informed thought about /how in the ever-loving FUCK a superintelligent FAI is ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO DO THAT./

You end up realizing that being a superintelligent FAI must be a /really hard job/, and that the word "intelligent" needs to be cashed-out in a way that actually allows "more intelligence" to /make hard jobs easier/. This is more-or-less why, when I want to talk about AI or cognition, I find it useful to Say Not "Intelligence", just as Eliezer once blogged that you should Say Not "Emergence". Talk only about actual mechanisms and how they make hard jobs easier.

Of course, Bostrom-type work on AI risk tends to define "intelligence", as "the ability to make hard jobs easier, down towards their barrier of innate, in-reality hardness." From there the conclusions follow, but they usually follow tautologically. That can provide a hint at which /a posteriori/ dissolutions of "intelligence" are really helpful, but other than that it's just a thought experiment.

Of course, having /learned and thought about the problem/, I can definitely think of ways to make a brain-y-type-thing that would find what humans consider very hard jobs to be relatively easy. Of course, in many ways, that's just that tasks that are extremely difficult for a body and brain optimized one way, may in fact be easy for a body and brain optimized another way. Lots of more /everyday/ tasks, even high-level intellectual tasks, don't come with formal proofs of computational, statistical, or physical intractability: there's nothing /innate to reality/ making them so hard. For us, gaps between hard-for-people and innately-hard are money on the table, and we pick it up by building a system for which the task is easier than it is for us.

I'm not arguing against pursuing dreams or trying things. I'm not even arguing that immortality is impossible.

We can accept the inevitability of death while still trying to prolong life. No one's going to reject a cure just because they've accepted death. But we can be comfortable with being mortal while still trying to make that mortal span longer and more pleasant than our ancestors'.

It looks like people on the anti-death side are saying: "We don't reject the reality of death; we reject the universal inevitability of it." The more I look into it, the more it looks like they're hypocrites: they reject both the requirement of death, and the imminence of their own. It looks to me like they are trying to find solace in the religion of trans-humanism; that they are hoping against hope that perhaps they won't have to face the existential horror. This is no different than finding peace in traditional religious views of an afterlife; which bizarrely the rationalist community seems to reject.

It didn't seem derogatory to me. In what way do you disagree with CGP? I don't think his calling death 'madness' is hyperbole meant to injure those opposed to him or to signal his belonging to a group (like atheists insulting theists often is). It is his honest appraisal of the situation.

In fact, since death acceptance isn't a politicized issue (yet! :[) calling it madness is probably a great way to make people think about it.

If you aren't opposed to what he's saying---that is, if you think involuntary death is worth resisting and eliminating if possible---your mindset isn't even what he is calling madness. What insult do you perceive?

In order to properly enjoy living for an infinity of time I would require the ability to consciously control what makes me happy and what interests me, and for more extreme circumstances, exactly how much pleasure and/or pain I experience at any given time.

Once you have that the whole "If you were truly immortal you wouldn't like to spend billions of years immersed in the heart of a star or an infinity of time in a void, now would you?" argument becomes moot because I can enjoy absolutely anything that happens to me just as much as I wish to.

True immortality requires some form of wireheading for happiness. And that sounds great to me.

So. My philosophy on this comes down to: If I die then its final. I cease to exist, and, in my opinion that sucks. If I don't die, then there is a chance, maybe incredibly, ultra tiny, that I get to better circumstances.

--------------

So I had zero time to work on either Renegade or XGEF this week.  As briefly mentioned last week, my work deployed a new version of our product on Sunday, and it wasn't until Sunday night that it was pointed out to me that this basically meant I had had no weekend. Saturday had a few hours of me remoting into work and getting backups squared away, as well as shopping around for and testing a camcorder last-minute so I could record the process to document later.  Sunday was the early-morning deployment itself, which was about 5ish hours or so, but all of this meant that I was left without sufficient unwinding time to recover from the previous week (which was more stressful than average due to needing to prepare for a deployment with only scraps of documentation).

Anyhoo, I hope to get that time this weekend and hopefully claw my way back up the work/home balance scale.  On that note, however, due to my changing duties at work, I'm probably not going to have much downtime to design or code at work like I have been--or rather, that time now has legitimate work-y things for me to instead channel that energy into, which means that I need to transition from having essentially worked on Renegade part-time back to it being a regular old side project.  It was nice while it lasted, tho; I got XGEF about 80% of where it needs to be, with most of the trickiest things addressed, so that's good at least.

--------------

So we had a bit of a discussion about sapience/sentience vs intelligence, which mostly came about due to taking a look at the pokeball question again.  In the beginning, we essentially took Origin of Species' stance, which is to say that anyone over a certain intelligence level (or brain density or whatever) comes out of a pokeball comatose or braindead, so naturally it's illegal to capture humans and safeguards are put into balls to prevent human capture as per national and international law.  

The /reason/ for this occurring has been a bit of a thorn in the side of the lore for some time; I seem to recall that [[/u/DaystarEld]] even just sort of handwaves it as a necessary limitation without a real justification.  I'm inclined to agree with that approach, but over time we've accumulated additional lore for the pokeballs that has made the intelligence thing more and more unsupported.  Specifically, we sort of decided (and apologies if this is actually aping your lore, Daystar; it all runs together and I couldn't possibly identify the original source of all of these ideas at this point) that pokeball technology came about after studying Ghost types and their phasing and interdimensional travel.  

(Ghosts are themselves following the original Gengar concept of a creature slowly pushing itself into our dimension.  We figure they're distortion-born pokemon that are essentially Chaos/Warp demons out to wreck shit for no good reason.)

The father of the pokeball tech found that by isolating the organ that triggers the phasing from a Ghost and hitting it with enough power, one could open small portals into other dimensions that follow other physical laws.  The vast majority of dimensions explored are just facets of the Distortion world (and thus highly dangerous and not very useful on net, considering that it's basically like a portal to Hell, demons and all), but someone somewhere figured out a way into a dimension that seems to have properties that we associate with pokeballs: all but halted time passing, non-euclidian geometry, etc.  After a lot of iteration (facilitated by the apricorn tree growing outside, which doesn't really have any super special properties but is a /very/ convenient source of sturdy, hollow spheres), the pokeball was born.

Now, this explanation (such as it is) doesn't do much for avoiding the intelligence threshold handwave, short of pushing the question further away a bit.  We could say something about the chaotic distortion energy field that every captured object has to pass through, and higher complexity minds just can't handle it, yadda yadda, but it's still pretty much just an arbitrary decision due to not wanting to let the player being able to capture humans (or rather, not being able to /enslave/ humans; I actually have no problem with people getting black market balls and using them to inflict mental retardation on enemies as a particularly heinous means of tying up loose ends.  Funny what feels acceptable and what doesn't).

Anyway, so all of this lead to exposing the inelegance of having this effect tied to an INT threshold.  INT so far affects things like the number of moves that one can easily keep in mind at once, the speed with which one learns moves, a general small boost to skill gain in general, and as a modifier to how a pokemon reacts to certain stimuli.  Some of this seems to overlap with the whole “the more of this you have, the more likely a pokeball zaps it out of you” thing, but some of it doesn't, and so it was proposed that an additional mental stat be added, that of Sapience (SAP).  It would usually (probably) correlate with INT, but there would be room to allow them to deviate, such as, for instance, a particularly dumb Growlithe (low INT, medium SAP).  With this addition, SAP would affect speed of training a move to associate with a command, number of commands known, and act as a modifier to loyalty-affecting actions (higher SAP means tending to its wounds counts more for a loyalty increase).

It still doesn't address the inherent hand-waviness of the arbitrary pokeball threshold, however, and in absence of that I'm not even sure I'd entertain the idea on its own.  I'd love to hear any ideas on the subject, either pertaining to the INT/SAP split or to addressing the core “can capture pokemon just fine but can't capture humans without devastating results”.  I /would/ like to avoid “pokemon are magic” at all costs, so fair warning, but I'd love to otherwise consider any thoughts y'all might have.

*** What if being smart somehow helps you get out of a pokeball and avoid full capture? This would mean that, just as healthier pokemon are more likely to escape a pokeball when you are trying to catch them, high-INT/SAP pokemon are also more likely to escape a pokeball.

Altenately, aren't all pokeballs created by Silph Co? Maybe they rig their pokeballs to reject humans. Since pokeballs are pretty complicated stuff, I don't think it'd be unreasonable that they still have a monopoly (especially if anyone trying to reverse engineer pokeballs has to deal with Pokemon Hell World and a slew of other dimensions as they perfect their off-brand ball), but if there are multiple companies then you just have to say that it's an industry standard.

**** For the second idea, on a Pokeball monopoly, all legal Pokeballs are programmed to reject humans. Like, it's /super/-illegal for them to be otherwise. Silph doesn't have a monopoly on Pokeballs, though, and you can find jailbroken Pokeballs on the black market. Super-illegal, still, but there.

As for the first, we took inspiration from Pokemon Origin of Species in the sense that if a Pokeball connects it automatically captures with no chance for resistance (the trick is being able to hit the Pokemon in the first place, and size/mass limits. Higher level Pokeballs can take more of a beating and can hold larger Pokemon). Though, OoS approached Pokeballs from a 'convert to mass-energy and recreate' angle and we adopted the auto-catch rules before coming up with the ghost organ idea, so it's not impossible that we may return to canon's interpretation there.

Regarding Silph having a monopoly, I'm thinking it's a Microsoft situation where 75%+ of the market is dominated by them, but maybe there are some rich or otherwise stubborn companies that are in on it as well. However, as you point out, due to the danger involved, I bet that most other companies are more concerned with ease of use and capture features, not actually improving the tech itself due to the sheer costs involved on that end.

*** If we're OK with capturing-but-not-enslaving humans, and are basically writing flavor text...

Perhaps Pokeballs work by modeling the nervous system at a very low level, and subverts a critter's natural psychology by application of a carefully tuned stimulus, Snowcrash style.

You could choose to limit this by computation: using an algorithm that has a run time that scales very fast - perhaps even exponentially - with brain complexity. This would makes human-capable equipment way more powerful as run-of-the-mill stuff (assuming that Pokemon top off at about "gorrilla")... and so the stuff designed for capturing beasts, even with a modest computational safety margin, just doesn't cut it - but specially built research hardware might have a chance. (And if capture-tech that high-powered is illegal, it'll be hard to get: these are ASICs supercomputers in the high Request-For-Quote range, not guns.)

Alternatively, the limit could be sensor/emitter technology... which isn't nearly as subject to More's law, and so doesn't trip the "but the world will fall apart in 5 years" intuition that the computational complexity problem does.

This is how I basically see pokeball tech working in OoS, so I'd expected that to be how it works in Renegade as well :)

The problems of not using a pokeball to train a pokemon in OoS are massive, however: all automated training programs in the pokeball and pokedex tech can't be used, the things that train them not to attack humans and differentiate between enemy and friendly pokemon for team battles and so on are the least of it, you'd have to train them even in the most basic things like responding to movement and retreat commands, or aiming their attacks. Not to mention all the biological upkeep and environmental hazards many pokemon would entail.

The time and money investment would almost certainly not pay off compared to investing all that energy into training other pokemon in the meantime, but maybe that calculus would be different in Renegade.

(Although it just occurred to me that if the limiting factor that attracts Giratina's attention is the portal activity and thus the number of 'context switches' within a pokeball, then one would be relatively restricted when interfacing with a highly complex /or/ a very large brain. Although a quick google shows that even a sperm whale has a brain that weighs about 20 pounds, so it's not a huge variance. And those that aren't physically impaired like humans would still be possible to train 'virtually', just at a lower safe rate.)

But yeah. I aim to have that sort of low-level training available to teach in the situations that it's needed (so that one can hack it and train, I dunno, knight's-move commands), you just wouldn't want to waste your time on it in the vast majority of cases. One other exception is when deciding what to teach in situations where the pokemon's ability to understand is limited--if you can teach a Pidgeot thirty movement commands then you just go nuts, but if you can only teach a Beedrill 6 in any reasonable amount of time, then which ones do you go for? Do you trade off specific moves and settle for a generic 'attack' just so you can communicate more specific aerobatics?

*** You could do a hand wave involving human and Pokemon evolution. If they have no relation and the world has supernatural stuff then why can't Pokemon have some resistance to something that effects humans in the dimension the pokeball uses.

It seems like you're looking for some force or effect that applies to humans and not Pokemon. What if humans developed cancer from the dimension due to radiation. While the Pokemon are fine.

**** This is actually very similar to where the current discussion track eventually landed on in Discord. I basically got thinking on what distortion negatively effects, and since that basically means "what is Ghost and Dark effective against", the natural conclusion is something to do with Psychic typing.

Thus, the current idea is that all humans have a small Psychic typing %, and unlike a normal Psychic pokemon which has a more-or-less isolated and separate organ that the brain merely commands, in humans the psychic-ness is interconnected within the brain, like white matter in our brains.

Repeated and chronic exposure of a standard Psychic pokemon to distortion via pokeball might introduce microfractures of the psychic organ, but unless it's above and beyond normal use it's probably not going to have much of an effect. You can't say the same for micro-alterations of the brain itself, however, and so humans that are captured are essentially lobotomized: at best your personality completely changes, at worst (if you were Psychic on top of the latent brain structure) completely comatose or braindead. Most individuals come out completely infantilized.

This also would mean that Dark humans would have an additional but probably undiscovered boon: due to their latent absorption of distortion energy via the Dark organ they've got somewhere in their head, /they/ can probably hang out in pokeballs no problem. Due to their overall rarity and the absolute social outrage over the problem (lobotomy is actually a very good parallel in this sense) experimental evidence for this would be hard to come by.

Unless, maybe, you're an individual as powerful as Giovanni with a host of loyal Renegades at your disposal, with a higher than average distribution of Darks in the ranks...

EDIT: oh, and then we could say that the higher a unit's SAP stat, the more any Psychic typing is inseparably connected with the brain. Thus, brain damage per capture/release can be calculated on an individual basis, meaning that while in-universe people think that the rule is "humans and pokeballs don't mix", the /actual/ rule is "medium-high SAP + any Psychic typing and pokeballs don't mix".

*** My problem with the pokeball-as-portal-tech idea has always been that it isn't supported enough by canon, where we clearly see pokemon in their balls able to be interacted with digitally, such as through virtual training regimen and bonding exercises. I guess there's no reason one couldn't mesh the two and say that pokeballs both put the pokemon in a pocket dimension and also have an interface that allows them to experience simulations, but at that point it feels like adding complexity without benefit, if there's going to be a handwave at the end of it anyway :)

**** It's just stupid hard to make a pokeball system that does not by dint of existing create the means of full digitization and uploading, which then dominos to a completely different world. I'm okay if the player asks questions such as "how does X even work", but it's more difficult when they can ask "why can't I just X" when interacting with systems of explicit rules. For that reason, I find the digitization model brings up some of those questions, such as "why can't I make backups of my pokemon if they're being digitized" which then leads to "why can't I duplicate my OP pokemon" or "why isn't everyone just carrying around a copy of Lance's Dragonite", and that doesn't even get into the questions of how we can digitize, simulate, and train brains but not add more muscle mass or bone density at will. If the reason that humans can't be uploaded purely comes down to a lack of processing power, what happens in a few years once Moore lets us catch up?

These could actually be interesting ideas to explore in some context or another, but in the context of a game sim where one is expected to explore and manipulate any of the world's rules they come across, I don't want to veto any player's ideas soley because I decided I don't want the world to work that way. So while "it only fits in the pokeball because portal tech, and only so much mass can be actively accessed at once because The Devil and humans can't even use it at all because Power of Hell" is a bit, I dunno, intellectually dissatisfying on a certain level, it's a lot more ironclad from a systems-to-work-around level. If the player is able to research and fund a pokeball that could actually within the rules of the universe simulate a human, then I don't want to stop them just because I said so.

Instead I'll summon Giratina and make it a boss fight.

Technically you can make a copy of the digital information of a pokemon, but to actually recreate that pokemon out of the non-original pokemon's matter, you'd need the exact right proportion of matter, and the tech that would allow that to be understood and gathered and stored hasn't been created yet.

  how we can digitize, simulate, and train brains but not add more muscle mass or bone density at will.
#+end_quote

I mean, they kind of can, but it's hellishly complex, which is why working, safe TMs are so rare and difficult to create. Increase muscle mass without also increasing the body's natural ability to oxygenate that muscle mass, or the right marrow amount to support the bone density, and the pokemon might look fine at first, but collapse after a few hours or die to some underlying weakness or chain reaction.

I'm not a biologist obviously so I don't know to what degree I'm overstating this, but it seems justified to say "This would take a LOT of trial and error to get right, with each individual specie, and so it hasn't been done yet."

Hell, it would make a lot more sense in canon if CARBOS and IRON and the other supplements were actually the brand names of TM-like programs that can slightly buff your pokemon's physical and mental attributes in predictable ways.

#+begin_quote
  what happens in a few years once Moore lets us catch up?
#+end_quote

Actually I think Moore's law has a semi-ceiling that we've surpassed in Pokemon anyway: there is a hard limit on how much heat can be dissipated from a given surface area, and so keeping chips cool will be a big challenge sometime within the next decade if we continue to cram more and more of it into less space. I'm not versed enough on technical knowledge to know what potential solutions will work best for solving that, but I just assume the pokemon world has in the same way I assume it's solved the rudimentary mind upload issue: because it's demonstrated to have done so.

Many of these problems may in fact be solved in the future of the pokemon worlds we imagine. But they're in the /future/ of their world just like space elevators or solar satellites or quantum computers may be in the future of ours. We have to leave them /some/ closed doors, some places to continue research on and open new technologies and reach new eras.

There may in fact be an era in the future of Origin of Species' world where people can fill pokeballs with matter and copy a dragonite template onto it, or just create their own unique pokemon that are stronger than any found in the wild, or as Bill wants to do, figure out how to reverse or solve the problem of intelligence limiting in creatures that get captured, including humans.

If you plan on allowing people to fund research over the course of years in Renegade's world anyway, why /not/ keep it a digitization problem that still needs to be solved, and then let them pour money into some lab to solve it?

Mostly because I have no confidence that I could simulate a post-scarcity society that organically grows from a normal one. If that was the /point/ of the game, then maybe, but as it's essentially a backdrop for the game I /actually/ want to make (train pokemon, fight Legendaries, explore the world), I feel like I should come up with just enough lore and rules to justify the systems I want, and then permit growth and progress within those systems and in combinations of those systems and leave it at that. I can't predict or generate how a society would react to such a game-changer, not without going full-on Dwarf Fortress.

I can appreciate the difference of complexity between a program that knows how to output one specific product vs procedurally generating a product, but to have a program that can, fully generically, scan an object, break down that object, store that object in a compressed form, and then recreate that object seemingly perfectly, you've already /got/ what you need for replication. Just do them in a different order; capture a barrel of corpses to get your material, point a previously-scanned template to replicate at the barrel data/mass/whatever, and you're mostly golden.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, they kind of can, but it's hellishly complex
#+end_quote

I agree that it's not just like moving a slider over to the right, but if this society can simulate animal brains /and write the changes to the meat/, then adding muscle mass is downright child's play. It would be one thing if the only digital interaction was with something like porygon, but the fact that it's a poor man's "I know Kung Fu" /that works on 700 disparate species and counting/ is an enormous indicator that A: the template can be modified before release in presumably a purely digital form, and B: the digital changes can be perfectly replicated in meatspace. It's...shit, it's a Star Trek tech in a world only barely removed from Cowboys and Indians.

The only way that I feel like it's justified at all is by removing a lot of the scientific background of the tech industries. In our world, observations lead to fundamental theoretical groundwork, which is then applied practically. The equivalent process (in Renegade) is mostly reversed: why would you need to theorize generalized theories of electromagnetism when you have a floating friggin magnet in front of you that's done 80% of the work for you biologically, and you just need to tap it? It reminds me of how the ancient Greeks had the steam engine, but there was no use for it since slavery was so prevalent and so much cheaper; why have a fundamental understanding of natural phenomena when a significantly cheaper, tamable, breedable proxy to the powers of the universe is right under your nose with every possible variance you might want?

Add in the inherent violent chaos of a world wracked by Stormbirds and other colossal threats, and you have a scientific community that is really more like mad scientists or hackers, tossing together Frankensteinian tech together by the seat of their pants, desperately trying to survive the next Snorlax stampede or Diglett migration or Stormbird attack. They don't know /how/ it works and only vaguely /why/ it works, but in the moment that's a tertiary concern at best. I see the pokeball, not as a parallel to the electric car or some other modern refinement of an old process, but like the invention of gunpowder, or even fire: crucially important, and its descendants will shape the world, but ultimately defined by its ability to force chaos on itself to give humanity some breathing room.

Whew, sorry for the inforant. All this said, I totally understand why such a stance isn't really compatible with your vision for OoS; it's certainly not clean, not modern, only passingly (and superficially) comparable to our world, and you have meta-goals that are intrinsically associated with science in general. Your story is partially defined by the process of humanity peering a little deeper; Renegade is more like take what you can carry and run.

** In the asking of questions, some ambiguity regrettably is unavoidable. Let's consider an extremely boring question:

#+begin_quote
  Between the colors pink and green, which would you estimate to be your favorite?
#+end_quote

- What do I mean by =pink=? What, /exactly/, is the range of colors to which I'm referring? Does =pink= include lavender or maroon? Am I talking about RGB or CMYK? (Similar complaints can be made about =green=.)\\
- Explicitly, I've directed the target to consider only the pure and undiluted colors. However, it's eminently likely that he instead will contemplate various items that in his experience have /represented/ the color. (This is the difference between "I prefer green because, being the color of nature, it seems calm and soothing." and "I prefer green because leaves are green and I like leaves.", which says nothing about whether the speaker likes green /itself/.)\\
- What does =favorite= mean? Again, explicitly, I inquired solely about the isolated color---but maybe the respondent will think, not of amorphous blobs of color in a featureless black void, but of buying a pink car or of painting the interior of his house green. Certainly, "What would you prefer the color of your primarily-driven car to be, if you could choose any single solid color of glossy paint?" would be an interesting question, but it isn't the question that was asked /in this instance/.

That's the problem. What's the solution?\\
- Describe the intended context with excruciating detail, leaving no room for error\\
- Allow the respondent to request clarification of the question's intended context---even incrementally, if he finds it necessary\\
- Ensure that the respondent explains the context of his response alongside that response, regardless of the context in which you yourself plan to answer\\
- Allow the respondent to deliver multiple responses, each with its own context provided alongside

This actually seems likely, since most people know that "pink" is different from "red". Meanwhile, how many people disqualify "cyan" as a "blue"? And "black" and "white" probably have extremely limited ranges compared to the other colours.

** Second weekly-ish update on [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIWf3Nqudgh18j4RK8bm4zOTSKUFl6l9Igvdg1adzGE][The Tesseract Engine]], my ongoing game engine project.

--------------

EDIT: The GDD is now officially complete... um, complete-ish. I still have to add illustrations.

EDIT: Done.

The [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t32OHPtbsFtlOi70zNL5RrwwPbuZhkBHfZbRScFcrhg][almost-final version of the Game Design Document]] is out. I need to either complete two sections or leave them unfinished, do some proof-reading, and add some screenshot and images, but I will not otherwise modify this document for at least a month after today.

It's a very long document (roughly 50 pages) that goes into a great amount of details on the engine, the editor, what dynamics I want to encourage, what I need to research, and which features I want to have. It went through something like four drafts, and took month for me to write, and have written almost no code so far.

Now, that is by itself a very, very worrying sign. The standard way to approach a game project is to smart small. You're not supposed to spend months planning, you're supposed to make minimalist, flexible plans and make a prototype as soon as you can to test your idea. The world of game development is full of enthusiastic people full of dreams who spend six months detailing variations of their great ideas, then 3 weeks realizing their ideas are actually terrible and only work on paper.

Given that I know that, there are three reasons I spent a lot of time planning anyway:

- I honestly think I'm way better at planning than the average amateur game designer. I have worked on software projects and games before, both successes and failures; I think I have a fairly good instinct for differentiating "good idea on paper" vs "good idea in practice". Part of the reason I took so long to design this thing is that I wrote a lot of plans which, on second examination, didn't feel like they were actually going to help me implement the thing.

- The classic trap when writing a GDD is to write features, when what you should do is write objectives and dynamics. You make decisions like "and then character X will have a +5 sword, and the sword will be able to do Y", even though you're not able to visualize the impact these decisions will have. The GDD I wrote has considerations like "I want the user to feel X", or "I want the user to be able to do X in context Y" or "I want to avoid trap X that I've seen other projects fall into", which I think are actually useful to write down in advance.

- I need it for motivation. When I begin a project, I have enough motivation to power through difficulties; when the project is close to completion, I can motivate myself by thinking of finishing what I've started. The biggest motivation drain is when I'm in the middle of a project, I've worked on it for 4 days/weeks/months, and I don't feel any closer to my objective. At this point, I think having a framework of thoughts and a project philosophy already written will be a life safer, because it will give me milestones and a sense of progression. It easier to feel the progress I'm making if I feel like I have a global view of what the project is about.

That being said, I'm still worried I spent too much time planning, which is why I'm officially stopping today. For the near future, I'll be doing as much implementing as I can.

In that spirit, I won't be making a long list of milestones and deadlines. I have one milestone ([[https://docs.google.com/document/d/18fdaeiuhH3kNYXS8nM29aAbvC0AFzyr15oJMIGIVlwU][described here]]) with no deadline, and once it's done I'll make another.

Next step: Have a game engine where the Player can walk around, jump around, add and remove blocks.

--------------

This is a bit of a false start, since I was supposed to update this week.

I'm still uncertain about how to this. I want to set up these regular updates to force myself to work on the project regularly, to make it into an habit I have, but honestly, I've never had much success with commitment mechanism. I think I'm going to sort of compromise and commit to updating every week, but if I haven't worked on the project I'll just talk about whatever comes to mind instead; the idea being that I never really forget about the project enough that it's hard to get back into it.

Anyway, I'm going to commit to several people I know, friends, colleagues, and on several subreddits to update. We'll see how long it lasts.

--------------

I welcome all questions, criticisms, and absolutely any feedback you have. Despite (or because of) the amount of planning I've done, I'm going into this pretty much blind, so I'll take whatever advice I can get.

If nothing else, it would let you prototype the feasibility of what it is you want to do, without wasting time cloning minecraft just to discover that the part you /actually/ want to do isn't what you thought it would be.

**** Oh wow, lot of useful feedback here. It's very harsh and a bit mean, but I get the gist. Thank you very much :)

I'm going to try to answer everything later, but to address your main points:

I did write the GDD a bit like a diary. When I was writing it with a team, it was with the idea that everyone already knew what the project was about, which is why I didn't open with the "meatiest" parts.

On the other hand, the GDD also serves as a kind of proto-to-do-list, in the sense that it's supposed to have be exhaustive-ish overview of what the final project will be like. So while I agree that some parts feel a bit shallow and read like "this feature will be good instead of bad", I still want to include them in some form. Idem for the "I don't know how to do this" parts, which are intended to remind me of which subjects I need to research.

But yeah, I should probably rewrite these parts to make this more clear. On the other hand, this isn't exactly a promotional document; it's better to be readable and interesting to get useful feedback, but it doesn't really /need/ to sell the game.

Regarding whether I should make a Minecraft mod... I don't know. I've kind of taken it for granted that I need to build the thing from the ground up to have enough flexibility, and on the long term I do want the engine to be 100% my own... but it's true that it might be faster to make a prototype to test features by modding Minecraft than from the ground up. On the other hand, I feel more comfortable with C++ and Ogre than Java and Minecraft code, but yeah. Another possibility would be to make a fork of Minetest's code, which is C++ and Irrlicht.

I'll think about it.

  This is a bit of a dangerous and inflexible philosophy. There are so many cases in the game industry of a glitch or a bug becoming the ultimate killer feature; don't precommit to denying yourself the use of these happy accidents.
#+end_quote

I don't... think that's a good design philosophy. I mean, if I do find a killer feature on accident, I'm not going to discard it, but otherwise I need an easy-to-control physic system. I'm not going to make a system more likely to have bugs because I hope happy accidents will happen.

  pray tell how ragdolls are responsible for enabling non-lethality.
#+end_quote

Maybe not ragdolls, but having enemies leave a body behind. A stealth game with non-lethal options looks weird if the enemy you "tranquilized" disintegrates.

  the only system that will fit all three of these constraints is the null set. If you want it to be simple to understand and use by content creators, then your code is going to be complicated.
#+end_quote

I don't follow. I mean, I'm familiar with the idea of design trade-offs, but in that case wouldn't making the system easier to predict also make it easier to code? A system with few inputs and few "behaviors" will be easier to read than Unreal Engine's physics module.

  should this not be decided by the map creator? What's the point of such an arbitrary distinction?
#+end_quote

Simplicity. The fewer customization possibilities a creator has, the easier it is for her to wrap her head around those possibilities (which is why Super Mario Maker is easier to understand than Unity).

I mean, in practice, it's way more complicated than that, I'm trying to optimize for maximum "creation possibilities per effort spent learning the tools".

  Not going to happen, as the path of least resistance is always going to be "Minecraft except X"
#+end_quote

Good point. I sort of agree, but "always" is a bit strong. Basically, my goal is to make "Minecraft except X" /not/ the path of least resistance, or at least not by a wide margin.

  This has been tried. HTML/CSS is shit, and far too broad for a UI that should have a common design language.
#+end_quote

That's interesting. Can you tell me more? What has been tried, and what would you recommend for ingame menus?

#+begin_quote
  You say this for every damn section. Stop saying it and just say what you *have* designed.

  The self-deprecation has no place in what should be a description of a game that does not yet exist.
#+end_quote

I agree that I'm not writing this optimally, but I do need to write it somehow. Basically, this document is not just a list of ideas I have, it's a list of priorities and things I need to research / conceptualize better. If I write "I'm not sure how to do X", then 3 months later when I start working on X, I know that I need more research.

That said, yeah, there are probably better ways to formulate it. Overall I'm trying to list the leads I have, to give direction to future research, and the general metrics I need to optimize. Suggestions welcome.
