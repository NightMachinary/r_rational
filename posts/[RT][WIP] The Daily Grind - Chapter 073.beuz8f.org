** Holy fuck what a chapter. Please dont read if you dont want spoilers. Last week chapter: sneaking past a single monster This week chapter: surviving last minute against an infinte hoard of monsters, people riding dragons, someone cloned themselves somehow, book flat out ends On one hand, im happy something actually happened On the other, more happened in one chapter than the least 10 combined

*** Also, the whole "1 minute until something happens last stand" seems kinda contrived. And, for the first time in the series history, the author learned what cheknov's gun actually is and used it. Thank god for that.

**** I mostly just figured that the characters were the kind of people who would do that thing, where consumable items don't get used because you might /really need them later/. Which, yeah, led to some things, the nerf gun especially, being unused for a while.

As for the whole last stand thing, well, I can sorta see how it was contrived, yeah. I did try to set it up by showing some parts of the dungeon getting more aggressive, and with the small glimpse into what the larger people-network was thinking, but it wasn't my best foreshadowing.

***** Don't worry, the setup for the last-minute fight was just fine. Especially the fact that they inadvertently brought it on themselves by disrupting Karen's operation; that was a nice touch.

But did they manage to loot the maimframe?

***** Less contrived than most stories though, it sure was fub. And clues are good, but obvious checkovs guns arn't desirable in a rationlist fiction anyway. Do good on you for not following the obvious route (like real life)

** Well that was abrupt, but not unexpected! Now that it's over, some thoughts on book 1. It was... alright. It had a modicum of creativity, and wasn't afraid to get a bit /weird/ with it. On the other hand, in 73 chapters we have almost no real information about the dungeon or what it is or why it exists, except as a wish fulfillment vehicle for the main characters, and after all that time it was beginning to grate a little. It's rude to your audience to dump mystery after mystery if you don't really intend on offering a solution, or enough clues to reach a solution.

I thought the first 2/3rds were pretty interesting- I think my favorite parts were the real world situations, where the dungeon was an ominous and unknown threat with mysterious rules and powers kind of lurking in the background. Those sections felt the most grounded and relatable. The actual dungeon-running portions felt a lot more like a Monty Haul D&D scenario- just an endless string of fights with no narrative tension that even the characters don't take seriously, and huge piles of loot and powerups that weren't really earned. The threat of the dungeon outside did not scale at /all/ once the characters were trapped inside- to be honest, it felt like during the final dungeon safari chapters the author was getting a little bored and tired of the whole premise, and the whole thing kind of toned down to make it easier on the characters so it could be wrapped up faster. It was actually kind of interesting, as the writing seemed to get into a depressive funk around the time that the main character was overcoming his own. I've been there, Mr. Author. I recommend a break until the characters and the world start to feel fun to write instead of a chore again, and maybe a 3g dose of psilocybin if antidepressants aren't working for you.

Overall I think it showed a lot of promise. Recommendations for the future- you really need an emotional arc for your characters, something that drives them or that they can overcome, and you need to make your fights a reflection of their narrative struggles instead of just RPG encounters. I love the weird-ass magic system you have going on, and I'm really hoping you can tie it all together with some kind of /purpose/ if you come back to this world. I'd like to see more written about the real-world repercussions of all of this. Also, if you are going to use the dungeon powers as some kind of social re-engineering project, start figuring out how you're going to do that instead of having the characters just kind of allude to it- it didn't make a lot of sense, none of them have seen anything that would suggest they're going to get save-the-world level power in here.

Finally, thank you (assuming you read this) for all the hard work! I know I'm being critical, but really I did like it enough to make it all the way through so you're on the right track. Keep trying, you're going to do amazing work.
