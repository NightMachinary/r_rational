Synopsis: April 1st, 2020 - The coronavirus ravages a burning shithole planet called Earth... yet hope remains while the company is true... Anjelik - an effective altruist turned Pop Star - will do whatever it takes to save this world and its dumbasses. Can she rescue humankind if they're already damned, or should Noah just get the boat?

Additional info: I'll be posting at least 15k+ more words of the story throughout April! Share and Enjoy!
