  Why do the rules of engagement for a duel require it to happen at high noon?
#+end_quote

Back to the Future 3 gave an explanation for that one... Paraphrasing from memory:\\
- Wait! The Sun is in my eyes!\\
- It's high noon! The Sun is equally in our eyes!\\
- Oh, so that's why they always did it at high noon...

** I wrote [[http://mhd-hbd.tumblr.com/post/139258778601/concept-star-wars-but-you-know-not-sucking][this]] a while back. (It's a rambling rant, not a story.)

[[http://theworldofstevenuniverse.blogspot.dk/p/steven-universe-season-1-english.html][Steven Universe]] also qualifies. It deconstructs a /metric fuckton/ of tropes.

** Ya titles are immutable.

Anyway [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/oh-my-generic-monster-girls-space-battle-forums-edition.366441/][I'm doing]] a deconstruction of the self insert world transformed story/genre/fetish with a side of magical creatures emerge in modern society.

The main point of the story is to ask "what and how would people actually respond to this and how could this EVER actually happen". In hind sight I'm not even sure if the original thing I'm deconstructing is/was ever popular enough that any of my readers have actually seen the original examples.

most of it in pretty poor taste and not very appropriate for this reddit.

****** I think there is one anime that plays with it for laughs, but generally ya it's more that there might be one or two token monster girl characters in a fiction and not an entire world/setting of them.

The weird thing is how it shows up, in a lot of MMORPG for example (although this is changing) there might be a super monstrous race that has males that are pretty obviously meant to be creatures... and then the females are to be frank barely divergent from the 'tried and true' body type of human female with maybe some horns, tail and some artful features.

******* Uncommon in anime for the exact same reason it's uncommon in western media. The concept mostly got introduced by /Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou/, a manga turned show that has a frankly disgusting amount of fanservice. That's partially why it's a fetish, and the other is that the internet likes to take its own ideas and run with it.

*** I am familiar with a few of the major monster girl works, and, for all its virtues, I cannot say your story struck me as a deconstruction of it. The characters mostly do not feel like Real Everyday People who just happen to be monstergirl-ified, and all the reactions feel a bit artificial.

(I have apparently not read far enough for the "how could this EVER actually happen" part. I'll take your word for it.)

**** Whelp I'll keep working at it. One of the things I knew getting into this is that I needed more work on my characters. Thanks for the input, if you don't mind I'd like some input on what you found not working for the characters. I've been told that there was a lack of caring about them before abs been working on re-evaluating things with my work since then.

** /[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/1295/][Of the Stars]]/ is intentionally designed to be a reconstruction of /Sailor Moon/. Quote from the author:

#+begin_quote
  For the most part it will follow the /themes/ of the anime - love, hope, redemption, friendship, forgiveness, second chances, idealism, etc - even as I reconstruct them so that they work without blatant plot backing.
#+end_quote

I don't know if it's the kind of thing you're looking for, but it was exactly the balm I needed after stomping away from /Sailor Moon Crystal/ in disgust (the way I see it, one could be forgiven for thinking that /Crystal/ is a /deliberate attempt/ to create the most uninspired, bog-standard Magical Girl show possible).

Fair warning: it's a bit AU, and updates tend to be months apart (but several thousand words long).
