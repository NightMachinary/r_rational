** It seems like everyone forgot about the recommendation thread yesterday, so here it is a day late. Oops!

I personally can't easily think of much to recommend, so I'm going to try something new.

Anyone can make a request for certain requirements for stories and I will try to find something that fulfills the criteria. However, don't ask for similar stories to what has already been requested multiple times on this subreddit. I mean there's already numerous threads on time-travel stories, Naruto fanfiction, or Harry Potter fanfiction.

Anyway, here's my few recommendations of worth:

[[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/1931][Slip Hero]] - Involves a doctor reincarnated into a medieval world with magic. Points for subverting the usual reincarnation dreck by having the protagonist not remember very much about his past life (he's not aware that he reincarnated), and involves him actually using what little he remembers of the modern technology as novel ideas invented by him in a slow technological uplift. Unfortunately, while the story's definitely not dead, the author updates excruciatingly slowly on the order of 2 or 3 times a year.

[[http://www.ironteethserial.com/][Iron Teeth]] - What's a goblin gots to do to get ahead in this world? Follow this poor sucker as he attempts to get a life better than being a slave and hopefully evolve into something better. Consistent update rate by the author.

- Stories in which common premises, usually handwaved, are used as the main conflict fuel.

  That is, a human displaced into another world tries to find out who is responsible for this and hurt them, instead of following typical [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld][Portal Fantasy]] storyline. Or the protagonist notices that the world around him starts to look too much like harem anime, and tries to figure out what reality-warping device or mastermind is responsible for this. Or... you probably get the idea.

  In other words, stories with low-key [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheAuthor][Rage Against the Author]] plots.

- Stories where [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac][omnicidal maniacs]] are /right/: that is, where the world is such that destroying it is the right thing to do.

- Stories with the plot centered around antimemetics. (Well, /except/ *qntm*'s [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five][There Is No Antimemetics Division]].)

Whichever you would prefer. Fanfiction is allowed.

But they don't have the same continuous narrative that /There's No Antimemetics Division/ has, as far as I can tell.

**** I spent a while thinking of anything that would fulfill your requirements, but there were only a few I found that meets them:

- Anything by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Watt-Evans][Lawrence Watt-Evans]]. The stories he write often involves realistic people in slightly cliche situations. While it's not to the point of the protagonists being Genre Savy and taking advantage of story telling conventions; instead they simply act in novel ways that are different from what should be expected. [[https://www.amazon.com/Lawrence-Watt-Evans-Fantasy-MEGAPACK-ebook/dp/B06XVFLTBW][Here's]] a collection of his short stories for only a dollar, although I've only read his Ethshar series.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10909255/1/Something-Very-Special][Something Very Special]] is the only story I have ever heard of where the villain has an actually good reason for killing off an significant number of the human population. I don't want to say anything else about the story to avoid spoilers. Unfortunately the author has stopped updating last year and doesn't seem to be continuing the story, but it's so good that I wanted to recommend it anyway. The link I gave leads to the 7 chapter version on fanfiction.net. [[https://sites.google.com/site/shermansplanet/storage/Something%20Very%20Special.pdf?attredirects=1][Here's]] the 9 chapter direct download version.

  Anyone can make a request
#+end_quote

Does anyone know any stories in which the main character tries using rationality (or however it is labeled by the author) for ordering and improving their life, but the whole thing turns into struggle against the “defects” of the human mind instead? E.g. someone with addiction tries to give up but just telling to themselves /“[insert substance here] is bad for you because [insert rational reasoning]”/ doesn't work because it's not the rational part of the brain that is addicted to the drug. Other possible examples: anxiety, apathy, depression, learned helplessness, paranoia, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman][violence,]] etc.

Preferably as realistic and with as little artistic license for wishful thinking as possible.

I'd actually even be fine with [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63697.The_Man_Who_Mistook_His_Wife_for_a_Hat_and_Other_Clinical_Tales][those books that practitioners like writing about their patients]] (that's a good book, by the way), but only if they aren't ~5% verbatim notes from the patient and ~95% guesswork from the therapist.

**** Hey, I just stumbled on another story I read a while ago that I realized sorta fulfills your request about rationality running into the flaws of a defective mind.

There are a fair bit about dealing with psychological issue on Eden's part and a good amount of her time gets wasted because she just can't convince people that they are making mistakes, and her sanity is slowly eroding away.

Another story that might be up your alley is Peter Watt's [[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]] since it involves alien minds and weird human psychologies. It doesn't fit what you're asking for, but there's a relation. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Blindsight][TV Tropes]] has a good summary

These descriptions are what I found enjoyable about the stories. For more fleshed out teasers check out the stories themselves.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471700/1/Stargate-Reopened][Stargate Reopened]] - A more realistic take on Stargate written as infrastructure fiction. Manages to function as a reconstruction - as opposed to a deconstruction - as the authors fix issues in the canon while keeping the source material's spirit intact.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9442823/1/In-Memoriam][In Memoriam]] - [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index][Toaru Majutsu no Index]]. Another more realistic imagining of the source material. Doesn't require an understanding of the source material to enjoy.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/stark-transcendent-iron-man-marvel-quest.3513/][Stark Transcendent]] - Marvel Comics forum quest. Apparently handing SufficientVelocity control over Tony Stark results in a more kick ass story -- who would have guessed?

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/officer-of-the-republic-a-sw-si.478840/][Officer of the Republic]] - Star Wars SI story. A fleshed out and realistic portrayal of the jedi.

***************** The notion that trans women are men pretending to be women in order to trick other men into having sex with them is a common trope. Notably, this belief has been used as an attempted defense for the act of murder: see the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Gwen_Araujo][Gwen Araujo]] case for a high-profile example.

More generally: I, a cis dude, would probably not be that bothered if someone called me "she" tomorrow -- I'd laugh it off, wonder briefly what was up, and move on. But if everyone was calling me the wrong thing every day, and I needed to spend great amounts of time, money, and effort to get my presentation to the point where people were calling me the right thing /most/ of the time, and I met someone I really liked, and then they looked at me with betrayal and said that they'd never have liked me if they knew I wasn't a man... well, I'd be pretty fucking livid.

tl;dr: you're right that "dude" isn't a slur or insult, but if it looks like a straw is breaking a camel's back, look at what else that camel's already carrying.

The last chapter was the result of the voting over how to deal with a cholera epidemic, and all of the rolls were spot-on. The shamans of the community marched out like Spartans in 300 and punted the epidemic back to the lowlands whence it came.\\

A sovereign wealth fund (SWF) is a state-owned investment fund investing in real and financial assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, or in alternative investments such as private equity fund or hedge funds. Sovereign wealth funds invest globally. Most SWFs are funded by revenues from commodity exports or from foreign-exchange reserves held by the central bank.

**** I've already added that part but still need to tweak it. IMO it should reduce poverty, increase unemployment and equality and GDP and poor earnings, and piss off capitalists and the wealthy. Later I'm planning to have it increase inflation also. There's actually already a mod for UBI but IMO it has the costs be unrealistically low.

** New season of sense8 just came out. It's probably my favourite thing on netflix. It's by the wachowskis and the guy from babylon 5. It's an extremely good show, though it takes about 4 episodes for the first season really to get into gear.

Everyone seems pretty dang competent, though I'm not sure I'd call it rational fiction. Better than most, though. (That said: not terribly scientifically accurate).

The best way to describe it: 8 soap operas happening simultaneously with lots and lots of badass action scenes. People being good at things and stepping back when they're not.

And, uh, one of the first scenes is a lesbian sex scene complete with a rainbow strap on being thrown to the side afterwards, so you might not want to watch it with your family in the room with you because it does have some sexually graphic scenes.

** [[https://leonardpetracci.com/the-bridge/][The Bridge by Leonard Petracci]]

It's about a population struggling to survive on a damaged space ship. There aren't many "bottled population" stories I can think of (think a story set in a Fallout Shelter), and this one is particularly strong. There are more than a few less than rational characters, but even that's explained eventually.

** Welp. For anyone that hasn't seen it, Zootopia's pretty great.

It's another of those things, like Undertale, that immediately absorbed me into the fanbase; since I watched it last month I've read something like 5 million words of fic. :P
