** Interesting that Cat's nemesis is Bard-- I'd have figured her thematic ties to Pilgrim would have preempted anyone else taking the mantle. Also, what does this mean for Bard's relationship with Neshamah?

*** I get the feeling that Bard wants the Dead King well and truly gone, but also doesn't want Cat replacing him with the Accords.

If the Dead King wins, no more stories. If Cat wins, the stories become far less interesting (less extreme and bloody; more political and gray).

**** Or maybe it's a play for survival. There's the broad strokes of a 'New Supplants Old' present in Catherine and the Accords vs. Bard and Neshamah. But if Bard can jump ship and remain relevant within the new system as the person constantly striving to unravel it...

I get the feeling that the Bard wants out of the whole business. She's lining up Catherine to fall into the trap of being her successor or trying to end the whole wager between the Gods.

*** I think Above was setting Pilgrim up as her nemesis, but after the mess with Twilight they pulled back on that. It's been two years, so they've certainly had time to move away from that story.

**** Yeah, he admitted he'd never get a story where he beats her after the battle of the camps, then she brought him back after he sacrificed himself. After everything they've been through, if he turns on her I very much doubt he'd succeed.
