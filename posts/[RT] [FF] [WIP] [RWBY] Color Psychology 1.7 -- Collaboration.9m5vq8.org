** Weiss is pretty great at the whole communication thing, and I really like how you're handling the character in general thus far. She plays off Ruby's technical mindset very well; I can see their differing strengths leading to realistic character growth.

Also, your portrayal of Pyrrha does more than just pay lip service to the whole "never had friends/childhood and was socially stunted" thing, which the show was guilty of IIRC. This chapter had her acting like a junior politician (or just a really bad, unelectable one) in that she smiled a lot and was polite, but apparently wasn't well-trained enough in the whole "crowd interaction persona" to smoothly transition over to dealing with smaller, more intimate groups.

As a result there was so much politeness that what she was ultimately communicating basically never matched her tone, which made her seem either really passive aggressive or simply not able to assertively get her thoughts across. Also, her nonstop smiling just came across as creepy: she was smiling so much that anyone in a convo with her would soon start to distrust that her smiles actually meant anything, which isnt conducive to forming relationships (or even interacting casually, really).

Really enjoying this story!

** man what a SUPER awkward conversation

I like Jaune's technically-true statements about his aura. From the last chapter, "never better", and from this chapter "It won't. Unless I run out of aura the normal way, of course." I do wonder why he isn't able to talk about his problem.

I also like how Ruby is embarrassed about her "don't propose solutions or analyses yet" problem-solving method. Too real... I've never had much luck getting my coworkers to try it.

Also what's up with Pyrrha's power? In canon she just controls magnetism, right? ("wow, you can control poles") I dunno how to square that with what she does to Ruby's power, or how she figures out what Jaune's problem is, or how she heals him, or why she's perfectly exact at putting her weapon away. Is her power different in this story? Some clever use of magnetism that I haven't thought of? (Electromagnetism /is/ one of the four fundamental forces.) Some special interaction between magnetism and aura?

*** The impression I got was less that he wasn't /able/ to talk about his problems and more that he couldn't explain himself without revealing that he was a fraud (like in canon). But there are a number of things that do seem to be non-canon about his situation: Ozpin seems to think that there are "powers beyond semblances" involved, and I find it unlikely that his situation is like it is in canon where his (non-aura) self-image is defined by wanting to be a hero so much that he lies in order to become one. Of course, playing with Jaune's backstory and how much various people know about it is basically a fully-formed genre of RWBY fanfiction at this point, so there's really no telling which minute variation this story is going for.

**** Speaking of Jaune, self-image, and aura...your post's inclusion of this topic brought a big question to my mind: how is Kaine going to deal with the fact that aura apparently is some sort of bounded reality warping field?

Aren't people going to start asking questions when his image starts to change drastically in the coming weeks/months? Because (unless I misunderstood how aura works in this fix) his current image is probably in major conflict and not matched at all with his internal idealized image of self, which is what aura works off.

Is he going to have to explain why he suddenly has clean cut hair, a chiseled jaw, and a generally more heroic seeming? Or is it going to go the opposite route, in the event his aura plays off his self doubts?

Or is this interaction going to be one of the big mysteries of the fic, in that he happens to be one of those rare individuals who is bad at lying to themselves and whise self image maps well into reality? I.e., his "knight armor on top of blue jeans" half and half look matches how his ample but acknowledged self doubt doesn't get in the way of his desire to do good (or play hero, if we're being uncharitable).

I'm looking forward to finding out if this'll be a plot point going forward.

The fact that "Jaune" happened to be mispelled into a different (but still recognizably nominative) form is hilarious. Looking at my keyboard, it seems you missed J for K and U for I. As for whether aura will change things for him, I don't know. I don't feel like anyone knew Jaune well enough to know about it, and anything else could be attributed to character growth.

** Reading Chapter 6 again, Weiss says

#+begin_quote
  "it wasn't the main goal" - Weiss

  "What was the main goal, then?" - Ruby

  "I can't say. Class 1 restricted information." - Weiss
#+end_quote

If Weiss can't tell Ruby the main reason, then it seems a bit weird to point it out so much, even if Ruby was sure it existed.

Theory time!

The assimilation and then "The exclusivity of exceptionality" (what a mouthful) right next to each other. Hmm

By making everyone identical in most regards, the people with differences stood out stronger (Weiss says so herself about her family's semblance), so this could be a drive to make hunters stronger by focusing "specialness" onto chosen hunters.

If this is the case, then Weiss must've been doing this intentionally. Instead of telling Ruby the secret, she gives her all the information she needs to figure it out herself (and the audience). Potential plot relevance? Maybe we can infer things about Weiss' motives and Atlas' culture. Weiss wants to share things with her teammate. She is restricted by Atlas' law/culture/her responsibility. She is willing to circumvent that restriction. Even though Atlas' social norms dictate that citizens can handle anything they are told, they still keep information secret -> Maybe their culture + structure only work if dangerous facts aren't known about at all by the public.

*** Good analysis...

And now that you've raised that whole topic, I'm kind of getting "Daily Grind" vibes re: the "Secret" creature, and how it exists/is powered by not just closely-held secrets, but by those not in the loop knowing that those secrets exist in the first place.

Maybe a person (i.e. the Schnee collective) is a lot more special when lots of people know about it and can't figure out what they do to achieve said specialness?

*** I'd say they're very mercenary and effective in Weiss' case, but is it a better attitude than vale or mistral?

#+begin_quote
  In Atlas ... you should never become upset, no matter what topic is broached, or in what matter. Citizens are considered responsible for their own mental state.
#+end_quote

The usual weakness of this attitude is a barrier to communication out of fear of being seen as weak. This is not true in Weiss' case, but it's questionable whether the entire population is capable of talking clearly. I also don't know how much of Atlas is able to control their emotions as effectively as Weiss.

There is a question on the mental stress of controlling their emotions, which I have absolutely no idea about. Does it take effort to suppress their emotions or does it become negligible after enough practise? Does it impact fun?

Caring only about their own mental state decreases cooperation on managing them, but depending on above, this could be irrelevant. Does this promote an individualist mindset in general life?
