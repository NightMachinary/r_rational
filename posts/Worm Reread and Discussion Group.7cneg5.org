** I've actually just started reading Worm for the first time. I tried reading it a while back and couldn't get into it. Doing better this time. Some basic thoughts:

- Why is it called /Worm/ instead of /Parahumans/?

- It sure looks derivative. I've seen these [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/31964/Boku_no_Hero_Academia?q=my%20hero%20acade][tropes]] [[https://www.amazon.com/Steelheart-Reckoners-Brandon-Sanderson/dp/0385743572/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1510606012&sr=8-1&keywords=steelheart+brandon+sanderson&dpID=51JJFBMgonL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch][somewhere]] [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405325/?ref_=nv_sr_1][before]]. This is just another take on /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][The Incredibles]]/, isn't it?

- I really hate Taylor. I'm taking Emma's side on this one. I mean, how can the girl make such consistently bad decisions all the time? She's just a waste of human flesh.

- Tattletale, on the other hand, is awesome! We're getting married. As soon as I figure out how.

- Why Arcs? Each Arc would be a Chapter in any other book! Why it have to be all hipster?

*** How is it another take on The Incredibles? The only thing they have in common is superheroes, and maybe both being subversions, but even that's stretching it.

Worm predates MHA if I remember correctly... Yeah 2011-2013, as opposed to MHA starting in 2014. Also, it isn't centered around a superhero high school, which differentiates it from both MHA and Sky High. That's not even getting into the tonal differences between them all. I haven't heard of Steelheart Reckoners, so I can't really comment on any similarities.

As for why its called Worm... there are a variety of reasons for that that are spoilers, but if you're at Tattletale I can at least tell you this much. A Worm is a contemptible person, a weakling. To "worm" is to maneuver yourself into a position of power. Also, worms are something she can control.

No idea why its arcs though.

**** To be fair, The Incredibles does attempt to explore superheroes in the context of society instead of ignoring it. When Mr. Incredible causes massive amounts of property damage in the first scene, he (rightfully) gets prosecuted for that. When other super heroes get caught abusing their powers, the public backlash is enough to eventually force the government to ban usage of powers. It even goes so far as to invent some jobs as a result of the powers, such as Edna's super costume profession.

Now, the Incredibles isn't comprehensive or even rational, but it's pretty interesting for a kid's movie.

It's another superpower deconstruction story. In this particular subversion, supervillains begin appearing, but no superheroes.

******* I think if you're bothered by having read other works which try to deal with the superhero genre in new ways, then fair enough that's just your preferences. Since Worm is definitely about dealing with the superhero genre in new ways.

But personally I don't consider that at all to be a negative point for Worm, because I think it deals with the superhero genre in a really interesting and new way I haven't seen elsewhere. And I think I'd describe it as more of a reconstruction of the superhero genre than a deconstruction, taking many hallmarks of the genre and trying to create a world where those make sense and follow from the world's own internal logic.

- A character is in a zone of comfort,

- But they want something.

- They enter an unfamiliar situation,

- Adapt to it,

- Get what they wanted,

- Pay a heavy price for it,

- Then return to their familiar situation,

- Having changed.

Since I'm only at Arc 8, I can't say where exactly to line up the pieces. They may very well line up multiple times. For Taylor, her school situation was a familiar routine, from which she admitted she was finding excuses to deviate from. Living with the Undersiders may also qualify as a zone of comfort, from which she doesn't want to deviate. Chapter 6.09, she resists leaving, then in 7.12, she finally makes that decision. And... since that's where I'm at, I can't really say more on that.

So, I'm not really criticizing /Worm/ here, which a lot of people seem to have taken my remarks as. But I have seen these tropes a lot. Stories in which superpowers spontaneously appear? Check.

The earliest such work I'm familiar with is /The Incredibles/. If there is an earlier one, I'd be interested in hearing about it.

Does she deserve the bullying? No, of course not. But she's not doing anything to stop it, either. If you've ever dealt with bullying, you'll know she's doing exactly the wrong things to make it stop. And from Emma's perspective, she might not even realize that what she's doing is wrong. It's just something that's built up over time, each step feeling like the right thing to do. Taylor on the other hand?

******** I finished Arc 8. Combined with the fact the next "Arc" is an extended interlude, this feels like the end of the first volume. I can almost see a flashing neon sign saying "End of Part 1".

The [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=407513&type=card][Endbringer]] looks like a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina][Diabolus ex Machina]], (followed by a Deus ex Machina when Scion arrives). As for Taylor's decision at the end (whatever it is), it looks like she's just planning to do the Hero Thing of taking a crappy world and trying to make it better. I don't expect that to go particularly well, but I do expect that she'll learn a great deal about how the world works in the process of trying.

The most interesting part, as far as worldbuilding goes, was Miss Militia's interlude, and her recollection of her trigger event. I get that powers come from somewhere, and while not all of these stories explore that, this isn't exactly new ground. In fact, most superhero stories (when played straight) include an origin story. I would be surprised if /Worm/ deviates from the established pattern and didn't explore where powers come from.

So, Scion, the Endbringers, and the Source of Powers. Those are the three big questions, right? I stand by my initial assessment: this is all very familiar territory.

Well, you did want the story to go off the rails. Doesn't [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies][dropping a rock on the city]] counts?

Regarding Scion, I don't think his appearance could be called a Deus ex Machina, since waiting for him was explicitly mentioned as a frequent Endbringer fight strategy. It wasn't unexpected, for the characters or for the readers.

Granted, I suppose it would all be, ah, "derivative", if you're using such a broad and acausal definition of this term. But if you liked the content about the Source in Miss Militia's interlude despite this, or if you liked, say, related sections of /The Reckoners/, you'll most likely like /Worm/'s take on the topic very much.

That said, the concepts wouldn't be completely unfamiliar, and your opinion on Taylor probably isn't going to change, if it hasn't already. That given, decide for yourself.

... Or you could list what you like/dislike about the story and I could say whether there's more/less of it further ahead.

********* I'm not familiar with all the stories you linked, but I'll tell you that what makes /Worm/ unique to me is it actually explains and gives reasoning how a scenario that's found in superhero works of fiction could actually occur. It answers questions like: Why can't people with powers just chill? Why do they have to fight all the time? Why don't the super powerful heroes (Eidolon, Panacea etc) just take over the world? Why are there even Endbringers that exist? Why don't they destroy the world? Why doesn't Scion just kill them? It actually answers those questions (I think some of them have already been answered or hinted at for you) in creative ways. For example, the Endbringers are at this point Diabolus ex Machinas but I am so sure you have no idea as to their actual origins or purpose.

Also, I personally find the powers in Worm extremely creative and how they use it. Night (the cloak, flashbang, smoke grenade) and Oni Lee are the best examples of this early on. Are there other examples of works that utilize creative powers effectively like that?

Anything by Sanderson, really. He is in fact doing all of these things you talk about, constantly deconstructing (and reconstructing) fantasy settings. I imagine that's one of the reasons he's linked on this sub's wiki.

Well, more like they're an invocation of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChandlersLaw][Chandler's Law]]; the plot wasn't going anywhere useful, so /wham/. Coil's interlude suggests this may not exactly be the case, but I don't have enough information yet.

*********** Fair enough, I haven't read /Reckoners/ (which came out after /Worm/ right?). I have read /Mistborn/ (and /Wheel of Time/ if that counts at all, and I will say that I think Wildbow is a better writer and far superior at character development based on my limited experience with Sanderson thus far. /Mistborn/ is fairly simple bad vs evil, whereas pretty much all the characters are, to an almost frustrating degree, shades of gray in /Worm/. For example, I think it's funny you love Tattletale so much when a lot of people passionately hate her and find her a smug, unnecessarily manipulative bitch (but maybe it's because you're still so early on in the story).

Also, overall I find Steven Erikson and especially George RR Martin (who actually arguably overdoes it) far better and more focused on deconstructing fantasy tropes.

I will say I do feel that Sanderson and Wilbow give me a sort of similar feel with their writing. One of the main things, and this is a personal one, is that both of them seem to have zero issues with writing extremely graphic, gut wrenching violence but they completely refuse to even get PG-13 with sexual content. Off the top of my head I can't think of any other authors who do that. Sanderson obviously does it because of his religious leanings, and I have my own, private theories towards why Wildbow does it, but it's really just a personal issue I've come to accept since I'm a very sexual person myself and I consider sex extremely important and wish people were more comfortable about it, especially in America.

But again, I would be really interested in your thoughts when you finally find out what the Endbringers actually are and their motivation.

It was actually published first. /Because/ Worm /hasn't been published./ I'm getting really annoyed that people feel the need to point out that /Worm/ was "written" first.

It does not, that was Robert Jordan. Sanderson took his job to mean he needed to mimic the existing style, so it's not really fair to attribute it to him as an example of how he writes.

You realize you're coming off as a fanboy now, right? Before you were defending /Worm/ as an example of characters using their abilities in creative ways, but now it's that the characters are complex shades of gray. If you'd like, I can counter with authors that [[https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=charles%20dickens][do that better]]...? Regardless, a work does not need to be defended against other works. In this context, they're just different examples. It's not like we're handing out writing awards.

I tried reading Steven Erikson... I'll probably try again in a few years. I thought Martin's writing was trash. That was maybe... 10 years ago? Read /A Game of Thrones/, and thought it was vile. Was surprised when HBO thought it was worth making a show of. More on that later.

So... violence and sex are different things. The fact that both will earn a movie a PG-13 (or R) rating is irrelevant. When writing a /romance/ story, sex is kinda relevant. Neither of these writers is doing that. When writing /action/ stories, violence is rather relevant. Both of these authors are doing that. Asking for sex in an action story... just why?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

... you've lived a very sheltered life, yes? The 70's are thattaway --->

I'll tackle this from the perspective of movies, having seen quite a few. Sex is kinda central to /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][The Graduate]]/, but showing it would add nothing to the show. The fact that it happened and how it changes the characters is what's important. Turning the movie into a skin-flick would do nothing. Or how about /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054215/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][Psycho]]/, with its famous shower scene? No nudity, because it wasn't needed; the scene couldn't be more famous if it did show more skin (it would probably be less well known, in my opinion).

Let me arbitrarily divide an audience into two: those intimately familiar with sex, and those who are not. For those who are, writing about and showing depictions of sex is unnecessary. They can fill in the blanks on their own. "Sex goes here" is sufficient. For the other audience, depictions of sex is actively harmful. It skews their expectations, warps their sense of what is normal, and may even make them feel inadequate.

So when HBO picked up /Game of Thrones/ and decided to focus on sex and nudity, I just have to shake my head. It's shameless pandering to the basest desires of their fans.

Cause it's honestly bizarre to me you're using new works as an example of how /Worm/ is unoriginal, it'd be like saying Kurosawa's /Hidden Fortress/ is unoriginal because /Star Wars/ exists. Yes /Worm/ isn't published but I'm confused about your fixation on that especially considering you stated you have a strong interest in fanfiction.

#+begin_quote

I don't really see that other than in the broadest stroke, but perhaps that's because you're so early on in the story. For example, you think the government regulates the superheroes in /Worm/? With the arguable exception of a few other countries, it's absolutely the other way around. There's so many differences in /The Incredibles/ - The kids didn't just get their powers and aren't the focus of the story, there's no focus on how or why characters have super powers, the super powers are relatively cliche and not used that creatively, and most importantly superheroes actually are able to just live peacefully, which if you'll keep reading, will find out is literally impossible in /Worm/.

#+begin_quote

First off, I won't deny that I probably count as a /Worm/ fanboy. I'm not a fanatic and I think people do overhype it up, and honestly it's not as super original as some people paint it as, but I think you also have some bias against the work considering and that you're actively looking for cliches and tropes rather than trying to enjoy the work. I made those comments on /Mistborn/ just to explain why I find /Worm/ a superior work in general, but also because I was surprised you cite Sanderson as an example of someone who's deconstructing fantasy tropes on a level above Wildbow. You actually never addressed my point, as I'm not sure if you would disagree with me on /Mistborn/ being extremely derivative (Downtrodden orphan secretly posses incredible power and is destined to save the world - and discovers said power with the help of an older mentor who is also very powerful; said mentor sacrifices himself in the fight against a great and ancient evil but ultimately the protagonist succeeds with the help of a seemingly minor item/character that was only hinted at in the past - am I talking about /Lord of the Rings/, /Harry Potter/, /Star Wars/, or /Mistborn/? Now do that for /Worm/ and /The Incredibles/ - even up to this point) or if you think it's not representative of his other works which are more deconstructing.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe because I'm a smug, manipulative, condescending jerk myself. I can relate.
#+end_quote

Sorry to hear that, but that wasn't really my point - rather I was trying to show that Wildbow's characters often have wildly subjective interpretations from readers. Who actually roots for the Lord Ruler or Ruin in /Mistborn/ (actually maybe you do). Who doesn't like Vin, Sazed, and Elend?

I mean his writing might be trash (although you imply it's because he has such focus on sex and nudity which I personally find a bit bizarre but to each their own) but that really didn't have anything to do with my point that Martin deconstructs the fantasy cliches far more than Sanderson did in /Mistborn/.

Being a fan is fine. Liking something, telling other people about it... all well and good. The negative connotation of the term is the confrontational aspect: defending the work from any perceived slights or competition. While I am actively analyzing /Worm/ as I read it, looking at the tropes, cliches, and subversions, I am also trying to enjoy it as I go. I'll probably write another top-level response to /Worm/ in one of the weekly threads sometime /soonish/; I'm further in, and people seem to want to talk about it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

So, you were talking about /Mistborn/'s characterization; I didn't address the point, because there isn't really anything to argue. /Mistborn/ is actually rather typical for Sanderson. Complex characters are not his strong suit (which isn't to say they are either good or evil), and he usually plays the Hero's Journey straight. /Mistborn/ demonstrates his strength in worldbuilding; you can see that while the Hero's Journey is typical, the premise has been knocked upside-down. The Hero of Ages came to save the world... and the Lord Ruler won. The setting is the central idea: a land rimmed with active volcanoes, ash falling from the sky, crops that barely grow. An apocalyptic landscape. This particular subversion isn't exactly original (for instance, any dystopia ever) -- take a crappy world, and heroes who want to make it better.

I did not mean to imply Martin's writing was bad because of the sex. I mean that as a criticism for the /television adaptation/. Martin is best known for subverting heroic tropes: just when you start thinking a character is the /real/ hero, he dies. That certainly puts a damper on the Hero's Journey. Now, it's been a while since I read it, and my memory is rather fuzzy, so bear with me. It seemed like he spent too much time building a world that was larger than life, without actually creating anything new. He made promises with the audience that he then broke. He introduced too many characters too fast. The writing was all grimdark without reason. The thematic elements didn't have a point. To be fair, it's quite possible that what really bothered me was the lack of a heroic journey; I was less mature and my tastes unrefined in those days. Regardless, I do know much of the writing itself was weak, and the book left me with a sour feeling.
