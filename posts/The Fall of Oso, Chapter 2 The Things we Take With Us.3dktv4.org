** I can't promise updates will be nearly as frequent as these first ones have been, I write when I'm feeling inspired, and inspiration is a remarkably tricky thing to cultivate.

That said, I'll try my hardest to update at least once a week, more often when I've got my groove on.

** I'm enjoying this. Looking forward to the next chapter...

Only thing I'm kind of wondering is how they organised themselves to prevent detection over all these years :)

*** That in particular might not be gone over too heavily, but as far as backstory is concerned, they did it through the careful compartmentalization of information. The worst that could happen was an individual cell being caught planning the murder of a single individual. Even if an entire island was exposed, the scope of the plan was kept very carefully under wraps for a long time. A lot of individuals were caught, and there were even some spies, but the damage they did was limited and the overall conspiracy went undetected. The Amat have ruled for 2000 years, they are used to rebellions and uprisings and know how to deal with them, what made this such a powerful blow was the sheer scope of it.
