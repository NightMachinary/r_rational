About a year ago, JJBA - Finger Consistency, a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure ratfic, was posted here. Looking back at the [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://amp.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ddkiu0/rt_ff_wip_jojos_bizarre_adventure_finger/&ved=2ahUKEwjYis6wlNzwAhVMGFkFHR7HDlsQFjADegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw3qH6pJ6wPOer84ZQ8vk8SE&cshid=1621648070521][associated post]], it looks like the author, FattyUmpire, removed the work from AO3. It is not available in the Wayback Machine, and the author has been unresponsive to DMs.

Anyone have a static copy sitting around somewhere? IIRC it was pretty dope, seems like a shame for it to just no longer exist on this mortal coil.


** Ha! I remember this! And looking at that post, I even commented.

Unfortunately, I don't really have my [[/r/DataHoarder][r/DataHoarder]] shit together. So I'm sorry I can't really help with this.

This does highlight how much we need a JJBA ratfic though. That said, there really was barely anything there, that I can remember anyway. So, sad to say it, it wasn't as big of a loss as it could've been, though it was a neat intro. In that I can remember, anyway.

** 75% downvoted? Wow. I wonder if the downvoters just hate JoJo's Bizarre Adventure without having watched it, but just from Reddit's obsession with it and osmosis, like me, or if they are prompted by the complex philosophical question of whether the author's apparent desire to delete it should be respected by even those past readers who keep an imperfect copy in their own heads.

Anyway, I wish you luck. I'd forgotten about this ratfic and it reminds me of simpler times when it felt like more of the stories posted here were really, (really) weird things written by community members than otherwise.

*** OP (1) didn't define what JJBA stands for, and (2) asked for help viewing a work whose author appears to have done everything possible to make it unviewable. Not a downvoter myself but, like, I get the impulse
