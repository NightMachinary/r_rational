  "Your grandparents were not as good as your parents," said Chetan. "You do not need to know all the rules to teach all the rules. It does not make any sense, I know, but humans are able to produce humans who are better than themselves. If that was not the case, we would all be dead."

Chetan reminds me of that, and is giving me a creepy feeling for that reason. Having said that, leaving the factory is probably the best move.

** /Stares at update/

/Slurps coffee/

So it looks like Charlie is torturing his family. That was not what I was expecting from a chapter that started with consciences being fully sentient skin tags that you get after a certain amount of moral development.

Possibly this is wordplay, like when he says "destroy them" or "own them" and he means beat them badly at a computer game. But I doubt it.

There is a bit of memetic hate for Grandpa Joe, which Charlie seems to now share.

** You know I'd always thought that the bleeding hearts at [[/r/grandpajoehate][r/grandpajoehate]] were always too charitable to the man so it's good to see a story that treats him properly.

(really though jfc Charlie)

I've related to Keerthi a lot, since I've been trying to figure out how Charlie actually isn't an asshole. Damn if he isn't making it hard right now though. Maybe running the factory just really requires a kid who can handle their shit through weirdness and horror? That might be worth it, since it's a pretty important factory after all. Who else would supply such quality chocolate?

** If you're wondering why this is chapter 14 when the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/f9s555/wipff_chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_fudge/][last chapter was 14 too]], it's because the previous chapter 13 was an announcement of the story's hiatus, that has now been deleted. This shifted ff.net's chapter count back one. Now the last discussion thread links to the wrong chapter, but I'm just glad we got another update.

I wonder if Keerthi will be the main perceptive character for now on(or at least as long as she's in the factory, as ominous as that sounds), or if we'll get narration from other characters too.

"Little Matador" seems like an anagram involving "Matilda," since from the plot summary it seems like...well...most Dahl books but Matilda especially, with "Ms. Sweet" substituted in for "Ms. Honey." But I don't know what to do with the leftover letters, except maybe "Let Matilda Rot".

** Theory: Chetan is some sort of invader that can only infect people who had good parents, the reason there are so many terrible parents in this verse is that many of them are part of resistance movements. It wants to get out of the factory because Bucket knows, the fact that he is terrible is beside the point. Theory two: Bucket's whole reason for this is to surgically attach Chetan to himself since he could never grow one himself
