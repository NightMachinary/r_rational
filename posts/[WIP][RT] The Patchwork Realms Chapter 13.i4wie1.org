** Haha exposition fairy. Haha moving up into hospitality. Haha puppy nibbles, the bane of cloth and leather everywhere.

Considering this chapter is almost entirely a lore dump i would probably just call it "the lore dump". But thats boring, so a more interesting title maybe like "astrophysics for dummies" or "plotting the way". That "dealing with devils" from rr was good too, although i feel like this may be a recurring theme from here on out, we've already had 2 chapters like that and im expecting at least five-ty more? Idk, looks like youre setting up for dungeon delving from here.

** Now taking suggestions for this chapter's title, since I couldn't come up with a good one.

*** something referring to the transition toward a not-just-dungeon delve/adventure tropey story? This seems like a major shift in the plot; I had expected a long story of Athos' adventures in this world, but now it seems like Hellsport will be "home base" for what is effectively a game of Diablo. I'm not creative enough to turn that into a good 1-3 word title, but that's where my mind wants to go.

I'm not sure quite why, but my response to this is 'ouch!' :> The current leading contender is "Dealing with Devils", suggested by someone on Royal Road.

***** Sorry, I realized as I wrote that that it might come across as especially demeaning. I only intended to provide a well known example of the dungeon delve portal stone trope.

I do enjoy your stories, including this one!
