*** Well, computing with quarks and gluons seemed right up my alley, so I checked it out...

And was disappointed. Someone used to Babbage's difference engine might similarly theorize that we could use electrons to do computation by shoving the electrons so that they formed the shapes of small rods and gears, which then might be used to do computation.

Anyhow, I'm sure there's good stuff on there, but apparently not meta-expertise.

EDIT: Apparently Hugo de Garis (the author) has a reasonable understanding of physics. In which case I can only assume that he strongly underestimates the reader, or is a bad pedagogue, or that I'm wrong about him having a reasonable understanding of physics. If he's studied this he should at least be making a higher-level mistake like trying to use high-energy states as information storage without taking into account the massive decoherence problems that arise when your qubits want to radiate via pair production. But no, his proposal literally goes "step one: isolate a gluon of the desired color..."

*** It often has popularizations of scientific/technological topics that leave experts facepalming at the appalling twisting of their material.
