** It was this story which inspired me to create what ultimately became [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DeepRise][deeprise]].

The only real concept that survived was the use of the term Royal and Noble.

But I adored this story.

** I liked Neil Gaiman approach on Lovecraftian horrors. Especaily in the ocean at the end of the lane where it is explained why lovecraftian horrors do not invade our world.

**** It was good, but find it on the cheap if you can. Far too short to be as satisfying a novel as it deserved, in my opinion. I hope he revisits the world soon.
