Summary: There are trainers, and than there are great trainers. This is how I became the very best of them. Join Red and Blue as their rivalry takes them across a very dangerous Kanto in competition for the Grand Championship. Mix of game/anime/manga. Journey!fic Realistic!pok√©mon Realistic!PokemonBattles

Other Info: Influenced from Lamora's Game of Champions,  50CaliberChaos's The Sun Soul, and Vile Slander's The Saga of Kings, amongst many other fics.

In this chapter Red learns a bit of history and attempts to train the scyther with some help.

I hope you guys enjoy!

*** You can follow the story on FFN and mess with your settings so that it sends you a mail whenever it updates, not sure about AO3 but probably something similar is available there as well.
