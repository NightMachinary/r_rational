** You know, I wonder if it is possible to knock Heiress out, tie her up, magically put her to sleep, drain her blood and replace it with some sort of antifreeze(without killing her), after which put her on ice somewhere up north, so as to completely seal off the Heiress Name(since the current keeper isn't yet dead)

*** Eh... if Names run on stories, then perhaps being put on ice like that is enough to drop you out of the story - and thus revoke your Name, which will of course show up in some bastard sister as she enacts her revenge plot. Names seem like the sorts of things to intelligently and visciously bite anybody who tries to mess with them as overtly as that.

**** I got the impression that the Dread Empress simply outlawed the Name, and had anyone who tried to claim it killed. The nobles still think it's possible; Mazus intended to be the Chancellor.

*** Last chapter we have seen the Aprrentice can permanently cripple a name.

I uess if warlock got his hands on one he could wreck some permaenet damage.

So the question is why Black have not criplled all good names?

**** The author clarified [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4o7153/a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_2_chapter_27_cut/d4a83kl][here]] that the damage only applies to Cat, not future Squires.

** I just caught up to this chapter after starting last week. I've been finding this story very good. The best I could compare it to is Worm with the "good to be bad" mantra. So far I like the pacing of this much better as it doesn't feel like it is marching from one world ending crisis to the next. I also like how the Name system allows the story to get cheeky with clich√©s.

At this point in the story I appreciate how Cat isn't immune to permanent consequences of bad decisions. My favorite part though, was the arrow that killed the Hero a few chapters back. That was just gold.
