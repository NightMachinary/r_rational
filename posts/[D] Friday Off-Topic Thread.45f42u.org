Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

**** He's had his first checkup with the pediatrician and is doing well (he's a week old today). He's passed all his tests and doesn't cry much. Sleep isn't too big of an issue, since my wife and I can tag-team it and he goes to bed quickly. Plus he's a newborn, so doesn't do much more than sleep and eat anyway, which means there's lots of downtime for me (some of which is being sucked up by XCOM 2, which I'm near the end of).

I've had no grand epiphanies thus far, though I do feel some mental changes that are probably hormonal instead of grounded in practical reality, meaning mostly anxiety and love, though the former is fading somewhat now.

What was disappointing though was Deadpool freaking out about how he /looks/ and not getting back in touch with his girlfriend right after his escape. It's just that, their meeting scene made me evaluate both of them as people who wouldn't care about someone's looks that much and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance][would expect the same attitude from their partner]] as well.

But the scenarists made getting to that level of trust the whole point of the movie and the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop][credit-roll aesop,]] reducing the film for many to a one-time watch thing --- if even that.

*** If you are desperate to cut down on your sleep and you can set your own work hours, then there is a well-supported method which allows you to only sleep for 2 hours out of a 24 hour period.

It's called the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep][Uberman Sleep]]. It involves sleeping for exactly 20 minutes every 4 hours on the dot. I know one person who did this for a year, but you *have* to keep to this sleep schedule. If you sleep at the wrong time or for too long, or even just skip a nap, you will find it impossibly difficult to get back on track. However, while transitioning may take a few weeks of exhaustion, you will be alert and focused during your waking hours.

EDIT: I probably should be clear about the one person I know who did this. He claimed to have done so and sounded truthful, but he was only someone I met twice so I don't know how trustworthy he was. In addition, there is a lot of articles online that say how it doesn't work while others claim it's success. [[https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/polyphasic][Here's]] an article which argues against it in a fair and calm manner.

**** I want to contradict the last 3 posters. It is an interesting experience, and while yes it can be frightening or disturbing, there is absolutely nothing that will actually harm you. I think there is something to be said for being able to acknowledge fear and other powerful emotions without allowing them to override your behavior; i.e. understanding that what you are experiencing is essentially just an alert signal, and it isn't itself something that must be avoided. If you can find a safe way to practice that skill, I say go for it.

That may not be your motivation, but regardless, the worst that can happen is a few moments of gripping terror, and possibly hallucinating a malevolent demonic entity that wants to devour your soul and/or drag you into the fiery pits of hell. Much more entertaining than horror movies imo.

I experienced lots of this while experimenting with lucid dreaming. In particular I was practicing maintaining consciousness while falling asleep. I would set a timer for an alarm in like 25 mins or so that would wake me up if I actually fell asleep without maintaining consciousness, and repeat about 4-5 times. Only tried it when I could sleep in the next day of course, so not actually depriving myself of sleep. YMMV but maybe something to try.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#OS_support][Windows and Mac OS X support a tiny fraction of what Linux supports out of the box,]] and overlapping cuts that down to just FAT ([[http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/44224][UDF on Windows is fragile]], NTFS-3g is not on OS X by default and it's fucking /freezing Thunar/). FAT doesn't allow distinguishing Posix permissions, so either literally everything on the partition is executable (with a /hard binary patch/ to udisks2d!) or /only files with Windows executable extensions. On LINUX./

I AM FUCKING PISSED.

Is there an actual solution? Has no one invented some sort of ext permissions-mapping file that allows you to mount FAT through an ext pipe? Why are the proprietary platform devs so psychotically NIH that they can't stand to provide access to /literally anything else?/

Platform market share is a goddamn nightmare. If everyone used Linux, there would be no problems in Linux left to say that everyone shouldn't use Linux.

EDIT: I have decided to keep FAT and its stunted permissions (not that I had much of a choice). I can live with long stacks of green filenames.

In terms of a shared backup between multiple computers, you may be best off doing some kind of network backup. I've had success with a linux box acting as an FTP server sitting on the network. This won't give you the ability to back up when you're away from home (unless you have a static IP or something) but should be pretty straightforward.

Is there some way to engender a market of new platforms that themselves engender markets of software without spiraling into combinatorial explosion?

If you don't have admin permissions, you'll be stuck with FAT32 or Dropbox or something AFAIK.

Because industry is often built around enterprise clients, who are willing to maintain an office-wide monoculture, and wanted to move everything onto "the cloud" for safe-keeping anyway, since that was a massive improvement on paying their in-house IT departments to develop in-house solutions.

We are not the end customers of most of the computing industry, not since a combination of open-source competition and cheap, effective piracy cut down on the profit margins from shrink-wrapped software.

*** The industry solution to cross-platform data is to host all the data on a server and less people access it using something like NFS. This actually works very well, /if/ you can guarantee that you can maintain connectivity to your server. Which is basically already demanded by corporate VPNs, so no loss there. In many situations this option has significant extra value for security reasons. You may be able to simulate this by, I don't know, carrying around a Raspberry Pi? Not a great solution.

However, you can do this without the server using virtualization. Many virtualization offerings can pass [[https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#idp46730497510000][partitions]] and [[https://www.howtoforge.com/virtualbox-2-how-to-pass-through-usb-devices-to-guests-on-an-ubuntu-8.10-host][usb devices]] directly through to the guest OS, allowing it to handle the filesystem. This is a relatively lightweight solution for me, since I almost always have at least a headless linux VM around just so I have it if I want to do some quick scripting, but it may not work for you, especially if you can't manage to get a virtualization system running. I think that virtualbox can do both of these and there are ways to get portable virtualboxes. One key realization is that you actually don't need the /same/ VM everywhere; rather, you just need /a/ VM everywhere, and they can be completely different as long as they can take your USB drive or disk partition and run linux.

Another solution, if you want a startup idea that'd be /way/ too hard for the few million dollars you'd make before the NSA acquihired you: combine both of these ideas with the idea of the [[http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-stick-pcs/][stick computer]], but run the entire thing over Thunderbolt instead of HDMI. Run a tiny linux box, provide an NFS share, Thunderbolt means firstly that your NFS share is fast, but secondly and far more importantly that you can do [[https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Sevinsky-Funderbolt-Adventures-in-Thunderbolt-DMA-Attacks-Slides.pdf][DMA attacks]] to get sufficiently low-level HDD access that you can hand it off to the linux box so it can provide it over NFS. This is an awful idea but seems absolutely hilarious.

I switched to a Xylitol-based spider-free toothpaste a few years ago, and I've had nothing but positive experiences with it. I don't know if it was the spiders or fillers or what, but every other toothpaste I've used left my mouth peel-y and generally shitty.

Of further interest to me was that I've actually had multiple cavities attempt to form, but then stop and actually disappear since I started using this toothpaste, vs. the many many fillings I got while using spider-based toothpaste.

*THE SPIDERS JUST GET WORSE FROM HERE*

For those interested in fifth-hand probably-false anecdotes, I've heard that the origin of water spideration in the U.S. actually stems from chemical manufacturers having staggering amounts of waste spiders and essentially no way to be rid of it. Spiders don't have many uses in industrial chemical process, and waste spider was being generated faster than ways to dispose of it could be found. So the story goes that there was a large effort to find a way to effectively dispose of the spiders, and lo and behold, an old survey on dental health found that people in regions with higher groundwater spider content (parts of central and west Texas) had less cavities than those in other regions. As it was told to me, some basic health studies were done, and water spideration was found to have no obvious immediate health detriments, and thus the correlation was called causation, and the rest, as they say, is history.

(muh bodily fluids, etc.)

*Anyway*, [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CMJNO7I][this is the toothpaste I'm using]]. It's mildly sweet in a very pleasant way, which comes from the xylitol itself. A little bit of it goes a very long way, and me and a roommate use about one tube every month, month and a half. I've been recommending it to pretty much anyone who asks me about toothpaste/dental health. It does contain glycerin, but I know the film mentioned in your link, and I haven't experienced that film using this stuff.

Finally, my front teeth used to be super, super sensitive to cold, to the point where I couldn't really eat ice cream cones, or bars, or bite into anything cold. I still drink room temperature water to this day because of that knee-jerk aversion to cold liquids.

Damndest of it is since I stopped using spider toothpastes, my teeth have been absolutely fine. I can bite goddamn ice cubes with my front teeth now. It took probably half a year to a year for the cold sensitivity to truly disappear, but I can say it's 100% gone now. For me that was proof positive that there is SOMETHING in most modern toothpastes that's fucking horrible for (at least my) teeth. Probably all the industrial-waste spiders they pack it with.

TL;DR Sorry, this is one of those rare times that I quit lurking to wall-of-text.

Also don't underestimate how much high end infrastructure engineering goes into designing the 'path' of a theme park.

The biggest complaints I actually have for theme parks is that they don't have as much lavish awesome attention to detail as they COULD have.

But ya if the same degree of engineering and aesthetic mood improving experience went into every city street and every suburb as goes into disneyland and theme park experiences the world would probably have happier people in it.

/Shit/ it is. It's a nonstop sensory overload of duplicitous sell-you-stuff bullshit, and it drives me mad every time I expose myself.

And I really, really love waterslides and rollercoasters and even those low-key rides where you get strapped into a chair that swings around an elliptical centrifugal arc /and it's like your flying/. Oh, and the actual centrifuges where you defy gravity temporarily because you're pressed too hard against the walls.

But seriously, I will march a horde of Orks at any attempt to tile the universe in the capitalist bullshit associated with current theme parks, and then I will rebuild them as glorious socialist theme parks, where you don't have to Adult so damn hard your whole time there and can actually relax and enjoy it.

Won't it just be nicer when the only cosplayers are the people who /want/ to cosplay, as whatever they like? When you don't have to shlep a 5kg bag of sandwiches and water bottles around /all damn day/ because there's actually affordable or free supplies for keeping yourself going /available/ instead of having unhealthy, bad-tasting, overexpensive crap pushed on you? When the games aren't rigged? When cheap souvenirs aren't being pushed?

But anyway, yeah, army of Orks. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Because that is how I react to being told that the future should be tiled in the lowest dreck of late-capitalism.

I'm noodling with the idea of a protagonist setting up a new blockchain and bitcoin-like currency, to have something cash-like to start a prediction market with. Anyone know enough on the topic to recommend one style of blockchain over another, or clever tricks that could be applied to the design; or know a subreddit, reference, third-party, or other thingummy that might help?

*** Are you also interested in designs of the prediction market itself? I'm not really an expert but I have been searching about that recently. The best explanation about market makers I could find was from the Augur project. LMSR (Hansons Algorithm) and an adaption of that. Augur is also interesting in itself because it is decentralised. Harder to shut down for your protagonists enemies (if any).

*** You know, if the end goal of the protagonist is to forecast well, perhaps there are more effective solutions than a prediction market. Tetlock covers one compelling alternative in Superforecasting.

The book's about this team that (strongly, consistently, with growing margins over time) won a 4-year long, rigorous forecasting tournament. Anyway, along the way, they ran many RCTs testing various hypotheses like 'do teams of forecasters perform better than individual forecasters', and 'does a specially curated team of forecasters beat out prediction markets'. Well, turns out such a team did outperform a prediction market. It was constructed by taking the top performers based on results of a pretty rigorous metric (Brier score, which measures forecasting accuracy) from a large sample and putting them together in a team. It raises important questions about the efficacy of prediction markets when this approach so handily beat out alternatives. Maybe the prediction market under test wasn't fully incorporating real costs/incentives, but I imagine some more RCTs can uncover that.

I'm still uncertain but it did downshift my belief that prediction markets, if constructed well, are optimal at forecasting accuracy. I'm more like 60:40 in favor of this 'superforecasting team' technique, but just haven't read enough to gain more confidence.

That is, indeed, the goal. And alternatives to prediction markets, such as the Delphi method ( [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method]] ), will be considered, and possibly even experimented with.

That's been on my to-read list for a while, but you've just convinced me to move it to the top of the pile. :)

That said, my protagonist is going to have at least one major difficulty applying what you describe: The only people he has to draw on are himself, and copies of himself. I've already pencilled in a failure of the prediction market due to an overconfident consensus, and attempts to deliberately nudge the copies into different headspaces... and I'm considering more severe, arguably less ethical experimentation later on.

***** I have read the book and can recommend it. Solid advice on how to improve forecasts.

The thing to keep in mind is I think that Tetlock tries to improve the accuracy of the US intelligence community and not accuracy in general. That probably involves a lot of politics. Prediction markets are still the best bet IMHO (pun intended).

In case you haven't seen it yet here are two articles on slatestarcodex about this book.

**** The prediction market that participated in this competition was DAGGRE by Robin Hanson.

[[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/12/at-loooooong-last.html]]

The people behind the competition (IARPA) seem to be prejudiced against betting and crowds of forecasters in favor of experts.

Only paying for participation and not for accuracy was allowed (which is the whole point of a prediction market).

Also everything that can give you an edge in a prediction market (Delphi Method, Insider Knowledge, Superforecasters, etc ...) can be used to gain money by improving the accuracy of the market.
