A little while ago over on Questionable Questing, Questingdragon, the author of [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/][The Sins of Cinnamon]] started a quest in that same universe to expand upon the lore of the world they're in. After about 45k words it entered a hiatus that has just ended today. Check it out [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-days-of-thyme.9683/][here]]


** It lives! Thanks for the heads up. Both of these are /great/.

Days of Thyme is an active quest, city building/managment, with voting and dice rolls to determine outcomes. They play in the same game-overlay fantasy world and have great prose.

Endorsement quote: "Reality strains to remain backwards compatible with you."

** The site keeps forcing me to create an account. Is there a way to read this anonymously?

*** Nope, QQ restricts the NSFW half of things to people who've signed up, in order to avoid drama mongering from its sister sites.

** Is it a sequel? Do you need to read /The Sins of Cinnamon/? I started reading that a while back but stopped because it read like the Erogamer and I was reluctant to inflict that kind of angst on myself.

*** Its not a sequel. /Sins/ is paused, /Thyme/ will for now be used for worldbuilding and later /Sins/ is supposed to finish. Its not clear wether these two are concurrent in-world or not.

/Sins/ starts out with a bit of progressive sex stuff but later these parts take a really small role over the whole awesome dungeon fighting.

*** What part of The Erogamer was too angsty for you? (After reading Stephen R. Donaldson books, normal levels of angst barely register any more...)

**** Just to be clear, I meant angst in its actual definition, not as a colloquial synonym for edgy teen stuff or doom n gloom. But specifically, it's the philosophy of sex masqueraded as litRPG. It's just weird and anxiety-inducing for me. I still read it but it's something I have to be in the mood for.

***** Oh, I thought you meant in-story angst, like Cindy's internalized shame at being fat and the characters worrying about what's happening to the world and reality as a result of the Erogame's influence.

** Oh hey, this updated. I was really liking it, so I'm glad it's not dead.

I still feel like it's still in the early stages, somehow.
