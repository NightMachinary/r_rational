The latest chapter, "Look Both Ways," can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/66202159][here]].

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

*This series is being posted in various places:*

** I love this series, but as I recommended it to a friend the other day I struggled to properly explain why. Part of it is the worldbuilding of course, everything seems thought through and both taking from and building on canon in clever ways. But there is something else that is really drawing me in - I can't tell if it's the story or writing style or what, I'm just absorbed when reading. I'll try to figure it out, but for now I'll just say kudos and please keep writing.

My favorite detail so far is the Roman Wizarding Republic - "not Roman, not really a Republic, but at least a Wizarding" is how it remember it going. Funny and clever.

**** Yes.

(For anyone who isn't aware, it's a quote by Voltaire: "The Holy Roman Empire was neither Holy nor Roman, nor an Empire." The Wizarding Roman Republic, on the other hand, is not Roman, and not much of a republic, but at least has wizards.)

"Other Faces" is more like a collection, but folks have bookmarked it so I'm reluctant to just dissolve it.

(I'll probably reach out to the people who've bookmarked and let them know I'm reorganizing things)

Now that I'm out of grad school, probably the only thing that'll actually kill this story is just...not getting any kind of reader engagement (which seems unlikely, because engagement has been pretty steady). There's a risk of burnout too, I guess, but the publishing rate gives me enough breathing room to work on other projects too (at present: an original fiction novel, some worldbuilding resources, and another Harry Potter AU that'll be /much/ shorter than TINTF).

*** Might I recommend Birds of a Feather? Sadly probably abandoned but it's 46 chapters of at least equivalent writing quality and some great if in a much smaller scope of worldbuilding. Much more of a character piece than this though

*** Reductionism, with respect to personal identity, is the idea that "the self" doesn't exist. Put simply, what we call "the self" is /reducible/ to simpler components.

What this boils down to is that Tom Riddle's desire to never die is perfectly compatible with his apparent death (in the conventional sense), because he chooses to identify himself not as "a particular subjective point of view" but as a /pattern/, and not simply as a pattern predominantly composed of experiences and memories (as most reductionists would) but as a pattern predominantly composed of beliefs and values (what we might call "Death Eater-ism").

The most thorough work on (identity) reductionism is probably Derek Parfit's /Reasons and Persons/, but you could probably commit murder with a hardcover edition, so I would recommend /Personal Identity and Buddhism/ by Mark Siderits for a more approachable work that isn't (checks book) 500+ pages with a tiny font.

(This is my attempt to explain some of what's going on with Riddle without (a) spoiling future story developments or (b) writing a dissertation on the topic, which I guess could be fun but... I'd say "but it probably wouldn't be of interest to anybody here," except that I said that about the Margaret Thatcher letter and was proven wrong on that count, lol)
