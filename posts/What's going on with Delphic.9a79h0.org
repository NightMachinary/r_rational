** Not vanished, I promise.

I'm 1700 words into Chapter 12. Chapter 15 is what should be publishing tomorrow, so I'm three and a half chapters behind.

And, yes, that's a real "behind," because I have four Patreon patrons and I promised them a chapter a week. As long as at least one person is sending me money, this is a real obligation.

I'd feel worse about it, though, if I had more patrons. To be explicit, the guilt formula is:

G = c*[ln(n) - 1]

For c the number of chapters behind, and n the number of patrons. If I don't complete and publish Chapter 12 in the next two hours, my guilt will jump from 1.16 to 1.55. But a single additional patron being added would further increase the guilt to 2.44.

*** Guilt is great and all but what's the correlation between guilt and speed of release?

What about speed of release and chapter quality?

**** The machine learning algorithm is hard to decipher, but I think G is strongly signaled in the fitness function for raising priority of writing over other creative activities and hobbies.

I don't "push through" just to get a chapter released. As far as I can tell, the chapters don't significantly vary in quality. If you feel otherwise please provide feedback.

** I've been waiting for the thread, can't wait for the next chapter.

With the passing of Aeromancer (???) and disappearence of Bone-Blood-Sinue or whatever, it's down to APGTE and Worth the Candle for me more or less.

** The author claims it is just a temporary falling behind schedule [[https://delphicserial.com/2018/07/29/interlude-rebirth/#comment-203]]

I hadn't noticed the demise of Aeromancer, though, and for a reason that doesn't sit well in the context of rational fiction. I'm quite disappointed.

*** Aeromancer posted his drafts for 14-17 and the outline for the rest of the story though. At least we get that.

** Tangential question. Why is this thread getting downvoted by some people?

I still don't have a good sense as to what downvotes signal.

*** I didn't downvote, but my guess would be a combination of the meta-element (this isn't posting a rational story so much as /about/ a rational story) and an attempt to discourage badgering authors.
