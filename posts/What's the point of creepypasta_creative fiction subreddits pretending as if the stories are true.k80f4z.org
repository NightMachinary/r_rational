** Because it's fun? Don't throw shade at SCP until you've seriously immersed yourself into the deep lore.

** This is a strange question to ask on a subreddit dedicated to fiction that aspires to an arbitrary notion of realism.

I can ask you: What's the point of "hard" science fiction? It's all made up anyway.

The answer to both of our questions is that for fans of the respective genres, the heightened sense of realism helps create a more immersive experience.

** Kayfabe helps preserve verisimilitude?

As an interactive medium, the internet can make all of us participants of a story. You don't see the characters in Nightmare on Elm Street violating the rules of their crazy upside down universe.

Do you not like games?

** If it's obvious that the stories are fiction, then what's the problem? Do you want every SCP post to have a disclaimer every 100 words saying “THIS STORY OF A HORRIFIC PARANORMAL ARTIFACT IN A SUPER SECRET FACILITY ISN'T REAL?”

** It makes it easier to voluntarily suspend disbelief for a little while so you can get spooked out.

** What's the point of breaking the fourth wall?? Like if your format allows for it or is enhanced by it than.... good I guess. But that's like asking why your video game characters don't attempt to fight off your efforts to control them and scream for you to leave their bodies alone and stop manipulating them.

Because it'd be absurdly jarringly out of place in the medium that the story's being told in. It's like asking how the narrator of a story knows what the characters are thinking. Pointless

*** hmm... that might actually be an amazing game concept, depending on the execution.

**** It would be tricky to pull off correctly, but it's definitely a neat gimmick for a little indie project.

** Because humans don't naturally have separate concepts of "fictional" and "truth", the concept of "canon" is a fairly recent invention, and humans dont on a hardware level actually make a distinction between metaphorical and literal reality. All of these things are things that need to be /invented/ and /learned/, and the distinctions lapse if you don't pay attention or the context is even slightly ambiguous. Even questioning this only makes sense to a certain kind of highly trained mind.

** I have always just assumed that it was an integral part of that specific sub-genre of horror. part of the enjoyment seems to come from the idea that, while you are reading, you can convince yourself that it is real. sort of like with professional wrestling: it isn't important if a fan knows or doesn't that it is fictional; the important part is that they can convince their brain that it is real for the duration of the performance. viewed from that perspective, it isn't really that surprising that some amount of people are actually unaware of the fictional nature of those subs.

you've got to remember that, for people who don't have a concrete grasp of the limitations of human memory, semi-magical things like an entire restaurant appearing or disappearing overnight do seem to occur. it's the same principle by which deliberate gaslighting works. you make a suggestions about the nature of reality, and people will reflexively search their memory for things which would make that statement true. it is pretty easy to match memory failure artifacts with a whole bunch of spooky or just plain magical happenings.

** Anything on the internet could be false unless there is a LOT of associated proof that is difficult or (preferably) impossible to fake. I don't think there is any real compelling reason to pretend anything is true (including this comment) unless it enhances the entertainment value.
