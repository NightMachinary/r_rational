They've had an omnipotent wish granting dragon for at least a few decades, but on Namek there doesn't seem to be any sign of the Dragon Balls use.

The only idea that makes sense to me is that a long while ago a Namekian wished to know about souls, afterlife, etc, then wished for all Namekians to automatically go to heaven when they die. Then, they or someone else wished for the Namekian regeneration, so now you have a society of people who have complete definitive proof they have eternal paradise awaiting them and regeneration which means their whole lives will be comfortable until they get there. Which is sort of a utopia. Some other Namekian/Namekians might also have made wishes to ensure that the afterlives themselves would never be damaged, which could explain the ridiculous levels of luck Goku and the Dragon Ball cast have when protecting the universe..

​

EDIT: To clarify, I'm saying that Namekian DO have a utopia, and it's BECAUSE of the Dragon Balls and worst comes to worst they know there's another uptopia awating them when they die because of another wish and this one won't ever be threatened because of a wish to ensure the universe will always be saved from danger, which might explain how the universe constantly gets saved at the last second in Dragon Ball. Also, maybe the reason Piccolo and the other Namekian didn't wish for immortality was because they genuinely knew they had a utopia awaiting them when they died so they didn't really /want/ immortality.


** We've got no evidence to suggest namekians don't have their own utopia , and no evidence they needed to wish for it. We see no land predators or extreme weather events (until a hole gets punched into the planet's core.) No overpopulation, disease, or anything else, they just hang out. The only namekian who shows any real signs of any sort of infirmity is the super obese one. Very tiny farms are seen but I'm guessing they only eat when they feel like it. As a species, they can merge with one another fairly easily, and can live for a really long time, reproduce asexually, and are utterly without ambition. Kami actively purges desire from himself to create piccolo. Maybe they wished themselves this way, to not need anything due to causing trouble with the infinite cosmic power of the dragonball and getting slapped down by the legitimate gods of the universe, or maybe they've never needed anything. Namekians are alien as fuck.

TBF, canonically, the Namekian race was almost exterminated by an extended drought. That's when Piccolo was sent to Earth (well, the Namekian who would then split into Kami and Piccolo). Guru was the only survivor who then repopulated the planet.

*** Alternatively, perhaps it is not that Namekians live in any sort of Utopia-in-the-world, but perhaps that they all have some religion similar to Buddhism, and have all† achieved the equivalent of Buddhist enlightenment. So nobody would have any real desires to change the way they are; nobody would be actively thinking or inventing stuff; nobody would see any reason to be in conflict with one-another; etc. It would give rise to a social milieu reminiscent of a Utopia... but there would still be, well, disease and predation and stuff. It's just that nobody would see this as a problem. This all seems to match the way they live quite closely.

To the degree that Dragonball is a Journey-to-the-West retelling, Namek /is/ “the West”, i.e. the parts of India where Buddhism originates.

And what better place for a [[https://www.uexpress.com/tell-me-a-story/2001/1/28/the-dragons-pearl-an-ancient-chinese][dragon to hide its pearls]], than on a planet where nobody wants anything?

† King Piccolo, who lives in a cave and has over 10,000 desires each day, is an outlier and should not be counted.

**** Actually, it was calculated that King Piccolo had 58,405,479 and a half desires each day. Roughly 41 thousand per second. He personally justifies the existence of HFIL.

** Well, Namekians have a very long lifespan, they reproduce asexually, and they only require water to survive and don't need to eat solids (though they are able). And like you said, they regenerate. The only health problems seem to come from extreme old age.

They have no wars and no ethnicities. There are only two types of Namekians: warriors and mystic members of the Dragon Clan. Evil Namekians only exist because of King Piccolo who in turn was born out of Kami. In other words, excluding Piccolo, evil entities literally don't exist among Namekians.

Namekians need and desire nothing that their watery planet doesn't already offer them -- a planet that in itself poses no threat to their existence. Their life seemed pretty damn utopistic until Freeza blew it up.

*** Yeah, my thinking was that it's so utopian BECAUSE they have Dragon Balls. I.e. someone wished for all of those things, world peace, health, extremely long youth.

** They might have religious reasons not to use them. They also might have everything they need right now, and are cognisant of the cooldown period of ~140 days - they might want to keep them available for a crisis, like a meteor or a plague.

They didn't use them against Frieza, but maybe he just attacked too quickly for them to respond?

This, probably. When the old Kaioshin is brought back from the Z-Sword, he's shocked to learn there are Dragon Balls on Earth, he says that the Dragon Balls 'only bring chaos' and that their use was only allowed to the Namekians because they were 'the wisest race in the Universe'. So the implication was that the Namekians would be contented and wise enough /not/ to use the Dragon Balls, just to be their custodians in the event of a major crisis.

** To the various things already said I'll add that the Namekians possess nothing like a Dragon Radar, and they're extremely small in number. Granted, perhaps they could wish for one, but I wonder if the Dragon would grant that - if it would, it'd be pretty close to "wishing for infinite wishes" levels of munchkinry.

Though at the end of the Buu saga apparently they did manage to gather the Dragon Balls all on their own, even though it should be basically impossible, so who knows.

*** There are 6 namekian village tribes, each village elder has custody of a dragonball and guru has the 7th. Since they can sense energy it would be trivial to gather the dragonballs together from each of the clans. How they find them again after a wish is granted is not explained, it seems that the planet namek is written to be tiny as only 150 people live on it and the villages didn't seem as far apart as they would be on Earth.

Yeah, that was my point. I can understand how they'd find them over centuries of them being scattered if everyone knows what they look like and they're supposed to bring them to the closest village elder when they find one, but it doesn't seem like it could be done /efficiently/ without a radar. At the time of the Buu saga I'd have imagined the Balls would be scattered, since they had been used multiple times after the Namek mess, and the last wish was to teleport everyone to Neo Namek. But perhaps when they teleported they appeared all bunched up.

(I mean, who am I kidding, Toriyama simply didn't bother thinking that through XD. But yeah)

**** Hm, good question. Now that you mention it I'm not sure it was ever shown on screen.

EDIT: here: [[https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_(object)]] it says they don't scatter. But then mentions nothing about the source, and the main Namekian Dragon Ball article says that they're simply "never shown" to scatter in the series (but they're shown to do so in the video games, though of course that's of arguable canonicity).
