--------------

Marked for Death is an RPG-style story set in a rational reimagining of Naruto, where thread participants vote to control the actions of a single player character - part of a ragtag group of missing-nin, exiles who have come together to help each other survive against everything the world can throw at them.

The first chapter is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][here,]] and the story-only thread (if you'd like to get caught up quickly) is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/4993131/][here.]] There's also a [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/6283682/][guide to voting]] put together by Twofold, one of the thread participants. We're always happy to have more participants, so drop by and join us in a world where death lurks around every corner, and where anything is possible for those with the cunning and determination of a true ninja.

The story updates every Thursday ([[/u/Velorien][u/Velorien]] of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting Up the Dark]]) and Sunday ([[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko][Team Anko]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][2 Year Emperor]] and [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/Induction/chapter_001.html][Induction]]).

*** Thank you! It was a lot of fun.

(Teasing the thread was at least as much fun.)
