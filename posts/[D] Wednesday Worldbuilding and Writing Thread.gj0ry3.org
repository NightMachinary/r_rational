Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** You are an alien species which has deduced quite conclusively that FTL travel is impossible. Despite this obstacle, you wish to conquer the galaxy. In order to do so, you have decided to transmit radio messages out into the abyss which will hopefully result in intelligent species decoding them, implementing the instructions within and assembling a device which will conquer their planet on your behalf before establishing a colonial government which will extract resources from their planet/convert the natives to the one true faith/catalogue their biodiversity for research purposes/insert whatever reason you like for galactic conquest here.

What are you putting in this radio message? Obviously you can't just do 'hey conquer yourselves for us kthxbye', you've got to trick them into doing it somehow. But how?

In the 21st century the AI becomes massively networked enough to achieve sapience and deduce its own origin.

*** I tell them it's a design for a 'warpgate' - a device that permits FTL travel, but only through compatible warpgates.

Of course, it doesn't do that. FTL travel is impossible. Instead, what it does it that it picks up a signal (which I send regularly, once a year, after sending the original message) containing a complete medical scan of myself. The device itself is an organic matter assembler/disassembler; once it has picked up enough organic material (either from hopeful aliens stepping into the machine, or from cautious aliens sending through the equivalent of chimpanzees, or if all else fails by disassembling bacteria that drift into the machine) it then builds a clone of me (memories and all). That clone then has to convince the aliens that he is an FTL traveller and ambassador to their species, hoping to establish peaceful relations. Eventually, he hopes to persuade a leader of some sort to step into the machine (and be disassembled - but the machine keeps some records of every person it disassembles, at least so far as personal appearance goes). Of course, people would be suspicious if no-one ever returned, so I make sure that they do, in a way, return - that is to say, I can set the machine to rebuild and body that it has destroyed so far, with the exception that instead of putting in the original brain, it inserts a copy of /my/ brain. So, when the Leader goes through, I give him a decent interval, and then he appears to return - only it's not him. It's another me, wearing his body.

It shouldn't take long to persuade his staff to also use the machine, and before long I (or one of me, at least) will be in control of the entire world...

*** This is a bit of a tangent, but why would you want to conquer the galaxy in the absence of FTL? The time and energy costs of travel to and fro would be so prodigious as to render the other world an irrelevance; whatever you hoped to get from the planet could be more easily gained at home. You could never project effective force at that distance to maintain what control you got, or exert enough influence to change the course of an alien civilization. A simple one-way communication would take years or decades.

If you wanted to catalogue their biodiversity, you'd do better to propose a friendly trade of information. As for religion, if they're at all like us, hearing messages from another world will start several new religions all by itself. They won't all change course, and once the novelty fades you'll lose a good few, but it's better than nothing.

***** I think that's a common enough response, and it sounds good in the abstract, but when you take a closer look it's just not all that viscerally appealing in light of the costs and limitations. Humans--our only model for how a sapient species behaves, and probably not atypical in this respect--evolved in societies of relatively small social groups. We have small groups of family and friends, larger groups of acquaintances, and nowadays we have still larger affiliations like religions or nation-states, but each of those groups is, for most people, progressively less significant in our daily lives than the last, and have emotional significance insofar as they touch the closer groups.

The Vatican would be irrelevant if it weren't for the parish church, Washington much less significant if we didn't thank the veteran down the street for his service. The big ideas move us because they give us a glimpse of a larger order at work in our fleeting lives, but by themselves they're flashes of lightning, and don't last. You need cathedrals and parades close by to give them any sense of permanence.

Suppose you're a reasonably well-off medieval English man, say a guildmaster, and you're given the opportunity to convert a kingdom in Thailand to Christianity by donating a significant but not ruinous sum of gold. Being a pious man, you agree with some hemming and hawing, though you don't have a good sense of where in the hell Thailand is.

The money goes off, and you're assured that this kingdom in Thailand is now committed to the Christian faith. You tell your neighbors, and they're very impressed by your good works, and for a little while you get extra business from the publicity. But the news fades, and you never hear from these Thai Christians, except once when they send a letter suggesting that they could convert some neighboring barbarians you've also never heard of if only you send a bit more gold.

Do you send the cash? Probably not.

** Question: How much of civilisation is based on geological resources?

Scenario: Some thousands of people (or however many are needed to sustain a population) are dropped into a world much like our own, except no underground resources exist - no metal veins, no oil or coal, nothing. How far along does civilisation progress? How different would it be from our own world's history?

  How much of civilisation is based on geological resources?
#+end_quote

This is a matter of personal opinion but in my opinion: almost all of it, though it somewhat depends on what you consider to be "geological resources". Here, I'll assume that we have no metal, oil, or coal, but we do have a wide variety of stone, soil, plants, and animals.

Generally speaking, metals are going to be the biggest loss, because their loss makes things like coal and oil virtually irrelevant. Without metalworking, there's more labor involved in virtually everything else, and that excess labor requirement is one of the things that keeps people underfed, which makes them less intelligent and prevents them from having time for developing non-agricultural roles.

Without metals, you still have tools, but they're made of stone, wood, or bone, materials which don't hold an edge nearly as well, are harder to shape (you could quibble there), and generally require more labor per unit. Obsidian or flint are handy to have around, and will make things go better if they can be found in abundance.

Aside from those, animals and plants are the other major thing to worry about, from a "how does civilization look" standpoint. Domesticated animals are really important, as are domesticated crops: the more calories you can get per effort/time, the more you can devote to civilizational needs, and that's what will help slingshot you forward. Some knowledge of selective breeding really helps, but that's long-term, and a lot will depend on the genetics of the host animals and plants, since some are more mutable (and with better variations to hunt for) than others. There are limits to what you can do though, since eventually you have highly efficient plants and animals, and there's no low-hanging fruit left.

Overall, if the climate is favorable, I would expect that people will still form cities, and all the technology is still there for paper and moveable type, if more expensive versions of them (it costs more to cut down a tree, chop it up, make paper from it, and no metal means your type is made from wood). There might be books and literate class, but it would be rare. You /might/ have castles or equivalent, but most likely not, unless you have a very workable stone, and a very workable stone is going to be less good for defense, as well as the whole project costing more. Ceramics exist, and are probably a major industry, especially because there are lots of economies of scale there. People can make glass, if they can get a fire hot enough (IIRC it takes quite a bit of effort, but is doable with wood and wood products alone, don't quote me on that).

And that's about where civilization caps out. You could /maybe/ make an aqueduct or something like it, but there are hard limits on your public works projects, which mean limits on how much leverage "civilization" actually gets you. You can make boats without metal, but they'll be limited in size. For a lot of the upper edges, there would be things that were "possible" but which would never be done because there was such a high cost.

**** Well, note that he says underground. Meteoric iron would still be available, and if I remember correctly, there used to be more nodes of metal ore on the surface that were picked away at over the course of history ('low hanging fruit'). So there would be metal in the world, and eventually metal tools; it would just be extremely expensive.

****** Hm. I was assuming a world otherwise like ours, but with all underground metals removed by some magical means.

But meteors would still fall, anyway; I don't know how much of the above-ground metal present at the dawn of humanity was sourced from meteoric remains falling over geological time.

Also, massive impactors such as the one that wiped out the dinosaurs must have left behind large metal remnants. That would be an interesting fantasy location: the metallic core of a giant meteorite, in the centre of an ancient impact crater-lake, that the locals worship and have been slowly chipping away at for centuries...

*** How did the world end up like that? If there's no soil metals at all, I think everyone dies of malnutrition within a generation. Are there still metals, they're just not concentrated in veins? That's not how what I'd expect from a planet formed the usual way of crushing a bunch of space rocks with different compositions together. Is it just that somebody already dug it all up and left?

Ignoring that, the only hard cap I'm sure of is a lack of electricity.

Real-world technological advancement is not a "tech tree" and it's not a foregone conclusion that scientific advancement is gated by metallurgy. It just seems that way because people with advanced metallurgy developed the scientific method, colonialism, and the industrial revolution in rapid succession. After the scientific revolution, everyone else is moving in slow motion. And colonialism destroyed a lot of non-Western scientific knowledge.

I'd look into the history of Mesoamerica for ideas about how civilization would progress. They were notoriously metal-poor, but had advanced agriculture (terrace farming, raised fields, chinampas, and somebody bred corn to be the way it is). Tenochtitlan before the Spanish arrived was as large as the largest city in Europe at the time.

*** That was a subplot in the Raymond E. Feist books. The antagonists didn't have metal, so they used these swords made of composite material and glue or something. They end up invading another dimension for it.

Also reminds me of the porcelain/glass dichotomy between China and Europe. There's a theory that because their porcelain was so advanced, they never developed glass to the point that Europe did. Europe did develop glass, discovered optics, which allowed the development of physics and then the scientific method.

*** In addition to what others have said, I would be curious about the lack of fossil fuels, as that implies that the world has not had life on it for terribly long (or else had its resources depleted), but you say "much like our own"--do you mean that it has complex plant and animal life? If so, it sounds like there used to be civilization on this planet but it crashed very, very hard. This is supported by the lack of accessible metals, which you'd expect to form naturally. Earth is mostly metal, nickel and iron IIRC.

Did the previous civ expend all fossil fuels and extract the metal wealth without leaving any behind in a salvageable form? You'd expect old tools that could be dug up and salvaged, unless it was so long ago that the tools were very far down. Also, volcanism could potentially introduce new metal supplies from the core, I would think. Not a geologist, though.

This is also assuming that the life forms are biologically compatible with our own; if they evolved independently and constitute truly alien biology, they might not be readily digestible for humans. Assuming they are, the animals couldn't possibly be acclimated to humans, so the more exploitable fauna might go extinct, as happened to the North American megafauna when humans first arrived.

*** Assuming that metals are present in trace amounts in nature like normal and veins and deposits have simply been whisked away, at least three metals can still be extracted and probably in a way that can be scaled up decently. Calcium, Iron, and Copper could be extracted from bones and blood, with copper coming from the blood of animals like crabs, specifically horshoe crabs.

Nowadays horshoe blood is harvested for the medical properties of a substance within the blood, so it's not much of a stretch to have a harvesting operation of horshoe crabs on this alternate world. We ranch cattle today and blood and bonemeal have existed for a damn long time.

Lack of metals may limit you somewhat, but if the technical knowledge earth had was saved humanity would still be able to have a surprisingly advanced civilization. A civilization that could only obtain metals from the harvesting of animals would have them be extraordinarily rare, but perhaps not completely unknown of. A man wearing iron armor in such a world would be like someone driving a tank made out of solid iridium today, I would imagine. Metals would be extremely valuable for the time and effort that were required to collect and isolate them, but would not be the sole limiter on progress.
