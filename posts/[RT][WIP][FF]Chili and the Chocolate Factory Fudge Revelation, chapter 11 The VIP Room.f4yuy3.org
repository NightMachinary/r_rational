If they did use kilometres it wouldn't be spelled as meters. That's American spelling. The UK spell it as metre, centre, etc

*** It manages to have the vibe where almost anything could happen an I'd go "yeah, that makes sense, I can see that fitting into the narrative".

It's also good how we have several one-joke characters in the cast and none of them have overdone their joke - or at least not overdone it in a nonfunny way.

Though, 'except for Mahuika, who helped pass the time by sharing a fun fact about herself' was a good one.

It's a perfectly reasonable misunderstanding, though.

  "What!?" exclaimed Mr. Bucket. "You can't kill them! They're too valuable, and poaching and hunting birds is always wrong! Always! Always! I will never contradict myself on this specific topic!"

Are we going to meet Danny? I hope this is more than just a cheeky reference, because I have a large fondness for that book.

Some bits of HPMOR and the first two chapters of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/burn-up-worm-complete.395526/][Burn-up]] are what comes to mind for me. Anyone have other thoughts?

*** Well, objectively this was the worst room so far because the grass wasn't made out of chocolate. The terribleness of the room doesn't carry over to the quality of the chapter, though! I enjoyed this chapter every bit as much as the other chocolates in this box we call a story.

  The sky was a dark gr[redacted]y col[redacted]r.

which is a joke about British vs. American spelling. No one knows whether Wonkaland is in England or America, so they don't know whether the sky is a "grey colour" or a "gray color".
