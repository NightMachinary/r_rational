** Subbed, and will +probably+ almost definitely make use of it at some point. I mean, honestly, you can't always just leave fictional characters with your own skillsets.

** Offtopic. Reddit's voting algorithms really befuddle me sometimes. A moment ago this was at "11: 88% upvoted". I upvoted it and reloaded, now it says "14: 100% upvoted" Assuming that two more upvotes came in at the same time as mine, how do you go from 88% upvoted to 100%?

(I know, vote fuzzing. I just wish they'd be consistent about their numbers.)
