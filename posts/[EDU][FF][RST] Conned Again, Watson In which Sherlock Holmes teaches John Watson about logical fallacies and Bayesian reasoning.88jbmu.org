[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1130873][/Conned Again, Watson/]], a work of officially-sanctioned and traditionally-published Sherlock Holmes fanfiction, consists of twelve short stories. Each story has a paragraph or three of explanation (sometimes including book recommendations) in the book's afterword.

After inheriting a cab business, Watson's cousin James attempted to emulate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor]["how the Americans have reduced company management to a science"]]. However, he botched it so badly that his company was nearing bankruptcy. He then was taken in by a con man. Watson encourages him to go to Holmes regarding the con, and Holmes informs James that he was such a perfect "mark" that the con man probably will approach him again, at which point Holmes will aid in the criminal's capture. Holmes then inquires as to how James actually implemented the "modern American management methods".

Afterward, Holmes points out how Watson has replicated his cousin's errors on a smaller scale in his shopping for groceries.

  [Sherlock:] "Perhaps people unconsciously assume that Fortune has a finite number of outcomes in the sack of black and white pebbles she arries. Then the more black pebbles you are dealt, the higher the proportion of white remain in her sack, and the more likely you are to get white. But in truth her supply is infinite, and she can always continue to give black or white at perfect whim. Failure to understand that is the first great human fallacy in misunderstanding the Laws of Chance.[...]

  "The second great fallacy is to think that you can ignore a very tiny change of a very large loss or gain. A mathematician would warn you of the meaninglessness of multiplying zero by infinity, but we did not have to venture into such abstractions to see that the Marquis's second system would have come to grief eventually."

The ageing (and seemingly-benign) leader of a small cult seeks Holmes's help. According to her faith, she must bequeath her "church" to a descendant of her great-grandfather (the cult's founder). She has 61 candidates. However, the 61st, an infidel who mocks the cult, lives in Canada, and has written back to say that there are 59 more descendants in Canada. The cult leader must choose which candidate is the best, based on which of them has a particular mystically-significant birthday.

The Canadian relative sends over a list of birthdays, but refuses to give the corresponding names and addresses. Instead, the Canadian insists that the cult leader must tell the mystically-significant date to the Canadian, after which the Canadian will contact whichever American relative matches it. However, it's the cult leader's suspicion that there are no other American relatives, and the Canadian is plotting to take over the church (using a non-relative accomplice with a fake birthday) and milk its followers for money. The cult leader wants to know whether or not the Canadian's list of birthdays looks fake, and gives to Holmes two lists of birthdays---one for the 60 British candidates, and one for the 60 alleged American candidates, but neither is marked. She expects Holmes to tell her which one "looks suspicious /in its very nature/".

  [Sherlock:] "Not a bad simile, Watson: real randomness is a sharp and spiky place, which will cut the unwary as surely as sharp rocks rip apart the boots and hands of the ill-equipped cave explorer. We are unaccustomed to such roughness because processes human and artificial so often give nonrandom pattern to the world we encounter, and uniformity is a simple pattern to generate, and therefore commonplace."[...]

  Holmes raised a long finger. "Never mistake uniformity for the product of randomness.[...] But you are not alone in your error: mistaking a uniform distribution for a random one is a common blunder. Indeed, it is worthy of being tagged as the third great human fallacy in misunderstanding the Laws of Chance! You had better start making a list. It is as ever most instructive to talk to you, Watson."

However, he recently took out a large life insurance policy, with his sister as the sole beneficiary. The insurance company suspects fraud, and refuses to pay out. Inspector Lestrade is sympathetic toward the sister, and has asked Holmes to investigate.

  "Quite so, Watson. You have indeed chosen a fitting name for the Normal Distribution. Just as Napoleon sought to conquer all the populations he encountered, so the 'Napoleon's hat' curve tends to dominate all random populations encountered in nature. But remember this: Napoleon ultimately failed in his quest---he never ruled /all/ of Europe, despite his ambition. And similarly, not /every/ imaginable population conforms to the normal distribution, although student mathematicians sometimes fall into the trap of thinking that all must."

  [Holmes] ticked off points on his fingers. "First, you showed us how the human eye and brain can detect pattern where there is none. It is understandable design by evolution, for it is better to be frightened by ten shadows than to overlook one actual tiger, but it often trips us up in modern life.

  "Second, there is the fallacy of retrodiction---conducting a blanket search of a great number of possibilities, and claiming subsequently how unlikely it is to get just that message in just that position. It is more often done by numerology: measure every possible dimension of the Great Pyramid, say, in every system of units known to you, and then try dozens of possible numerical combinations of the results to see whether any of the numbers that emerge seem significant, such as being a famous year in the Christian calendar. But your Bible messages have that beat all hollow."

  "Well, it does not matter now, Holmes. As it turned out, you went to Canterbury, and survived; Moriarty is dead, and can never tell us on what basis he chose Dover. All else is moot."

  Holmes looked at me without seeming to see me, his gaze focused somewhere beyond infinity. "Is it, Watson? Do you remember the many-worlds view of reality, endorsed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Challenger][Challenger]] and many other clever physicists, that arises out of quantum theory?[...]

  "In that case, the original Sherlock Holmes who tossed a coin on the way to Canterbury gave rise to a huge (but not infinite) number of subsequent versions. Call that number a zillion if all had survived. If I had rolled a die as I should have done, a third of a zillion would be alive now. As it is, there are only a quarter of a zillion. One-twelfth of those other versions of myself were killed by my stupidity."
