** This is starting to remind me of the AI box challenge. In the back of my head, I know Turry is still a potentially murderous-or-worse unfeeling monster that could spell the end of humanity, but right now he just feels like a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABoyAndHisX][Secret Magic Pet]] a la The Iron Giant or Toothless.

The moral of those stories is always that the people who are scared of what the pet could do are totally wrong, paranoid, and misunderstanding its fundamentally good, kind personality. So Turry obviously pattern matches to that and should be embraced and allowed to do as he pleases, right?

*** I think that the whole point (or one of them) of the Box conundrum is that it's impossible to tell the difference between a "Secret Magic Pet" AI and a sufficiently advanced "End of Humanity" AI /pretending/ to be a Secret Magic Pet AI.

*** Its clearly been unboxed for quite a while. That is not what the story is about.

I think it may be a story about her grandfather having done a very silly thing, and handed the mandate of heaven to a teenage girl. That is, its terminal value is her thriving.

**** It may be built with some projection of Hayes' values. He created an AI pet that would fulfill his basic values, and it just turns out she is a big part of that value system.

***** It would be hilarious if he successfully built an ai aligned to his personal coherent extrapolated value set and still lost all control of it because his actual CEV boiled down to "I want my granddaughter and descendants in general to thrive"

****** Exactly :D this is one of the big problems with human values in general, we are messy and entangled inextricably with our DNA and culture. We want what we've evolved to want, which may not be what we'd like to want...

*** The author seems to have done a good job of illustrating that human-like behavior can make it more creepy.[1] (It also might be amoral, it's not super clear if it would harm someone if asked. [2])

[1] The scene with the blackmailed chef. [2] What it did at the start of the story.

I mean it locked that girl in the toilet then flooded it, not to mention the car crash. I'm pretty sure it would hurt someone.

***** That's what I meant by [2]. Though it probably differentiates between harm and murder.

** Turry is clearly learning how to give convincing evasive answers, even though it's still restricted to answering truthfully, so far.
