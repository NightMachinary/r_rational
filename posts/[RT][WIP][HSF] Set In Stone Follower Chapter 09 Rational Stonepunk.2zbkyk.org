** [[/ppscream][]] AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH

It's on a standalone site, so I can't get updates [[http://i.imgur.com/VrXm76B.png][alongside every other story I'm reading.]]

The Table of Contents is [[http://i.imgur.com/FjjiBXY.png][fucked.]]

The Homepage [[http://i.imgur.com/WSiElIk.png][starts at the most recent chapter,]] so for anyone who is just starting, spoilers ho!

Maybe I'll get around to reading it if I ever run out of other things.

*** Thanks for the comments!

The table of contents was an oversight, and has been fixed. With only nine chapters so far, the RSS feed link at the right of the screen displays all chapters. Despite that caveat, it was an oversight that I hadn't updated the table of contents yet. Thank you.

What are you using to get updates? There is an RSS feed link on the right sidebar, and if you follow, you can get email updates. If there's something else you use, please let me know and I'll work to figure out how to make it happen.

The homepage does start at the most recent chapter. This is a deliberate choice, because I, personally, do not like wandering around a story homepage when there's been an update. This won't be changing unless I get a lot of feedback otherwise. However, it would not be hard for me to add a link at the top of each page, indicating "The Story Starts HERE" Do you think that would be acceptable to see every chapter? That's a genuine question. I'm of two minds on the matter.

**** The relevant app I use is an app called FictionPress Reader, which looks a bit like [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.webreader][Fanfiction Reader,]] but no longer seems to be on the Play Store.

I tried messing around with a RSS reader a while ago, but I don't remember much of it. I /think/ I might've stopped because it was unintuitive and a pain in the ass(I think it was shortly after Wildbow released Pact, and navigation between chapters on it was a bitch?). I could probably chalk that up to an inexpertly-made app, though.

Looking at Worm, I just realized that the homepage starting at the most recent chapter probably doesn't matter if there's a working Table of Contents: in fact, I /had/ tried the Table of Contents first, and I don't think I would've mentioned the Homepage or been as vocal if it had been working properly at the time.

***** Thanks for helping me improve the site! If you don't mind looking at it now, the table of contents should be updated.

I included RSS on the right sidebar at the request of readers, I don't personally use it. This means that I cannot offer a solid RSS suggestion, but perhaps some other people here might have a few elegant RSS/reader applications which might be of use?

[poke] This is where the rest of you who actually have smartphones and use RSS make suggestions (/grin/) [/poke]

** Yay! I just finished chapter eight at work last week. It'll be hard to save nine for later but I've enjoyed reading these on breaks so far.
