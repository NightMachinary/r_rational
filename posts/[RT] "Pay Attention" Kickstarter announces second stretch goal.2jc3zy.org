Hey everyone!

[[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213223018/pay-attention][The Kickstarter]] for "Pay Attention" is 1/3 of the way through its run and is overfunded. A couple days ago I added a stretch goal, for which I would write a second work: a 10,000 word (minimum) rational horror novelette. Well, that's $15 short of funding, so I'm adding ANOTHER stretch goal: if we get another $500 after this, I'll write a third work: a 10,000 word (minimum) fantasy story set in the Union of Anundjå at the very beginning of the Drauga War. Here's the blurb:

/Set on the second day of the drauga invasion, High Marshal Albrecht Löfgren is on a show-the-flag-and-boost-morale inspection of the Tenth Legion, a war-weary band recently rotated off the front lines after too long standing between civilization and the barbarian northmen. The dining-in is interrupted by horrific news: a massive undead army is sweeping up the valley below, led by a powerful vampire battlemage and his coterie of Archmage followers. With less than an hour to prepare, can Albrecht successfully save the lives of the exhausted Legionnaires?/

If everyone who has given $12 or less could find a friend to match their pledge, we'd pretty much make that second stretch goal.

As a final note: according to the Kickstarter stats, the vast majority of my pledges have come from this subreddit. Thank you all so very much. I really can't convey how humblingly wonderful this has been.


** I feel like this Kickstarter could maybe benefit from being posted to [[/r/hpmor]], OP, considering that it draws a much larger population with similar likes. In the meanwhile, I'll try to haggle some people into donating. Seriously looking forward to these stories.

ETA: How has nobody funded any of the "extra 2000 words" options yet? Grr

****** From a test, [[/r/horror]] isn't fond of monetized books.

******* How odd. Where do they think most books come from?

Thanks for the warning; I won't post there.
