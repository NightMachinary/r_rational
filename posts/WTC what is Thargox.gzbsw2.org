Paging through some old chapters, and I can't remember what details about this entity were revealed. There's no wiki page on it either. can someone refresh me?


** Thargox is good at coordinating large amounts of warders, is friendly with Solace, made the locus' bottle, and can only be communicated with through an entad (IIRC).

FYI you can find specific names on AO3 by clicking "Entire Work" on the top and using Ctrl+F.

I'm not sure we know whether that's the case. But it is true that an entad was used to allow Thargox to puppet somebody else as their council representative.

God I love WtC. Wish we had two AlexanderWales, where the second one just wrote non-canon or non-canon-relevant reams of material for us to read daily. Just like interludes or something low-stakes he could output 6k words of, nightly. And maybe a third and fourth AlexanderWales too. Is that too greedy?

*** thanks, I had found a few references but the way Thargox was referred to in several places indicated more familiarity than I guess we've gotten. Solace's coyness seemed to be foreshadowing something that I thought we would have seen by now. Guess it's still wait and see =)

**** Well, we also met him, and he has some lines. He possessed a woman at Heshnel/O'kald's fort through an amulet.

But yeah, we don't know anything beyond what's been said in this thread.

** The details have not been revealed. No one in-universe even knows, aside maybe from Solace.
