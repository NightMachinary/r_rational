** Needs to do some work on the anachronisms. Like, the ball point pen was technically invented in 1888 but there were a lot of false starts, and the Biro wasn't sold under that name until World War II.

**** My personal favorite is duodecimal/dozenal. Divides evenly into 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 pieces, with only two more digits than usual; which also makes more of the rational numbers have short +decimal+ place-value representations. You can even count to 12 with one hand: place your thumb on the 12 segments of your four fingers. Overflow to your other hand and count to 144 = 100b12.

******* Great fic. Preview quotes:

--------------

"By the way, C-378 and I'm assuming the Darjeeling loop was T-35, but if it's all the same to you I'd prefer we reset the numbering back to zero."

--------------

"Delta-2 T-25 C-11. How did you know the trigger?"

--------------

"We both know that with your voice trigger, you can reset faster than I can, so there's no reason to do anything rash. Hear me out."

******* My guess would be [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/76290/celestia-sleeps-in][Celestia Sleeps In]]. The author is extremely rigorous with his worldbuilding, after every chapter is posted he posts a blog about all the behind-the-scenes worldbuilding details such as analogous 18th century technology, social structures, and etc.

For one chapter IIRC the author actually made a real-life daffodil and daisy sandwich (a canon example of Equestrian cuisine) and ate it to see how it would taste to the human character.

** Kind of crappy, to be honest. I couldn't even make it past "Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you..."

The writing is bad, and Tom Riddle doesn't make any sense. He's not even as smart as canon!Tom was, which I suppose is quite the downgrade.

How does he know about computer uploading?

/skims further

If Jerry has been in Tom's head since Day 1, then how is Tom still so stupid? Does Tom have a severe learning disability? What is going on?

Jerry says "Let's eff this place" at one point and then Tom says "bullshit" and says that he learned it from Jerry. So... what is Jerry's stance on foul language, /really/?

*** He seems smarter to me. Canon!Tom was great at magic, but intelligent? He made horcruxes and tortured and branded his own minions.

Your post seems to be based on reading a single chapter or so. Keep reading, it makes more sense from there. I personally think Jerry is not evil at all and he's just manipulating a sociopath into becoming a good guy from birth, seeing as suspiciously he's only doing bad things to people who would become Death Eaters later on.

**** Hm. I read to the point where they enter Hogwarts. Still have complaints with the writing style, and especially with Tom's voice.

There are also... lots of holes, I suppose you might call them, that are not impossible for me to fill but cause me to wonder whether the explanations I'm coming up with were actually intended by the author or if they're legit oversights that I just happen to be able to explain away.

I can see where the appeal is for some people, but it just isn't my cup of tea.

**** The current chapter seems to be Tom's third year, and it's September 1939. So he started in 1937.

Which I think is a year off, because if I remember in canon, Tom Riddle was in the class of 1945.
