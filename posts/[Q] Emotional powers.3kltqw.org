Hello again, just wanted to know if anyone has tackled works about universes where emotions have tangible power such as the Green Lanterns, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Star Wars, Soul Eater or even something more extreme like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagan where abilities are powered by emotions and tropes like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove][The Power of Love]], [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind][Heroic Second Wind]] or [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove][The Power of Hate]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBornOfMadness][Power born from madness]] apply and can even bend physical laws.

Given that they seem anathema to rationalism I wanted to know examples of how they are handled in your stories. Are they explained given concrete terms and a scientific background? Do they stop working in your stories? Or you simply write them as part of that universe laws and accept them as another tool the protagonist and villain can use even if it's not rational?


** I read a fanfiction called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][With This Ring]] that is a DC Universe self-insert story about a character with an emotional spectrum ring. His is Orange, and instead of being powered by force of will, like the green ones, his is only powered by avarice, or desire.

It's not a rational work, but the way the character works (for example, trying to meditate on Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs so he desires more complex things) around the weakness of his emotional weapon is clever. When he goes to try to clean the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch][Great Pacific garbage patch]] he has to make himself /want/ the oceans to be clean. Not just in a vaguely "oh, that would be nice" way, and not in a "I will force myself to do this" way (which is what a Green Lantern could do) but in a "I will find a way to make cleaning the thing that I truly /want/" way.

In a world with weapons powered by emotion, it's rational to make sure your emotional weapon is used in a good way. Emotion isn't irrational, any more than having a particular utility function could be irrational. Desires, interests, things you find joy in, and distaste are all orthogonal to rationality. Rationality doesn't prescribe ethics or love. Rationality is a tool.

In any case, a good example might be something like going into a berserker fury if you have control of that. You give up, say, your ability to use magic or your ability to make long-term decisions or distinguish friend from foe to temporarily gain great power in battle. Although during the time when you're berserk you may not be making rational decisions, there's no reason a rationalist wouldn't have this in the list of options they'd consider if it was at their disposal. An author might reasonably want to write this kind of thing out of their work, but there's no inherent problem.

**** I've been keeping up with it daily, around where did you stop around?

The story has kept on functioning in various arcs, usually something related to the plot of the show, or OL developing or solving some probable or future problem in contrast to how things are usually done on the common DC universe's, and some social arcs from time to time. Currently the story is in the time between the two seasons of the show, so it has worked with integrating a couple of arcs from the regular DC Universe into the story[[#s][]], while the biggest long term goal is [[#s][]]. There's also the parallel renegade universe which has been confirmed by the writer to eventually going to crossover with the main one.

Other than that it has kept with the same kind of structure, which I can understand which is not for everyone's taste, but which personally I like as to how it balances the social and story side of the characters. OL still suffers for being the most oblivious character when it comes to certain 'situations' [[#s][]], but it's usually well balanced with the action.

In some parts I find it helps to take a week's break which allows one to read half an arc in one single time, other times the serial nature works well with reading it day to day.

I would say that one of the best details which come from the slow evolution of the problem solving is how the SI is not just solving everything by himself, but dragging his surroundings(starting by his friends, stretching to their friends and families and generalizing to the whole governments) into a state where they can solve it by themselves more easily.

There's planned to be a self-crossover down the line? And it's with, if I understand rightly, the "renegade option"? (And not the blue power ring Ultraman version, which I think would be pretty cool?)

Does this mean I gotta read all of those? They don't quite grab me in the same way, and they're starting to blur together with the "main" plotline pretty bad. I've thought about just skipping them.

****** I really don't know, I'm not sure whether there will be any communication between the two parallels to get the readers up to date on the differences, or if the author is just going to assume people have been keeping up.

There's a post with the links for all the renegade chapters separated, but that's also not the easiest way to read because the renegade posts are usually intersected with the regular story to show similar events that are happening on the time. There are even events like [[#s][]] which are told primarily from the renegade perspective with a bit at the end from the main story perspective which shows what happened differently.

In general each bit of the story is told from the perspective of the parallel which obtained the bigger picture of the events. Either way, I don't really think the crossover is going to be any time soon.

****** Let me warn you now that there will be a chapter in which the Renegade is the focus and the normal SI just has interlude chapters. Yes, that means that just like most of the Renegade chapters will make zero sense if not read as part of the normal arc the "normal" interludes will make very little sense to anyone who has skipped most of that Renegade-focused arc. And more importantly said arc still has consequences in the overarching story. The arc in question is called "Abberation" and is also quite hard to follow if you haven't kept up at all with the SI vs Renegade differences. But if you really don't want to read that stuff you could instead just read that single Renegade chapter once you're there, accept that you don't get most of the previous references and aren't sure who all the characters on Renegade's team are and as a tradeoff miss pretty much nothing of import from the normal story without having to read /all/ of the Renegade stuff.

**** Gradually it ramps up in scope and in level of strength, as well as threat to the main character and how much he uses and abuses his knowledge and ambition.

The author also explores 2 AUs, one in-depth in which the main change is that the main character is more ruthless and assertive, and the another much less explored one in which the main change is that the main character is dropped into the Ultraman parallel universe and is given a Blue ring, powered by hope, rather than an Orange Ring, powered by avarice, and has to become a villain to survive. A villain powered by hope rather than a hero powered by greed!

It's not my favorite fanfiction, but it's my almost my favorite work of fiction in its category of "give me something daily to read that is entertaining", only slightly edged out by Dinosaur Comics.

** I think the general take on it is this: Being 'rationalist' means you think, plan and execute in ways that make sense /given your setting/. So if you have studied the evidence and you determine that Magic Artifact A gives you super strength when angry and seemingly lacks lasting side effects, then you do your damndest to make yourself angry when you need super strength. You can be rational /around/ the emotions, and anyway, none of us are ever completely without them. Rationality helps you do things, it doesn't tell you what your terminal values should be (though it might force you to rethink them if you haven't thought through how you arrived at them).

In my world, which is a Fantasy world with ~1910s technology and heavy magic, emotions fuel magic, so suppressing them means you don't get to play at the big boys' table. Your personality (and mood) determine your affinities with the five magic elements, and while yes, there is a strong tendency for methodical, think-it-through people to be particularly strong in Earth, they make what use they can of the other elements too, because anything else would be sub optimal. Of course, there /are/ certain doors that are closed to those who insist on sanity. Fire gets stronger with desire and directed emotion, and rationalists just aren't going to be able to access the most powerful Fire magic without doing something to their brain to shut down the wordy mathsy parts. That said, I once [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2y6r2v/wip_mk_bst_please_break_my_oath_magic_andor/][asked /r/rational for some input on my oath magic,]] and there were a lot of really sneaky buggers here who started suggesting deliberate magical personality rewrites, especially temporary ones tied to triggers.

**** I have almost finished one book, but it was the first long thing I wrote and out of 130k words I'm dissatisfied with roughly the first half. While I think the rest is great, I can't exactly submit the second half of a book. Rather than rewriting the whole thing I have shelved it and started on a second book (which takes place earlier and in a different part of the world). That second book is sitting at 25k words and I'm happy with it so far. It also has the advantage of working both as a stand alone and as the start of the series.

While the world is huge, this book should be fairly reader friendly. Plot starts with a bunch of people with suspiciously complimentary skills and little knowledge of history waking up outside Evil Capitol which has been abandoned for 300 years, and most of them have no idea what the history of the place is, so things are introduced gradually in a hopefully interesting way.

** Emotions affect you ability to perform tasks in the real world, so there's nothing inherently "irrational" about the idea from a Doylist perspective. From a magic-building perspective, it's no weirder than (say) spoken words having power.

HPMOR has Patronuses, Unbreakable Vows, Dementors, and probably a few other things I've forgotten. Those all require and provide specific mental states, which led to one of my favorite bits of HPMOR (the Azkaban sequence.)

And Lanterns have shown up; there's /With This Ring/, and [[/u/alexanderwales]] has explained how he was planning to use Green Lanterns in the /Metropolitan Man/ sequel hook. There have been a couple of /Star Wars/ fics started, too.

** The main thing keeping most canon emotional powers stories from being rational isn't a consistent and sane world--that can be fixed easily by fanfic. It's that they aren't about someone (and not necessarily a villain) very quickly just taking carefully measured (but quite large) quantities of controlled substances /all the time/.

Because that's how you actually control emotions, rationally. And that's helpful when how focused, able to visualize, or quick-thinking you are is the difference between beating the world-ending threat and everyone dying. /Everyone/.

Can anyone explain the attraction? Is there good story behind that ehh art style, annoying characters, and goofy (initial?) plot? So many people like it and do fanfic of it...so maybe that means there's something compelling but also other bits that are really flawed--which is all I see in the first few episodes.

  Thus begins a rollercoaster ride of Fanservice, over-the-top fight scenes between mecha, hot-bloodedness, epic sunglasses, massive Badassery, and mind-blowing heroism. The show is loads of fun and seldom takes itself seriously; it could be described as the exact polar opposite of Gainax's other famous series about giant mecha, /Evangelion/. Don't try reading any science into the show---common theory says its universe's /laws of physics/ are subservient to the Rule of Cool. On Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness, /Gurren Lagann/ is soft enough to be spread on a bagel.

#+end_quote

That depends on what you mean by "the good stuff". TTGL is organized into four major arcs, the first three of which are, in true Gainax style, homages to previous approaches to the giant-mecha genre. The fourth is semi-new, giving props to /Getter Robo/ while also setting out its own (batshit insane) way to do giant-mecha.

Episode 7 is, without spoilers, a Wham Episode that forms the border between two of the major arcs.

Again, without spoilers:

- First Arc: the "original" Super Robot shows. Has something of a parodic tone, features lone manly men going up against basically faceless evil oppressors. Episode 4 is the worst in the show and we all wish to forget it existed.

- Second Arc: the original "serious" Super Robot shows. There is now a genuine, continuous plot. The Evil Oppressors have names and faces and a command structure; the heroes have a coherent team structure and definite personalities beyond being Manly Men. Bits of worldbuilding are seeded. A pretty cool Final Battle is had at the end of the arc, culminating in, of course, heroes triumphing, but with more worldbuilding and plot seeds planted for the next arc.

- Time Skip. A lot of people complain about the time skip. Many of us fans, however, say that the time skip lets TTGL show something unusual in most fiction: /progress/. The time skip is seven years, which means that while the main cast end the second arc in their mid-teens, they begin the third arc as young adults. The time skip lets us see some of the /aftermath/ of winning the final battle in the second arc, how the world of the story /kept going/ after what would otherwise have been "the end". This is itself one of the themes of the show: the story /shows/ the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoWhatDoWeDoNow][So What Do We Do Now]] moments, and treats them as more opportunities for the characters to grow.

- Third Arc: A more "modern" treatment of the mecha genre, with Real Robots, moral dilemmas, and politics. Homage to /Gundam/ in its various incarnations. A new villain is introduced, as is an important element of worldbuilding (the Emotion Power itself: Spiral Power = Determinator Energy), and the two are tied together to justify the Serial Escalation trope (and the old villain). New characterization is added in, as we see how the characters grew into stable or less-stable adults and authority figures in the new world they built after overthrowing the second arc's Evil Overlord -- more of this would have been better. Urban mecha combat, more difficult enemies who /can't/ just be shot at until they die, worries about civilians.

- Fourth Arc: Definitively starts some time around when they take Gurren Lagann into space. The first and last arcs are the ones that really make the show famous, and personally, I'd say this is the better of the two. This is the part where TTGL goes from merely /epic/ in its story structure to actually /mythic/, as the show's themes and conflict are extended to their extremes and brought directly into the limelight as important parts of the underlying fabric of life. Moral themes begin to be stated directly, and, this being TTGL, yelled at your face. There are some /very good moments/ in this arc that should have been more than moments, because they demonstrate and magnify the enormity of the show's conflict: /before/ you thought the heroes would inevitably win because /they're Determinator super-robot pilots, that's what they do/, but now you're shown that in fact, they are merely the latest in a long line of rebels across the universe who thought to oppose a /literally/ God-like foe, and that /all previous such attempts ended in death, surrender or treachery/. Until the beginning of the very last episode, /the heroes haven't even accomplished anything new that didn't end in failure before/. Ends with mecha that throw galaxies around as shurikens to fight what is really, underneath, a battle of wills. And note that when I say this arc's foe is God-like, I am not talking about Zeus, I am talking about a Power Who Is, and in fact the nearest that any /mere TV show/ has ever come to portraying the Lone Power on-screen. I am talking about, "Has more energy to use and higher technology than everyone." I am talking about, "Should not appear in a story if you are not willing to arm the heroes with Spiral Power, because there's just no other way to win." I am talking about a multiversal Singleton agent -- that is how powerful this arc's villain is.

- Ending: The characters Earn Their Happy Ending, but not without substantial losses. Life continues to move forwards, and we're shown an epilogue in which the society the characters helped to build has been Marching On.

The show distils the Super Robot genre down to its core tropes and themes, and then first parodies, then reconstructs, then /extends beyond the impossible/ those tropes. It features likeable, fully human characters (yes, even as a giant-robot anime), [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xw/higher_purpose/][provides them with motivations the viewer can root for]], [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/wx/complex_novelty/][puts them in /genuinely/ challenging situations]], and eventually builds up to their fighting a [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/x8/amputation_of_destiny/][destiny-amputating superpower]] /and winning/.

If you hated the first few episodes, then frankly, go ahead and skip to the last arc. It's fucking awesome, and a classic.

***** To be fair, two and a half hours of reading will get you through Philosopher's Stone and nothing else, and it would make you think it's just a children's book series. "It gets better" actually applies to a /lot/ of stuff.

I personally liked TTGL. It's very much a "feelgood" type of story, but at least it's consistent considering the rule of cool powers everything in the universe. Not every story needs to be rational or deep to be enjoyable. I agree with you on Bleach though.

Hardly standard children's book fare, though Middle Grade is harder-core than most people think.

That's one reason people loved it. It had YA stylings even in the first three books. I contend it has always been a YA series, in fact. Which was one reason it has so much trouble getting published. Middle Grade simply isn't that long and emotionally punchy.

That 2.5 hours would also be a complete story. The suggestion is, it takes that long before TTGL /matters/. That's too much, unless there is one hell of a payoff.

  Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face ---

  “AAAARGH!”

  Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain --- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.

  Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off --- the pain in Harry's head was building --- he couldn't see --- he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”

  He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down...down... down....

That reads to me as, "Quirrell was too dead to do anything as Voldemort yelled, I showed up and Voldemort ran when he saw me, Quirrell finished dying as or just after I pulled him off you." It doesn't read as "Traumatized? Why, you didn't see anyone die or anything."

Let's see, what else?

You didn't give examples of what you meant about TTGL, you assumed things about my motivations so don't fucking do that, and you suggested watching the Harry Potter movies -- an anathema.

But I don't really care to discuss it any further. Not really worth my time. Point is, Harry totally knows he murdered a dude.

I suggested watching the movie version of TTGL, there are two movies that contain the condensed story.

EDIT: Also, I know you don't want to argue but for everyone else: I didn't mean Quirrell didn't die, I meant kids would assume he didn't. It's written ambiguously enough. Disney villain deaths are less ambiguous than the end of PS, to continue the comparison.

********** I see what you're saying, I think, but Disney villains usually don't die screaming in /pain/ and yelling "kill him". That distinction matters.

***** Well, you could skip episodes 4, 5 and 6 if you like. But then, if you didn't fancy TTGL episodes 1, 2 and 3, chances are you won't like the rest either.

Edit: By the way, make sure you watch the japanese version. The english dub is not very good.

**** That universe will quickly collapse into solipsism or into objectivity. The middle ground is unstable. All you need is one person thinking that it shouldn't work that way, and it works slightly less that way than it did before, which amplifies the effect recursively as it now takes the majority opinion into less consideration as a proportion than the guy who just now thought it shouldn't work that way. The effect compounds over time. If the majority converts, perhaps due to watching the laws change and realizing it no longer is working that way, they might settle in to all have the same objective reality. Otherwise, everyone diverges into solipsism where they are the only real thing in their world and the universe works how they think it should up until they start to think it shouldn't.

**** Well, the question comes down to whether that rule is recursive. If the way people think that people think is how people think, then how they think is essentially arbitrary, unless given a starting point for the whole system to evolve from.

** One thing that I've observed: mind magic is the enemy of character development. More precisely, mind magic should have read-only access to emotions. If a character is just experiencing emotions because of magic, it's not very engaging. If there's always a possibility that your characters are hallucinating a few chapters, then it's hard to care about what's happening. And so on.
