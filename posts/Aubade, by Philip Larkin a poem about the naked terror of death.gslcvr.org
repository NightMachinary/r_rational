  "That this is what we fear---no sight, no sound, No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with, Nothing to love or link with, The anaesthetic from which none come round."

Thanks for sharing the poem, I quite enjoyed it. [[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44644/a-psalm-of-life][This]] poem by Longfellow makes for a nice pallet cleanser afterwards, if you'd rather not dwell on that small unfocused blur before the dawn.

*** (I also enjoyed in particular the verse with that sentence, though the overall poem leans a little too much towards defeatism for my taste.)

**** Hmm, I didn't think so?

#+begin_quote
  Death is no different whined at than withstood.

  Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.\\
  It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,\\
  Have always known, know that we can't escape,\\
  Yet can't accept. One side will have to go.
#+end_quote

We're going to have to do the impossible and beat it.

***** Hopefully not impossible, but yes.

From the rest of the poem I'm inclined to interpret the author's 'One side will have to go' as--consistent with other parts--taking our 'going' as the foregone conclusion, though I would certainly applaud if the author had intended a twist.

'know that we can't escape': 'knowing' suggesting a truth rather than a possibly-false impression.

'Death is no different whined at than withstood.': true (attitude of complaining versus attitude of acceptance), but the hope of an attitude of fighting against it is either ignored or lumped in with 'whining' as no more meaningful than acceptance.

'Most things may never happen: this one will': again, treating it as something certain to happen, rather than something that one could do something about.

'And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.' Similarly certain (nothing more true than that it will be soon).

'The sure extinction that we travel to', similarly certain.

My impression is thus that the author either is taking death as a given or writing a narrator who is taking death as a given--it's conceivable that the author in writing such a narrator is subtly trying to suggest to the reader (maybe also using reverse psychology?) that it's not as hopeless as the narrator thinks, but I feel I have insufficient evidence for this to be convincing.

****** It is that hopeless, though, at least in the very long run of 'total emptiness for ever'.

It's not the primary focus of the poem, but to me it seems like 'we can't escape, Yet can't accept. One side will have to go.', accompanied by the coming light of day, is meant to provide a spot of - not quite hope - but at least sufficient desperation to achieve all that hope would. And I'm satisfied with that. It's a lot more honest than phony raa-raaing would be.

******* Desperation works.

Long run 'it is that hopeless': are you referring to this universe's apparent second law of thermodynamics (for which the something-rather-than-nothing existence of the universe in the first place represents hope of future meaningful discoveries), to the statistical likelihood of meaningful survival (for which strategies can already be imagined, such as as a fallback method lots and lots of far-away-from-each-other backups, and/or for instance redundant consciousness with many far-away-from-each-other communicating points), or something else?

(raa-raaing: 'Rage, rage against the dying of the light' comes to mind, which I have enjoyed in the past--though I suppose it could also be taken as similarly giving-up-before-the-fight, in the sense 'Die anyway of course, but die a little more unwillingly won't you?'.)

********* <Google Translate--'Why not both?'>

Both the first two are fine with me--I noted my own reasoning-for-hopefulness for both. I haven't for the third because by definition it's a hypothetical reasoning on your part which I haven't thought of, thus haven't thought of to describe my reasoning about.

A small unfocused blur, a standing chill   \\
That slows each impulse down to indecision.   \\
Most things may never happen: this one will,   "

Great quote, thanks for the link.
