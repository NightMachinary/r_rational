** It feels like it got cut off...nothing about the conversation changed from beginning to end, no new point was made, and neither character took any actions or was moved in their viewpoint. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to get from this -- that Mediator is hopelessly naive? That Protector is a paranoid reactionary? That we should engage with and overcome-through-politics the demons that trouble us? That we should cower in our walled city because some things really are unbeatable...except by walls?

It's a great start to a story that I'd like to read, but there's no story and no parable.

*** I think it's intended as illustration of [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/rl/the_psychological_unity_of_humankind/][psychological unity of humanity]], in contrast with the way [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer][some other minds]] and [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god/][optimization processes]] might work.

It also reminded me of one very interesting and very scary [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][meditation on Moloch]].

**** Yeah but it's like.. I don't think it needed a parable for that.

It's so filled with ingroup references that the only people who could understand the veiled reference are the people who are already aware of the point it's making. So the metaphor just seems gratuitous, imo.

***** I agree that author probably didn't tailor his writing to the target audience, or maybe didn't even think about target audience at all.

***** I somehow missed this detail. Now I am also confused about the point of the essay. Maybe I got it wrong, or maybe it's just inconsistent.

** This seems to be a pretty obvious metaphor for our current refugee crisis, along similar lines to Clark's "story" on popehat recently.
