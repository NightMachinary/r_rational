[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7joi4e/biweekly_challenge_selfdestruction/][Last time]], the prompt was "Self-Destruction". Our winner is [[/u/blasted0glass]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7joi4e/biweekly_challenge_selfdestruction/drcgx3m/]["Collaboration"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/blasted0glass]] for their fourth win! Only one more until you join the coveted superwinner club!

** This Time

   :END:
This time, the challenge will be *Forbidden Research*. There are very few areas of research that people are expressly forbidden from pursuing, but they do exist, whether for moral, ethical, political, or practical reasons. This prompt shouldn't be taken to be /just/ "Things Man Was Not Meant to Know", though that's the obvious avenue for it; some things are dangerous, unorthodox, or simply tied up in political red tape. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, January 24th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge theme will be *Pioneer*. Write a story about someone (or a group of people) who are the first at something, whether test subjects, explorers, or thinkers. This is an extremely common trope in fiction, as well as the subset of rational fiction, largely because being a pioneer tends to be more interesting than following in the footsteps of a pioneer. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 1/24*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat can [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7ogds0/challenge_companion_forbidden_research/][be found here]].

**** It basically is. It's from one of the universes I keep plugging at, and forbidden research (and loss of knowledge) are one of the major building blocks of that setting.

*** Mod from lesserwrong.com here. We'd rather not have this content, at least as-is. Since LW2 is not a fiction site, fiction written in first person needs to somehow unambiguously communicate what it is, within the first paragraph.
