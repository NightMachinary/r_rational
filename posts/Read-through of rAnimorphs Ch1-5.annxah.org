Preamble: [[/u/Not_Baxtor][u/Not_Baxtor]] and I are doing a read-through of r!Animorphs: The Reckoning, and posting our comments as we go. In order to not pollute the subreddit, we will post the above chapters in megathreads - the below parent comments have spoilers up to and including that marked chapter, along with an off-topic thread.

Feel free to join us in our read-through! One of us has read it and the original Animorphs before, one of us hasn't. And thanks to [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]] for the story!

** This is awesome! I've had the idea for a while to do ratfic "book clubs" either as a series of megathreads here or in its own subreddit. The goal being to let folks catch up on long fics while still getting the experience of theorizing/speculating about them with a group of other first-time readers.

*** So I'm super happy that they went through and got every single animal that they could and acquired them. It really bothered me in the original how they just were getting the odd animal here and there, and only as required. Then they'd end up in situations where they needed something, but didn't have it ready.

***** Without answering the question (nor saying if I even can answer), I've been thinking about the best way to address this - surely from their perspective they don't know those sorts of costs... like, I'd go out to the max, and acquire everything and every person I could. But then I don't know if I'd ever run into limits or break the machinery.

Is there a good way to think about this? It's like the problem of if you ever woke up with a superpower, how would you go about using it without knowing it's limits or if it would ever break.

In this case though, they really should just find another Andalite to talk to.

**** Yeah... bad move

Although it does say that she only targets the humans, not the yeerks:

#+begin_quote
  I focused on Melissa and her parents, mentally excluding the Yeerks they were carrying. The alien slugs would hear it anyway---they'd have to. But if my guess was right, they'd be unable to tell it apart from any other thought. It would sound just like Melissa, just like Mr. and Mrs. Chapman, my message translated into their own internal voices, just as Elfangor's voice had been translated into mine.
#+end_quote

But I feel that being confident about that is probably not something that she can be, with so little experience.

It makes me think - I was impressed with the others raising the possibility of not doing anything in their earlier meeting. Having it as an explicit option. I feel that Rachel misses that completely, and that is her weakness:

#+begin_quote
  About halfway through the conversation, I'd started to feel that pressure again, the itch of inactivity that made me want to get up and pace, made my fingers twitch and cut my patience in half. It had grown worse and worse as the others bickered and dithered, until finally I'd had to step outside to get some fresh air.

***** Hmm, still can't excuse this. The result is to put the yeerks on their guard and totally throw away any advantage of surprise. Even if the yeerks are misdirected to suspecting Andalites rather than humans, the cost of this action is insanely high.

It really would be hilarious if they got caught and stuck in prison on their first mission. Hilarious, without considering the fate of the species, that is.

They should definitely cue up a really small morph like a fly as a top priority, if they haven't already.

Seems like that is talking about acquiring a morph from another morph, when in your own body. But could you acquire something when you are already in morph form? Probably not, I guess, but I can't remember if that's written anywhere

**** You're correct. In the OG books you couldn't be in morph if you wanted to acquire something, and it's the same in The Reckoning. Remember that when the kids morph in the fanfic, their original body essentially goes up into a pocket dimension in Z-space and is held in stasis. That body is where the DNA patterns for morphs are stored, so /it/ has to make contact with the target in order to absorb its DNA pattern.

*** [[/u/Not_Sophie][u/Not_Sophie]] said "we tried acquiring from a morph, and it works" (quoting from Ch 3)

This raises the question of whther you can acquire a copy of your own body as a morph. Say:

1. Cassie and Jake acquire each other's bodies as morphs
2. Cassie acquires her own body as a morph from Jake, morphed as Cassie
3. Cassie can morph her own body whenever required, say to heal an injury while maintaing her appearance as Cassie

*** It seems that the thought-speak power can be used to make suggestions to people in their own internal voice. If this is correct, this is pretty damn powerful - especially for controlling the minds of other humans who have no possible way of conceiving the existence of such a power. Although it might send people crazy if used too much.

And how does the thought-speak power interact with a human controlled by a yeerk? Could Cassie have used it to support her mom when her mom was fighting the yeerk for control of her own mind?

*** When the yeerk was crawling up Cassie's neck into her ear, could she have acquired it as a morph? This would have been a total game-changer. Not sure of all the implications. Though one interesting question is what would happen if one of the kids in yeerk form invaded another human being controlled by a yeerk. Would that kid acquire all the thoughts and knowledge of the yeerk, as well as the human host?
