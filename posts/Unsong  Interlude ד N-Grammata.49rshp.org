  And “he” corresponds to the English letter H. H is for hydrogen
#+end_quote

Breaks suspension of disbelief. When you're not connecting He to helium, it becomes clear that you're just witnessing the divine subgraph of the looks-sparser-than-it-is graph of reality.

**** Except that Hebrew /doesn't have/ an "E" equivalent. Hebrew uses an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad][abjad]], not an alphabet, and so vowels are not represented in writing.

Welp. Suicide has become a lot more common. God knows I probably wouldn't last long in this universe, since sometimes the only thing that keeps me alive long enough to get out of a bad time is the lack of a convenient method.

**** It comes and goes. ATM, I'm stuck at a religious school where I can't be too open with the therapists (who aren't all that good anyway, IMO), so I'm trying to hang in long enough to graduate (this semester and two more).

I have an internship in San Jose starting next month and have a few places that I can go to, which will hopefully make the last two semesters a little easier to handle.

--------------

I have no intention to buy a gun, for that very reason (although another reason that the Mortal Name would be so tempting is that it would make "donating my organs post-suicide" a lot easier; it's when I find myself starting to think about how to manage this IRL that I realize that I'm slipping again).

***** Fuck, man. I'm sorry. I assume you're stuck at that school because of your parents? I've got double clergy parents myself, and though it sounds like I've had it less bad than you I still can't stand being around them for more than a few days at a time. Too many bad memories. Where others see them as paragons of Christian Virtue, I must see them as people, broken as the rest of us, putting on a mask for those they teach. Really shatters the ability to believe any of their tripe.

Anyway, things do get better. For me, it happened when my parents moved several states away so I didn't have to deal with their crap all the time. Get educated, get out, and if necessary remove toxic influences from your life.
