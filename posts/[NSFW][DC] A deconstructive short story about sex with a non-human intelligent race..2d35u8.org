Lurker here, I thought this might amuse and/or inspire the kind of mentality which seems to be popular here.

There's plenty of "furry" interspecies porn out there, but how much of it actually tackles and overcomes the difficulties of such a relationship?

Even though Kvothe was talking about flaws in an object, instead of simple differences between two people, I think this quote really captures the spirit of the idea.

“It had flaws, but what does that matter when it comes to matters of the heart? We love what we love. Reason does not enter into it. In many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing /because/. That's as easy as putting a penny in your pocket. But to love something /despite/. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect.” ― Patrick Rothfuss, The Wise Man's Fear


** Hmm. this story is getting several degrees removed from what I would counsider directly rational. But it resonates somewhat with me.

You see my desire as a transhumanist is to see a world in which persons can wear bodies and sexualities as you or I would wear a set of clothes. In fact, in spite of the danger and the dedrigation of what we might call the continuity of conciousness, I find the idea of a world in which beings can wear alien personalities and mindsets seductive as well.

At any rate, the linked fanfic deals with two beings with reletively human minds overcoming differences in their relatively alien bodies (which are still both relatively humanoid anyway, among the vast diversity of lifeforms). The issues with comprimising greater difficulties between species might be worth looking into. Of course, many authors have tackled this problem on the scale of interplanetary relations, but it is fewer that go so far as to bring the questions to the bedroom...

** Very nice. Wins bonus points for a non-mammalian character.

Refreshing to see such a story without someone holding the sexual idiotball. Adults acting like adults about sex, instead of charactertures out of a '90s RomCom, is rare in fiction, full stop.

I think this fully qualifies as rational fiction. Thanks for sharing.

** Situations like this can go in a lot of different ways though. We have to remember the alien aspect of the well, aliens. A [[http://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/aliens/marge-simon/found-in-the-wreckage][related short story]] where things escalate horribly -- trigger warning.

*** Meh. That story was about cultural issues and irrational stupidity (but I repeat myself). The "alien" part was also iffy, as they were apparently genetically compatible. It was "sci-fi" only because it had a single mention of a spacecraft and a strange, though not really alien, culture. Could just as easy have been about a shipwreck in ancient China and footbinding. And, for some reason, rape.

Not impressed. What's the point in yet another idiotball cultural differences short story? That was a horrible example of alien "contact" going wrong. OP's linked story was much better, with people dealing with physical differences rationally, and something genuinely new to say about it.

**** I agree, that was really not the best of examples to use.. But I wished the Op's story would have focused more on their cultural differences, alien sociopsychological implications of intimacy. I genuinely enjoyed it and would have loved to have seen them explored in greater detail. And yeah, it was refreshing to see the whole affair being handled rationally - so many stories do not get it right.

It's a bit of a personal bias of mine against aliens that comes across human-ish. Alien depictions of aliens are just so fascinating to read. Say like Yudkowsky did on Three Worlds Collide.
