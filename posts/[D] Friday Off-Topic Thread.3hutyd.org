Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I hope I'm not being off topic by not being off topic enough, but what does [[/r/rational]] think about AARs? If you're not familiar, AARs (After Action Reports) are when people write about what they did in a play through of a game (edit: specifically complex strategy games, primarily ones made by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_Development_Studio][Paradox]]). Sometimes its very dry and technical and only appeals to players of the game. Other times, however, the writer creates a story based on what happened that is appealing even if you haven't played the game.

I recently read a very well written AAR called [[https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/3fz3mi/the_black_france_saga_the_complete_fascist_french/][The Black France Saga]]. What it made me realize is that story-based AARs are essentially rational fiction by default. This is because the plot is tied to a game with set self-consistent mechanics and the characters involved are often the player and the AI who are solving problems "through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources". Basically all the bullet points in the sidebar under "Characteristics of Rational Fiction". Of course, it doesn't necessarily have to work out so nicely. For example, the author can insert non-rational genre type explanations for certain aspects of the world that are abstracted by the game. Nevertheless, I think story based AARs are definitely compatible with the rational genre.

*** A lot of them read like non-fictional history books, in a good way. I'm sort of on the fence on whether I consider history to be rational; it meets the baseline standards, except when people do irrational things. (I've often wondered why counterfactual history wasn't really a genre; there's alt-history, but it's almost always prose instead of written as in-universe reference material.)

Thanks for linking the Black France Saga; it reads very well (though I've always been a CK or EU guy when it comes to Paradox games).

**** fictional*

History is always rational. Rational fiction is an attempt to write a most empirically-sound (consistent) setting, and irrationality is a most extant thing. History is the world canon, and everything that happens in it is consistent. Rationalist fiction is fiction focusing on characters that learn about and use rationalist principles. And in history, there are certainly people who are more rational than others. But most of all, players of strategy games try to be as effective as possible, and that's really what rationality is about: effectiveness.

**** Yeah I agree, especially about the AARs that have actually been made. Although, I do think there's a lot of room for more personal, less history-ish stories, especially coming from CK.

That's especially true of game play-through stories not considered AARs because of the game genre, like [[https://aliceandkev.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/alice-and-kev/][Alice and Kev]] (I forget how rational that story is, I just remember it being personal and touching).

In terms of the rational genre-ness of it, I definitely think the stories hit the four bullet points in the side bar (especially since the characters involved generally act rationally) but what constitutes the rational genre is a bit nebulous in a way that those bullet points don't quite cover.

Related, I'm thinking of posting a few of the quality/rational story AARs to the subreddit, do you think that's a good idea?

*** The difficulty is profit motive. Getting into space is expensive. Figuring out how to get into space less expensively is expensive. The payoff is uncertain for both of those. The government is almost certainly not going to be the organization that revolutionizes space travel, given current funding levels. That might change if there's a resurgence of interest in space travel (and movies like /The Martian/ help with that) but I sort of doubt that it's going to become politically expedient to make a push for space.

Musk's idea is to aim for smaller profits along the way to bigger ones. He knows much more about the subject than I do and seems to think that it will work, so I guess I sort of trust him on that.

But other than that, the state of space technology is abysmal and won't get better until there's an actual economic reason to go into space (satellites aside).

Hill-climbing is a generally more reliable and easier to meta-reason-about algorithm for accomplishing things than just trying to pump a bunch of probability into a discontinuous, walled-off possible-world. Musk has the right idea: pave a continuous path towards space colonization, where each individual forward step will provide society with /some/ (even if small) amount of immediate net reward, and the /path/ builds up to accomplishing the long-term goal of /get us into fucking space so we don't all die pathetically on Earth and can have anarcho-communism like the Culture./

Scope insensitivity makes "survival motive" basically non-existent, assuming that by "survival motive" we mean "survival of the human race" and not "survival of the individual".

People have been trying for /decades/ to make the argument that we need a backup planet. They haven't gotten any traction. People don't actually care. The human brain isn't wired for caring about humanity in the general sense. So I suppose you might try to increase rationality in the general public so that even though people remain emotionally scope insensitive, they start to understand and agree with a survival motive as rational. But that seems much harder than just going after the already existent motives (like profit).

See, but then we're talking about entertainment motive.

The final season of /Friends/ was the most expensive [television show] of all time, costing $10 million per episode. How much does a trip to Mars cost? For a single crewed mission ... Wikipedia says $6 billion as a lower bound estimate. That's just to go there and back again, no colonization on offer, just the Mars equivalent of an Apollo mission. You could get 30 /Star Wars/ movies for that price! And in terms of entertainment, actual space /is/ competing with fake space.

Now, it's possible that you can use entertainment as a single prong of your Swiss Army knife of getting people to care about space. But I sort of doubt it, given the competition in the form of hyper-optimized-for-entertainment media.

  Concomitant with this is the argument that the nature of life in space - that vulnerability, as mentioned above - would mean that while ships and habitats might more easily become independent from each other and from their legally progenitative hegemonies, their crew - or inhabitants - would always be aware of their reliance on each other, and on the technology which allowed them to live in space. The theory here is that the property and social relations of long-term space-dwelling (especially over generations) would be of a fundamentally different type compared to the norm on a planet; the mutuality of dependence involved in an environment which is inherently hostile would necessitate an internal social coherence which would contrast with the external casualness typifying the relations between such ships/habitats. Succinctly; socialism within, anarchy without. This broad result is - in the long run - independent of the initial social and economic conditions which give rise to it.

Unless each person can independently maintain the station and not interfere with other people trying to do the same, nobody is self-sufficient. Nobody's even slightly self-sufficient. So on the scale of one space station, you need coordination, and humans tend to turn to hierarchies to coordinate. For your argument to work, everyone would need their own space habitat and would need to be competent to maintain every part of it. How this model handles population growth is left as an exercise to the reader.

Your argument here is also diametrically opposed to the one you quoted. Iain Banks was arguing from interdependence, whereas you are arguing from independence. So I'm confused.

*********** If there's value associated with material goods, people will try to acquire material goods. If there are any limits on the rate of acquisition of goods by peaceful means, and if there's some sort of weapon available, piracy becomes highly likely. This creates defensive military coalitions, which leads to conscription and taxation.

A military force in the face of piracy is something of a commons. As long as it exists and is strong enough, it is to my benefit for it to exist. However, it is more to my benefit if my habitat doesn't have to provide soldiers (because it means there are more people to share work over locally). It's to my benefit if other people pay taxes instead of me. So building on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom][Ostrom's work]], we'll need auditors and an arbitration system and sanctions on people who don't provide taxes or conscripts.

This doesn't make anarchy between habitats impossible, but it doesn't help. We're familiar with hierarchical systems involving governments to solve these problems, so we'll turn to governments first.

Once you've got a post-scarcity economy, /then/ you have much less need for such things. Except there are non-physical things that are still scarce: other people's attention and influence over people, for instance. Violence and the threat of violence can acquire those. To eliminate that problem while maintaining anarchy, you need an outside force to provide peacekeeping and any necessary investigative services (and this isn't anarchy so much as a government without enfranchisement). So from a theoretical standpoint, it doesn't look like living in space stations leads inevitably to anarchy.

The Culture's anarchy, as far as it extends, relies on a servant class of AIs. Almost everyone lives on an orbital or space ship; every orbital and space ship has an AI with a brain the size of planets serving as concierge, arbiter, and panopticon; slapper drones serve as law enforcement and punishment beyond the scope that ship and orbital Minds choose for themselves; and there's no indication that humans have any say in what behaviors merit punishment. So even if we're generalizing from fictional evidence, I don't think we get anywhere near your assertion.

I think the analogy sounds nice at first, but doesn't /quite/ work. Sea-going ships have to make port /eventually/. They're not actually self-sufficient. Space habitats /need/ to be self-sufficient: even if you're the pirate, the rate at which you can raid other habitats /in three-dimensional astronomically-sized space/ for supplies you can't produce yourself is just a losing proposition. You /need/ to be able to supply your own needs, or you will just plain die -- curse of dimensionality.

Which isn't to say that I don't want to read a story about space piracy. Space pirates are basically the coolest thing ever. It's just that I think, if you're talking about a society that lives in space /full-time/ rather than using space as a way to pass between planets, you need to rationalize some interesting way for pirates to both exist and survive.

************* You do not need to be self-sufficient for luxury goods. If a set of pirates likes silk but can't produce it, then they will be inclined to raid places where silk is produced, or nexuses of silk trading. When they can't get silk, they make do with the pseudo-polyester blend that the ship's systems can produce.

You do not need to be self-sufficient for things you rarely need as long as it is not catastrophic to lose or expend it or you can have reserves or backups. You need a CO2 -> O2 converter in your ship, and your primary has a 10-year MTBF and you've got a spare. Your primary dies, you can't fix it, so you raid another habitat and take their spare. The people you raided are not pirates, and they can't fabricate a new one, so they trade with another habitat to secure a replacement.

There can be multiple ways of acquiring a good, and people can prefer one but fall back to another when necessary. If it's possible but un-fun for a set of pirates to produce the goods they need, and it is possible and fun for them to raid other habitats to get the same goods, they will prefer to raid other habitats when they can.

People trade. Trading requires rendezvousing with people, which requires being at a known place at a known time. You can engage in trade only with a very limited set of partners, arranging meetings in secrecy, and that limits the set of goods you can trade for and the potential profits. You can trade in the open, and that opens up the risk of piracy.

Producing goods means extracting natural resources at some point. If pirates can identify where those natural resources are being extracted, they can raid in that area.

Even to rendezvous in an astronomically-large three-dimensional space already involves problems. Cryptography also makes it easier to build cooperative-but-secret trade systems once you've got /some/ kind of information broadcast working.

***************** I can't really fathom what your model of these space habitats is. It seems something like:

Trade is rare. This in turn means that each habitat has a source for all or almost all the raw materials it needs, and each habitat makes all or almost all of its own goods. Any trade that happens, happens in small groups or pairs. This requires that, if habitat A produces a good that habitat B wants, habitat B must necessarily produce a good that habitat A wants. It is easy to contact all your potential trade partners securely with no risk of interlopers or MITM attacks. It is impossible to advertise that you have a good for trade, arrange to meet with a trade partner, and point a gun at them rather than exchanging goods.

The only reasonable way to get anything near that model is to make space travel prohibitively expensive for all time. (That doesn't explain how each habitat has access to all the resources it ever needs. That would require sifting the asteroid belt or some such. But we'll set that aside for now.) But that would result in people putting their habitats close together specifically because people like to talk to each other and see each other in person and travel and trade. So you have to induce a diaspora somehow. (Then you have to keep large habitats or large collections of small habitats to maintain healthy breeding populations, but that's only if you want humanity to survive for an extended period of time.)

Of course, if space travel is prohibitively expensive, that /alone/ is sufficient to prevent piracy. And trade.

Then you should have started out by saying that the technologies and living arrangements of the Culture inevitably lead to anarcho-communism.

Unless you're saying that the AIs generated by the Culture, given the technologies of the Culture, will inevitably establish anarcho-communism between themselves -- which says a lot more about their method for generating artificial intelligences than sociology and technology.

What do you mean, survival motive? What disaster could possibly be so terrible that it's easier to survive on Mars (say) than in a hidden base in a mineshaft, in a desert, or under the ocean?

A war? We're assuming a technology level that puts interplanetary travel in reach of private citizens. I'm sure there'll be interplanetary ballistic missiles sitting around.

An asteroid strike like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs? Our mammalian ancestors /survived/ that one, and they didn't have cool toys like electric heating or air filtration. We can weather any natural disaster.

Global warming? It'll be an ecological disaster if our planet's temperature rises by one degree. Mars is eighty degrees colder than Earth. It's far easier to reverse global warming here than it is to terraform a second planet.

And if civilisation does collapse and we're knocked back to the Stone Age? Our species made it out of the Stone Age once before. This is the only planet in the universe where food literally grows on trees.

On the other hand, how many people do you think it takes to maintain a self-reliant civilisation at our current technology level? Ten million? A hundred million? How many specialised areas of expertise do we use to manufacture something as mundane as a box of cereal (let alone a space suit or a mining vehicle)? How many experts in each area does it take to train the next generation without losing any knowledge? And how long will it take to build a colony of that size?

The only argument I find compelling in this space is basically that it's more responsible to geoengineer Mars than Earth - we don't stand to loose much if it goes wrong, besides all the other ecological problems. Getting to a (very basic) biosphere might not be all that hard, if you're willing to wait centuries.

*** People get dazzled by these fake(ish) news stories about colonizing mars to make it a backup planet, harvesting platinum from the asteroids, and extracting helium 3 from lunar soil. This is [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/06/near-far-summary.html][Far bias]] -- exotica associated to exotica, with the cleverest sounding ideas being trumpeted loudest based on their suitability for status signaling purposes. The reality is much more interesting (albeit perhaps a lot harder to believe).

About 5% of asteroids are essentially made of steel alloy. Not ore (oxides) like we find here on earth's surface, but a mix of reduced, metallic nickle and iron. This is similar to what exists at the core of the earth and other planets, thanks to the relatively high density of these elements -- implying that the asteroids tend to be fragments of larger planetoids that were big enough to have a molten core. If you want to make iron on earth from surface materials, you have to spend energy removing the oxygen to turn it into metal, but in space it's already metal.

We can machine these metallic asteroids directly into canisters, support beams, mechanical parts etc. We can also melt them down and refine them further, producing higher grades of steel for example. A tiny trace amount of their content is platinum group metals, which are great for various electrochemical applications, so extraction of such materials may be worth doing -- but it's not the most practical near-term use. Making additional machines is. And if you did extract some of it, selling the platinum on earth would be the stupid way to use it -- you'd want to use it to make machines in space more efficiently, until you have so many that shipping things to earth becomes trivial and starts making economic sense.

A fairly high percentage of asteroids are carbonacious, "C-type" asteroids. They contain lots of carbon. They also contain hydrogen and other volatiles. Since they have some rocky parts, their composition is likely similar to asphalt. C-type asteroids can probably be mined for their hydrogen/water content by fairly simple heat treatment. Surround the asteroid with a plastic bag, heat it to a few hundred degrees, then allow the gas in the bag to cool back down, and you end up with volatiles like water.

One possible use for the hydrogen collected this way is as a chemical rocket fuel (reacted with oxygen). But this isn't necessarily as good of an idea as it sounds because it's usually going to be more efficient to use electromagnetic energy (focused solar, microwave, etc.) instead of chemical energy to heat your propellant atoms. Electromagnetic methods allow you to accelerate the atoms a lot faster than chemical rockets, so you use less reaction mass (albeit more energy per unit thereof). You can also use just about any kind of atom this way, whatever is most plentiful that you can afford to waste. (As it happens, oxygen is extremely plentiful in the asteroids, and makes a great propellant.) The reason propellant efficiency matters is mainly because gathering a lot of energy is usually easier than gathering matter.

[[/u/danielravennest]] can fact-check the above, I'm mostly cribbing from his comments in the past and [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods][his book]].

Where it gets really interesting is when you think about what happens when the space based industrial supply chain becomes robust enough that it produces all (or even most) of its own parts. (See also Dani's other book, [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Seed_Factories][Seed Factories]].) My take is that this is likely to be sooner than one would think, because the main reason we have trouble reproducing certain items is the energy cost. That is, we usually don't have any problem whatsoever in creating any given product or substance per se, rather, the tricky bit is always creating it without expending hundreds of dollars worth of energy per gram.

In space, however, energy is ultra-abundant. Not only can you concentrate sunlight easily with mirrors, your entire manufacturing operation can be moved closer to the sun to reduce the mirror area needed per watt of energy. Sunlight weakens [[http://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/solar-radiation-in-space][based on a square law]], so to get to where sunlight is ten times as strong, you can go to around a third the distance from the sun. Energy efficiency is quite a bit less of a concern for space based industry than people are used to thinking of it as being.

As a rather extreme example of this, Robert Freitas [[http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/3.14.htm][proposed]] using a variant of the mass spectrometer to purify materials via tuned lasers and high-powered magnets. The pure materials are converted to jets of ionized matter and printed onto a surface to create specialized components. The mechanism is estimated to consume around 8800 MJ per gram of output (at a speed of 1.25 grams per second). That's hundreds of times the energy cost relative to what materials typically require to refine from raw ore (it would be $130/g or $130000/kg if you were paying 5 cents per kWh). However, by using a 11 MW solar power plant, he estimated that a 120 ton system could replicate itself entirely in about 3 years.

In terms of earth economics, you can think probably of better uses for an 11 MW solar power plant over 3 years than fabricating 120 tons of equipment. (That's 15 billion dollars worth of electricity at 5 cents a kWh.) However, the result includes another 11 MW power plant and omnivorous refinery/factory. This in turn doubles every 3 years, so you get exponential growth, and it keeps going on and on for as long as everything is kept organized and supplied with raw materials. After 30 years, that's 1024 plants, and the number of plants at 60 years is around a million, or a billion at 90 years, etc. A sort of energy based Moore's Law if you will.

However, the 3-year time is based on some assumptions that turn out to be rather absurdly conservative. First, that we would use no other more efficient means for manufacturing or refining than the (super inefficient) ionic separator/printer, despite having the ability to print up essentially any piece of equipment on site. Second, it assumes that we would remain at 1.0 AU for solar power collection purposes. The design only needs to radiate heat from about 1/70th of its total area, so the area needed for cooling is quite a bit less than the power collection area, and not really a bottleneck. Most of the mass is taken up by 77,000 square meters of mirrors. If we were to move the device to 0.3 AU, the mirror space required goes to around a tenth of that area. This implies replication rates of around a tenth the duration (0.3 years), just by moving to an orbit near Mercury. We could probably scale up another ten times by switching to more efficient manufacturing methods for the larger parts, which puts us down to a couple of weeks per replication.

Another thing the design doesn't account for is recent progress in material science. Graphene is now known to be a decent power collector, and can be [[http://phys.org/news/2008-07-graphene-strongest-material.html][absurdly thin]] while maintaining decent strength parameters. Carbon nanofibers can now be [[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/540706/researcher-demonstrates-how-to-suck-carbon-from-the-air-make-stuff-from-it/][electrolysized from lithium carbonate]], which can be created from the CO2 in our atmosphere, or the carbon of an asteroid. Methods to create graphene from carbon nanofibers probably also exist (e.g. chemical vapor deposition). At any rate, the energy investment needed for this is likely to be well under the 8800 GJ/kg of Freitas replicator. (Even 1 GJ/kg would be surprisingly high.) Also, the amount of mass needed drops dramatically if we assume much thinner panels.

What it basically comes down to is that setting up a whole Dyson sphere could only take a matter of weeks, given the capabilities of NASA or a comparable organization today. Well, we probably aren't psychologically capable of R&D cycles fast enough to get it down to literally taking only a few weeks (we'd hit various bottlenecks), but if someone were to allocate a trillion dollar budget to it, or if we were to assume a moderate superintelligence (like say an enhanced human, or a team of unenhanced natural geniuses) with access to NASA or SpaceX capabilities, it would probably get done within a matter of years to decades. A DS would require about 75 doublings if you start with a square meter and assume 0.3 AU is a suitable distance.

Actually, I don't think we really need any tech past 1980 or so to pull it off. If the people who went into the semiconductor industry had instead focused on self-replicating space machines, we'd probably have faster computers by now /and/ a Dyson sphere, not to mention no more global warming (other than what we choose), civilian access to space, power too cheap to meter, etc. This might have been a bit much for the politics of the Cold War era though, given the incredible potential a DS has as a WMD.

(The silicon chip transistor density could have been improved a lot faster with high-scale space based manufacturing / testing facilities, so Moore's Law is a big waste of time if you look at it from that perspective.)

The natural composition of metallic asteroids (~95% Iron, Nickel, & Cobalt, in that order) is a good ore for making various steels, but is not a steel itself. Typically you want to add some alloying elements depending on what use you have.

Steel is defined as having 0.2 to 2% carbon. Very low carbon alloys are called "wrought", and are ductile, but not especially strong. As you raise the carbon content, steel gets harder but more brittle. High carbon steel is suitable for edged tools, say, but not hammers. When you get up to 4% carbon it's called cast iron, which is very brittle but easy to cast into shapes. Stainless steel requires at least 10% Chromium, and is present in fractional percent amounts in some asteroids.

A modern space solar panel has an output of [[http://www.spectrolab.com/DataSheets/Panel/panels.pdf][177 W/kg]]. Over a typical 15 year operating life, it can then produce 177 x 15 x 31,556,925 = 84.1 GJ/kg. This is thousands of times higher than the energy content of chemical rockets (10-15 MJ/kg). Your minimum mass for a given mission is then to use a lot of solar arrays to accelerate a small amount of fuel to high velocity, rather than use a lot of chemical fuel to accelerate itself to a much lower velocity.

The reason we don't do it today is a solar panel in space produces 7 times as much output as a panel on Earth, due to night, weather, and atmospheric absorption down here. If it costs you more than 7x as much to put that panel in space and beam the power down (the situation today), then it makes more sense to put the panel on Earth. If in the future you have robot factories that can /make/ the panels in space, and avoid the cost of launch from Earth, it might make economic sense to beam down power.

The Solar System is full of small objects in random orbits.

The Moon and other medium-sized bodies are small enough to mechanically throw stuff into orbit with a large centrifuge. Once your materials are out of a gravity well, you can move them around using efficient propulsion systems and gravity assist maneuvers, at a small percentage of propellant mass.

This particular case (Freitas atomic separator replicator) depends on microgravity and easy access to hard vacuum, etc. otherwise you would need massive support structures, a vacuum chamber, vacuum pumps, etc. which increase the cost (and thus reduce doubling rate) substantially. An externally powered ion printer device that creates things from low-grade ore for 8800 GJ/kg would be conceivable, but I doubt people would be very impressed with it sans an adequate solar array, since that's $130/kg worth of power.

The energy cost of delta-vee is insignificant in this context. Even if you were slinging the materials around at 100 km/s, that would only be 5 GJ/kg. Also, stuff manufactured closer to the sun would probably be made using materials launched from Mercury, which has an EV of 4.2 km/s, meaning the energy cost is only 8.82 MJ/kg. That's peanuts compared to the power collection capacity for a given kilogram. If you collect just 100 W/kg, you can pay for 8 MJ in a little over 2 hours.

Pretty sure I didn't mention that particular scenario, but again if you were to do the math you'd see it's plenty feasible to use shorter times by spending higher (yet still insignificant) amounts of energy. It's not really necessary to use belt asteroids however, since various asteroids (known as "Near-Earth Asteroids") naturally move closer to the sun anyway during part of their orbit.

*** A smattering of unknowns about colonizing Mars:

- Where do we find active volcanism? (Geothermal is the easiest legal type of power to generate there.)
- What nitrates and phosphates are present? (Plants need them.)
- Are there problems with using, say, argon in place of nitrogen in air that humans breathe? (There's insufficient atmospheric nitrogen locally, but argon is non-reactive and moderately plentiful. But maybe the nitrates are edible by some nitrogen-releasing bacteria on Earth, in which case you can use them instead -- but it's something you have to keep track of.)
- What local ores are available? How do we locate them and how do we smelt them?

You're going to need to reproduce any equipment you use, to a first approximation. The basics are pretty straightforward -- grow plants, you can turn them into food and clothing and light building materials, and you've got oxygen production right there; make fertilizer; that sort of thing. But, for instance, how do you ensure you've got a good air mix? Too much carbon dioxide is toxic. Too little kills your plants. Insufficient oxygen will kill you. Excessive means fires are a problem. So you need something to track and adjust the air mix in your facility, and you need to be able to fabricate another copy of that because things break.

You need building materials, and that means quarrying stone and somehow making a construction of stone blocks air-tight. How are you doing that? Carefully shaped blocks plus partial melting with lasers might work. It's even easier if you use ice as a building material or as cement -- that's only an option in polar regions where it's always below freezing. However, ice does sublimate, so maybe it's not a great option. Or once you have smelting down, you can weld metal plates together to form the outer shell of your facility -- and use stone outside as ablative armor.

It would be safest to send robots to set up the facility and send humans once the facility was demonstrably stable, of course.

  A lot of folks don't like that Monsanto patents seeds. That's just ignorance. All seed companies, including organic seed companies, patent seeds. A seed does not have to be GMO to be patented.[15] The first seed patents were issued in the 1800s, long before GMOs existed.[16]

  A lot of folks don't like that farmers aren't allowed to save seeds from GMO crops. Well, farmers also can't save seeds from patented organic or conventional crops either. Or from hybrid crops (seeds from hybrid crops don't tend to breed the desired traits reliably).[17][18] But I grew up in a farm town, and I've never met a farmer who wants to save seeds. It's bad for business. Seeds are one of the cheapest parts of running a farm.[19] Farmers who save seeds have to dry, process, and store them. Farmers who buy seeds get a guarantee that the seeds will grow; if they don't, the seed company will pay them.

  People say that Monsanto is evil because they sue farmers for accidental contamination of their fields. I looked, but I couldn't find any court cases of this. I did find court cases where farmers denied stealing seeds and said it must be contamination, but in all those cases, a jury or the court found they were lying.[20][21] (If someone inspects your field and 98% of the plants growing on it are a patented variety, that's not accidental contamination.)

*** Science Is Bad when it involves meddling in complicated systems where unanticipated consequences could be disastrous, and a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. A lot of systems in nature are like that: ecosystems, human bodies, human societies, etc. Almost any non-natural change could be the beginning of a disaster, and even in the aftermath of such a disaster it may not be possible to pinpoint a specific cause.

Ecosystems in particular have so many moving parts that it's almost impossible to trace the cause of any given disaster except in general terms. Local farmers introduce a new type of wheat, and years later they're overrun by frogs. The temperature of the ocean goes up by 0.5°C, and a species of jellyfish goes extinct. Was there a correlation? Who knows? You can't rewind the last five years and do a controlled experiment, you can only use the evidence you have. The same goes for economics, sociology, and any other field that studies complex emergent systems.

Pharmaceutical research, at least, can trial the same drug on twenty different people and get representative results of how it'll work on similar people in the future. It still takes them a long time to develop a new treatment, because they go to huge lengths to ensure the safety of their patients. After all, it's quite obvious when a drug has killed a patient, so there's every incentive to avoid that.

If we could trace back a hurricane to the heat wave that formed it, to the greenhouse effect that altered the weather, to the coal-fired power plant that produced the CO2, to the official who decided to build that... but of course that's pure fantasy, a complex system like the weather would be affected by many decisions and pointing fingers is impossible except in an averaged-out statistical manner. Even in retrospect, we can't judge which power stations were good or bad decisions to build.

There's no way to do full-scale experiments on a system like that, and local tests will almost invariably miss some consequences just by virtue of reducing a complex system to a single one of its interacting parts. And you'll end up affixing the "Backed by SCIENCE(tm)" label to results which have little bearing on reality. And then people will make decisions based on those labels, and if their mistake is noticed at all it will only serve to undermine their trust in science.

Don't get me wrong, the naturalistic fallacy is still a thing. +There's no sense in ideas like the paleo diet, whose adherents eat the way their evolutionary ancestors did, since the rest of their lives have changed in every way.+ Keeping a specific tiny part of the old way is like growing a single tree in the middle of a roundabout and calling it conservation. But the other way around? A "natural" system - one that's had millions of years of bug-testing by the blind idiot of random chance - can react in remarkably dangerous ways to a relatively small change that it's never encountered before.

Edit: All these issues can be avoided - it's a matter of doing science /right/. Perhaps the problem is specifically Half-Assed Science, not Science as a whole. Still, reality imposes some constraints - the pressure to publish interesting results, the tendency for non-experts to misinterpret technical data, the pressure to make a profit even on potentially incomplete information, the lack of time and manpower to collect all the knowledge you really need - that can easily make Half-Assed Science the norm.

I disagree. Eating the way our ancestors did before larger society actually makes a great deal of sense, since it is behavior closer to how our evolved bodies have functioned best. The fact that our other behaviors have changed does not speak to a lack of utility in that regression, particularly considering that a lot of our differently modern behaviors have negative effects to our physical and emotional health.

The "old way" regarding paleo is about nutrition. Human nutrition has not changed, and what we put into it has. One of the major points of the paleo diet is rejecting the temptation of the superstimuli added by sugars, fats, and other flavor additives in processed food. Superstimuli are in fact that "relatively small" change that humanity had never encountered before. What about removing that detrimental change is the naturalistic fallacy?

And in addition to that, it is a diet in the first place: a set of behaviors that make you mindful of what you eat and motivating you to keep your consumption in moderation.

  I disagree. Eating the way our ancestors did before larger society actually makes a great deal of sense, since it is behavior closer to how our evolved bodies have functioned best. The fact that our other behaviors have changed does not speak to a lack of utility in that regression.
#+end_quote

You don't know that. Your evolutionary ancestors might have spent their days hunting and been more active than the modern lifestyle of working at a computer. If you ate exactly what they did, you'd be eating too much and not burning enough calories. Some adjustment is necessary, not just in how much you eat but in the relative proportions of different nutrients - you presumably use less protein to build muscles than a more active person would. How much adjustment can you afford before your diet is no longer paleo?

That is being utterly pedantic. I'm not sure we even know the exact proportions and quantities of food they ate back then. There is no "true paleo" in regard to quantities and proportions, it's about limiting the /content/ of your meals. I'm not even someone who knows anything about paleo, I just have the general idea and read a few blog posts describing studies and the practice.

******* Okay, I've read the blog post you linked, and I /was/ wrong about what the paleo diet is. I was thinking it was something like Atkins - more meat and vegetables, less cereals and carbohydrates. In fact, the motivation seems to be more avoiding ready-made meals and heavily processed food.

Which... I sort of assumed everyone already knew that? I thought that idea wouldn't need a name like "The Paleo Diet" because it was already common sense? Didn't everyone learn to cook for themselves from their parents, and learn the reason why it's important? Surely your secondary school teachers would have mentioned it - in your Home Economics class if you had one, in Biology if you didn't. In this day and age, it would be perfectly possible for everyone in first-world countries to eat only microwave meals and takeaway pizza - and literally the only reason we don't is that people understand there's no faster way to wreck your health.

And seriously, diet is not obvious to people who know nothing about nutrition. I think it's possibly the least covered topic in even physical education classes. For classes claiming to teach healthy life practices, there was quite a dearth of learning. You are falling prey to some strange conjunction of typical mind and hindsight. No, everyone did not learn that from their parents. In my culinary class there was nothing about diet, nor was there anything in biology, because /those classes were busy teaching culinary and biology./ You are at once coming off as condescending, and ignorant for being so.

** So I was reading way too many mediocre [[http://tinyurl.com/qgd54wh][worm CYOA]] fanfics and got inspired to write one of my own (I haven't written much since high school so mine will just be extra mediocre). Only problem is I can't decide what to write! I have the first chapter of like, 5 different stories written.

I'm disabling World Breaker powers by act of ROB no matter what I do, mostly because other CYOAs have thoroughly explored them, and only a madman wouldn't choose kaleidoscope given the option.

My current plan is just to write a universe where nearly everyone has become a CYOA reincarnate. That way I can have all the most munchkiny builds in there without a protagonist instantly steamrolling the universe. Plus then I can explore the implications of a new build whenever I feel like.

Naturally such a world will quickly devolve into a high powered fantasy kitchen sink.

I've often thought that the Worm CYOA is sort of a magnet for mediocre fanfic, mainly because everything gets overpowered almost instantly and that just basically kills any tension, ingenuity or suspense. The whole things seems to have been designed by someone who has no interest in reading suspenseful stories, but has dreamed about becoming a god.

This setup would be more of a Holy Grail War or Future Diary kind of thing, though you'll need some reason to force them all to fight each other. Otherwise you end up having the 6 of them that aren't insane team up, murder/contain the other three and fix everything forever almost instantly. So maybe a time limit after which they all die if there are more than x people left alive? Or some other thing.
