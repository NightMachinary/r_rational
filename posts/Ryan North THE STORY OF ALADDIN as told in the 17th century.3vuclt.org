*** Why didn't he need Aladdin. He was trapped in the cave, but he could have been killed, and that could have been the Sorcerer.

**** He already had a wish-granting ring, though, I think is the point. Even if it was limited.

***** As I recall from actually reading the story, the magician is for some reason unable to use the ring or retrieve the lamp. I think that you can only do either if you are naive, or something, kind of like the "diamond in the rough" concept from the Disney film. That's why he sends Aladdin: the magic somehow bars him from retrieving the lamp himself. I don't think he actually knows that the ring can summon genies, only that it's magical and somehow related to retrieving the lamp.

** That's the sort of wish you make very carefully. If there's one genie there's probably others. You first need to check on the local magical threats.
