I'm new to the genre and looking for core recommendations for rational fic. I have already read HPMoR, Mother of Learning, Metropolitan Man, and am currently reading Practical guide to evil. I would appreciate the insight of the community. Thanks in advance :)


** There is a community wiki, though I can't ever seem to find a link on the sidebar since the site layout change. Here is a direct link to it: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index]]

There's a section called [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works][Defining Works]] that has a lot of good options. The ones that immediately come to mind (outside what you've posted) would be:

- Pokemon: Origin of Species (ongoing - Pokemon universe)
- Worm (completed - original superhero universe setting, pretty dark and depressing (IMO) but many people love it and it's spawned tons of fanfics)
- Animorphs: The Reckoning (ongoing... I think? I stopped reading it. Animorphs universe)
- Luminosity (completed - retelling of Twilight, with a second much more original sequel)
- The Two Year Emperor (completed - DnD universe)
- Worth the Candle (ongoing - original setting that brings a lot of tabletop and RPG staples into play. One of my favorites)
- The Erogamer (ongoing - original setting with erotic-themed "Gamer" powers. "Quest" format. DEFINITELY NSFW. You need to create a free account to get to it. It's fantastic, though)

There are also weekly Monday Recommendation Threads that are full of good suggestions. Often not completely rational, but a lot of rational-adjacent stuff is good too.

#+end_quote

Literal tons. I've been spending the last month and a bit digging through fanfic. I think I've gone through like, 3.5% or so?\\
Let's just say there's a lot of fucking fanfics.

Anyways, to expand on Worm and why it's "rational"...

- First off, the main character munchkins the fuck out of her ability. It's something that defines her.

- Secondly, the setting is created to be rational. The author sets up a starting goal of "People have superpowers" and an end goal of "people get them because of psychological trauma", and every step in-between can be reached from the one before. It's really enjoyable to just dig into the setting and find out more of it.

Though, as I just said, "people get them because of psychological trauma". Worm is not completely rational. Even though there are aspects of what someone would call rational fiction in it, the story itself revolves around flawed characters and how they're flawed.\\
If you enjoy that aspect of the story, you'd probably enjoy the sequel a lot more than I did.

I feel like this is a common talking point but having read Worm I never really felt it to be the case. Within the context of a superhero reconstruction and given her near-suicidal starting outlook & shard-induced conflict-drive, she comes up with some clever fighting strategies, but imo & iirc never really uses the OP multitasking abilities or mundane utility of her powers to much effect. She eventually uses it to read lots of texts in parallel (it's like Naruto with the whole shadow clone thing -- wholly underexploited), but never, like, travels the country as a freelance exterminator commissioning herself out to big-ag as the world's most organic insecticide, or rapidly clearing bedbug infestations from fancy hotels, or w/e, making a few hundred million and commissioning some fancy, endlessly precise (insect operated) powersuits. Even putting on a costume at all seem to put a target on her back when she could just as well operate from several hundreds of feet away in her civilian identity, unbeknownst to passersby.

***** A couple of problems with these munchkins. First off, her range is two blocks. While that would be enough to remove all insects from a hotel, it's useless on the scale agribusiness needs. She could pollinate small specialty farms, not cornfields.

Interestingly, she could make a killing growing pot, but that was never her interest.

Second, anything she can do a specialized tinker can do better. She's more versatile than most tinkers, but for any specific application there'll be at least one tinker whose whole power is that application. Multiple tinkers in canon came up with extermination tactics to fight her, so she isn't the only person who can provide that service. Tons of tinkers/thinkers can have her level of battlefield awareness or better.

Yes, her power would have insane mundane utility in our world, but the Wormverse has better ways to do all of those things.

***** I had similar criticisms for her to begin with, but I feel like she does indeed munchkin her ability to a significant degree, just not in those specific directions. Due to the limitations on her powers and the instinct that Parahumans have by default, she does manage to use her incredible multitasking and diversity to great effect. By the end of the story she is the defacto battle commander for the mission that is intended to /save the planet/ and attends almost every Endbringer fight as one of the core members of the direction and strategy teams, we don't see a lot of them but it is shown that she is very respected for these roles. She even manages to use a very niche aspect of her power to get good at something completely unrelated, shooting, which she is very good at due to the spacial awareness granted by her bugs.

****** Good point! I'd been trying to recall if the enhanced spatial awareness was used for markmanship (by planting bugs a laser sight?) was canon or fanon but wasn't sure. By the end of the story do you mean the fight against Scion post Golden Morning? And I'd agree that coordinating a team / recon is one of the better combat-related applications of her power, though might still struggle with range (it never goes beyond like 5 blocks, right?). Another good one involved synergies with other capes, e.g. timelocking tactically floated spiderwebs via Clockblocker's power, which iirc she did against Echidna.

******* The part I'm talking about is The Slaughter House a lot Arc, for most of that conflict Taylor is the one calling the shots with the big guns only watching over her shoulder, as they don't want to be directly influenced by Jack, even after she loses Jack at Elysburgh she sits in her Dragon-craft and directs fights elsewhere. And yes, her spatial awareness is canon, it comes into play basically everytime she shoots a gun, even early in the story when she isn't aware of it. She mentions it right before shooting... You know what I'm talking about, so I don't blame you for forgetting, it was hardly the most interesting thing to happen in that chapter.

***** She utilizes her powers much better than anyone in mainstream fiction would. Not perfect, but miles better than any popular superhero fiction, which I think qualifies it as essential if you're into that genre.

Side-note: I tried watching "The flash" on netflix, and my god, what hot garbage. If you're used to that level of ability utilization, worm would seem like a masterpiece of munchkinry.

More broadly though I think I've always found the ‘reed richards is useless' trope to be among the more obnoxious (despite being required as a conceit of most street-level superhero settings, else they'd be a different genre). Except when facing immediate existential punchy threats, it seems like most superheroes' comparative advantage aren't in manually fighting evildoers, but in ‘earning-to-give' lol, if not by funding social programs then at least by funding private paramilitary organizations. I guess that is what Coil does (though even then, partnership with larger organizations could have magnified his effectiveness tremendously, were he less motivated by the accrual of personal power)... the skitter case just seems like if Coil took to the streets as the vigilante ‘Schrodinger', using his precognition to dodge left /or/ right when engaging muggers in fisticuffs

Yeah, /Worm/ was completely different from what I expected. When I heard "people use superpowers rationally", I was expecting something like [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13][this]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10503877/1/The-Amazing-Peter-Parker][this]]; a story starting from the premise that people get superpowers and having them behave like rational economic agents, maybe with a dash of effective altruism. Instead, I got the opposite; a story starting from the premise that something like the DC or Marvel universes existed, with people dressing up in spandex, taking on secret identities, and non-lethally beating each other up on the streets, and trying to come up with a way it could /possibly/ make sense. /Worm/ has several layers of justification to try to make it work (the unwritten rules, the way rogues are targeted, the nature of trigger events meaning that powers usually go to traumatized individuals, the inability of Tinkers to create technology that can be reversed-engineered or even maintained by non-Tinkers, the influence of Cauldron, the nature of shards to seek out conflict and preserve hosts' lives), but I'm not sure it does.

******** Disagree. The worldbuilding is nonsense if you try to actually think about it. The Entities are stupidly complex and have complex motivations and yet lack /basic/ mental tools they would have to have had to devise the ridiculously OP capabilities they have; the conclusion of Worm relies on them not having those mental tools. Their plan to satisfy their motivation is multiple layers of insane troll logic. What Scion does on Earth doesn't make any sense, at any stage of his existence. Nothing about the existence and quantity of the Endbringers makes any sense. (And no, Interlude 27b does not make it make any more sense. The /least insane/ interpretation of that chapter is that it is blatant lies tailor-made to take Eidolon out of commission. I'm really not sure why fanon decided to take it as the truth, beyond 'MOAR GRIMDARK'.)

Worm tries to be a setting which works according to rules, but those rules are self-defeating and self-contradictory, and it's not even hard to find the contradictions.

The more intelligent it appears, the higher the probability of intelligence involved in forming it.

The entities do /extraordinary complicated/ physics (e.g. the interplanetary transportation) and psychological modeling (e.g. somehow they automatically give everyone who triggers the specific manifestation of their attached shard whose power will screw them up the most).

Significant digits is okay. Still worth a read, but it's not on the same level as hpmor. There's moments when it feels like yudkowksky wrote it, and then others where the writing drags on and on.

Magic wise, have you read the Imager series? Magic lets you reshape matter and move heat around. If there's not enough raw material or the conjuration is too complex, the spell kills you. There's only a handful of violations to this premise, and they're all established early on.

**** Fanfiction is kind of a better fit for the genre, to be honest. The premise of "fiction without dumb characters, where the systems are self-consistent and everything happens for a reason" is just more satisfying when contrasted with existing popular fiction. Plus, niche communities tend to be more willing to discuss "low-class" stuff like fanfiction, which can lead to them /only/ discussing them, as a method of distinguishing themselves from more mainstream communities.

That all being said... I don't think fanfiction is nearly as prevalant as you're saying. Most of the ongoing series now are original fiction, and there are just as many (if not more) essential works that are original fiction as there are fanfiction. Plus, a lot of the bigger stories that are rational-adjacent have their own forums ([[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]], [[/r/cosmere][r/cosmere]], etc.).

I read and loved Mother of Learning.

Have mixed feelings about Worth the Candle...respect it but don't enjoy it. Also I'm not sure how rational the hero was...he was more rational in his philosophy then his actions.

Read a bunch of reviews of Worm. It seems to be full of a lot of characters that act like insane murder hobos?

Ra is kind of hard to google. Do you have an author or website?

Unsung looks like it has promise. Also Erogamer. I started The Good Student. I'll have to give it another try.

******** With Worm, you might be thinking of the Slaughterhouse Nine, who are a group of villains that "murderhobo" would describe pretty well. The protagonists definitely aren't though. It's probably the least rational story I listed in terms of the characters themselves, but one of the most rational in terms of worldbuilding---the powers are explained really well, and it's a reconstruction of superhero fiction, basically explaining ways that certain superhero tropes could actually happen realistically.

I would separately recommend Twig, by the same author as Worm (Wildbow). It's basically a more fantastical sequel to Frankenstein. It's a bit less accessible, but the character building is some of the best I've ever read.

[[https://qntm.org/ra][Here's a link to Ra.]] It's very much an anthology, which isn't to everyone's tastes, but it's recommended around here enough that it's worth a try.

Unsong is... kind of rational? The worldbuilding is purposefully crazy, and a lot of the mechanics within it more metaphorical than fully self-consistent, but it's all in a way that makes sense. It's honestly more relevant to the rational community in that a lot of its subject matter appeals to the type of people who read rational fiction. Although it might not be what you're looking for in terms of rationality, it's still really good.

******** Also, Worth the Candle: I would agree, although a lot more at the beginning than later on, but it's made pretty explicit within the story that the intention is for it to be a coming-of-age. This is supported by the author's own statements about the main character being a self-insert, but of his teenage self rather than this current one. To me it's more of a deconstruction of rational fiction, which would make sense given the author has written some of the most foundational stories in the genre and been around for a while. He probably got bored of just writing really good rational fiction.

If you aren't a huge fan of Worth the Candle because the protagonist isn't super-rational, I would check out [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight.]] It's by the same author, and more of a straight-up representation of the genre. The protagonist still isn't the /most/ rational, but it's way less about his personal flaws than WtC. I would also check out Metropolitan Man if you haven't yet, since it's 1. also by the same author, 2. the best Superman story I've ever read, and 3. the description of it as "fanfiction" is kind of simplistic since Superman has always been open to different authors' interpretations.

********* The other reasons Worth the Candle wasn't fun for me (even though I think it is a masterpiece) is that much Existential Dread/Metanarrative undermines my suspension of disbelief, and I don't like Grimdark.

If I am going to look for fiction like X, it would probably be Mother of Learning. It's not pure rationalist, but it was refreshing to have a smart hero I didn't want to throw things at. Hero's with pragmatism and common sense are much rarer then heroes that revere the idea of rationality.\\
Looking at the Goodreads list, I also loved Jumper, A Fire Upon the Deep, and Mistborn. The Eighth Warden was recommended by someone here and while I'm not at all sure it counts it was decent.

I'd rather have an original work of sort of rationalist fiction that is well written in English than a purely rationalist work that isn't really a functional novel.

********** The unifying theme of a lot of what you've said you like seems to be creative use of consistent power systems, what with Mother of Learning and Jumper and Mistborn all focusing on that. I'd recommend Sanderson's other work in case you haven't read it, since he's basically the master of that, and his three laws of magic are a core part of rational fiction. I'd also reinforce my recommendations of Worm and Unsong, since they also focus on that. Also The Dresden Files, and The Name of the Wind (which is a masterpiece, although you might wait for the last novel to be released so you don't have to be stuck waiting forever).

Also, as a heads up, there's actually a distinction between "rational" and "rationalist" fiction (which the sidebar used to contain, but no longer does). Rational fiction has self-consistent worlds where characters make thoughtful decisions and everything happens for a reason; rationalist fiction also has those features, but with the extra caveat of explicitly focusing on good thinking, often with an emphasis on the LessWrong ideals of changing your own behaviors and recognizing cognitive biases.

As an example, Mother of Learning would be rational fiction, while HPMoR and Luminosity would be rationalist. Or, more apt to this conversation: "purely rationalist work that isn't really a functional novel" would be rationalist fiction*, while "work of sort of rationalist fiction that is well written" would be rational fiction.

*although I do think HPMoR is a pretty well-written novel in its own right

Set in an alternate universe Industrial Revolution Europe with potions that gives you supernatural powers, involving a Chinese protagonist who found himself spiritually merged into the body of a dead university student with a hole in his head. The story is about finding out the mysteries of this strange world and constantly foiling the plans of evil Lovecraftian beings.

The protagonist is extremely meticulous about things to account for Murphy's Law (in order to survive a world where mortal lives are as bubbles on the tide) and his thought processes are written in a logical and consistent manner akin to intelligent characters' "reproducible patterns of good thought" as mentioned on Yudkowsky's blog, with consistent creative usage of his powers as well as SCP-like sealed artefacts. What I've been most impressed by is that almost all of the anachronisms is eventually explained in-universe, including why one of the gods use the crucifix as his religious symbol. I can't recall any plot holes that aren't eventually addressed.

The choice of words suffers slightly from being translated from Chinese, but it's still easily readable.

****** I guess "gratuitous" has a bit of a range. The worst case is: complete tonal dissonance, sex scene sticks out like a sore thumb and feels like it was just put in because the author randomly felt like masturbating to their own prose. A milder case is, the sex scene is more organic to the plot but it still sort of feels like the plot bent itself over backwards in order to lead to sex as a plot point; which you could argue is another form of irrationality for a story, except instead of being in the service of, for example, having the main character be unreasonably successful, it's in the service of having everything resolve with people fucking for one reason or another. The totally-not-gratuitous case would be: yes, I can entirely believe in a situation where everyone is a thinking person this setup would lead to these characters having sex.

****** I believe you've just mixed up [[https://tiraas.net/about/][The Gods are Bastards]] (generally characterized as not /especially/ rational, but good (especially wrt worldbuilding), if a little overlong) with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249][Worth the Candle]] the TTRPG self-insert rational work that's mentioned elsewhere in this thread.

**** I started it. I loved it for a while, but burnt out on it. I have a limited tolerance for "What is real?" stuff. It tends to erode my suspension of disbelief.

** In addition to everybody else's recommendations, [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] (complete) (and sequels (one complete, one not) is excellent.

So are Ra and Fine Structure at qntm.org, although FS is a bit rough around the edges (both complete). The Antimimetics Division stories at SCP, by the same author, are also terrific.

It's not what I'd call a core rational work, but Everybody Loves Large Chests (in progress) is also great fun if you can get over the rapey bits.

There are a lot of things almost all rational fiction doesn't touch. Because it's hard. But even if it's hard it's worth doing.
