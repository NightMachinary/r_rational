Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Random question; who else knows how to solve a Rubik's Cube? I recently decided to learn and was so surprised at how easy it was. Within a month I know a couple of methods of solving a 3x3 and can solve a cube in less than a minute. Also it's a nearly effortless way to impress people.

*** I learned this a while back, and I'm glad I did. It was a fun few days.

Anecdote time!

I actually started learning on a bus on the way out to a summer camp I worked as a counsellor for. I had the algorithm beside me for the bus ride, but was distracted and would keep losing my rhythm or make a minor mistake and have to start over, once I got the the camp, I had less time, but I would still practice with it during my downtime (the kids loved watching it and hearing what I was doing and why). It should be mentioned here that they were third to sixth graders.

About thirty-six hours after I started, I finally solved the cube! I felt enormously proud, and all the kids were ecstatic. They all begged to see it (to check that I had, indeed, solved it completely). As they passed it around, it came to this one kid.

And this kid....he weighed the cube in his hand, that cube I had spent hours on. He looked right into my eyes, saw my pride and joy. And, without hesitation, chucked the cube as hard as he could at the wall.

It shattered into a dozen pieces.

Why?

I have no idea.

Kids.

**** Not particularly relevant since it was years ago, but did the center frame or any the cubes actually break? Rubik's cubes are surprisingly easy to take apart and put back together again, assuming all the pieces are intact.

It's an excellent way to cheat, actually. Usually much quicker to just solve it normally if you already know how, but all the anecdotes about people taking the stickers off and putting them back on again are rather amusing, since that's literally the most effort-intensive method of cheating possible.

*** It's easier to learn than most people expect.

I was once on a loooong bus-across-the-US volunteer trip that I found out very early on I didn't want to be a part of, much too late to back out. I managed to stay sane by buying a Rubik's cube at the first stop and then teaching a person or two how to solve it on the 6-8 hour bus rides between destinations. They usually picked it up in about an hour, and I'd have them spend the next hour trying it on their own and answering questions along the way. One of them came up to me a month later to show me that they still remembered how to do it.

It's a unique way to make friends if you happen to be stuck with a lot of time.

**** Solving it the first time by figuring it out myself was an experience I'd have lost if I'd looked up the algorithm. Solving a Rubik's cube again now that I know how is more of a fun thing to occupy your hands with. (It gives a little mental "ding!" of achievement every time, which may or may not be a thing for other people.) So if I couldn't figure it out the first time myself, that's what looking up a method would get me.

But there's also really complicated algorithms with lots of subcases to solve a Rubik's cube very quickly. It's not currently a priority, but it would be interesting to try to learn one of those: a very hard challenge that's very different from things I've done before and produces tangible impressive results.

** I'm working on a CCG (like Magic and Pokemon), just for fun (not planning on selling it).

Looking for theme ideas that'll fit the mechanic I'm planning on using. Both players will build their decks beforehand, trying to do something clever but not obvious. You hand your deck to the other player and they hand you theirs, you look through it for a minute or two (timed), then you start playing. You play through, then you switch decks and play with the one you built in the first place, and whichever deck won the first time, has to win better when it's creator is playing with it.

So, what theme makes sense to have you play twice, the first time with your opponents deck. I've got some ideas which I'll hold off on posting them for a while, so as to keep the idea space open.

*** The idea of figuring out how a deck works as you play reminds me of Sentinels of the Multiverse, which does that in a cooperative setting. I think part of the key is the many moving parts with which to interact with and thus be useful to the team (deck, discard, allies, enemy boss, enemy minions, environment).

As for a theme, I'm imagining a competitive game with multiple win conditions, scorekeeping that allows for the comparison, and cards which can pursue multiple different conditions either simultaneously or exclusively to obfuscate which your deck is built towards achieving.

To that end, perhaps a theme of Civilization, with cultural, military, economic, political, and scientific victories to pursue. Perhaps every Civ has the cards to build towards 3 of the 5, and you and your opponent have to figure out which of those 3 this deck is best for.

Another idea that just came into my head was mad scientists. You and another classic mad scientist have broken enough each other's respective lairs simultaneously and are both seeking to take over the world. Similar to the above idea, you could win the world by controlling the political system, extorting the world's economy, military subjugation, cultural control, or sabotaging your opponent. That has the right feel of you trying to figure out how your opponent's mad science and gadgets work while he does the same with yours.

** I've been thinking about what I want to write next, once I've finished all my deliverables for current projects, which has led me down the rabbit hole of looking into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Personality_typologies][personality typologies]]. There are a ton of these out there and lots of them just read like straight-up character personality descriptions, so I think it would be pretty neat to use one of them as a template for a group of characters. I could just pick a random typology like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality][Enneagrams]] and say, "Alright, there are going to be nine principle characters that more or less hew to these types, which is going to define their conflicts and friendships.

There are just /so many ways/ to type people, which I think plays to my natural love of ordered systems. I have a lot of questions about how accurate any of them are (whether these typologies have undergone any sort of blind testing and whether they can make accurate predictions) but there's something comforting about the idea of saying "there are nine sorts of people" or "there are four sorts of people", which feels better than saying "there are between three and sixteen types of people" or just "there are people and we're really crap at figuring them out in any ordered way".

There was a post on the frontpage of TIL today about Japanese blood type personality theory, which would be really interesting if true, which is why people treat it as though it were true; if you could know someone's personality from a simple blood test, it would simplify your interpersonal dealings enormously. The same goes for Western Zodiac signs.

Any personality type systems that you particularly like? Any you think would adapt well to fiction?

*** I'm reading The Games We Play by Ryuugi, a fanfiction which crosses RWBY/The Gamer but has its own extremely in-depth world-building, and a lot of the mythos draws from Jewish mysticism. So a lot of the story draws from the metaphysical ideas in Kabbalah, whch focus heavily on the 10 'emanations' of God, the Sephirot.

Looking into the Sephirot has yielded some interesting creative ideas for me regarding what kind of ideas characters can typify. So a character could typify Gevurah, divine judgement without mercy. Or Chesed, which is divine compassion and mercy.

Or a character could typify Keter, which is "Being desire to bring the world into being" and " although it contains all the potential for content, it contains no content itself". So this character could b someone who has no intrinsic direction to his/her life but rather has a lot of potential-- their very identity is based around being potential itself.

This is all getting rather abstract and unintelligible, but basically, I think mystical mythos/tradition have a lot of archetypes that are useful for creative work.

Interestingly, RWBY itself uses a very classical four humors ensemble, down to the color coding (red humor = sanguine, yellow humor = choleric, etc.). And though I haven't gotten to the reveal of the Riders, if there is one at this point, I thought that was drawing on some kind of Four Horsemen thing.

*** Overly sensitive moderators seem to be abundant in sustainable, big online communities (Teamliquid is an example of a webforum with very aggressive moderation but a very loyal and active community). This is not a coincidence.

Small communities don't need serious moderation since they self-moderate quite a bit. Outside of very occasional off-topicness, for example, [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is pretty much self-policing. We all know each other and post things we like.

Big communities are toughter. Communities that have upvotes/downvotes like reddit can be, to an extent, self-moderating and allow a light moderation touch, even when they get big. That's really great. That being said, upvote/downvote tree commenting (compared to a traditional bulletin board reply age sort system) isn't used everywhere since it has its own drawbacks. Part of what draws people to places like 40kO, TeamLiquid or SpaceBattles is the format. However, bulletin board format has its own problems too! And really big bulletin boards are hard to moderate.

You'll notice there aren't a lot of big traditional forum communities that are both 1) good and 2) lightly moderated. This is because your moderation options for a big community like these are limited! If you are too light on moderation, things go downhill really fast because individual users don't have the power to "downvote" a thread, and replying to a bad thread bumps it, so telling off a bad poster actually makes things worse, etc.

So basically your options are "Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy" or "Police State", and if you want people to actually post fanfics, it has to be the latter, or you have to use a different format. [[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/tl-community/17883-tlnet-ten-commandments][Team Liquid]], for example, has a set of rules that begins with "This is our house" and is broad and empowering to the moderators.

In general, I would like a fanfiction community that was 1) big, 2) BBS style, 3) lightly moderated, and 4) not a wretched hive of scum and villainy. I'm pretty sure it's not possible to have all 4 of these at once, though.

Some pointers they gave were along the lines of: Only draw your weapon if you expect to be shooting it immediately, immediately disarm if you encounter LEOs and explain why you are armed, and don't pull your weapons around LEO's unless you've already gotten permission. As far as actually stopping a shooter, that's really hard to do unless you get the drop on them from very short range with a concealed weapon, and unless you're both lucky and above average with your aim and tactics, you're as likely to be a hindrance as a help. The takeaway was, basically pretend to be unarmed unless you get an opportunity to take out someone you're absolutely sure is a shooter from very close distance.

***** Again, anecdotal/other cops may have different preferences, but immediately point the gun at the ceiling or ground, then slowly separate your hands. Basically, the first part of getting disarming as if you were being arrested except don't get down on your knees or place the gun on the ground until asked. This is when you try to explain that you have a concealed carry license and are not the shooter. You'll probably be shouted at until you get on the ground anyway, and if you are, you should completely disarm and comply. This is a terrible position to be in with an active shooter around, so you'll probably end up being arrested or at least disarmed and asked to kneel, so you should try to avoid moving around with your gun out. Also, while this may sound terrible, it really is good advice, if you're black or visibly middle eastern, don't risk being in weaver stance in an active shooter situation, because all it takes is one jumpy officer to ruin your month and/or end your life.

***** Generally I swing over to ff.net, pick a fandom and sort by most favourites and >100,000 words then click through until I find one that looks interesting and had a solid start. Once that method started to dry up working I started clicking on the favourite stories tab of authors whose stories I enjoyed, working on the theory that if I like their stuff then I'll probably like the stuff they like. After that I sorted SB and SV creative writing forums by most views and went down the list reading anything that seemed interesting.

As for why? I've been churning through books at a ridiculous rate since primary school. When I was 12 I'd have bought a new book on monday and be finished by wednesday and I've sped up a lot since then. Put simply, I'm going to read things. It's just going to happen given who I am, so I might as well read good stuff if that what's going to happen.

Edit: I suppose I feel like I can count on fanfiction? If I'm reading a book and it turns out to be terrible then I've already bought the thing, but if I'm reading a fic I can just close the story and move on with nothing lost. That, and I'd have to buy maybe 1-4 books a week to keep up with the amount of reading I do.
