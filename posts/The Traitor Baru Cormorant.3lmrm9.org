Seth Dickinson expanded one of his earlier short stories into a novel: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant]]

Edit: While looking into all his other stuff, I found this - the author himself selling the book better than I even could: [[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/guest-post-seth-dickinson-on-building-a-better-evil-overlord/]]

I just finished reading the book and think it would be perfect for the subreddit. Characterization is superb and the narrative flows logically - the main character is an accountant and often makes strategy decisions based on economics.

For fans of GoT: Imagine a Westeros where the head of every House is Littlefinger, and the main character is Varys+Littlefinger Daenerys+Roose Bolton

For those without the time or money to read a full novel, there is a short story preceding the publication of the novel. Warning - this short is almost word for word the ending chapter of the novel, and thus is potentially a huge spoiler. That said, if you like the story, the book is still worth the journey even when you know the destination:

Just... goddamn. I honestly only saw it coming about 5 pages before it happened.

Damn.

** I have the book in front of me and I'm about to finish chapter 8. I have to say, so far it is very good. The worldbuilding is impressive, and the characters impressively rational.

** Been reading this and enjoying it so far as well. I'll look forward to seeing if it has a solid ending, as I haven't read the short story. =D

** I'll probably get this, but I'm just bothered that her last name is Cormorant, so my first thought was "Wait, What, an oriental female Howard the Duck?"
