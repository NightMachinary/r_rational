** That excommunication fiasco is going to be a shitshow. Besides wrecking Cat's plan for peace and the Pilgrim's redemption trap, it's going to blow up any chances of Callow ever turning back to Good. Like, they slammed that door so hard that everyone thought it was a gunshot. Callowans aren't going to forget about that time when they were a Good nation under Evil domination and other Good nations not only did nothing to help them but also shot them in the back for trying to break free on their own.

That Hasenbach is losing control of the crusade also means that things are going to get really ugly really fast. For all its flaws, Procer is a human foe. The princes didn't sign for holy war and genocide, but the angels aren't going to care. Neither will Malicia or the Dead King, once angels hit the ground, demons will follow.

*** Actually the really interesting thing is that it opened up a door for a very different redemption arc. Procer has gone a bit off the rails and seems to have lost sight of the fact that Good and Evil aren't supposed to be arbitrary team names, but actual philosophies. With the House of Light in Callow denouncing the heroes and the Crusade as false there's now an opening Cat could theoretically exploit.

Squire, Archer, and Thief, are all neutral names that don't have to be villains. Hierophant, and Adjutant are new so shouldn't have any historical weight pushing them towards villainy. Dioblist is a defeated foe bound to servitude in death. Soverign of Moonless Night is fey and therefore outside the whole good/evil thing. Cat didn't actually become Black Queen (in spite of everyone calling her that) thanks to the Black Knight breaking the super-weapon and the name not settling in.

Cat's curent plan involves killing the Dread Empress so she won't get in the way of throwing the Dead King under the oncoming Crusade both for the goal of liberating/protect a Good Kingdom from tyranny.

This could be spun into the story of How Procer got cleansed of it's Evil via copious amounts of stabbing.

** Fuck man, Diabolist is the best. Cat becomes the Antichrist and all Akua says is "Well done!".

A lot of people point out Cat doesn't /have/ to become the Dread Empress even if she kills Malicia but I'm not so sure. It's certainly true for Heroes but that bridge has been crossed a long time ago. As a Villain, I think there's a certain narrative weight to killing the current Tyrant with your own hands that means you can't just wash your hands off of the entire affair.

If she had a choice, I suspect she'd place Black on the throne but again, I'm not sure that's how it works. He's in the middle of enemy territory, he'd have nothing to do with overthrowing the current regime and hes showed no ambition for the Tower.

Interesting tidbit: Cat was given the room that once belonged to Triumphant /even when Malicia was Dead King's guest./ Looks like he knew what was going to happen from the very beginning - or at least showed Black Queen more respect than the Dread Empress.

****** Villain immortality works much like the One Ring really. Villainy does grant what is basically immortality from mundane life and even from most warfare, just as the ring grants invisibility. But just as those "invisible" make themselves easy prey for the Nazgul, villains all but guarantee they will die in a Story significant way. For all that Amadeus treads that line skillfully, he is unique in his ability to do so and even then at times has held on by a hair's breadth.

That's the entire reason The Dead King goes for the undead version of immortality. Its a lesser experience, as Cat can attest, but it leaves him much less beholden to the trope based traps that the Bard specializes and excels in, and allows him to be on a much more even playing field with Good's immortal monster.

A woman who treats tricking the fae as a trifle and who at minimum indirectly caused the end of the Summer/Moon hostility.

As for climbing the Tower, Cat said nothing of the sort. She just said she wants to kill Malicia, which doesn't modify the old plan of bringing the Tower down, crushing Praesi nobility under the rocks and burning the ruins just to be sure. Of course, that plan is likely to go haywire and lead to climbing the tower anyway, especially with Akua as advisor.

Such an attempt is all but gauranteed to succeed due to the narrative weight behind the "ancient lich makes a fatal mistake and perishes" story. Neshamah is just like the Black Knight in that he knows the power of narrative, and therefore knows that he absolutely must nip every narrative that ends in his destruction in the bud as quickly as possible. If he starts a story about betrayal, though, he can't possibly hope to stop it himself.

And besides, he acknowledged Cat as an equal. If he knows anything about her, he should know that she doesn't really have an ego to stroke, so lying to her about her being an immortal has no value to him. He, of course, immediately gave the speech about how backstabs among their kind are just minor inconveniences rather than eternal bonds of hatred, but that also makes perfect sense. If immortals didn't work that way, they would never be able to make alliance under any circumstances.

** All right, hear me out.

The Dead King's first major act upon meeting Cat was to pull her aside and give her a tutorial in social interaction between immortals. Though it is possible that he was lying through his teeth, I find it highly unlikely due to the fact that he should know Cat doesn't have much of an ego to stroke. Lying to her about her special status has no value to him, so he has no reason to do so.

Second, we know Malicia has been to Keter. It is possible that the whole meeting where Cat proposed her terms was a sham, but again, the Dead King has no reason to turn Cat so completely sour on him so quickly. He knows that his continued unlife depends upon not creating stories that inevitably end in his destruction, and "Ancient lich makes the classic blunder of backstabbing a Callowan" is a pretty ironclad story.

Third, we know that long-distance scrying requires the placement and upkeep of amplifiers at set distances. However, it took weeks for Catherine to get to Keter through Arcadia, so it is not unreasonable to think that getting there from Ater would take many months. With an amplifier chain that long, maintaining it in secret would be difficult even if it didn't require mages to be placed in miles of barren, blasted desert for multiple years. In addition, this network is likely not perfectly secure, and it's probably not possible to maintain an open, secure scry over the entire distance without at least some of the mages along the way realizing what was being spoken, or at least who was being spoken to. There's only one person in that desert worth talking to, after all.

In conclusion, doing active negotiations through long-distance scrying is a massive security risk that is 100% gauranteed to bite Malicia in the ass for Story reasons. This means that, in order for Malicia to be making offers in real time, she must be in Keter right now.

I think Neshamah gave Cat that little speech about how backstabs are passing nuisances among immortals to manipulate her into killing Malicia "right under his own nose," as it were. Obviously, one guest killing another cannot be tolerated, and Cat and her retinue would need to make an immediate dash for the exit, presumably under pursuit by All the Legions of Hell, but that doesn't mean the Dead King would be obligated to actually pursue them beyond his walls. He could make a show of force and believably pull his punches during the chase scene, with multiple close calls for all of the Woe on the way. Once they climbed the walls and jumped into the abyss below, only for Cat to open a door into Arcadia just before they smashed on the rocks below and just after Masego confirmed that he had a means to safely arrest their momentum on the other side, the Armies of the Dead would cease pursuit entirely. The next time Cat came to treat with him, the Dead King could welcome her with open arms, the minor betrayal understood as a passing annoyance with a mortal interloper.

I mean, yeah, theologically they probably shouldn't have done that and Procer/Levant/Ashur are probably right to call them at least a tiny bit heretical for sanctioning Cat's rule.

So, is the position of the HoL in Laure is that villains are bad and the people should be incensed against them, but it's kinda okay to be ruled by one if you don't have much of a choice, and it's really everyone /else/ who are the heretics for not understanding that distinction?

Alternatively, if the Saint of Swords had nothing to do with it, holy hell Good fucked up. Heads will /roll/ for daring to accuse her of what they have

** I feel like I'm missing something... why does Catherine being declared Arch-heretic of the East strike the group as a serious mistake on Procer's part? I mean, I understand why they come to the conclusion that it's a sign she's losing control of the crusade, but if she actually had been responsible for this, why would it be bad for Hasenbach? Diplomacy has already failed - Callow was already going to be invaded again. She only keeps her Proceran princes on board if they have a chance to snatch up land, so that was a foregone conclusion anyway, wasn't it? All this means is that the next invasion will also need to kill some heretical priests as well as the Army of Callow.

And honestly I'm a bit surprised that the reaction of most of the Callowan Houses of Light was to back Laure's stance. The country is already split over Catherine's reign, so I feel like a significant portion of both the priesthood and regular religious folks would have turned on Laure. It's like if the Catholic church declared that the King of England was a heretic, and so was the archbishop who crowned him. Sure, a lot of people who are invested in them continuing to rule would stick with them, but plenty would go "Hey, yeah, these guys are actually heretics... no way we're going to keep following them." After all, the priesthood DID crown and endorse a Villain, so it's not like the charge of heresy is incorrect. I'd have expected civil war to break out at the proclamation, rather than just a couple small riots in a city or two. I guess this means that even the religious citizenry are Callowan first, and faithful to the Gods Above second?

Anyway, I guess this helps explain what The Dead King meant last chapter when he said:

#+begin_quote
  “A shame that her understanding of what a crusade is was so lacking, but it is too late to leave the saddle once the lion is ridden."
#+end_quote

Sounds to me like a Crusade is something that ends only when one side or the other is wiped out. And the "sides" are strictly defined by Good and Evil, not by countries. So even if Callow is beaten, even if Praes is beaten, the Crusade will continue and invade Serenity after. And if they actually beat The Dead King, they'd then attack the Chain of Hunger or the drow after. It doesn't stop so long as there's any Evil, unless the leaders of the Crusade want to face the consequence of disobeying the Gods Above (which is a surefire death sentence). Does that sound correct?

Because they effectively declared the priests in Laure heretics. Who are the people going to believe? Some foreigners or their own priests? Callowans is all about keeping their grudges, and add the retaliation from Laure's house of light, means that the people will unite behind Cat rather than oppose her. So any possibility of popular uprising against her just died.

I mean, but it's common knowledge that the House of Light in Laure endorsed Catherine, who is a Villain. That's pretty clearly heresy, no? And although in the real world this would be unresolved bickering between different churches, in the Guideverse the Gods Above exist and interact with Creation. Their stance seems clear on which side is Good, and it isn't the one run by a Villain. If they didn't support the Crusade, then the heroes wouldn't have flocked to it, and if the Gods Above don't agree with the heresy declaration, I imagine any heroes trying to fight Callowans would lose their power.

I originally used the Catholic church versus the Church of England as an example, but I guess worship of the Gods Above isn't analogous to Catholicism. Seems more similar to Protestantism, where even though all worshipers pray to the same God, there are huge differences between the actual practices and beliefs depending on sect, language, and location. This is less like the pope condemning a branch of the same religion, and more like several different sects collectively condemning another. Baptists wouldn't care if the Lutherans, Methodists, and Calvinists called them heretics, for example. Looking at it that way, you're right, it makes a lot of sense.

***** Even in this world where Gods are a thing, things like the Liturgical Wars still happens. So unless the Callowan priests loose their ability to cast miracles, there's no reason to believe that the House of Light in Laure is more heretical than the others.

*** Even if an enemy country has done something that warrants a bombing, it is still a mistake to escalate straight to /nukes/. That's the issue here. The Crusader churches went straight for the theological-political equivalent of nukes.

Callow was mostly behind Cat. She was very popular with the lower and middle classes but unpopular with the nobility and church. The truebloods were purged by Thief so while the nobles aren't for her they are no longer against her. Now the church is being driven to support her.

The thing about Callow is that they will side with a Callowan they hate over a foreigner they love every time.

#+begin_quote
  “It's a feudal disaster is what it is,” Thief said. “It means that any oaths sworn to her are dissolved by holy writ and that /any who follow her are ‘estranged from the light of the Heavens/'.”
#+end_quote

This declaration essentially excommunicates everyone who doesn't immediately turn on her. Everyone from Brandon Talbot to the high priest to a scullery maid to the random carpentry contractor who does one job replacing one door at the palace are now both damned to hell and a valid target for the Crusading army, according to the Crusader Churches.

And this is /Callow/. The "fuck your outside interference" nation.

They have essentially declared war on both the people and priesthood of Callow. The response is inevitably going to be "fuck you then it's war."

They can argue the Callowan priesthood collaborated with a villain and there might be /some/ merit to the argument but you will notice there was no mention of the Callowan priesthood losing access to miracles and priestly power or a bolt of lightning hitting the House of Light.

Laure's House of Light may have flirted with crossing a line /but they are still in good with the gods above/. For a Proceran church to declare them heretics while the gods haven't and a Proceran army is invading them? It /screams/ of warping religion to serve political aims, and naturally that is what Callow's priesthood is accusing them of.

Essentially, for many this strips away the divine backing of the Crusades and reduces it to a sectarian conflict. /This/ political group is backed by /this/ sect following the Gods Above and /that/ political group is backed by /that/ religious sect following the Gods Above. The story has been tipped away from "Divine Crusade to free the people of Callow from the dreaded tyranny of the Black Queen" and much closer to "Proceran expansionism using religion to get other nations to help with the dirty work."
