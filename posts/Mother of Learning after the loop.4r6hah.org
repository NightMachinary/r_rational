So, I've been rereading MoL in light of recent developments at the end of second and start of the third arc. I'll probably put together some lengthier post later, but something just fell into my eyes.

#+begin_quote
  [No. First of all, they intended to summon a large amount of high-level demons to help with the invasion. This was why they were willing to go through with the attack, despite their lack of success against us and their inability to do much to the academy and its wards. Demons, especially high-level ones, are virtually immune to mental attacks and highly resistant to magic. The aranea would be massacred in no time at all, and the mages would be too busy fighting for their lives to help out the city's mundane defenders. Those same defenders would be up against trolls and fire elementals, who are immune to firearms, with winter wolves and iron beaks acting as support. ]

  "That... that's horrible," Zorian said after digesting that for a second. "Why aren't they doing that now?"

  [They can't, remember? No summoning anything while in the time loop. The whole material plane has been cut off from the spiritual ones,] the matriarch reminded him.
#+end_quote

So basically, Zorian and Zach both had problems dealing with the invasion before, none succeeding in stopping it, and as it seems, the final invasion, when the simulation ends, will be far more difficult to deal with.


** Quatch-Ichl was mostly carrying the invasion before. With the aid of their three soul magic specialists they can probably stop him. The rest of the damage can be sharply limited.

*** Agreed. If Zach and Zorian find a way to kill Quatch Ichl as soon as the loop starts they might have a chance. And they need to find a way to get to him anyway in order to get his items for their upcoming quest, I'm guessing.

**** You'd need to find his Phylactery. But, regardless, you don't need to kill a lich in that situation. Just destroy his body so that the soul returns to the Phylactery. It will take a few months before the Lich is a problem again, and by that time the invasion issue will have been solved.

****** If you kill him the day of the invasion, even if he can have a body ready within a day, he'll still get back to Cyoria way too late to do anything about it. Yes, it could be annoying to deal with again, but once the army is taken care of, the (remaining) combined might of the city should be more than enough to crush him if he tries to do anything too public.

******* True, true ... Of course, he's smart and would probably just wait another 400 years rather than recklessly throw away his life, at which point Zorian and Zach wouldn't care anyways, so the problem would be solved.

But the thing is, he was always rather tough to get. I mean, the only time Zorian managed to get him down, was when QI thought he was just a student and talked to him.

Other times during the invasion he just teleported in, killed Zorian, and most likely teleported out.

So even considering that he can be dealt with, the problem is getting to him first.

While we don't know how exactly the soul stores memories, I'd wager that a very gradual change might not trigger the projections in place. So he'd forget memories of one year in about one year. You can still erase his mind, it just takes longer

** Yeah the events of the invasion with demons would make things worse and factoring in that there had to be some reason for the Loop to be initiated in the first place I wouldn't be surprised if stopping the invasion was a possible the goal of the loop by being able to learn how the enemy thinks. At this point it is hard to speculate why the loop was started as neither Zorian or Zach have memories of that and red robe has left the loop permanently. So it is nothing more than an untested hypothesis.

*** It's unlikely that the loop was deliberately created to stop the invasion, since it was triggered a month before the invasion took place.

That would only work if the Maker found out about the invasion early, and decided that the loop was the best way to counter it - a strange reaction, at best, and given how it has drastically shortened the total loop duration, quite suboptimal.

**** Hmm I do see the point and I will admit I am grasping at straws but the reason for the loop initially is a huge mystery so I was more or less grasping at any possibility I could see. In retrospect the release of the primordial ending a loop early is a counter point. I guess we just lack enough information to make a decent hypothesis on why the loop was started.

****** Possibly that or the initiator wanted to maximize the length of the loop (obviously before Zach started wasting energy through repeated resets) After all the largest drain on the loops power is the reset meaning that the starting set up would have granted the longest loop time possible had their not been those wasted cycles by post memory wipe Zach.

******* No, they did the opposite of maximising the length of the loop. The Guardian made it clear that the Gate was designed to be started at the peak of the planar alignment, and would have lasted far longer (11 lifetimes, perhaps?) if that had been done.

"The time loop is normally supposed to be initiated at the peak of planetary alignment," the Guardian explained. "Unfortunately, something seems to have gone wrong and the time loop has been activated one month prior to it. This made everything more costly, causing the time loop to degrade far more rapidly than it is supposed to."

** Between Quatach-Ichl, the demon hordes, Sudomir, the fact that Zorian will need to start over with the aranea, and of course the cult mages summoning the primordial, I wonder whether there's enough difficulty to justify pre-emptively eliminating Red Robe.

Otherwise, in case you need more difficulty, add random headache at the end of simulation, due to the real body adapting to idk what kind of stuff ... Skip three weeks and make Zorian's schedule really tight. Perhaps he'll prove incapable of solving everything and we'll get epic battle with primordial where gods also get involved ...
