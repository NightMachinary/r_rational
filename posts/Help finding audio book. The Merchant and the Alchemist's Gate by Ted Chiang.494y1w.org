edit: Seems to be back up. Maybe a network issue. If you haven't listened or read the story, I would highly recommend it.

I hope this is the right place, but I was hoping someone could help me find a fantastic reading of a book by Ted Chiang.

The story was originally on [[http://www.uvulaaudio.com/merchant.html][this site]]. It had a wonderful speaker and really brought the story to live, but it seems in the last few days the link doesn't work.

If anyone has a copy or alternative link, it would be greatly appreciated. I'm currently scouring the internet to find an alternative. It would be a shame to lose this audiobook.


** I just tried it and it works.
