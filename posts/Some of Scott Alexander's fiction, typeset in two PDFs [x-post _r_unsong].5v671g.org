** Thanks for compiling them together, this is fantastic! They really do look professional. Reading in an ebook format is so much better.

If anyone's interested I also took the liberty of making an [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxFRUeX-WeaheElUY05yU2U0d28][epub format]] of Scott Alexander's fiction based [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3u39yg/a_collection_of_scott_alexanders_literary_works/][on this list]]. Format might be a little wonky here and there, but it's all there.
