*** Maybe that was high-handed of you... but literally the OP starts by defining rational fiction in the most insulting way possible (and such that only a caricature of HPMOR fits his definition), and then various posters continue with either claiming that rational fictional=good fiction (despite numerous counter examples of good fiction that is not 'rational') or lumping all rationalist fiction in with the worst traits of HPMOR or any number of misunderstandings that show they have only read 1 or 2 rationalist stories and not bothered reading the subreddit of tvTropes page at all.

So the thread was probably going to be shitshow regardless.

Edit* expanding on my post because I thought of more points to rage about... Earthscorpion shows up to tone police, not the numerous other insults such as calling rational fanfic fans EY cultists, but rather Daystarelds' post calling them out. People trying to get the thread "back on topic" by returning to the OP even though OP was poorly thought out and/or outright trolling, also ignoring what little advancement the discussion has had from OP. The LotR being brought up 3 separate times, with the discussion repeating itself down the same way. People asking why JJBA isn't rational in order to call [[/r/rational]] too general... like wtf, in JJBA new applications of powers and powers themselves are randomly invented every couple of fights, the fights often consist of absurd guesses and predictions of opponents actions... trying to call it rational to prove that rational fix definition is too general seems especially disingenuous to me (for the record, I found the dozen or so episodes I watched to be fun, but too repetitive for me to watch the whole series).

So I think your mistake was trying to fairly engage with them at all.

From my lurking on space battles and other forums, I have seen people that know that lesswrong is just a collaborative blog yet still choose to use the "cult" label.

** Ugh. It's a good thing to have critics, but I really wish the criticism was /better/. Most of the issues the author seems to have with rational fiction really only hold for bad fiction. Having competent antagonists and secondary characters is a founding principle of rational fiction. It is definitely possible to evoke the feeling of a genre without jumping directly into its traps and inconsistencies. Rule based magic systems allow themselves to be used as major solutions without feeling anticlimactic. Trope longevity doesn't necessarily indicate the quality of a trope.

The observation that characters seem to become less human in rational fiction is true somewhat more often than the others. It's not true most of the time however and isn't a necessary part of rational fiction. Characters failing due to biases and errors in judgement is a hallmark of rational fiction, and I think rational fiction does a better job of handling this than a lot of other genres. It is a much more enjoyable thing to see a character make a mistake and then have that mistake dissected and analyzed than to have a character fail and never learn from it.

This view of rational fiction seems to take the worst pieces of fiction that claim the label and then say that the problems with them are inherent parts of rational fiction as a genre. This is problematic.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    The definition of rational fiction has been debated at great length, so I'm not going to touch on how it applies to unaffilliated works, but stories written to fall into that category follow guidelines summarized on [[/r/rational]]'s sidebar:

    Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

    Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

    The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

    The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
  #+end_quote

  Which runs into the same issue that's been raised over and over - by this description, The Lord of the Rings is rational fiction. I Want My Hat Back is rational fiction. Frozen is rational fiction. Star Wars is rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Really, as their examples of things that fit these criteria they picked /The Lord of the Rings/ and /Star Wars/? They would be hard-pressed to find worse examples.

/Star Wars/ literally has a dark side and a light side of the force, with the Empire committing genocide and the rebels saving planets of cute aliens.

/The Lord of the Rings/ was explicitly constructed to be an epic about the conflict between good and evil. That's the entire point of the series.

It is simply staggering to me that they could say something so fundamentally incorrect yet still believe that they are shedding light on someone else's unacknowledged biases.

***** PGtE isn't particularly rational, as it doesn't make a serious effort to have "fair play whodunnits." Given any particular decision, you can see that it was in-character with the information they had, but you likely couldn't have predicted the character would do them beforehand with the informationn /you'd/ been given. There's also a fair bit of "not explaining the plan." What got me to decide it wasn't rational specifically was the way [[#s][Spoilers]]. As a reader, I didn't know enough about how the in-universe narrative-causality worked to predict it beforehand in any real sense.

Of course, I might have missed some foreshadowing a few chapters earlier, in which case I'd be wrong.

It's still a great story, of course, and I'm happy to see it posted for discussion, but it's more rational-tangent than actually rational, like worm is.

That's not actually a requirement for rational fiction as far as I can tell from the sidebar. Characters have to solve problems through the application of /their/ knowledge, not yours.

******* The reason I consider the fair play whodunnit as crucial to rational fiction is because it's the means by which we determine whether the other tenets of rational fiction were upheld.

#+begin_quote
  1.) Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

Here, if you only find out the plausible reason after the fact, that's functionally identical to something happening because the plot required it; the author made something happen, and /then/ provided the justification. Of maybe they planed everything books in advance, but the point is that we wouldn't /know/.

#+begin_quote
  2.) Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

This one doesn't actually require a fair play whodunnit, I admit.

#+begin_quote
  3.) The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Here, again, the fair play whodunnit is necessary. Without holding the information in advance, it's again impossible to tell if the character was given their information previously, or if the author decidedto bestow that information to get out of a corner they'd written themselves into. Offscreen character knowledge a character couldn't be expected to know is functionally identical to powers as the plot demands.

#+begin_quote
  4.) The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

And this one pretty clearly requires the fair-play whodunnit as well. If we don't understand the rules of the fictional world, then we can't make a judgement on if they're sane and consistent.

Of course, not all of these things need to happen all of the time; an author can chose to break genre conciets to make better writing. But it's my personal judgement that PGtE doesn't follow these rules often enough (well, save 3, paradoxically) to qualify as rational. If there was some way to predict its internal narrative causality, it would count. But with the system as vague as it is, it's too hard to predict to be properly rational.

But the problem with "checking it backwards," is that the author gets to decide the probabilities /after/ the fact. That lets them skew the probabilities to whatever would work, again making the lack of a fair play whodunit effectively author fiat.

#+begin_quote

Knowledge is power. Central to the idea of rationalfic is that characters don't get new powers as the plot demands. Even if the character could have reasonably expected to have that knowledge, not revealing the knowledge to the reader beforehand makes it a result of plot fiat, because the author could have made up any other piece of knowledge and used it instead. [[#s][Spoilers]]

I even run into this problem myself-- in my own fic, even though I (try to) foreshadow discoveries about the magic system in advance, I could easily have interpreted the magic system in some other way, and the readers wouldn't have known. As such, I don't consider my fic as meeting requirement #4, and only consider it as fulfilling #1 and #3 because the main conflict is political, rather than being about the magic system itself.

This might be a definition issue, as mine is pretty wide. I define a setting's rules to be any in-text thing that restricts how the reader can expect the plot to progress. For example, prophecies, limits on superpowers, clearly-deliniated moral boundraries, etcetera. Out-of-text narrative causality is not part of those rules.

Thus, I consider in-character knowledge as part of a setting's rules because, at least in a rational fic, a character's actions are constrained by what they know (as opposed to fortuitous hunches).

How do you define what a setting's rules are?

#+begin_quote
  See my post here. It's actually pretty causal, with strict Plot structure.
#+end_quote

I admit-- this /could/ negate my previous arguments. I don't have any direct arguments against your conclusions, but I'm not convinced that they have /predictive/ power.

I'll cede the discussion if, from an explanation of where we currently are in the plot, you can offer a general prognosis of how the story will develop in the short term. I'm not asking for specific events (that would be unfair) but more a prediction of which part of the hero's journey will be hit in the near-future of the story. I don't tend to read particularly in depth (I love PGtE, but I'm not really the kind of person that does a ton of analysis), so, unfortunately, you're going to have to PM me, but I do promise to accept any reasonable interpretation of how an event matches up with your prediction.

"Reasonable" is of course a bit of a weasel word, so to more rigorously define it in this context, I mean that an interpretation must concern a plot-advancing event, rather than one intended primarily for characterization or world-building. I also ask that, under your own subjective judgement, no superior candidate for some other, disjunct part of the cycle happened prior or after. (For example, you predict that we're at "call to adventure" and that we'll see "refusal of the call," but a candidate for "meeting with the mentor" happens before to the refusal.

I'm dropping burden of proof pretty hard on you, and I'm sorry for that, but you seem like you'd be doing this kind of analysis anyways :P

********** Well, you define rational fiction not how I define it-e.g. I don't consider it "Central to the idea of rationalfic is that characters don't get new powers [knowledge, in this context] as the plot demands". Characters can get things as plot demands it, as long as there is a plausible reason for it(as there was one, in the case of Catherine) I am not sure what else is there to discuss. I agree that a lot of appeal in rational fiction is being able to guess where the plot is going to go, but I don't think it's strictly /necessary./ Often happens due to how the four rules interract, but not absolutely required.

Whatever laws of physics/Not!physics are in play. E.g. Name magic in PGtE, Rule Of Three stuff, interraction between magical weapons and Named, all that stuff. Characters may or may not be correct in their assumptions about the /actual/ rules.

#+begin_quote
  I'll cede the discussion if, from an explanation of where we currently are in the plot, you can offer a general prognosis of how the story will develop in the short term.
#+end_quote

O come on, that's not fair. We are literally one interlude away from the epilogue of this book. That's pretty much the most unpredictable place in the whole story-this revolution of Hero's Journey just ended, new one will begin in the next book, we already received our Boon and other stuff.

I /think/ that Heiress never actually wanted to rule Liese, and in the interlude we might see what her actual plan was. Given some previous foreshadowing about her father -"if he'd genuinely found a way to make flying fortresses less costly it could be very useful"-her wanting Liese just to use the population as sacrifices is a real possibility. That would also pay off all the mentions of flying fortresses in a satisfying way. Another possible plot development is re-appearance of Lone Swordsman as an undead abomination under control of the Heiress, since his body is in an extradimensional bubble controlled by her, though I don't think he will play a major role.

Hmm. Now that I think about him, we never saw the end of that supposed "redemption story" with him. Catherine is so in tune with her villainy that she isn't getting redeemed any time soon, but Swordsman was certainly doubting his heroism by the end of it. Problem was, he couldn't be redeemed as long as he was allied with the Choir of Contrition. If, however, he is raised as an undead abomination, and sees that Callow being governed by Catherine /works/... That has possibilities. I'll add it to the Possibility Hat.

In general, I think next book (I suppose it's possible that this won't happen until book 4, but I don't think that is likely) will focus on Catherine accquiring a new name, like The Dark Queen of Callow. To do that, she would have to overcome three challenges somehow related to Callow. I think that Heiress would be defeated by the end of the book, after 3 encounters with her (either the same ones, or a different parallel set), which would signify the triumph of New Age villainy over the old age crazyness. Procer is likely to make some sort of move soon too, since they had that Stairway thing and were clearly just using the rebellion to buy time. Catherine is likely to end up needing to protect Callow from a crusade at one point or another. Also, there were two elves who were heading for Liese to do something important there.

TL;DR predictions for the interlude/epilogue, from most to least likely:

- Heiress unveils her evil plan related to Liese
- Procer starts to make their move related to crusades
- Elves do something in Liese, very likely relating to Heiress
- Catherine finally tells the Empress what she wants (to rule Callow)
- Swordsman's body is mentioned and/or he is raised as an undead
- Black gets an explanation from the Empress
- Robber's Name is confirmed

************* Thank you for the analysis. I don't think all of your prediction follow from internal logic, but there are a fair number I'd not only concede the argument for, but be actually convinced that PGtE is a rational fic, and not just ceding the argument on its technical merits.

#+begin_quote
  ...she would have to overcome three challenges somehow related to Callow.
#+end_quote

While a little vague on the timeline, you're making this prediction directly because of the setting's internal logic, so if Catherine needs exactly three callow-related challenges to get her name, this will definitely convince me that PGtE is a rationalfic.

#+begin_quote
  I think that Heiress would be defeated by the end of the book, after 3 encounters with her (either the same ones, or a different parallel set), which would signify the triumph of New Age villainy over the old age crazyness.
#+end_quote

If this happens, I'll cede the argument. Conditional to the "triumph of new age villany" being directly acknowledged in story, I'd also be convinced. The disparity is due to the fact that, as the viewpoint character, I'd expect Catherine to win anyways, so just her beating Hieress alone wouldn't quite convince me.

#+begin_quote
  Heiress unveils her evil plan related to Liese
#+end_quote

As your top prediction, if this happens in the epilogue, I'll cede the argument and be convinced of PGtE's status as a rationalfic, on the logic that if you can make a prediction that precise, then clearly the internal logic of PGtE is well define enough to be rational.

#+begin_quote
  Robber's Name is confirmed
#+end_quote

I myself can see where this follows from PGtE's internal logic, so if this happens in the epilogue, I'll both cede and be convinced.

#+begin_quote
  Procer starts to make their move related to crusades\\
  Elves do something in Liese, very likely relating to Heiress\\
  Catherine finally tells the Empress what she wants (to rule Callow)\\
  Swordsman's body is mentioned and/or he is raised as an undead\\
  Black gets an explanation from the Empress
#+end_quote

I'm rather iffier on these, as these predictions don't rely on the setting's internal logic with regards to narrative causality. If any of them happen in the epilogue, I'll concede, but probably won't be internally convinced.

So now we just need to wait for the next chapter. Which is hard enough /without/ the resolution of an argument hanging over my head :( How could you do this to me, man?

I don't think Robber having a Name is extremely likely, but it seems to be so sensible. He is known as "the craziest goblin", casually does unique memorable things (e.g. that thing with the demons, or him riding a bomb towards the gates of Liese and then surviving the blast), is quite often involved in situations where only Named should really participate (e.g. he was the /only/ non-Named in the room when Catherine was respawned). All of that points to him having a Name, in my opinion.

** All of these points are false and/or solve each other.

For points two and three, of course most fiction hase genre caveats and weird people who do things without using logic. The whole point is recognizing that fiction is riddled with these characters and putting a rational character into the middle of them. The main reason a lot of rational fiction is fanfiction is it's poking fun of and exploiting the fact that the cannon characters do irrational things and pointing out how they're being irrational.

Further, point two is definitely false. You can easily have a character who's rational and logical but isn't a cold emotionless robot. For example, basically any educated person in real life. Certainly some characters in some rational stories go too far, sometimes on purpose sometimes not. But since typical stories don't even attempt to use logic or rational behavior in the same way that humans do, it's not unreasonable to try to add some more logic. If you tried to write as realistic a character as possible into the Harry Potter universe, it would certainly end up looking a lot closer to HPMOR than it would to cannon.

As for point one, it's also blatantly false. You can write a story in which multiple or even all characters are rational. Or you could write one with rational characters and "normal" story characters. Maybe they'll look stupider in comparison, but it's only necessary to actually make them stupider if you're making a Mary Sue rational circlejerk fanservice sort of story. in HPMOR, he did sort of make Dumbledore... not stupid per se, but kind of weird in my opinion. But Quirrelmort was definitely rational. Hermione and Draco were rational at least in so far as they did things for well thought out, intelligent reasons. And most of the other characters were just sort of normal people.

Mostly this guy is just sort of taking the worst flaws that some rational fiction writers make and trying to argue that they're somehow inherent and unavoidable to the genre as opposed to over-exaggerations that some new writers occasionally make. An issue that occurs in all fanfiction, not just rational ones.

** Such an odd rant. One of the reasons I really enjoy rational fiction is because this:

#+begin_quote
  One: To create a hypercompetent main narrator you must make everyone else incompetent.
#+end_quote

... is not supposed to happen. I can think of several rational or rationalist fanfictions I've read where the source material has much more incompetence; HPMOR, R!Animorphs, Pokemon: TOoS, Metropolitan Man, Luminosity.

I wonder what the ranter had been reading?

#+begin_quote
  Which leads into the second problem with rational fics: the characters are too focused on 'intelligence' or 'rationality' and somehow forget to be people.
#+end_quote

Sometimes I can see this as a valid point, but usually the longer a work goes on, the less I feel that way. I've been eating up /Heroes Save the World/ recently and originally felt the kids were just too emotionally detached to be believably dealing with the situation... and then I get to an entire chapter that focuses on the trauma it's been inflicting on one of them.

And in some other fics with rational themes (if not exactly rational entirely), it's a plot point. In /The Games We Play/ it is mentioned as a plot point several times that the kind of modifications and trials facing the main character should be cracking his mind like an egg, but his power helps protect him and make it no more traumatic than, well, a game.

#+begin_quote
  Plus what's the point of having real conflicts if your character will just go 'this is the optimal' solution, solve it, done done NO FUCKING TENSION AT ALL.
#+end_quote

Again, this seems to make no sense and makes me wonder what he's been reading. I can't think of any rational fiction I've read with a straight-up Mary Sue who instantly figures out the best method and never makes a mistake. A huge part of the drama is that the characters often know they /don't/ know enough and hope their plan works based on their limited information or options. Plenty of rational fiction is extremely dark for exactly this reason; /Worm/ comes to mind.

#+begin_quote
  Three: Do you realize what genre cavets and aesthetic trappings are?
#+end_quote

I just think this is a matter of preference. Some people prefer not to look deeper at the concepts in a story - they are happy to go along for the ride and trust that things will work out. But it's a key part of rational fiction that there are rules (even if they may be almost entirely unknown). I much prefer creative solutions to macguffins or "it happened for the sake of the plot." Others, maybe, do not. But even then there are fictions where the twist is that the plot or macguffin are also guided by rules. /A Practical Guide to Evil/ has this as a running theme; the meta-conflict is whether the structure set up by Good and Evil can be overthrown, and if the characters are actually doing so or are just acting out their roles. /Unsong/ is entirely based on this; everything that happens is for the sake of the plot, because nothing is a coincidence.

As mentioned, I wish the ranter had given some concrete examples of what works he's thinking about. The only one I think I've read on Sufficient Velocity is /Dungeon Keeper Ami,/ and I think the only point of his that might apply is the idea of incompetent foes.

Edit: One last thing is that the ranter's definition of "rational" does not match what I think of (which is the sidebar here). His rant specifically seems to be against science porn that masquerades as rational/ist/ fiction. Not actually rational fiction in general.

*** I would not count Worm as rational fiction. it does have cases of characters thinking things through, but it also has as a more or less explicit conceit that shards mess up people's ability to be clearheaded and get along, as well as having cosmic entities that think in arbitrary ways and several plot devices. And not every character uses their abilities in the most efficient way (I have a hard time seeing why Contessa doesn't get up each week and go "path to having a list of the 20 most interesting things that will happen this week, by my current standards and assuming no further uses of this power".)

Some of these things are arguably rational, but I'd say they are only rational in a trivial way. "People fight because shards make them want to" is, literally, people doing things for a reason, so the definition is literally satisfied, but I think that goes against its spirit.

** I feel like a large part of the disagreement is the expectation that =rational= fiction should be a well defined genre, with sharp lines deciding whether a particular fic is or isn't rational. That might be the case for rational/ist/ fiction, but rational fiction really just stands for writing that people around here like.

And hey, it might be that the things that make some book good to us (consistent characters, a sensible setting that follows its own rules, etc) are also the things that make some book good to other fanfic communities. There's definitely a self-selection process going on here. Thus the occasional statement of 'rational just means /good/'.

It doesn't. Rational means good for us. "50 shades of grey" and "Twilight" are /good/ fiction. Look at the sales! People *LIKE* them. Maybe not the people around here, maybe not the kind of people that go into detailed analysis of particular fiction genres on online forums. But others do.

So we need a word for a particular class of writing that appeals to us, that is consistent and well characterised and avoids plot holes etc. etc. Because we used to call that 'good', but that is empirically incorrect. And 'rational' is a word, it fits the spirit of the concept, and so it took off.

I kind of disagree with this. I mean, yeah, we had to find a label for it and that's the one that stuck, but "rational fiction" pretty well describes the core tenets of the genre, as defined in the sidebar and on the tvtropes page and elsewhere.

I don't see why we should back down from the label and say "Rational means good for us." No, rational fiction means rationally written and explored fiction. Not all rational fiction is "good" and not all non-rational fiction is "bad."

And that doesn't mean my taste in stories isn't affected, to some degree, by how rational it is. I liked The Dark Knight even though it's got plotholes big enough to drive a batmobile through, but I didn't like The Dark Knight Rises because those plot holes were big enough to sink a football stadium into. (Was it a football stadium? I forget. You get the point.) If TDK was more irrational I would have liked it less, and vice-versa. But I can explain why, objectively. That I care about those things is part of my personal taste, but those things themselves are not.

It would be like calling "stream-of-consciousness" a genre, when it's really more of a tactic or style used.

I think this is supported by the fact that "rational" is a bit of a sliding scale; no one gets into arguments over whether or not a story is fantasy, or more fantasy than another fantasy (barring perhaps Star Wars), but whether a story is rational is very much greyscale. Some stories are more rational than others.

In addition, would it be possible to have a rational story that did /not/ overlap on any other genre circle in a venn diagram? A rational story that was not also a mystery, or a superhero story, or a sci-fi, or what have you? If it can't stand alone, I'm not sure it deserves to be called a genre.

This. I had to stop reading the thread because People Being Wrong In Obvious And Simple Ways is very frustrating, but I was hoping that we might be able to come up with a better definition of rational fiction.

I like how you describe it as an approach rather than a genre. Maybe it's comparable in that sense to e.g. "grimdark." I don't think that you can quite have a "grimdark genre" but there's definitely a cluster of shared qualities, and you could easily have an [[/r/grimdark]] that talked about grimdark fiction. Hell, insofar as some people think that all good literature has to be depressing as fuck, you could easily see a "Why 'Grimdark' is Problematic" thread where some of the posters are arguing that "grimdark" is just being used to describe good fiction and is a useless term.

****** There's still a pretty big leap between a story being a Romance, and a story having romantic elements (such as Star Wars). I wouldn't call Star Wars a Romance, there's a very particular focus that romantic stories have that Star Wars delegates to the backburner.

Which makes the comparison to Rational pretty apt, I suppose. We have a conflation of vocabulary between Rational the genre that presupposes munchinry, transhumanism, AI, competency porn, and setting fixing, and the rational elements that we have on the sidebar. We've noticed this problem and have bandied about "rationalist" to attempt to address it, but I think that's fixing a different problem.

So as usual, I guess we have vocabulary to blame at the heart of it all. Rational the genre, vs rational elements, and one side is talking about one while the other is objecting about the perceived sleight on the other.

**** On the rational writing podcast, when discussing the definition of rational fiction, the idea that it was 'thinky' fiction came up, that a common feature in rational stories is that they made you think about what was going on.

I think it's slightly more general than that, and I'll say that I think the (or, at least, /a/) core of rational fiction is that intelligence is a core virtue of the story. Battles will be won and lost primarily based on who had the better plan, who prepared more, who improvised the quickest, and so on. This would be in contrast to the 'generic action show' where Determination and Fighting For What You Believe In are core virtues that decide the outcome. In generic action show, whether the battle is won or lost depends almost entirely on whether the hero can get his second wind when things look down (often triggering some superpower to justify the success of said second wind, but it's the same thing).

This explains quite a few things, such as why rational fics tend to have anticlimaxes more than usual. You specifically /need/ a long, drawn-out fight to show off the raw willpower and determination of the protagonist at the climax, but in rational fiction you don't specifically need that, since you can show off the cunning of the protagonist and the extent they planned and prepared or the quality of their improvisation in a single scene where the enemy was outsmarted and simply had no hope of victory. Of course, you can do drawn out fights this way too, but the key is that it's not /required/. The focus on intelligence also helps explain the attention to detail and consistent rules, since your protagonist is supposed to live and die based on whether they can plan things out and grasp for advantages, and an inscrutable 'as the plot demands' ruleset is incompatible with that, whereas you don't /need/ the rules to behave the same way to force your protagonist to the brink of defeat before their show of determination and second wind.

***** Right, but I think that again conflates the two meanings of good? Apologies if the below doesn't make sense; I haven't tried to express this before and am not willing to spend a long time getting it intelligible. (do let me know if this at least aims in the right direction, or if it's completely useless)

You can write a 'good', well-written, consistently characterised, internally-making-sense story, and it still not actually being liked by anyone, and not /good/.

You can also (though it seems very hard, and I don't know whether it was ever achieved) write a story with completely non-conventional/'bad' writing, that makes no sense, but still is so emotionally evocative that it is well liked and /good/.

Most people don't really care about the 'good'/'bad' distinction; it's somewhat correlated with the story being /good///bad/, because in the extremes 'bad' is incomprehensible to everyone. But if you naturally take stories apart, try to figure out how they work, guess at the rules governing the imagined word... If that is essential for you to enjoy a story, then /good/ can de facto become a subset of 'good'.

The way these concepts map for me, 'good' is rational. No one's interested in /bad/ 'good' stories (uninteresting, boring rational stories), so it doesn't get talked about. /good/ 'bad' (compelling but non-rational) stories are rare for me, because of how I enjoy fiction, but common in popular culture.

** A lot of the confusion regarding what rational fiction /is/ seems to come from the fact that literally nobody from SV in that entire thread managed to understand that the bullet point definition that's being given is an extensional definition, not an intensional one. It points in rational fiction's general definition, it's not a fully complete necessary and sufficient set of constraints by which rational fiction is defined. It's like pointing to a bunch of red things to define what red is, rather than defining a specific wavelength range of light. In addition, the bullet points in the sidebar don't really mean "it's definitely rational fiction if it has these qualities." Instead, they're more along the lines of things that something has to have or it definitely /isn't/ rational fiction. Actually narrowing things down from the stories the bullet points bring forward to just the stories that a reader of [[/r/rational]] would call rational fiction would take a bunch more bullet points.

On an unrelated point, they seem to viscerally hate us, and I /recognize/ that flavor of hate. It's the type of thing I see whenever someone else in the room fails to hide how nerdy they are. I mean, look at the language they're using. Robotic. Not human. That's pretty familiar to me.

I really didn't expect SV to get in on the whole "let's hate the nerds" thing, considering, y'know, they're nerds. But apparently to urge to hate nerds is so strong it can infect nerdy communities and make them hate /more/ nerdy communities.

*** The essential idea of EA / LW / CFAR is "figure out the best available methods to achieve your goals". Those methods tend to be strongly divergent from mainstream thought -- for example, some average Joe hears, without context, that the EA crowd said "giving to Toys For Tots is not an effective way to save and improve lives". Joe immediately says "you monsters! You're against kids getting toys?! That's mean!" Then the EA crowd says "giving $3,000 to TfT makes 100 kids happy for a day. Giving it to the AMF saves someone's life." Joe is now in the awkward position of either admitting he was wrong or doubling down on how horrible the EA person is.

There's plenty more in there, and by other people. Yes, we've engaged and almost without exception we've been polite and constructive. (I freely admit that my last post in the thread was /not/ polite.)

I read through the first 6 or 8 pages and tried to engage productively three separate times, all to no avail. In all that time I did not see a single anti-RF person make what I would consider an honest argument. No one offered benefit of the doubt, no one really engaged with our points, there were numerous ad hominem attacks...shoot, their definition of rational fiction was tautological to start with and they refused to update when more constructive definitions were offered.

No. This is not "boyishly mischievous", this is rudeness and contempt. Here are some quotes to demonstrate what I'm talking about:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7515607/][Jemnite, post #1]] Okay, first before I start, I should probably define what 'rational fiction' is. It's that sort of odd fanfic trend where you see people go, "You know what this setting could do? SCIENCE. MOTHERFUCKING SCIENCE ALL OVER THE PLACE," except oftentimes it just means they cram if full of psuedoscience and strange philosophical arguments which have nothing to do with the scientific method at all?

[...]

"Rational fiction [...] hollows out the story and creates glaring faults and defects within it. It's popcorn fiction in the truest sense, it strokes the reader and author's ego for being so 'rational' and 'smart', so that they're too busy with gratification to see the major problems."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7515977/][Jemnite, post #11]] "And if you can say a story that says that is still 'rational fiction', I think you are blinded by your own self-conceits and cannot see past them in order to acknowledge that something you like might be bad."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7516046/][Random832, post #13]] "Another thing that rational fics suffer from is that the protagonist [...] is always a Mary Sue."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7516533/][Reveen, post #18]] "And frankly if you ask me, the better in terms of writing quality the work of fiction is, the less it will distinctly seem like rational fiction."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7516775/][firefossil, post #24]] "Rational fiction is inherently disrespectful of the original work." [...] "In short, rational fics are generally bad at fiction and bad at rationality."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7516967/][firefossil, post #32]] (In response to Kiba saying: " So I don't know why would anybody, rationalist or not, think like Vulcans.")

"Start with all rationalist fiction and all people who write it."

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7518032/][Guessmyname, post #52]] "Being told I was in the same lofty halls as the aforementioned MoR author wasn't exactly the most en-heartening thing in the world, either. It just comes across as one of those bizarre internet personality cults that lives five miles up its own arse, desperately attaching itself to other things like a fungus to feel bigger and more important than it actually is."

This is just from the first couple of page, and there was a lot more that I could have included. This is not boyish mischief, this is something that we would be entirely within our rights to call a [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/help/rules/][Rule 3]] violation on.

**** Bit of a late reply here because I've been busy, apologies.

People in my community can be robust in debate, and like all communities there are a few who can occasionally tend to make it a bit too personal, but fundamentally I think our users turn out to be pretty friendly if you get them on a human level. There's also a phenomenon in these quotes of imagining what rationalists must be like without thinking they've ever spoken to one- I think this diminishes a tad later on. Don't feel critique of what are words at the end of the day is necessarily personal, and remember that our community has quite a diversity of opinion as well.

Well, so much rational fiction is fanfic, there aren't very many original characters.

People seemed very fond of Pip from Significant Digits. And Garret from R!Animorphs. ETA: and a lot of people really, really liked Quirrelmort - who's basically an OC - to the point many outright refused to believe he could be a villain.

** So I somehow stuck it out until page 14 before finally giving up, but here's a thing that puzzles me. Quite a few people in there were saying that they find rationalfic /disrespectful/ to the original work.

I have this ongoing thing where I try to explicitly notice and dissect perspectives that completely surprise the hell out of me -- as in, "Wow, that idea wouldn't have occurred to me at all, and I still can't quite make sense of how anyone would come up with it". (Came up with this practice because I occasionally get social advice from socially adept family and friends, generally in response to some perceived /faux pas/ on my part, and about 80% of the time I wind up with this flabbergasted feeling of "Why would someone even /think/ of that?!")

This is one of those WTF ideas. I've seen it before from a bunch of friends who enjoy writing fanfic as well. How does this work? Is this some generalized dislike of all AU fics? Because as far as I can tell, if you think AU fics are okay, then this 'respect' business is just nonsense.

So a fic that takes a world, and says 'this thing doesn't make sense, i'll make it better'... That's pretty disrespectful, yeah. (Though I don't really much care about fanfics being 'respectful' to the source; parodies are fun, fix fics are fun).

** I don't know why I click these kinds of links any more; I really don't. I visited the linked thread and saw... pretty much exactly what I expected to see: vitriol, name-calling, strawmanning, one-sided discussion--in other words, stuff that's completely par for the course when dealing with anti-"X"ers. I mean, like, seriously: once you've seen one of these threads, you've seen them all.

There've been a lot of comments in this reddit post expressing confusion as to why the posters on SB/SV like doing this sort of thing so much, why their "criticism" is pretty much universally awful, etc. To me, the answer is quite simple: they don't like us. Some might call it tribal rivalry (though I think "rivalry" gives it a bit too much credit, as it implies that the dislike is mutual, which I don't find to be the case). EY calls it "sneer culture". You might call it something else--but we all know what it is I'm talking about: there's a group of people you don't like, so you insult them as much as you can, with each insult feeling deliciously cathartic, like getting to punch your sworn enemy, etc. etc. etc. ... and I really don't think there's anything more to it than that. You might protest at that, telling me to give other people the benefit of the doubt--and normally, I'd be all for that. But this, it seems to me, is a case that is ridiculously clear-cut: there are no doubts worth giving the benefit of.

So posting this sort of thing to [[/r/rational]], in my opinion, accomplishes little. It creates some needless drama, provides little actionable advice, and is thoroughly unpleasant to read through--to say nothing of actually /engaging/ with such "criticism". (Mad props to [[/u/DaystarEld]], [[/u/eaglejarl]], [[/u/blazinghand]] and [[/u/hackerkiba]] by the way; you are more patient people than I.) There might be thoughtful and useful criticism of the rational-sphere out there, but to find it, we need to look elsewhere--because this ain't it.

Aaand... I don't know what else to say. Mostly I'm just tired of having to go through this same damn song and dance every few months, or however long it actually takes before another SB/SV'er gets it into their head that creating another "I hate +Eliezer Yudkowsky+ rational fiction" would be a /hilarious and original idea/.

Seriously. Can we stop doing this? Thanks.

*** I think you're right about this being sneer culture, and that we all knew we weren't going to change the sneerers' minds. I (and at least some of the others) engaged so that uncommitted people reading the thread would see a rational counterpoint. (Pun intended.). So, yeah, it's aggravating, but there is some value.

** Having just spent a few hours reading through the entire thread, I actually got something out of it.

After much concideration and analyzing what I like about "rational fiction," or rather what I most enjoy when I find it in a story and the rational fiction community tends to have a solid cross section of, is Hardened Fiction.

Thus, I shall be using Hardened Fiction to define my tastes in the future.

*** That is a much better term. "Rationality", "rationalist", and "rational fiction" are all valid terms and I see why they were adopted, but they are terrible from a marketing standpoint. They are inherently divisive -- "if you don't agree that this is awesome then you are irrational!" Not the best rallying cry.

"Hardened fiction". Great choice.

**** Right? Hell, "Rationalism" isn't even why I read the stories. Just that they try to be more grounded and play everything straight. So Hardened Fiction is a closer term to what I enjoy anyways.

And yeah, that's a good point. "Yeah, I like rational fiction." "Oh, I see, so I just like irrational fiction?"

Instead it's like "I prefer hardened fantasy." "Oh, I like the more traditional fantasy myself."

** I can't help but think that these critics are, like, being so incredibly and unnecessarily mean, for whatever reason. It's like a palpable sense of disgust radiating from their every post, especially the thread OP's. Which is somewhat ironic, given that trying to stay as unbiased as you can is a major tenet of rationalist fiction, and these critics are so inherently biased against rational and rationalist fiction that they actually ended up rationalizing their reasons for hating it.

Amazing.

I wonder if any of the critics in that thread are following it, but don't consider it a rational fic such since it's never been advertised by the author as such?

******* Ah. Makes sense. Thanks!

For the record: I got a 25-point infraction for a snotty departure post. I didn't try to convince the mod to reverse the infraction, but I did ask why there were no infractions for the OP and 15 pages of the anti-rational-fiction crowd being anywhere between condescending and flat-out insulting...especially since some of the people doing that were themselves mods. (I'm looking at you, foamy.) The answer was that mods are just people and are free to be as rude as they want as long as they don't mod a thread they're in. There was no clear answer on why the OP and/or the anti-RF crowd weren't being infracted.

It doesn't succeed on the category of 'things [[/r/rational][r/rational]] likes,' probably due to not being allowed to be posted here outside this discussion, but it fulfills the other categories, like that the characters not holding the idiot ball, and all being driven by their goals and values, rather than being caricatures. Even though their goals are 'become part of a god/a god,' 'create an army of saiyan warrior clones,' and 'find true love.'

also any longer description someone else wrote or ideas about why it's rational would totally be useful.

******* So, I read 1.5 chapters. Findings:

1. Fic is fun. I will probs reads the rest.

2. lots of weird plotholes about how the flying monkey who talks to people who see him crashland his aircraft, blows up bars, punches people through windows, drinks soy sauce, flies visibly and lands in public places, etc, is never considered to be an alien or z-fighter or whatever. He does insane terrifying things and people just completely fail to react.

The specific events where people fail to react are basically:

1. When he lands on the car park, the people see he is an alien. He flies off supernaturally (seemingly). There is no response to this.

2. He flies in public, right up to the restaurant, and walks in with his tail visible, then drinks a bottle of soy sauce. The response of the owner is "ah, he must be american" (hilarious, yes, but also the dude's an alien)

3. he blows up a couple of bars with his powers. It doesn't sound like he systematically eliminated nearby witnesses. In bar #3, he punches a dude through a window and out into the street, then gets another drink. no reaction from bar people, not even mentioned.

The next day, there seems to be no major changes to anything, nor any reactions from anyone, not even in real time, etc. This is still a great fic but requires significant suspension of disbelief during the first 2 chapters that the world is populated by actual thinking humans.
