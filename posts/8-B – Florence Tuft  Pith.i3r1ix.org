** u/Don_Alverzo:

  And if she was found with another woman, there would be demotions, lost connections, angry bosses. Her career wouldn't tank, but it would take some serious steps back. That sort of thing was allowed in Ilaqua and Neke, but she wasn't about to move there any time soon.
#+end_quote

I'm genuinely surprised that this sort of attitude exists in a society where a person's physical sex is as changeable as the clothes they wear. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised at this point when I learn new ways that the Principality is a regressive shithole, but I wasn't expecting it to be a regressive shithole in regards to sex and gender in addition to everything else.

*** Keep in mind that until fairly recently, the only way to change bodies was to steal someone else's.

So the views around gender probably haven't quite moved on to thinking of it as an interchangeable thing.

** Also, I made a kind-of-poster of Weston's quote (the background is a stock urban fantasy image):

Thoughts? I'm thinking of printing it and hanging it near my desk.

** So, anybody have any guesses as to what crucial revelations are encrypted? Whether the escape was on the up and up?

*** One striking thing was /Florence/ giving the Tunnelvision name-drop in her POV:

#+begin_quote
  Yes, she thought. Pain could give you tunnel vision.
#+end_quote

So, any takers on "they merged" or "the memories were shared with Grace" or "They swapped places but 'Florence' desn't know this because of the memory encryption"? Anyone?

**** Florence's body has been modified so that a pith cannot leave it. This makes any scenario where both piths share the same body seem impossible.

Both are dosed with Null Venom, which prevents external - but not internal - projection. Grace's vocation is unknown. It is probably crucial to their escape.

Given everything we've seen from Tunnel Vision, I'm guessing her vocation is an advanced form of body and expression reading that is a functional near-equivalent to telepathy.

**** Maybe she just mentioned the analogy to Grace and it stuck in her mind.

** Great chapter (what do you call individual serial entries?), one thing that sounded a bit weird to me is that null venom only prevents external projection but for some reason Tuft couldn't use her joining vocations which I had assumed are internal projection. I remember a bit about it being hard to use joining in a body you're unfamiliar with, but Tuft was in the camp for a while, then again we haven't really gotten an explanation for what joining is yet so I'm sure there's an answer.

*** They wiped "all critical memories" right before capture, which I assume means they also wiped away how to rebuild their joining vocations (which are built into their bodies if I recall correctly).

**** I don't know if it makes sense for them to wipe those memories considering Tuft mentions her joining abilities are fairly basic and I think the Shenti are known for being some of the best joiners in the world so they probably already have her joining vocations. Maybe it just takes a really long time to set up a joining vocation in a body or their skills with precision memory wipes are rudimentary enough (this too was mentioned) that they accidentally removed more than strictly necessary.
