Please tell me if the whitespace for this chapter renders oddly on your device. This is the first time FIMFiction's editor has seriously frustrated me. Anyway, thanks for reading!

** In MLP (canon and fanon) proper nouns from Earth are usually "ponyfied" (you know, Canterlot, Manehattan, Haycart, Neighpon, Horschach, etc.).

You don't seem to do this. I noticed Maxwell and Markov in this ToC, and Moebius in the previous chapter. Is is intentional or maybe an oversight?
