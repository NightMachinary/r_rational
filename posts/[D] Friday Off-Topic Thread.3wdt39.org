Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

*** The thing about elections is that you're voting for multiple things at once, so your valuation of what voting is worth needs to take into account all the things on the ballot. If you were just voting in the national election, it probably doesn't matter [[http://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2012/11/05/what-are-the-odds-that-your-vote-will-count/][depending on where you live]]. But if the local elections matter, then you're going to the polls anyway, so the additional costs involved with voting at the national and state level are marginal.

The other thing about voting is that as fewer people vote, each individual vote becomes more and more worth it. We're not anywhere near this point yet, but it's something to keep in mind. If turnout is only 50%, then your vote is worth twice as much as if everyone voted.

(I vote, because my state allows for voting by mail, which lowers the costs dramatically.)

**** I'd argue that voting by mail is less efficient than either voting in person or not voting at all. If you vote in person, you might be part of a peer-pressure effect, incentivizing people who vote to keep voting, and if you don't vote none of your time gets wasted for an ultimately futile vote. If you vote by mail, your vote will be futile and you can't try to subconsciously manipulate greater voter turnout year over year.

*** Three issues, ranked from most important to least in my view:

1. Balance of opinion. The nearer each side's support is to each other side's, the more influence individual voters have: Powerful when races are close, less so when they're one-sided.

2. Volume, which you mentioned. The fewer people voting, the more power individual voters have: Powerful locally rather than nationally.

3. Quantitative effect. The more you personally will feel a difference between each option's governance, the more important your vote will be to /you/.

I'm guessing you're American, so let's take the worst case scenario: a presidential election.

Balance: Are you in a large swing state? If not your vote for anything other than a strong third party candidate is completely meaningless. A strong popular vote display for a third party candidate can provide them with election funds next time around. If you /are/ in a large swing state...

Volume: How close is a close popular vote? In 2000, the final recount in Florida came within a few hundred votes. Ohio in 2004, also famously close, was more than 100,000 votes apart. In the latter case you can still probably stay home. If you're in the Florida equivalent, however....

Effect: How much difference will one president make in your life vs another. Nobody can measure this but you.

This is extreme, but the same basic rules apply all the way down to local zoning measures and school board elections. Also, rather than just considering the time spent voting, consider the value of the time spent /researching/ your options. If the vote doesn't look like it's going to be close, or the numbers are huge, you probably shouldn't waste time on cost/benefit analysis of the available choices.

For California the chance your vote will be decisive is 1/100 million, in New Hampshire 1/70000. The mean is about 1 in 10 million.

Let's assume it takes half an hour to vote, and your vote lasts 4 years. Let's assume the average income is 20 dollars per hour, 40 k per year. The cost of a vote is 10 dollars. At the lowest value, for it to be worth it you'd need a financial benefit of 11*70000 =770,000 dollars or a potential penalty of that for it to have a clear financial benefit.

Some minor policy changes aren't going to be enough for that- you simply don't have enough to lose in four years to make that sort of gamble worthwhile. For that to be worthwhile you'd need some negative threat, like jail. If a politician promised to not imprison me for 20 years that could be 40*20=800 k worth of benefits, enough for me to vote independently.

Of course, if I actually value a policy a great deal, and really feel a substantial need to get it enacted then I'd join groups and spend money campaigning and talk to politicians. If some policy is so valuable to me that it's worth more than millions of dollars in financial changes to me then a vote isn't going to enough for me on it's own, even in a fairly small election.

Unless, of course, they promise really large benefits.

*** I vote because it is my civic duty to do so, and also because as a citizen of the United States, I find it categorically imperative to vote. Not voting in order to save time while not negatively impacting government functionality is a self-defeating decision. Why? Because if universalized, this decision actually cannot be made in this form. It would negatively impact government functionality if this were a universal strategy. The only choice is to vote.

Also, when I vote, I get to loudly brag to my friends (who also brag about this) and mention that I have voted. We all talk about how cool we are for being Americans who vote. This is good and fun and cool.

Also, as mentioned by others: vote by mail.

***** That is pretty much my rationale towards littering. I'm not going to throw my fridge into a lake, or throw my lunch carton out of my car window everyday, but every so often, I'll do something like toss my gum wrapper, or a balled up piece of paper, etc. and sometimes, my sister (who's young and idealistic) will get on me for it. I'll explain that I'm one of billions and that little paper I threw is ultimately meaningless. She'll counter that if everyone thought that way, then the problem would be terrible. I agreed with her, but then proceeded to remind her that my choice of littering or not has NO effect on these people, other than the marginal effect it MAY have on someone who witnesses me not litter and is "inspired". She can't counter, gets frustrated and stays mad at me for littering anyway.

Is that justification TO litter? Not exactly. But it also isn't justification NOT to litter. At the end of the day, a lot of what we (as an individual) do IS meaningless and insignificant, because there are so many of us. You can't have any significant impact on the world around you, unless you try to narrow your scope of effect to a small enough area, or you try to take a position that would lead you to being capable of making more important decisions (such as a political one, or becoming insanely wealthy) but even then, your decisions are restricted by a number of things.

EDIT: Plus, I find it laughable that we get on humans for consumer based littering, when so much more of the waste we produce is due to large corporations or governments.

** I'm working on a magic system which works something like this:

- There's this stuff called hava that's fairly rare (let's say something like ten dollars a gram).
- When you infuse an object with hava, there are two effects:

  - An extradimensional battery is created which has a number of joules equal to direct mass conversion. In other words, a kilogram of hava gives you 9 * 10^{16} joules.
  - This energy is then output at a maximum rate of the total joules divided by 1.5 * 10^{13} as joules per second. In other words, a kilogram of hava gives you 9 * 10^{16} "stored" joules which are usable at a maximum rate of 6000 joules per second (6000 watts).

- The effects that you can use this power for:

  - Imbue an object with raw energy output in the form of heat (at maximum watts).
  - Imbue an object with a constant directional force (at maximum watts).
  - Effectively change gravitational and/or inertial mass (within the limits of maximum watts).
  - Effectively change one half of classical inertia (within the limits of maximum watts). For example, you can alter "an object in motion stays in motion" but keep "an object at rest stays at rest" the same (with the power being supplied by available watts).
  - Effectively increase durability by using available watts to prevent bonds from breaking.

This is all done with something like glyphs or runes or something, or maybe a more exotic method. Once set, the patterns can't be changed and more energy can't be added to the "battery". A pattern can't ever be shut off except through total destruction.

So the problem that I have isn't really with the /magic/ so much as the /engineering/ of what a society would do with it. Obviously it gets used for the generation of electricity and replaces a few appliances. Either heat generation, constant directional force, or partial inertia seems to be the best way to get useful work done, though I'm not really sure which (both have their engineering challenges). Because you can't turn it off, you need ways of getting around that, but that's not too much of a challenge depending on which direction you go.

So my question is, let's say you have this material and knowledge of the processes. What are the things you build with it?

*** If I'm understanding this rightly, the kilogram of hava costs $10,000 and outputs up to 6,000 watts for 15*10^{12} seconds, or in other words about 500,000 years. The rate of dissipation is directly proportional to the mass of hava used so all hava usages should last for about 500k years. Which means that humanity will probably have no idea about the theoretical lifetime of hava, because things get lost and break and so forth before they are ended.

The big limit then is the output rate, not the duration. You spend more for more effect but it lasts forever.

Thoughts:

If you get 100% efficiency transforming to electrical energy, you can get 52560 kilowatt hours per year in perpetuity for only $10,000. It costs about $0.13 per kilowatt hour in my principality at the houseowner's rate, or $7000. So the hava represents a huge savings over what we're using now - $10k for perpetual amounts of power that would sell for $7k yearly in our economy but presumably power would be cheaper because the predominant source of energy is this stuff.

Revolutionizing space travel is obvious, if you can control it sufficiently. A set of hava-enchanted 'thrusters' can propel something in any direction by reorienting in space the objects - you need multiple so that you can idle by rotating all hava-lumps to counteract each other - wasteful, but when they'll last by default longer than the lifetime of your civilization, who cares? Hava tells the rocket equation to fuck right off. Even more so when you reduce inertial mass.

I wonder about the bit about protecting molecular bonds. Things get dull mostly because edges wear out. If you could sharpen something to an extremely thin / monomolecular edge then enchant with Hava, would up to a large amount of energy prevent individual molecular bonds from breaking/changing give you a perfect edge for the next 500k years?

Can reducing inertial mass allow you to accelerate something in a vacuum up to the speed of light? If you reduce the mass of something to effectively zero and accelerate it with this in a vacuum, what happens? Other than physics breaking down.

That's more or less the intended outcome, as it allows for cool things like impenetrable armor and wickedly sharp swords. On the scale of societies, it allows for more durable machines that go for longer before breaking down. The primary problem is that the output is still limited, which means that sufficient force can still cause destruction. There's some math to be done there (and some SI conversions), but I think it mostly ends up as something you use if you're rich and/or have some really great application.

This doesn't actually change inertial mass, it only uses available watts to fake that effect. So eventually (and fairly quickly, I'd think) you run into problems where you're getting an additional kW of power to pretend your inertial mass is less than it is, but that's not enough to complete the effect, especially at relativistic velocities. (Hopefully that makes sense. Imagine a tiny, hidden accelerometer if you need to.)

Edit: It's been a terribly long time since I've taken physics, and I never went that far, so maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong. A watt is equal to one Newton meter per second. In other words, power equals force times velocity. That means power divided by velocity equals force, which means that as velocity increases, the force you get from that power decreases. But it's my understanding that even with constant thrust, which we don't have, velocity in a vacuum only asymptotically approaches the speed of light under relativistic physics. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong; I spent a little too much of today brushing up on my elementary physics.

As for the hypothetical ... a metric ton is 1000 kg, which exerts a force of 9807N. To get the speed we'd take 1000W/9807N, which results in 102mm/s. So that works, I guess? (I'm not great with physics.)

A 12"x12"x1" piece of steel is roughly 20 kg. A 1W enchantment would lift it at a rate of ~5mm/s. Putting a 100 000 ton bridge on top of that plate wouldn't cause it to fall, it would simply slow it down to ~1nm/s. (1W/980 700 000N = ~1 x 10^{-9} m/s)

*** The first question you always ask about magic systems is can this be used to make a superintelligent computer. I think with this one it would be difficult, as you would essentially have to build a macro - scale set of logic gates, which I am assuming couldn't be done at a practical size due to needing a minimum rune size on enchanted objects.

The second question is how hava is made. Is it a limited resource, or can it be produced by some process? Does creating hava produce net energy, is it energy neutral, or is there energy loss? Would it be possible to make a magic machine which automatically produces more hava than it costs to operate?

Third question is how this affects transportation industries. You could build cars, but you would need some kind of constantly running hava engine in them, and that would be a waste. I propose a mass transit system set up as a series of concentric rings. The inner rings spin faster than the outer rings, and cars on the rings can switch between adjacent rings. You get into a car on the outermost ring, moving at a slow walking pace, then drive it on inner rings to get where you are going quickly. If enough people are using such a system, you should be able to save hava overall by comparison to a personal vehicle system.

I imagine that a society running on this would quickly either allow a regulated monopoly to produce hava power objects or would enforce a strict standard between all companies using it. Making hava engines standard between all applications makes mass production more practical, and allows engineers to simply put in however many slots for standard engines as their creations need, rather than requiring non-modular hava engine design for every single magic object.

Edit: Here's what I imagine the hava engine business would work like: You order however many nearly complete hava engines you need. The engines need only the last step before activation in order to turn on. You complete that step yourself and install the engine in your clockwork device.

The above is just one leg of a three and a half legged system, so there are other parts that aren't seen. Those other parts I'm pretty firm on though, it's the engineering that I just needed someone to poke so I could make sure there's nothing that breaks immediately (like infinite power or cheap planet-busters).

*** I tailor my strats for doing things to the thing I'm doing. Most what I do to "build up willpower" is actually tricking myself into being more productive, or making rules I think I can follow.

For example:

- In order to go to the gym more, I only play video games on days during which I went to the gym. If I have time for video games, I have time for the gym.

- My strategy for building up enough willpower to go to bed is to get ready for bed, wash up, change, turn off my computer, then get inside my bed. After I do this, I read if I want to, but since I'm already in bed I'm much more likely to sleep than if I'm in the living room playing video games.

- When I'm doing some kind of easier peripheral activity related to a major willpower expenditure (keeping a food diary for my diet, for example), I make sure to have fun doing that, or to convince myself it's awesome. This way, it always gets done.

- In general, try to remove obstacles to hard things and set up obstacles to things you don't want to do. If you want to go to the gym more, again, just always have a change of gym clothes in the trunk of your car, or in a gym bag ready to go. If going to the gym requires rummaging around for gym clothes, that trivial difficulty might be enough to stop you. If you're trying to avoid committing suicide, remove your gun from your immediate possession.

- Basically: Make it very easy to do what you want and hard to do what you don't want.

all of these probably fall into the category of "working with the willpower you have" rather than "building up willpower" but imo these are great

If you define squares by <a>, where a is the side length and 0 < a < infinity, and rectangles by <a,b>, where a is the shorter side and b is the longer side, and 0 < a <= b < infinity, there ought to be more rectangles than squares, since there are more combinations of a and b than just a.

Growth rates ought to be the same, since the growth rate for squares would be n, while for rectangles it would be n^{2} /2.

The only difficulty would be that you've defined it as an /infinite/ set, which means it's probably possible to map all rectangles onto multiple unique squares too, Hilbert Hotel style.

*** One way to go about this is to assign a measure to the number of squares and rectangles contained in a shape, then see how the measures develop as you follow a sequence of shapes that approaches the infinite plane.

For example, in a 2cm x 2cm square, there would be 2cm x 2cm of squares of size 0, 1cm x 1cm of squares with side length one, and thus (imagine a pyramid with a 2cm x 2cm base and a height of 2 cm) 8/3 cm^{3.} In the same 2cm x 2cm square, there would be 1cm x 2cm of rectangles of size 1cm x 0, 1cm x 1cm of size 1cm x 1cm, etc., for a total of, umm, I think 4 cm^{4,} which must be at least correct in the dimensionality: There is a whole extra degree of freedom!

In a sequence of simple shapes, say squares of diverging size, the rectangles would always outnumber the squares, but an interesting question might be whether there is some sequence of shapes approaching the infinite plane where the number of squares and rectangles remains equal, by being fractally perforated in all the right places. (The squares of course cannot outnumber the rectangles, as any square is a rectangle.)

*** I have just read the rules, my comments are purely theoretical.

The rules text could be more structured, such that information is presented in order of dependency and significance. For example, the attack tables and the list of mysteries could be at the end. Also headers would help. The tables are not sufficient to look up the attacks, one has to refer to the text.

I have also not figured out the board. The rules make it seem like an undirected graph with a limit on the degree. Even if you reduce it to a hexagonal grid, the amount of bookkeeping is immense -- for each space one needs to remember whether it is over- or underwater and the turn it was created in case of the former. Using hexagonal pieces of cardbord would solve the former, the latter requires an immense amount of dice. Or, you take a big sheet of paper and write the board down, which reduces readability and is cumbersome.

The underwater mechanic is interesting, but maybe it would better work with /elevation/ instead of the turn number. Instead of assigning the turn number as the 'height' of a space, which does imply the necessity of synchronizing the amount of water levels generated and the amount of space generated linearly to the turn number (meaning that the players have to constantly raise the water level for the mechanic to matter), just give each space an elevation. Each space with an elevation of zero is underwater and each underwater space has an elevation of zero, space with an elevation grater zero are overwater. The earth mystery can raise or lower the elevation of a square by one, the sea mystery lowers all elevations by one.

There are five types of pieces (effectively three, infantry is mentioned but not described), each with four types of elements. Makes sixteen types of pieces. Representing those is problematic. Most of the pieces have only a local sphere of influence (which is good, as it reduces the explosion of possibilities), although the knight can teleport. The interactions between the pieces are complex (most of the rules text deals with explaining them), and the number of pieces is probably one per turn, limited only by board size and fighting the opponent. The board is infinite. That means that allowing the players strong aggressive plays is imperative.

The element types of the pieces are mostly a combat stat (except the mystic). Even ignoring that remembering the interactions is difficult as their are no underlying principles mentioned, the fact that the elements are freely chosen by the players and do not change the way the pieces act fundamentally, you have Rock-Paper-Scissors balancing. Sure, the nash equilibrium is not as trivial, but for games you always want a strategic thinking type of problem solving, not a number crunching one.

The main problem I see is complexity. Both the board and the pieces are too complex for people to fit comfortably in their head, having both does not improve the situation. Implementing the game on a PC would make bookkeeping less tedious, but visualising the information and an intuitive understanding of the mechanics is still a problem. If the players cannot comprehend the situation and think through all interactions of /one/ turn, they will just stop thinking strategically or at all. Strategy is only possible when one has a solid grasp of the board state.

I would advise to either make the board a square grid (even better with a specified size), and then think about removing the elements or making them more interesting. The latter still has many pieces (16 pieces, means 136 interactions), this can be alleviated by coming up with general rules to describe many pieces or interactions at once, or using flavor to make them easier to remember.

Or, keep the board and replace the pieces by the simplest version that allows the game to be non-trivial (Earth Mystic, Sea Mystic, plus X and maybe plus Y).

Also, play it if you haven't and write how to into the rules. It is easier to understand rules if one can visualize them.

Instead I've wasted a lot of time making a "Make Your Choice" game based on my world where you get a few hundred points and have to choose magical affinities, faction, place in life etc. Because the world building is so extensive for the books already I've ended up with a MYC that is almost certainly too long. You can make your choices quickly if you go in knowing what kind of theme you want, but if not there are way too many options. It's impossible to purchase more than like 10% of the magical skills, even if you max out handicaps, and if you don't want to destroy half the world and have scizophrenia and have enemy factions taking your family hostage it's closer to 5%.

I don't know where to go from there. Do I shave off half of the cool magical skills? Pretend half the factions aren't there? At the same time I /want/ to show off the variety offered by magic and potential for munchkining in my world, since I'm hoping it will act as clever advertising for drawing in beta readers when I've finished a book I want feedback on.

I love games with broad varieties of potential skills, but the more complex the game, the higher the barrier to entry for new players. For some styles of games, this can be acceptable; a lot of it comes down to how you introduce the abilities to players. Front-loading character creation with a billion choices is generally not a good idea unless you're specifically targeting an optimizer demographic, which is pretty niche - but niche markets can still be viable, depending on what you're going for.

**** A Make Your Choice game, like on [[/r/makeyourchoice]]. It boils down to (free) text only character creation but without a game to put them in, often giving a quick introduction to the world or scenario. It's less proper games and more the players speculating/talking with other people about how their characters would get along and what might happen with the world. It's fairly niche.

In my case I've made the world history short and skippable, but there are still 14 factions and around 150 skills, of which you'll be able to afford around five to fifteen, depending on how many handicaps you take on. The skills in the MYC are converted from the different ways people use magic in the book.

The 'game', which is just text, I'm planning on releasing when I have finished writing the book I'm working on, to hopefully draw some interest from the MYC crowd and get volunteer beta readers. Making the game also helps me see if my magic is reasonably balanced, and it's hopefully complete enough that if anyone discovers a way to munchkin the magic I had not thought of, I'll be able to adjust the books to either not have the magic be munckinable in that way or possibly let characters good and bad have access to it.
