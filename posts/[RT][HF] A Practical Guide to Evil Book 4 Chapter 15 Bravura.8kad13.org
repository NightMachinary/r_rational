** Man that last paragraph, I could /feel/ the despair at her effort getting completely invalidated. Erraticerrata brilliantly toes the "only the author can save them now" line by making us temporarily forget about all the secret plans and powerful people on Cat's side, just for a moment.

Also that conversation with Zeze feels like it's foreshadowing some super important stuff, like the "end" of the great debate of the gods... will creation unravel if/when it happens? Also foreshadowing potential pantheon woe replacing the old gods?

This actually fits really well with what Cat is trying to do. Change how the world works. Without the context of Black/Cat he sounds just like a megalomaniac villain destined for failure. But together it feels like a fight not of Good vs Evil but Freedom vs being Bound.

**** It also shows in small mentions of how the good guys are becoming "blatant in stacking the deck". Instead of small nudges, they've started ramping up their interference.

All the while I imagine the gods below just laughing at them saying "even when you stack the deck, you are losing". I can imagine the level of interference going above an unspoken line, granting great power to the Evil side.

***** I don't think I agree. It's possible that Cat will do something Pyrrhic and fuck over Callow again, but that seems more the type of thing to happen at the climax of the arc. All I see happening right now is a typical end-of-chapter cliffhanger where our protagonist faces seemingly insurmountable odds. It's a normal story trope. It doesn't mean she's not going to use skill and smarts to overcome this challenge.

****** I think the biggest argument against Cat doing a Pyrrhic Victory is that she is /actively/ fighting against that. Her outlook upon battle has changed, and we've seen her ideals shift from a "no matter the costs"/"Justification is for the just" to wanting to stop the bloodshed and destruction of her country.

It might be a little too literal, but I think Cat truly does believe what she said to Juniper before - she's sick and weary of the costs of war. It's because of this that I think that she'll not pull another "Foundling Gambit" and instead rely upon her gathered allies and their plans to pull her through.

Although, the story just wouldn't be the same if Cat just all of a sudden gave up her impulsive nature, or her personal battles. After all, Named fights are the realms of near demi-gods.

As a side note, has anyone else noticed how much Cat has grown from the impulsive girl in the beginning? I just re-read through the entire series, and I am SERIOUSLY impressed about how much growth she's shown as a character. It makes sense when she's been thrown through the ringer for the past years, but for a girl of 18, almost 19, she's had to become so mature. Grey Pilgrim was right about that, she is a casualty of war - be it God's War, or just the war on creation.

******* Yeah, that's why I think it it happened at all it would have to be at a climax of the arc. Cat's not going to casually abandon her new ideals over some skirmish. Resorting to a Foundling Gambit would be a /big deal/ because it would mean the failure of the objectives she laid out earlier in this arc. I think she's going to be tested on this in a serious way at a proper plot-fulcrum moment--then and only then will she be confronted with a really compelling temptation to burn everything down to eke out a win. Hopefully she'll pass that test.

******* It also helps that she now has almost absolute political control and thus, plenty of options to bring to the table. The regals of callow are subtle in their power grabs, unlike the backstabbing wastelanders, and the officers in the Callowan army are all people that cat trusts. The founding gambit has almost always been used when cat didn't have the political backup for a proper planned victory or against people that flip the entire board when they think they will lose. It's easy to forget with procer's entire might at the doorstep, but she actually has /power/ now, and not just named stuff.

******* this is a clever writing trick that is brilliant but skirts very very close to the sort of despair you're feeling right now.

Cat has allies. The end of the chapter pits her against extreme odds and you think "well that seems pretty impossible to beat". But she has the entirety of the woe behind her. Thief, archer, Zeze and Hakram are all currently doing other important things, slowly setting the stage. Not to mention robber and his band.

Black, Malicia, the tyrant and ranger are all wild cards who all have varying motives that /might/ convince them to help her in different places.

Remember that cat also has a huge story advantage and the holy war has mostly been reduced to being an invasion by the terms with the pilgrim. Cat has yet to use the "absolute positioning" trick and goblinfire. There are still many unused cards that she can play. The author deliberately drives your attention away from them, which is a great story trick to build up suspense. Unspoken plan guarantee is in full effect.

******** Also Cat's whole fight is a distraction to give Masego time to take out the healers. If GP can resurrect the healers too that's going to be a bigger problem. There are probably limitations though, like number of times or number of times per hero per day, or only works on heroes who have taken him as a mentor.

********* It's also not a full resurrection. A dagger in the eye is invariably fatal, but it's not like they're instantly cold bones. Pilgrim was there fast enough that it's more high level healing than actual resurrection. And we don't know if the hero will have suffered any permanent damage anyway from the knife to the brain.

******* I think that the biggest thing that you're forgetting - and rightfully so, as that's what Erratic is trying to do - is that it's NOT /just/ Cat. Cat doesn't /have/ to overcome a dozen heroes with demi-god tier backup. She has people for that. In fact, that's pretty much all of the previous chapter have been building up to in the background - Cat now has people she can trust to actually do things/be competent.

So no, I don't think Cat can overcome a dozen heroes + Grey Pilbitch + Saint Cunt just with skills and smarts. But I think Cat, Adjutant Hakram, Juniper, Nauk, Robber, Vivienne, Masego, and the ARMY OF CALLOW can overcome them.
