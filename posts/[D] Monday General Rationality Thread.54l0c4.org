Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** *Music to be resurrected to?*

Assume that you are going to die, and some years later, be brought back to life. You have the opportunity to request, ahead of time, some of the details of the environment you will wake up in. What criteria would you use to select those details; and which particular details would meet those criteria?

For example, you might wish a piece of music to be played that is highly unlikely to be played in your hearing in any other circumstances, and is extremely recognizable, allowing you the opportunity to start psychologically dealing with your new circumstances before you even open your eyes. Or you may just want a favourite playlist going, to help reassure you. Or you may want to try to increase the odds that a particular piece survives until then. Or you may wish to lay the foundation for a practical joke, or a really irresistible one-liner.

Make your choice!

*** Depends on the circumstances.

- "With Your Drill...", the piano version, from Gurren Lagann: the default: soft and welcoming but hinting at soaring triumph and excitement when you recognize the melody.

- "Tutim" by Ethnix if I'm together with family, especially my wife. It's not "our song" in the archetypical way, but it's one we both enjoy. Also, protest songs have always been the best at describing my hopes in life. Besides, I want to make sure something of the Hebrew language survives this century.

- "Im Yesh Sikui" ("If There's a Chance") by Muki. The lyrics are suitable and the tune is nice.

- Anything by Sabaton: if I've got to steel myself and fucking deal with shit immediately.

- "Mirai Start" the anime song: if you want to completely and utterly fuck with me. No points if you can't /at least/ pull off a decent Rubber Hand Illusion to make me think you've changed my anatomy to go with the song. Full points if you /really do/ change my anatomy, /and yours/, to fully elaborate the joke. Though I will demand to go back to normal.

- Similar joke for "Carolus Rex", except you have to dress as the Emperor of Mankind and I'll need no Rubber Hand Illusion for that one.

*** I might choose Bach, "Air on the G String". Mainly because it would be a relaxing piece to come back to life to and I imagine being resurrected would be a little stressful.

Also I think of it as a timeless piece of music, so hopefully future resurrection employees won't laugh at me for picking it.

*** I'm reminded that there's some pretty inspiring resurrection-themed music out of the Christian tradition. The relevant lyrics of something like 'Alive Again' or 'Arise My Love' could definitely get one hyped up for a new life, if additional hype were called for.

*** I have a couple of different songs I have used for the alarm on my iPhone, so when I hear them, I think of waking up. I would pick one of them, to play up the idea to myself that I what I went through was no different than sleep, just on a longer and more extreme scale... Hopefully this would alleviate the sensation that the original "me" died and I am a pieced together simulacrum more designed by the algorithms that "revived" me than what originally organically developed.

*** If I were to go balls to the wall, I'd save up $2,000 at a time, and start investing them in medical companies in stage 2 trials. AFAIK, it's the least likely stage to fail and then when the stock pumps (See: [[https://www.google.com/search?q=crbp]]), sell out. Last January they were at 1 dollar per share. If I had bought 2,000 of them, I'd have a lot more cash than I currently do.

My problem is that I'm in school right now without a steady job, so no munchkining that for me.

**** The financial sector is not particularly amenable to munchkining. They're getting pretty good at estimating a company's future earnings and making sure their estimates correspond with reality. If most medical companies with drugs in phase II trials were undervalued, someone would surely have picked up on that by now. And if not now, certainly in a few years.

I don't know. If you had some experience or little-known information about drug discovery, you'd have a better chance, but if any quantitative analyst can do the research you've done then they probably have.

***** Efficient market hypothesis in a nutshell. While you can outperform the market, you need expert knowledge.

If there's any hot tip that can be summarised in a paragraph, it's probably either incorrect or has already been incorporated, though if it's new enough it may still be profitable.

Best bet to beat the market is to pay experts in relevant fields to guage the expected improvement on new companies. The downside of course is that this would require a significant investment on its own and may still not pay off.
