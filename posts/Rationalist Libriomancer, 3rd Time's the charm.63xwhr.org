So there have been two other main posts about the Libriomancer series in this subreddit.

But I found someone (who was writing crossover fanfiction), who wrote a good writeup of the limitations of the magic style.

So, let me set up the scenario. Tomorrow, by random act of god, you wake up as a novice Libriomancer. All references to the book series or the magic style or the author are gone, except for a few paper manuscripts of the books in your possession, unsigned. What do you do? How do you try to get past the limitations to achieve your goals?

Here's the fanfiction link which describes the limitations and magic style and some plot points of the book series:

Here's the other two threads where similar concepts were discussed, for reference:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/43h6d8/qdbstrationalistlibriomancer_why_doesnt_this/]]

Edit: A few things:

How would you achieve your personal-scale goals?

How would you go about achieving your societal/species level goals that I assume you all, as people who post on [[/r/rational]], have?

What if it turns out lots of popular books are locked, and you are in a world that resembles the one in the series?

What if it turns out that books AREN'T locked, and you can do whatever you want?


** From the other thread, it seems like the major limit is that the porters have locked everything interesting.

So, assume this is the case; you need a best seller to have interesting power. All best sellers are locked on principle.

The big loophole that jumps out at me is that the items are powered by global belief. So, it seems like belief continues to matter, even after you've pulled the thing out of the book.

And, if this is true, you could create some interesting feedback loops.

Like, write a text on, "Items of Power", then use it to get a weeping statue of healing, and a copy of the grail.

At first, no one has read the book. So the items would be all but inert. Your own magic could do the cosmetic effects.

But, use the weeping statue to win a Randy Prize (or time on a talk show, or whatever) and I bet people would get really interested.

Belief improves the quality of the items. And it sells books. Which drives belief.

So, pretty soon, you might find that the items pulled from the book are becoming fully powered.

And since we've already manifested them, it wouldn't matter if the porters lock the book as it starts becoming popular.

** It sounds like it's easy to generate money.

I'd do that. Then I'd see if I could buy bespoke scenes in best sellers / popular fanfiction.

For instance, a sufficient kickstarter or patreon donation would probably let me design a "ring of homeostasis" for some RPG sourcebook.

Then, ask the authors to describe a scene where those items are just sitting on an unattended table in a keep as part of the books explanation on climb / lockpicking checks.

That seems like enough to be immortal and rich.

** What happens if I try to extract 50kg of Metastable metallic hydrogen, but it turns out not to be metastable in this reality? Do I just die from the resulting explosion? Cause if so, I'm not going to touch anything that doesn't run on magic or verified physics with a ten foot pole.

*** I suppose it depends on whether you are a novice Libriomancer or a Master one, to be able to predict if the magic is strong enough to keep it contained, from whichever book you are pulling it from.

** Another question: To what extent can I use Libriomancy to solve Math problems? If it solves everything solvable that right there is probably almost the most broken thing about it.

*** I think the issue is you'd have to get a book with [the solution to Fermat's last theorem] to be popular enough that it has power. Once you do that, you're golden.

** FTL engine for sure, from one of the softer sci-fi series. [[#s][Anathem spoiler]]

The body-transfer creche from Old Man's War.

The "no being magic" rule seems to imply that once you make a permanent transformation, you lose your libriomancy. So my last item would be a bead of Lerasium from Mistborn. If that doesn't work, i.e. libriomancers simply can't give themselves inherent powers at all, then a Firebolt so I can at least fly.

Then go gallivanting around the multiverse having a shitload of fun forever.
