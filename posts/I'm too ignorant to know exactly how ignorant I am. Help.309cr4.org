My education has been scattered. Very deep in some areas, but also very specific where it's deep. I have a general idea of lots of things, but while I can discuss most non-pop culture topics with the general person and probably come off as pretty learned across the board, I'm not interested in comparing my knowledge of history, say, to a class of people that is usually not well-versed in history.

I want to change this but I find it probable that the gaps in my knowledge are such that I can't be sure of recognizing all of them and I'm likely to miss some of what I should read in order to fix those gaps.

Would you be able to help me out? No field is out of the question. If you think that the well-rounded person should be well-versed in the fashion of 13th Century France, then tell me so (and maybe explain why, if you think that most people would look at you funny).

Thank you.


** I think a /modern/ well-rounded person should basically be the equivalent of an 18th century polymath. You should know:

- Math
- Science
- Engineering
- Literature
- Technology
- Art
- History
- Economics
- Politics
- Philosophy
- Biology
- Food
- Geography

... and you should know these things fairly well. You should also know when you /don't/ know something, so that you don't expose yourself as a fraud to a domain expert - meaning, you shouldn't pretend at having expertise where none exists, and if the extent of what you know about Brutalism is that it was an architectural movement, you should know enough to stop there and not making educated guesses in conversation.

If you want my advice on how to accomplish getting to a point where you could consider yourself well-rounded, I would say to go grab some college syllabuses and see how much of what the 101 classes are discussing you actually /know/ (not just things that you've heard of). College textbooks are dirt cheap if you grab old editions that no one is using - generally speaking, most subjects don't undergo huge changes. If you are in college, you can usually grab an old textbook from any professor. They have gobs of them, because they get sent them by the textbook companies.

*** Social theory? Psychology? Anthropology?

All more fundamental than politics, right? Like, politics is an extrapolation of these things and history?

If you want to understand the human world around you, you need social science.

And no specific mention of computer science? I don't think we all need to know how a combine harvester works, but without coding your impact on any given field is reduced.

My list is pretty cut down from yours.

#+begin_quote
  Maths

  Physics

  Chem

  Biology (focus on human biology and medicine)

  Computer science (focus on coding and systems design)

  Social science (focus on psychology and social theory)

  Economics
#+end_quote

The rest on your list are extension or interest topics to my mind.

*** Most of the topics have direct, obvious utility.

Literature helps expose you to divergent viewpoints in ways that you likely wouldn't get from the rest of the topics. It's also useful socially in that you can talk about it and understand references.

Food knowledge is useful socially. It means you can talk about food, and you can go to a wider variety of restaurants while knowing what you might want and, more importantly, not being afraid.

Art knowledge is useful socially. Additionally, a dry analysis of it (as opposed to appreciation of art) works similarly to literature: how people choose to portray events, and which events they choose to portray, tells you about the people.

*** Erm, I'm sorry, but /which/ history, exactly?

Learning all of it would be a chore, of course, but are we limiting ourselves to the kind of Classical education that an 18th century polymath would know? Should we focus on the history of our nation of origin, or branch out? How specific should we get about minutia, or how meta should we get about historiography/historical sources? To what extent should the average person be paying attention to files being declassified, and the implications for the historical record? Of course, that's only relevant for history of the past 500 or so years, earlier than that and we're mostly rehashing interpretations of known documents or integrating archeological knowledge, barring uncommon circumstances.

There's quite a few directions to go regarding history education -- some of them hopefully even relate to the craft itself. But there are decisions to make above just "History", given that people generally don't agree on what constitutes the basics.

**** Predict what regions you'll be interacting with most. Get a decent overview of their history -- the sort of thing that averages ten years per page or thereabouts. Then get a more detailed overview of more recent history, something like the past two to three hundred years.

Also spare some time for Roman and Greek history from the imperial period, if you're dealing with western nations, or Chinese history in antiquity, if you're dealing with eastern nations. This is for much the same reason as you'd study literature -- the actual impact today is nothing you can't glean from recent history, but people make references.

** We live in a capitalist society. A well rounded person needs to know about business and the economic history of the rise of the west, the basics of materials chemistry and telecommunications technology. Additionally, one should know everything about coffee.

JK, I don't know. I always kind of figured that its /better/ if everyone had different spheres of knowledge, that way you become a more well rounded person by talking to people and learning from them directly. Plus, if you all know the same stuff to start, what's the point of talking at all? The fact that you are educated in /something/ is a great start, I wouldn't beat myself up over not knowing what you're "supposed to."

** Read "Guns, Germs, and Steel" for history. Then hop over to [[/r/AskHistorians]] and [[/r/badhistory]] and read their opinions on the work (but seriously read the book first, it's important to the lesson). This process will both brush you up on a lot of history knowledge, and explain some of the major pitfalls of being an autodidact.

For the sciences, I would recommend learning Newtonian physics thoroughly, with calculus-based kinematics, and deriving out contrived scenarios involving springs and pulleys and magnets for yourself. It's the most practical, visible portion of science on a daily human scale and it has some of the most approachable math.

You can't learn too much math.

If you just want to have learned conversations, the most bang for your study buck is art history. The history of music and architecture are the most broadly applicable. It's also really enjoyable to know.

*** Weirdly, the most thorough criticisms of Guns, Germs, and Steel I've ever found are in the reviews section on Amazon. Many of those reviews are garbage, and this is true no matter what the reviewer's opinion on the book was, but there are a lot of people there calling out the people who are posting the garbage comments which helps result in a good understanding of what is and is not valid in the book.

In contrast, on [[/r/badhistory]] I found a couple very general complaints, a couple very specific examples of flaws, and lots of scoffing. The [[/r/badX]] subreddits in general are bad for neophytes to learn from because they're dominated by the social signalling games of more knowledgeable people.

[[/r/askhistorians]] doesn't suffer from the scoffing, but had a similar problem with not targeting the criticism at the right level to make me feel the full extent of that book's failure. The overview criticisms seemed somehow weak, perhaps as though argued in bad faith, and the specific criticisms got bogged down in trivial details and didn't normally provide strong alternative explanations.

I'm not saying those sources shouldn't be looked at, they were helpful to me. But in addition to them, I would recommend glancing through all the reviews on Amazon and paying attention to anything that seems interesting (while being sure to fact check the reviews, and to read the comments replying to them).

** Everyone, not just well-rounded people, should know basic medicine. How to clean and dress a wound. How to treat shock. How to treat a sucking chest wound or flail chest, since those can kill quickly. How to move someone with potential spinal injuries. How to make a splint. How to recognize common maladies and potential big problems -- like ectopic pregnancy, heart attacks (notably, women have appreciably different presentation for heart attacks than men, and the media only portrays male heart attacks), and appendicitis.

You can learn this in ten days for about US$700 with the Wilderness First Responder course.

I wish this were a standard part of high school education.

** This sounds worthy and thoughtful, and I wish you the best of luck. There are many places to turn to learn and to find resources about how to learn. It might be worth checking out [[/r/lesswrong]], which is a subreddit related to the Less Wrong rationalist community. Other places to check out include the comments section of the blog [[http://slatestarcodex.com/][Slate Star Codex]] which is full of people who are trying to become well-versed in all manner of things.

[[/r/rational]], despite the name, is actually a subreddit devoted to rational and rationalist fiction (and fanfiction). You'll certainly find people in [[/r/rational]] interested in what you're doing here-- many will share your interests. Given that what you're talking about is reading, which is pretty close to fiction, you're pretty close to being on-topic. Hopefully in this thread and at the communities I linked you find what you're looking for.

All that being said, I will be downvoting this post to reduce its visibility on this subreddit. I wish to discourage divergence from the core goal of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] , even when I think the thread is good, like this one is.

If after a wikiwalk you feel that you need more structure, consider looking for a MOOC that teaches whatever topic interests you. [[https://www.coursera.org/courses][Coursera]] has a broad selection, for example.

** 1.  Computer building and manufacturing. We spend so much time using electrical devices that having them work well is a huge benefit. You should be able to install and alter components of your computers too, saving you a lot of money. This helps in fixing faulty components too.

2.  Human psychology. You should do some reading up on how humans generally interact with each other. Body language, psychology of obligation, how our memory works. We interact with humans a lot, this helps loads.

3.  Physics of heat and energy and waves. You should have a basic overview of how all these things work. You should know the difference between temperature and heat, what resistance means, what happens if you put too much voltage into something, what amplitude and frequency mean. This helps in managing a lot of things around you and limits the chance you'll be injured.

4.  Biochemistry of cortisol, epinephrine, insulin, glucose and fructose, oxygen, leptin and ghrelin, melatonin, estrogen and testosterone, oxytocin, and dopamine. These control your gender, aging, stress levels, love, motivation system, hunger, and sleep. You should know what makes them, what can increase them, and how to tweak them to your benefit. You spend all of your time trapped inside your body, these are important.

5.  Basic knowledge of car structure, physics of car motion. You're driving around a 1 ton death machine, you should really make sure it doesn't mess up. You should know how to diagnose common faults, how to fix minor issues like the oil or tires, what causes increased fuel usage.

6.  Mathematics of finances, taxes, and budgets. Your money determines how valuable you are as a person to many others and how powerful your influence is over technology. You should know how to get cheaper deals, how to budget money, how to pay off your obligations to others, what times of years you can get cheaper deals, how to negotiate.

7.  Basic first aid skills. You should know how to stop someone bleeding out, how to bandage an injury, how to clear a blocked airway, how to deal with burns and broken bones, how to handle an allergic reaction. If you have any loved ones this minimizes the chance that they will die.

8.  Statistics. You should understand what standard deviation means, experimental design, how to read papers. This helps you diagnose any issues you have. Have a medical issue? Research the best treatment. Not sure what the best food is to eat? Research their health benefits. You should know some common terms like the conflict tactics scale, child behavior checklist, program evaluation, and be able to talk about some of the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches.

9.  How to buy property, how to buy computers, how to buy cars. You should know the basic way to do all of these and common issues that arise. You should know what's important to look for.

10. How to use a condom, how to put one on a penis. How to get an std check up. Stds mess you up, best to avoid them.

11. A basic understanding of politics, political programs, the law, and things that may affect you. Do you know if any party offers subsidies or punishment to a group you're a part of? Do you know how a property dispute tends to be resolved? Do you know what rights the police have? Do you know how to find legal documents if you want to make some sort of appeal?
