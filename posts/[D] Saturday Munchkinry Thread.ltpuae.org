Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Another DnD optimization:

You are in a low powered and low magic late medieval (just as professional non-feudal armies and early gunpowder weapons are developing) D&D setting (a 6th level spell caster with 3rd level spells is as rare as between 1 in a hundred and 1 in a thousand people, and higher level get exponentially rarer). You are a high ranking general who has a Wizard ally who has developed a highly efficient curriculum. By screening for the smartest 90th percentile soldiers with simple standardized testing, and using a curriculum that trades off on long term overall understanding for optimized speed of learning, they can learn 4 level 0 cantrips and 2 level 1 spells in only 3 months.

Under non combat conditions, a trained Wizard-soldier can repeatedly use cantrips indefinitely using a trick to recapture the magical energy, but can only use up to 4 cantrips in combat conditions as they cannot recapture the magic energy. The Wizard-soldier can also cast 3 level 1 spells per day. As with D&D wizards, the Wizard-soldier needs 8 hours sleep to fully restore their magical energy (less sleep means proportionally less magic), but thanks to your Ally Wizard's optimizations, they only need a single water proofed sheet to study for their “spell book” and can prepare their spells each morning in only 30 minutes. Caster level varies between 1 and 2 depending on the soldier.

You have two apprentices of this Wizard to help in training as well, so you can pick 3 different sets of training curriculum to train subset of your smartest soldiers. What 12 cantrips and 6 level 1 spells divided into 3 subsets of soldiers do you have 1 tenth of your army learn?

*** Don't risk your soldiers on the front lines, instead use them to revolutionise your intelligence and communication.

Cantrips:

- Dancing lights: devise a semaphore system and use this for long-distance communication with a relay of casters
- Mending: keep all the equipment in good condition
- Prestidigitation: clean everything to improve hygiene and flavor the rations to improve morale

Scouts:

- Alarm: monitor all the key junctions and bridges for enemy troops, the caster just has to stay within 1 mile to receive the alert
- Mount: horses are expensive and need to be treated carefully. Horses created by magic are entirely disposable and need no feed, removing the logistical burden and allowing your casters to ride them to death

Spies:

- Charm person: politely ask captured enemy officers or uncooperative local civilians for intelligence
- Disguise self: this includes clothing and armour, so impersonate enemy officers or messengers to gather information and sow havoc with conflicting orders

**** The webcomic Order of the Stick has [[https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0512.html][a great example]] of Dancing Lights used as a communication system (although not with a long-distance relay).

Edit: These are excellent suggestions in general. Especially the cantrips: Mending is great for repairing lightweight items (up to 1 pound), and Prestigitation makes good hygiene much easier (clean anything without using up soap or water).

However, I don't think Alarm really works as a way to monitor locations for enemy troops. It activates anytime a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area without speaking the password. In other words, the spell doesn't differentiate between a stray rabbit, a harmless traveler, and an enemy army. If the Alarm is set outdoors on a public bridge, you will get a high proportion of false positives.

**** Thinking along similar lines:

The cantrip Message is good for short range secure communication during scouting (110 ft. range).

Ray of frost might be worth it for being able to chill provisions to preserve them and it can double as a weapon if absolutely needed (1d3 is a decent chunk of damage relative to a commoner).

Floating disk lasts 1-2 hours and can carry 100-200 lbs (depending on how good the soldier is). That isn't enough time or weight for long range logistics, but short range uses might exist...

** *Im toying with an idea for a munchkin/rational Alt History version of WW2, focusing on Poland specifically.*

It starts as it did in original timeline, on September 1, 1939. The immediate difference is however:

Whenever a Polish soldier dies (any member of the Polish armed forces) their strength, speed, dexterity, durability and theoretical knowledge and skills (not personal knowledge or intelligence though) is given to the nearest Polish soldier, atop of their own.

(for example, if there were two Polish soldiers who could benchpress 60 kg, and one dies, the other can now benchpress 120 kg).

Im working through the possible long term and exponential consequences of that "national" superpower. At what point does the number of "Super Poles" is enough to overwhelm the technological advantage of the Nazis, and the number advantage of the Soviets? At what point will they be able to go on an offensive? What would be the most optimal tactical and strategic use for a soldier who is Double (or Triple, or Quandruple) as strong and fast as normal human?

Assuming the Polish government and military cadres are rational and bloodlusted to win, how can they munchkin this power to maximum utility?

Other than this one sci-fi change, full realism applies. In all rounds Poland is bloodlusted, and led by rational-ish munchkin/optimiser politicians and generals.

*R1:* Poland has to defend itself, and repel both Nazis and the Soviets off its boarders successfully.

*R2:* Poland has to go on an offensive: forcing both the Nazis and the Soviets to surrender.

*R3:* Poland has to win WW2 single-handedly, as a mercenary force fighting instead of the Western Allies on all fronts.

R4: Poland has to conquer the entire world through military force or forcing submission.

** In video gaming, there is a common method of "cheating" that does not involve hacking into the game code or exploiting bugs: one simply creates a program to play the game, pressing buttons and tilting control sticks at the exact preprogrammed times. Done well, this allows one to "play" the video game with superhuman "skill", since pressing buttons at the correct timings becomes simply a matter of determining what the correct timings are. Many speed runs of video games are done using exactly this trick.

You have the power to do this with your own body. Your mindscape contains a simple text editor, where you can write in (preprogram) a sequence of steps and timings for moving specific muscles of your body by specific amounts at specific times, and you can execute the sequence whenever you want.

Some limitations apply:

- Only muscles you can move voluntarily can be controlled this way. So you can't use this power to stop your own heart muscles.
- Your muscles can only be moved in ways that you could move them. So you can't use this power to increase your flexibility.
- Your muscle movements are only precise up to the millisecond and millimeter.
- The preprogrammed instructions cannot make your muscles cannot exert more power than you could normally exert with them. So you can't use this power to gain superhuman strength.

In general, your power only gives you superhuman precision in timing and movement.

Other than setting superhumanly-skilled speed runs on video games, what can you use this power for?

*** *This power would be nearly completely useless* (with the limitations).

I know this because I've done this. Or more specifically, I've programmed a 12DOF robotic arm with raw G-code written manually and composed of line by line motor-move commands without the inverse kinematics. /It was an absolute nightmare/ and was used as an object lesson on why programing the robot joint by joint is stupid and why it's much easier to just create an IK solver and then program with cartesians.

For this power to be usable, you need a better UI/software. At minimum, an IK solver and preferably pre-programmed macros for the hand (like "grip" or "pinch") because otherwise controlling the dozens of joints in the hand would be superbly tedious. One step further would be to allow the user to "capture" poses and positions and then interpolate between them.

As for applications, well they're very limited. Since theres no control loop, scripted walking or standing is right out and you're limited to scripting tasks that you do while seated. Even then, you wouldn't be able to use this in an assembly-line setting because there would be too much variance that your script wouldn't be able to adjust to.

The best application is probably music where maybe you could play the drums really well or become a human MIDI machine and play pre-programmed piano music

*** I think this power is more limited than you realize. In video games, the world is absolutely predictable and precise so a preset input sequence works perfectly. IRL, your body needs to constantly make micro adjustments to compensate for dynamic real world conditions: slight variance in friction and air resistance need to be corrected for. A preplanned script would either need to allow for conditional programming or else the first tiny bit of extra friction or tiny bit of extra air resistance might throw the whole script off. With a robust scripting language which can utilize sensory input and conscious mental commands this could work, otherwise it will only be good for brief instances under precisely calibrated external conditions.

*** Like another person said, conditional scripts or very small and particular scripts would help mitigate the adjustments needed to adapt to real world conditions.

This reminds me a lot of the Iron Nerve in the Sufficient Velocity Quest [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked For Death]]. (Set in Naruto, where MC has bloodline ability that can remember and repeat movements perfectly.)

- Ninja Warrior: you can build a copy of the course in your backyard and create scripts for each obstacle, and smaller scripts for each step of each obstacle.
- Reload a gun: as long as you bring the gun to a particular starting point each time, the movement of the gun itself should be really fast.
- Roll dice to get the desired result most of the time: it'd take a bit of adjustment for unknown dice and unknown table surfaces, but with some trial and error you could probably roll exactly the number you want. (This is done in Marked for Death.)
- Card tricks: you could reliably do cool card tricks.
- Basketball: create a script for the common places to shoot a basket and you'd have pretty good accuracy.
- Free-throws: literally never miss.
- Field-goals: adjust your script for the distance from the endzone and you're good. You might also have to adjust for wind.
- Claw games/arcade games: go to an arcade and it's easy prizes.
- Fighting: A single script to win a fight might be hard, but short and simple scripts for common movements would be fine. For example, raising your left leg or right leg to block a low kick can be left to a script just fine. Same for things like kipping up, or jabbing to create distance.

*** Being kind and not too nitpicky while also taking into account what others already suggested: Exercise routine, weapon drawing, maybe some counter chokes?, with some setup putting armor on / off, maybe an aimbot?, precision manufacturing, with a shield maybe an auto block?, maybe grooming?, teeth brushing, showering..

​

It's kind of a lame power irl. Enemies aren't predictable, spawn points aren't predictable, yada yada. It's useful and I'd be grateful if I had it, but it's not going to instantly make you rich or powerful.

*** Using this by yourself? Useless. The time it would take to write and debug the scripts would vastly exceed the time it would take to just practice the movement without a script.

If you can take sensory inputs, as well as present an interface to provide inputs to the script, and other people can use this ability, then you might actually have something worthwhile. That would get you a situation similar to The Matrix, where you could just download a script to learn to fly a helicopter, without personally having flown a helicopter even once before.

*** In addition to what everyone else have said; probably at least 10% or so of humans already have this superpower IRL, possibly more like 40% if you relax the requirements, it's called "dexterity" and the only downside is it takes a few years of practice for each "batch" of scripts. In fact, this variant of the superpower is FAR superior to the one you describe, since it's highly programmable, able to adapt to slight changes of context, can have analog parameters, automatically breaks down and reorganizes sub-sequences, and a bunch of other QoL features.

The only reason you don't see this used in impressive ways every day is that the filter bubble most people on this reddit are in considers it low status and are unwilling to pay the opportunity cost to dedicate those years.

Having that downside removed is a common trope: Uber from worm, the skill downloads in The Matrix, that one girl in heroes, are just the first ones that come to mind.
