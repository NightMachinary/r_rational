** Hey, glad to see this back with a volume 2. Will you be posting chapters to the Sub regularly, and if not, what's the best way to follow updates for this?

*** I generally try to only post here when I hit milestones (finishing a volume, starting a volume, hitting the end of a story arc, getting some sweet new art, etc.), since I feel like I'm cluttering up folks' feeds otherwise. If there's interest in getting notified, I could start posting simple chapter links when they come out, but at least personally I prefer to use sites like Reddit for discovering new things rather than following ones I already enjoy.

There are four potential ways to keep up to date without needing any special action on your part:

- [[https://notamanga.com/feed.xml][NotAManga.com RSS feed]] (if you already follow things with RSS)
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23126/my-life-is-not-a-manga-or-maybe][Royal Road]] (if you already read stuff on Royal Road)
- [[https://www.patreon.com/EOTenkey][Patreon]] (if you're willing to part with $2/month to read chapters ahead of their public publication date, that gets you notifications via email)
- [[https://twitter.com/EOTenkey][Twitter]] (haven't posted updates there in a while, because I was talking to myself; but if people actually find it useful and follow the account I'll pick it back up again)

And two ways that require active habits:

- Check [[https://notamanga.com/]] on Thursdays (I've been very consistent about publishing on Wednesday, but the actual /time/ Wednesday is all over the map)
- I'm trying to post links in [[https://discord.gg/t4tXAN7][Discord]], since there are a few folks hanging out there
