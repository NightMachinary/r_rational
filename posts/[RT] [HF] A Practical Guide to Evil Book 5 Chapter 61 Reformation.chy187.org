#+begin_quote
  “None who cast token in the contest may kill the nine-year-snake for a span [of] nine nights,” Rumena said. “Immortality, Deadhand. For a time.”

  It murmured in Crepuscular, after that, citing the Tenets of Night. /For glory fades and stone crumbles, no victor forever crowned./
#+end_quote

A useful precedent for establishing that the victor of the upcoming contest for the Sigil be elected by peers, has power only for a given term, that they can't be killed by their rivals during that term.

** The chapter starts with Cat seeing the Firstborn competing in a range of non violent ways (slam poetry, not!Go, contests of skill). We then are introduced to a problem that would normally be solved through violent competition. My guess is she's going to have the claimants do the poetry thing and have the Firstborn vote on the winner.

*** The poetry is probably more like either dozens or the more contemporary rap battle that is its descendant.

#+begin_quote
  “/Cunning as cattle, fearsome as a trout/,\\
  /Beloved of nerezim, quiet as a shout!”/
#+end_quote

We're also seeing it within the context of Cat already vetoing deaths within the "Army" it's probable that there would be an amount of deaths by now otherwise.
