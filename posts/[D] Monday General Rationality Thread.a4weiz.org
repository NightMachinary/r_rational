Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** so, a while ago charles stross had a talk about how [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html][companies are paperclip maximizers]]. stross is a scottish author of transhuman spy fiction.

this is a simplification, but a reasonable one. so, you want them to cure cancer and give you immortality. they want money, and there has been noise about how [[https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/goldman-sachs-says-curing-diseases-may-not-be-economically-valid/][there may be more money in not curing people]].

so, as big companies are the only ones who can leverage the resources needed to solve for immortality, and they also have strong incentives not to cure you, why do we expect them to do so? our theory of mind for big corporations is simply wrong. the first type of way to modify corporate behavior is regulation, but this is hard to do with lots of negative externalities hiding in the weeds.

on the other hand, your government is its own maximizer for political power, with an externality of your quality of life. when people vote themselves money, bad things happen- look at [[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/venezuela-annual-inflation-tops-1-million-pct-in-november-congress-idUSKBN1O91WT][venezuela]].

*** Remember that companies are controlled by people. So diseases that can effect them and their relatives and loved ones will more often than not get cured. Diseases that don't won't.

​

A simple example is malaria, it doesn't affect most first world countries, so the cure hasn't been found yet and believe me there's been more than enough time for them to find a cure for it, just not enough incentive.

​

Immortality is also desirable for the people controlling said companies and conglomerates, so it's fair to assume they are properly motivated to get it working as soon as they can.

​

Be jaded if you want, just remember companies aren't actors, they are controlled by people, be they owners, CEOs, or stakeholders. And those people want similar things you want, safety and less suffering for their families and themselves included.

*** Companies also compete with each other. Here it is one situation where Moloch is helpful. The first to invent a slightly better cancer treatment should get much more customers. Then they compete their own market into oblivion, sacrificing overall value (here: money) for a slight comparative edge over the competition.

I think this is misleading and the referenced report would be more accurately summed up as “There may be some diseases for which, in some markets, curing is economically less feasible than an ongoing treatment with similar overall costs.” In particular, it is mentioned that the problems are alleviated for diseases with large markets (i.e. there is a lot of money to be made anyway) or high incidence (meaning that you are not going to run out of people to cure).

Additionally, if I understood correctly, the two main effects that actually correspond to a misalignment of incentives (and are not just a consequence of paying back all the R&D necessary) are

1. Curing a disease can eliminate the market, thus the potential profit is limited.
2. A person can pay larger sums in total if they are spread out over a longer period of time instead of being a one-time things, and cures fall in the latter category instead of the former.

First, I note that 2, while valid, only applies in countries without working health insurance, as insurance amortises the cost (i.e. the insurer makes decisions for lots of people at the same time, thus it can choose the cheapest option in the long run). Also, pharmaceutical companies operate internationally, so 2 is reduced overall as well.

Finally, 1 is a problem, but note how it only applies to diseases where the cost of curing exceeds the lifetime cost of treatment. (Else there would still be profit.) It could still be beneficial for a society to pay this large, up-front cost for the benefit of future generations so there is an argument that here, the incentives are in fact misaligned. On the other hand, I do not think most people care that much about future generations, so maybe the incentives are fine.

In conclusion, I think the incentives are, overall, well-aligned and that you have to look quite a bit deeper than most people do to find the problems. I do not /expect/ any company to develop immortality, but that is more because I think it is too resource-intensive for a single company to fund, and not due to a lack of inclination.

*** Thanks for the Stross talk. I've been looking for opinions like that (other examples: [[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tedchiang/the-real-danger-to-civilization-isnt-ai-its-runaway][1,]] [[https://thoughtinfection.com/2014/04/19/capitalism-is-a-paperclip-maximizer/][2).]]

He could've improved the presentation a bit by:

- giving a disclaimer on the differences between [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU][wetware]] and electronic CPUs.

  - qualitative differences in reaction times (clock rate, CPU power)
  - susceptibility to large groups of people becoming "outraged" and voting with their money. Doesn't always work, but when it does, companies even tend to overreact sometimes (e.g. the reddit's sub bannings).

- stripping off his own political opinions, no matter how reasonable they are. I see that he did try filtering them out, but quite a bit leaked through anyway.
