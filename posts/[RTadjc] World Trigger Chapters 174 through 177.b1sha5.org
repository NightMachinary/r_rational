** I forgot to post last month's batch, for a full 80 pages this time around.

World trigger is a superficially typical manga series with a surprising amount of rational-like tropes and qualities, both in the overall plot and its generally sensible portrayal of a competent 100-person organization around the main cast. This batch ends of the penultimate battle of a tournament arc of sorts. Said battle starts [[http://mangaseeonline.us/read-online/World-Trigger-chapter-167-page-1.html][here]], and those so inclined may read the series from the beginning [[http://mangaseeonline.us/read-online/World-Trigger-chapter-1-page-6.html][here]].

Besides that, the main feature of this batch is a digression into disinformation management in larger organizations, courtesy of the PR department.

An (almost entirely spoiler-free) summary of the overall plot can be found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a0zil1/world_trigger_chapters_166_through_169/eaw17l2/][here]], and a description of why I think it's at least ratjacent can be found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9rn8ra/rt_world_trigger_chapter_165/e8i53oc/][here]].

(High-quality official translations are widely available up to chapter 164, after which a two-year hiatus hit, and the high-quality translations of later chapters are sort of scattered about. At the linked aggregator site, most of the stuff is high-quality save for chapters 165 and 166, which are passable. The chapters linked in this post will eventually go down, they can then be found [[http://mangaseeonline.us/read-online/World-Trigger-chapter-174-page-1.html][here]])
