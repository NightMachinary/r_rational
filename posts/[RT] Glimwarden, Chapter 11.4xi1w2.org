** Ten stories is a /huge/ building for a Renaissance-tech-level civilization. Even in our modern world a ten-story building in an isolated town of 1000 people would be /weird/. I'm sure you know that, and I'm sure there's some reason why it's there, just pointing it out.

*** Yeah thats a mindbogglingly, impossibly big building for a 1000 people village.

I mean, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_Cathedral][Dome of Cologne]] stood unfinished for 300 years, total building time 700 or so, in a town of about ...40000 people, plus other parts of the country to get ressources from (no darklings).

If building size would scale with normal square/cube law we are looking at 150m vs 30m, eg factor 5^{3=125.} No way a town of that size under darkling restrictions should have been able to do that.

No the limit has nothing to do with age and everything to do with brain development, example if I freeze a baby, and then unfreeze them after they are 20 years old, they can now consent?

So yes that definitely qualifies as ageism. Plus even if consent was 100% correlated with age, it would still be ageism since it's discrimination based on age.

Anyway even if you assume no one can consent to anything for 10 years we already force them to do hundreds of things for greater societal good (like attending education, eating food, wearing clothes, etc) as well as brainwashing them into whatever ideology we desire. Forcing them to eat a heart is equivalent to vaccinating them.

That doesn't make sense, if women are better glimwardens and glimwardens are clearly the source of power then cultural history put women in the role of men in our world.

What's a man going to do when he can eat the same number of hearts as a woman yet she is more powerful (or equally powerful but far faster).

Yes and no doubt men's adapted psychologically has developed over all of human history, I haven't heard of female chimpanzee's suffering from PTSD for example. So in a world where females are fighting early they would get the psychological adaptions (though since they'd be on the X chromosome there's no reason why they might not also apply to men).

Of course it may also be the case that men were psychologically adapted for becoming glimwardens when darklings started existing and so the pressure is actually for men to be smaller rather than women more capable.

Also individuals have different psychological suitability for military roles, and some women are better adapted to military roles than some men. Yet again it's a correlation not an absolute.

Well for a start I'm pretty sure number of hearts eaten still matters more. So not seeing women performing better isn't any indication of anything. What you'd except to see is women with the same number of hearts consumed performing better than equivalent men. And you'd have to see this over a large sample size as to discount individual variation. And really the point isn't that women are better, but that lighter people are better. It may be likely that all the glimmanden are heavier than any glimwomenden but that's just statistics. I don't think we have a description of every glimwarden so we don't know their mass.

Power = Heart

Speed = Heart/Mass

Now the important information is what factor is on mass, if it's square root of mass, then yeah it's not that big deal, if it's squared then it's more of a deal, etc.

Good thing we have a main character who can test this by the addition of people/boulders, fasting, or removing clothes etc.

If your remove the conscription of everyone who taken a heart, then yes, no problem, vaccinate all you want, but I objected to your original claim that children would make for good glimwardens. Glimwarden service is for life, and it involves a lot of danger.

Yes, that's why I'm suspicious of "women only" being presented as enlightened. A policy strictly focused on efficiency would operate on physiological limits (must be this small to apply), and I suppose that would create a natural state of the majority of glimwardens being women, but probably not exclusively. EDIT: So it looks like they have women only policy first, and then they select small women for efficiency. Like in the real world in the countries that have men only conscription they then select men on the small side for tank crews. Sexism comes first, efficiency second.

Well see you thought the character was biased in their understanding of their powers but I thought they were biased in their description of things.

#+begin_quote
  Which supports my claim that from what we are shown the size advantage is pretty marginal (it's easily outweighed by cultural prejudices).
#+end_quote

I think not that the size advantage is marginal, but that glimwarden power is actually irrelevant. So the size advantage might make for a huge combat difference, but by and large glimwardens don't need to be more powerful from what we've seen and been exposed to.

Edit: I guess that's what you were saying and I just misunderstood, so I agree.

This was brought up in another comment chain, people aren't selected because they are best at fighting the darkling, they're selected because they are the best at filling the cultural role of being a glimwarden. What I was doing was overestimating how much of a threat darklings really are, there isn't as much pressure from darklings as I thought.

That is even if a 40kg person could take down 5 Darklings for ever 1 an 80kg person could it doesn't matter because Darklings aren't the issues that Glimwardens face (by and large). Glimwardens always win darkling and the times when they don't isn't often enough to be the overwhelming selective pressure.

So then we can suppose that a person is half as lighter accelarates twice as fast, that doesn't mean "marginal" to me in a combat scenario (though again this seems actually irrelevant). So my question then is does human propulsion matter at all when moving under the bind? If Ussain Bolt and and equivalent weight person took 100 hearts and used the bind to run, would Ussain run faster or at the same speed?

I agree that it could make for more effective glimwarden force if everyone is given a heart to discover the best signatures. And many other things could be done better. But as said in different places, it seems clear that the civilization is secure enough that glimwardens and politicians can play power games. There is no desperation to fight for every little scrap of efficiency, ethics be damned.

#+begin_quote
  So my question then is does human propulsion matter at all when moving under the bind?
#+end_quote

The quote is as follows:

#+begin_quote
  The bind had many functions, but two of the most important were to enhance the physical strength of the user and to propel the user across the field of battle. The first function was muscle agnostic; a person grew more powerful in relation to how much bind they had, regardless of their physical strength without the bind. For the second function, size was a detriment, because the bind required to move the body around increased with mass.
#+end_quote

So it seems that glimlight is the great equalizer, and a spherical glimwarden in vacuum would be able to achieve acceleration linearly dependent on their mass, both on muscle power (leaving aside the question how one could propel oneself in vacuum on muscle power) and on pure glimlight propulsion (pulling against the luminiferous aether I suppose). This probably does not translate into anything near linear advantage in battle. And another question is what is the glimlight coefficient, i.e. how much additional hearts a glimwarden must take to achieve the same acceleration with the excess mass of 1 kg.

Indeed for a start of physical propulsion matters at all look at the fastest runners in the world, most of them are not light petite women. Having more powerful muscles (and therefore being heavier) may make more of an impact than the bind moving you. That is if we suppose acceleration = muscle strength*bind power + bind power/muscle mass then the relation between muscle strength mass is more important. If an 1 extra muscle strength costs less than 1 kg then in this simple equation with no coefficients it would be better to be heavier.

And yes hearts comes into it too if children are worse at fighting then their heart collection rate might not overcome that their more efficient heart/power increase. And since darklings seem to be infinite it seems the fattest (weight) and weakest (muscle strength) of people who is sufficiently skilled could outpower (by outcollecting and making up for efficiency loss) an idiotic but light child.

Another thing to consider, 1000 hearts doesn't necessarily guaratee 100% risk free heart gathering. It's not obvious that an average kid could be expected to gather even 1000 hearts to "earn their keep" before dying. And then it would be the question of exact advantage the lower mass gives a kid compared to their reduced general capabilities to figure out at which point it's best to give them the hearts and set them off on the darklings. It you wanted to go "make everyone a glimwarden" route maybe it would make the most sense to give everyone 1000 hearts when they come of age and expect them to repay the debt to society within 10 years, you know, like student loan from hell. It all depends on specific numbers.

Since at the end of the day they would be able to run away from any combat I imagine there's some age far below 15 or whatever you class as adulthood where it is reasonable for them to be able to at least collect 1k.

But yes it is very much a numbers game.

Part of the purpose of giving everyone hearts when they're younger, not necessarily the full 1000 is to lower the deathrate which was very high at that age in this time period.

********* Given that:

1) At least in this region, there seems to be a lack of intellectual thought directed towards the problem of "how does the power of the bind make a glimwarden", including among the glimwardens themselves.

2) The times when the efficacy of the glimwardens is truly important are rare and not conducive to reasoned observation - IE, the fall of a town when it's lantern(s) fail - so there may not be many outside observers who could comment on the effect of body size.

3) Our world's history, where segregation lead to these sort of... market inefficiencies... despite the fact that competition/survival was often of great concern.

...then it is reasonable to think that a segregated glimwarden force could persist as a cultural thing.

...pure evolution is very slow and uncertain, after all, and the darklings (and perhaps the bind) have been around for a short enough time that artifacts (see: radios) of the previous era are still around...

********** For sure, that's a good summary, however I would say the nature of isolation of each community would mean we would see more variations (than reality where no village could be that independent and culturally isolated) and therefore more competition and it should be reasonable to think that a successful shift to a superior protection force should be reflected by the higher odds of survival of that place.

Though as you say in 2) may be low enough where it's not relevant. After all not only does it have to be better it has to be so much more successful as to be replacing all the towns around it (after they fail).

Your second sentence uses a different definition of ageism which most wouldn't agree with since there are often excellent reasons to discriminate based on age, e.g. 1 year olds are not allowed to be doctors, say. In other words, as you define it what you say is true. But your definition of ageism makes it a rather useless concept.

You are (perhaps unintentionally) performing a bait-and-switch.

No, people who aren't trained aren't allowed to be Doctors.

That's a bait and switch.

Yes, the doctors was a poor example - my bad.

But by your own logic, "people who can't provide informed consent aren't allowed to be soldiers" wouldn't be ageism?

*** An attack apparently happens when a lantern stops working. Maybe the lantern is somehow connected to the armor? Maybe the use of the armor drains the supply of hearts from the lantern or something. Or it might just be a coincidence.

If it had a spirit, it would likely have had the spirit before Chloe put it on. You are certainly less likely to be correct.
