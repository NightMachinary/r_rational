I love rational fiction, and especially curling up with a really long, thorough fic, like 50,000 words and up. I've read a lot of the long fic available, but I'm always looking for more!

Some of the fic I've read includes: - Mother of Learning - A Thing of Vikings - SI by Daniel Boese - All Friendship is Optimal works on FiMfiction - With This Ring - Set in Stone - Deeprise - Ra - The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect - Worth the Candle

It's pretty well written, and the author updates with extreme productivity: ~20k words twice a week typically; it's nuts. The most accurate description of the quality is that at its best, it's good. When it's not, it kind of drags. It's super long, though, so it will keep you busy if you like it.

*** Seconding this recommendation. Its very much an investment in the story. The first book (about a 1000 pages) is often considered pretty weak compared to the rest of the story (seeing as the author has yet to edit out some errors). But its 20000+ pages have some interesting world building and good charter development.

May be my favorite portrayal of Hermione; /easily/ my favorite Dumbledore - I'm recommending it for equal parts worldbuilding and characterisation. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/682neu/][This review]] and comments are decent:

#+begin_quote
  It's a super-spy story where all the Bond-background has been mashed up and subsumed in an ingenious mutation of the Potterverse... Fifth year is admittedly self indulgent, but I couldn't stop laughing. Imagine canon Umbridge trying to control a school of disgruntled teenagers trained in espionage.

Technically fourth in a series, but entirely standalone - this is the backstory for Hermione in a later crossover.

Hope and Silence in the Hive(not precicely rational but not not rational) and Terror and Peace Among the Stars are good. Terror and Peace especially, it even adds a lot to Hope and silence. Quite philosophical, even though the main character is strictly a kardashev 2 civilization on her own pretty much no meaningful conflict is possible to solve with simple force and even notes how crude what she makes is compared with what a proper stellar engineer would make, can be a bit hard to follow at times but definitely worth it.

** Since I see FiO on your list which means you're not allergic to ponies, I'd recommend The Maretian. The Martian / MLP crossover. Very fun, and looong. I don't see The Martian on your list either but I assume you've heard of it/read it/seen the film: if not get to it straight away because it's excellent.

I don't see Animorphs the Reckoning on the recommendations; do you only want complete stuff?

Metamorphisis of prime intellect: localroger has some other fiction, most notably his passages in the void series. Doubt it meets your length requirements, but still.

Crystal Society, Crystal Mentality and Crystal Eternity are a great trilogy. I personally love all three but many people reckon the first one is the only one that's any good.

Luminosity and Radiance are two stories written as rational versions of twilight. Stop your cringing at the thought of sparkly vampires and creepy stalker bois and mormon undertones; it's a story about transhumanism and munchkinry of cool super powers. People reckon the second book isn't as good, but IMO there's just a different viewpoint character who you don't like as much as Bella in the first book.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/][With this Ring]] - Young Justice Fanfic, how to utilize a ring powered by avarice to save the world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] - Harry Potter, Hermione MC. Not strictly rational, but at least logical in regards to mathematical theory in regards to spellcrafting. A balanced approach, wherein raw arcane power and precise application of limited power are both valid approaches to magic. Very Long, but no instances of an idiot ball as I recall. There are errors on Hermione's part, but understandable ones.

[[https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/][Strong Female Protagonist]] - An original Webcomic, what happens when a child raised to be a 'super-hero' grows up and faces the reality that beating up bad guys in the streets won't fix the world. Be prepared to be left hanging as the Hiatus has been going on for years.

That's about all I can do off the top of my head for at least semi-rational that I don't see recommended here too often. I've got a collection of at least logical stories as well if you'd like those.

No. The Self Insert talked to the person experiencing it, notices that he was in fact *extremely distressed* by the involuntary alteration of his body (using empathic vision, no less), and then proceeds to purposefully misgender him while making comments to the effect of 'if you were a man, you wouldn't need this bra, now would you?' and introducing him as 'Electro Lass' despite his team members protesting that such behavior is uncalled for.

Given that the Self Insert is quite literally and explicitly a insertion of the Author as a character in the story and behaves as the author imagines he would behave under those circumstances, that part of the story suggests very strongly that the author is IRL very dismissive of body dysphoria and very much a biological essentialialist. Which makes sense, given that the author literally said as much in the forum posts that he got banned over. (I mean, he also got in hot water for posting that the forum's rule saying not to misgender people was dumb and he would rather move to a different forum than stop misgendering people. But that's beside the point.)

Being trans (this is an over simplification. There are multiple factors to whether an individual is trans. Someone can experience body dysphoria without being trans and vice versa. For example, I experience mild body dysphoria when people are intimidated due to my build, while in my mind I'm everyone's friend.) is when your self identity doesn't match what's in your pants.

In the WtR case, the genderswapped individual identifies as male, so they're a man. The genitalia practically being visible does nothing to change this, it only changes if the character is cis or trans.

******* This might take some unpacking.

It doesn't matter if Paul was being serious when he says that he'd support someone being a helicopter, because it's a vehicle for the author to say that identifying as a helicopter is exactly as valid as self identifying as a gender you're not born with the genitalia of. It's validating a trope used to invalidate trans people.

As to the body swap thing: the thing that stuck with me was the multiple paragraphs of "he's a she but she's a he REE"

Phasing tech: rational. It's a tech he's used for a bunch of stuff, no reason for larfleeze to magically be immune to it.

Extreme mastery of the orange light: c'mon do I need to say it. Sure he's had setbacks with it but overall he became a super master at orange light after meditating and pondering on a half thought out mishmash of philosophy.

Hinon: she only helped him because he was interesting and possibly useful, read 'extreme mastery of the orange light', so she gave him a doodad which perfectly solves his problem.

Sword: having a contingency plan is good, and most of the plots involving Constantine were actually good. No complaints here.

The story up until this point had larfleeze as an end boss with very slim chances of beating; he put constraints on what Paul could do simply by existing. Then when the author realized Paul needed to confront larfleeze soon, and had no idea how to make the victory satisfying (there's no way Paul would lose when the result of losing is sitting in orange stupor till the end of time) they just had hinon be 1. Willing to trivially solve the problem. 2. Able to trivially solve the problem

The most frustrating thing about WtR is I'm a transhumanist myself. I could wake up tomorrow in a robot, or female, or squid body and be excited at the new possibilities, that doesn't mean everyone is like me. The author is a dense jerk who makes all transhumanists look like dense jerks.

** I've just spent basically all of quarantine reading [[https://tiraas.net/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/][The Gods are Bastards]] which is fairly long and in my opinion very enjoyable. Though it has a slight tendency towards slowness and wordiness and has some grammatical issues.

** If you're fine with things that are less than rational, but still self consistent, I've got a bunch.

- Ar'Kendrythist is probably my favorite web serial currently. The premise is that two people from earth are isekai'd into a world with magic and a system. The world is rich and vibrant, and the magic is consistent while still giving leeway for having magical moments. The characters are really well done imo, and face actual character development throughout the series. It's at about 730k words so far.

- Zombie Knight Saga has the protagonist becoming an undead in the beginning, and the world unravels from there. Great worldbuilding and solid characters. The magic system is great and some of the resultant combat is the best I've seen in webfiction. It's at about 800k words right now I think.
