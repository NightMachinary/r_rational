** u/Academic_Jellyfish:
#+begin_quote
  Torture of Callowan prisoners
#+end_quote

rip the Blood. You'd think the Pilgrim would've kept them from doing that.

Also,

#+begin_quote
  these ‘sharpers' were both commonly used and in large supply
#+end_quote

Reference to the deal they made with the Matrons. Must've been a pretty significant amount of gold.

*** He never got around to actually formalizing those agreements that he was talking about previously, as far as i can remember. Also i think it was mostly with the Proceran forces that he was attached to previously where as these are Dominon forces.

Edit: Here we go,

  “There are evils I have been forced to make peace with,” the Pilgrim said with iron in his voice. “Torture is not one of them. You may be certain I will allow no such thing so long as I draw breath

***** i mean i agree with you but the way things look Yannu might have been keeping it quiet, Pilgrim might not have known cause the information was kept from him.

Edit what chapter was that by the way? i can't recall if he's speaking for the Grand Alliance or only in his advisory position to the Proceran forces.

***** Yannu/any of the Dominion commanders might have not seen any value in keeping with the agreements made with a Villain. I mean Lady Itma has the nerve to upfront ask Hakram who could kill them all to kneel to them. Also that they might have seen the Pilgrim's uhh optimism? as being for men walking with the Gods blessings while men have to be more uhh down to earth comparatively.

The potential mistake here is about whether and when torture happened, if the Pilgrim knew about it, etc.

******** Interesting. I thought the "mistake" being discussed was whether or not goblin munitions were plentiful.

c'est la vie.

It is still perfectly viable and more likely an answer that Yannu simply didnt ask permission for his actions. He seems the type.

** Goddamnit Cat what is that timing? I mean yeah it would have been bad if the Grand Alliance was sundered, but you've been offering to go as far as possible for Cordelia for the last two books, it's only karma for her to suffer from her past decisions. Also love the chain of misunderstandings and how Hakram was this close to using it all as leverage for one of Cat's major goals. Also that Rozala saw that there were larger consequences but that she's already been ordered to back Cat to the hilt.

***** We don't know if Tariq's going to support her bid. He might though: his main concern in not was keeping the Grand Alliance from being destroyed over it. Cordelia's taken full control over Procer (not that he knows, but the Ophanim might tell him), and Levant's amenable since Cat resurrected Pilgrim. Ashur's a concern, but they've been made irrelevant for a generation, with the fleet being destroyed and Assassin wiping out the third tier. They're definitely in a good position to push to join.

** So, everyone's assuming it's Cat and Pilgrim, did I miss the part where Archer, Rogue Sorcerer, and Hierophant had already made their way back? If I'm remembering correctly Cat said that she'd be a while longer as everyone else headed back, but I don't remember them being announced as having returned. Same with tyrant, though he was crawling last he was described so I doubt he caught up with anyone.

It'd be weird for two people to return, and the way it's written

#+begin_quote
  Princess of Aequitan felt the world change
#+end_quote

would make you assume it's Cat and Pilgrim, but it could also be a 'world changing' event if it's say Archer and Hierophant, since visions of Archer dying were seen, or if it ends up Tyrant and one of the others due to some honest trickery.

It's a stretch, but Tyrant tends to make stretches much more likely when he's involved.

*** They're aware that Archer was resurrected.

I think Tyrant already made it out and his forces were observed to be retreatinf

I think the main points for it being Cat are:

- that they arrive at dawn
- two figures hobbling in
- narrative weight being with Cat and Pilgrim, especially in this moment. It being Archer and Rogue would be anticlimactic. Masego was already whisked away by Ivah IIRC
