** Something about the way the dialogue is built rubs me /slightly/ the wrong way.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "I felt something like that too!" Blue says, sitting up. "Shit, sorry, I interrupted."

    "It's okay! What did you feel?"
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

later on..

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "That's it, we're tabooing the word 'luck,'" Aiko says suddenly.

    "Tabooing?" Elaine asks.

    "Yeah, it's a way to resolve arguments that get caught up in semantic confusion. We're not allowed to use that word in the discussion anymore. We clearly mean different things when we say it, so let's focus on what we actually are trying to say instead of tripping over that word again and again."
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

I get that as a rational fic, this is designed to teach some conflict-mediating skills.

So I see the value in having a timid character (Elaine) that others learn to allow to speak before interrupting.

But I guess it would feel more authentic with some slang, whether invented or not. The dialogue feels like 10% too formal or stilted and IMO could use a little more 'sprawl' and a little less formal definition of terms. Instead of Aiko fully explaining what 'tabooing' means, maybe have her say:

"it's a way of getting around words that keep tripping us up"

Not sure if that feedback made a ton of sense to you...

  "Oh, that's like a game! What would you say instead of luck, then?"

  Aiko stops to think, then continues slowly. "If this power or ability or whatever exists, it has to be something guided. It can't just be some diffuse, aimless effect that happens at random but also keeps benefiting the absol. Otherwise it could just as easily hinder itself with the things it causes. So it must be through some specific mechanism, something under conscious control, like clouding someone's mind or sending a tremor through the ground or whatever."

** Has no one ever captured an Absol before or something? This hypothesis seems like it would be pretty easily testable with a caught one. My first thought upon reading that was "great, catch one and you've got a safe way to train against Pressure!" And then I read the next part.

If resilience to Pressure really does get "used up", that's an absolute nightmare of an already terrible situation - your strongest trainers getting weaker over time, less able to make use of their stronger and more experienced pokemon. If that was proven to be the case, would someone dedicated to fighting the Stormbringers be better off not attending their attacks for the first half of their career, so that their limited number of attendances would be "used up" with a stronger, more experienced team?

**** I imagine it's effects are variable depending on the species and "Legendary" status as well.

It seems the Stormbringers have an AoE measured in miles (or kilometers for your non-Muricans), whereas this Absol's is measured in yards/meters.

If we're going through with some "scientific" approach, most forms of non-focused radiation do not fall off at a linear rate--ie something twice as far away is not taking half, but one-fourth or less the amount of exposure.

Thus it's likely the Absol have a Pressure "output" several orders of magnitude less than the Stormbringers. It's /probably/ not too dangerous for an Absol Trainer to be exposed to it, in as much as they might be exposed to the chaos of its effects (the opposing 'mon might lunge at the Trainer instead of the Absol, for instance). The "total amount" they would receive is likely negligible compared to the exposure of a Stormbringer.

TL;DR: Absol Pressure is likely similar to the dose of a microwave oven or a cellphone; Legendary Bird (or Mewtwo) Pressure is similar to that of the radiation from nuclear fallout.

** Awesome chapter as usual! I love seeing Blue improve as a leader and avoid making costly mistakes that he easily could have made in the past ala Viridian Forest's events. I kind of hope Blue captures the Absol somehow and bonds with it in a unique way since he's Dark and it's a Dark-type.

Also, I do have one quick question about Pressure. Is the whole discussion about only being able to stand up to it a limited amount of times a definitive thing, or is that just something that Blue and the others were speculating? It was a bit hard to determine from the way it was written in this chapter.

A question: Are ghost types rare and difficult to catch? They would be a very useful resource in this situation: even if they can't phase through walls, they're probably silent. Gen VI removed Gengar's levitate (wtf?) but even Gastly by itself is pretty darn scary; quiet cloud of poison (secondary typing!) that moves by itself.

Also, one thing that I just noticed: Surge's gym pretty much teaches people how to deal with those situations. Why not even the rangers ask for backup? Practical field experience, too.

** Interesting that of all non-legendary lines with Pressure (Aerodactyl, Weavile, Dusknoir, Absol, Vespiquen, Spiritomb, Wailord, Bisharp), 50% of them are dark type.

Could Blue's darkness give him an advantage on resisting Pressure? Maybe that's why elder Oak was so resilient, something Dark about the Oak family tree.

As an aside, I find it a little unusual to think that a Pokemon like Vespiquen, which seems to relatively common from the way they were talked about during the Pineco catching chapter, would not have the same reputation as Absol for bad luck. Maybe attributed to the chaos caused by dealing with large combee swarms?

Absol really does seem to have some kind of heightened intelligence, of only for it's ability to be so dang creepy. That scene of a lone cat-monster standing in the center of a dimly lit hollowed out chamber while the rumbling of even larger snakes come burrowing toward you. Chills to the extreme.

*** Yeah, It's meant to be a little vague, when she says it :) Basically she's just hypothesizing that the absol semi-constantly uses its Pressure to manipulate the world around it in ways that look like guided misfortune, but is really just mayhem that it can escape much more easily than anyone that happens to be around it.

** Hmm! I'd have never thought of Absol as a lamb before, but I guess I see the resemblance ;3 Cute Undertale reference, too, and an enjoyable chapter overall. I am confused, though, as to why Blue's reaction after seeing the Onyx wasn't to tell everyone he could to get the fuck away.

**** I reread the bit I was referring to. I can't copy it, but it's right after they exit the cave, having found the Absol resting by the Onix nest.

Blue can't reach the other trainers involved, besides Bretta and the Rangers. It feels as though Blue didn't tell Bretta about the Onix, or seriously downplayed the threat, because she and her group appear to be completely taken by surprise when Blue and company show up to rescue her. Unless she just didn't believe him? Though if she follows Blue online, it could be reasonable for the reader to expect her to deduce he would not benefit from such kind of lies.

***** Ahh, I see what you're saying! Yeah, he didn't go into an actual text message or anything, just flagged his location with a descriptor that said that his group needs reinforcements. Think of it like a macro that people can use to communicate quickly and easily. He was expecting to stay there until others arrived or talk to them over the phone, and totally forgot to update Bretta's group when he left. That's why he still had to describe the specifics to the Ranger.
