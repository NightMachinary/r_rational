[[http://www.mangahere.co/manga/world_customize_creator/c001/][Custom world creator]] , [[http://www.mangahere.co/manga/re_monster/][re:monster]] and [[http://www.mangahere.co/manga/tsuyokute_new_saga/][tsuyo]]. Their worlds have fairly consistent rules and characters acting rationality. Re:monster has been translated further in story form then manga form at the moment. [[http://www.mangahere.co/manga/all_you_need_is_kill/][All you need is kill is another interesting one.]]


** I liked the second two. World creator is crap, though. Just pandering to the gamer audience with minimal effort.

Re:monster is wish fulfilment, but it's the kind of wish fulfilment that's self aware enough to not be grating, with a decently interesting plot. I saw the main character described as a turbo-sue, and have to agree, but that's half the fun.

Tsuyo is fun because it's basically a peggy sue fanfiction, comic-fied. Not particularly rational so far (enemies are just evil for evil's sake) but does a decent job nob being incredibly cliche and just having a believably, but not massively OP hero.

Y-you don't say.

  Because I couldn't bring myself to wake the girls who were sleeping soundly due to the fatigue from last night's intense orgy, I slipped through using [Metamorphosis] to not wake them up.

**** Well, I guess it's a bit closer to 3/4ths the fun... Though I'd read the hell about a manga where the premise is leading goblins to victory, rather than making yourself OP.

***** Ah, I'm actually past the end of the manga and reading the translated novel version at this point.

I still think it's a fun read, but the further I go the more it appears our protagonist's moral compass isn't quite human, or at least wouldn't match up with our society's.

On the other hand maybe it never was. He did say that he literally cannibalized villainous people in his original life to feed his power.

****** I think it becomes pretty clear he doesn't follow our morality after the first time he killed and ate a random passerby.

** So far, I just read world customize creator. Rational stuff is supposed to have them using weak powers to a great extent. It looks more like the main character is nearly omnipotent and not doing much with his powers. Also, he seems to just assume that everyone he interacts with is the good guys. It looks like he's been lucky so far, but it's not a good strategy. You can't just make someone an artifact because they told you that they're giving it to someone that they tell you is on your side.
