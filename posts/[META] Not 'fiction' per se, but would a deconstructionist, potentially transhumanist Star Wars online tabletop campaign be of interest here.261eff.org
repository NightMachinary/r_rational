The campaign in question: [[http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/260r4i/online_star_wars_saga_edition_running_a/]]

While whether or not any roleplaying game is 'rational' depends heavily on the ongoing actions of those playing it, I would be very glad to have players who know the value of actually doing whatever is needed to succeed (as opposed to just whatever effort is expected of their subconscious model of their role), and it seemed like something that might relevant to the interests of this subreddit.


** I saw this there and didn't say anything for a few reasons foremost of which is that you don't mention medium up front ((how we will be playing)) and the other reason is that I don't normally reply as either these don't happen because the person gets bored or no one wants to play but if you are dedicated enough to branch out to other communities i would be excited to play if it is play by post or similar method that does not require me to be somewhere specific at a specific time.

*** I did mention in the original post that it would probably be run over an online tabletop like Roll20, but that was buried in a wall of text, so I should have been clearer about that. I do like the idea of an asynchronous game, but in my experience it's hard to keep a play-by-post campaign going without running into the issue of people losing interest or just not posting with sustainable frequency; I've rarely had that sort of issue with in-person gaming, so hopefully having regular sessions should help keep things focused and on-pace.

That said, I would definitely welcome and even encourage players to collaborate, communicate, and even undertake projects/missions/interactions 'off-camera' via chat/email/etc., so even if you couldn't make the regular sessions, you could still be an active participant in the campaign.

**** so if I do play ((which, what time are you planing)) I would want to go with a more transhumanist theme as opposed to a munchkin one, specifically one based on [[http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/simplified/]["transhumanism as simplified humanism"]]

Disgraced jedi Alistair Wright one day in a class at the jedi academy alistair asked why some things were darkside, bringing back the recently dead, healing terminal illnesses, forcing plants to grow faster, preserving the life of those injured past natural recovery. The teacher answered as they had every time, most of those things were not possible and even if they were they would violate the natural balance, they would be using the force to make the impossible possible, they would make you a tool of the darkside doing your will against the will of the force. they didn't know about his experiments, the animals he had killed and brought back, the plants he had made grow, the patients he had quietly cured and sustained through surgery. Alistair stood up and announced "then I denounce ballance, call me darth wright" and left, the students paralyzed by bystander apathy and the teacher left with his brain trying to find a line in a script that wasn't there. A few days later Alistair saw the first wanted poster for "Darth Right, wanted for heresy"

***** Sorry for the delay. I want to get in contact with all the prospective players and figure out when would work best for everyone, but the preliminary time is late morning to early afternoon on Saturdays. I'll send everyone a message with my contact information and add people to a group chat as they get in touch.

I can definitely see the Jedi taking a deathist viewpoint, and a Jedi who rejects that and aims to cure all ails would fit well with the campaign. I do wonder whether the Jedi actually use terms like 'heresy', though. Did he have previous exposure to Sith or Sith ideals? Suddenly declaring oneself to be Sith in the middle of the Jedi Academy seems a bit dramatic. There are certainly plenty of 'grayer Jedi', actual Sith, and unaffiliated force-using traditions in the KotOR era that he could have been drawn towards as part of his disillusionment, whether just philosophically or politically as well.
