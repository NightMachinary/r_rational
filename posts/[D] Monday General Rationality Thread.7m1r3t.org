Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** 1. What are your New Year's Resolutions? Mine are, basically, exercising more, reading more, and writing more, though all of those things are broken up into sub-resolutions (e.g. I decided my word count goal by looking at the projects that I need/want to accomplish this year, estimated the word count per project based on past projects, and then broke that into monthly/weekly/daily counts + some buffer/failure days to make sure that the goal was reasonable). I'm also moving residences, in part so that I live closer to a gym.

2. Anyone want to form an [[/r/rational]] group to support each other in keeping our resolutions, to the extent that online acquaintances can do so? I have some ideas, but I'm less set on the “how” and am open to ditching or adding to them. Register interest /first/, and then we can figure out what would work for the people who are interested. This might not be very effective, but I'm all about trying new things (especially low-cost things) and I'm willing to give it the old college try if anyone else is.

*** I recommend you make this a post rather than a comment, because the Monday Thread is for discussion but you are trying to get a mini-group together for mutual support rather than asking for advice on how to keep up with New Year's Resolutions.

Not to say that you shouldn't have posted here (it's fine!), but it likely work better as a post over as a comment.

** For blood pressure reasons I'm looking for a precise saltshaker or other way of applying salt to food. Most saltshakers either flow too fast and are hard to control or flow too slowly and clog easily. It seems the only way to find out which is the case is to try it yourself which isn't an option at any store I know of.

Any recs?

*** I put the salt in the pepper shaker and vice versa. Typically pepper shakers have fewer holes; because what I really want is tonnes of pepper and a precise amount of salt, it's all result and no hassle apart from my guests being confused every once in a while.

*** If you're desperate, you could resort to eating liquid-type foods, like soups and porridges. Dissolve salt in water, do math, pour a very precise amount of the salt water into a measuring container, then pour the salt water from the container onto your liquid-type food.

**** This seems bizarrely convoluted, if you are just going to apply a specified amount of salt-in-water to your food then why not just cut out the middleman and apply that amount of salt directly? With the added bonus that you aren't restricting which foods you do this for.

He said he was having problems with doing this, because salt clumps together and essentially forces you to add them in large randomly-sized discrete chunks. So if he wants exactly X amounts of salt on something, he can't do it with his salt shaker. In contrast, if you dissolve salt in water, now you can easily measure out precise amounts of salt to add to stuff, with the only problem being that your food would be covered in water.

******* The way to get a precise amount of salt into water is to dump the whole thing in. As in, here's the procedure:

Step 1) Weigh salt shaker.

Step 2) Dump large amounts of salt from shaker into water.

Step 3) Weigh salt shaker again to know the amount of salt you put in the water.

Step 4) Do math, calculate the amount of salt water to use to get the amount of salt you want.

Step 5) Pour exactly that amount of salt water onto your food.

If you do step 2 directly onto the food, you can indeed tell how much salt you added, but that's unlikely to be the amount you wanted to add. The water is needed for fine precision.

I mean, without the water, you would have to do something like this:

Step 1) Weigh salt shaker.

Step 2) Dump large amounts of salt from shaker into an empty container.

Step 3) Weigh salt shaker again to know the amount of salt you put in the container.

Step 4) If the amount is wrong, pour the salt back into the salt shaker, repeat from step 1 until you get the amount right.

Which will take forever if you want a very precise amount.

#+end_quote

is to just use whatever precision scale you're using for the salt shaker and just measure out salt onto that (rather than doing math for how much you removed from the shaker which would take a while). With that approach I can say from having done chemistry labs that you can get a specified amount in a few seconds, adjusting the amount on the scale is really quite quick, and given the wider tolerances allowed for food it would probably be faster than that.

  Step 5) Pour exactly that amount of salt water onto your food.

It also strikes me that the water isn't massively necessary here either, since you could just use a smaller measured container to dispense salt (or more like a teaspoon marked with a given size circle) in an analogous fashion. It's not clear that you would be better protected from applying too much salt by pouring in saltwater. You could probably guarantee a great deal of precision if you diluted the saltwater enough, but that has to be weighed against the cost of adding more water to your food (yes you could make the food with less water in the first place to counteract that, but at that point you're not saving any effort).

*** Salt shakers tend to acquire a salt crust that eventually makes the holes smaller. You could try to accelerate that - dipping the shaker in water and then in salt, or if you want to go fancy, putting the shaker headfirst into a supersaturated salt solution and then slowly evaporte it over a heater.

Also buy all the shakers online, test them to your satisfaction and return the ones you dont like.

***** Potassium Chloride is sold as '[[https://www.amazon.com/Morton-Salt-Substitute-3-12/dp/B00KPX1W4U][Salt Substitute]]'. You cook with it just like you'd use table salt.

I find that it [[http://www.bloodpressureuk.org/microsites/salt/Home/Howtoeatlesssalt/Alternatives][tastes pretty similar]] to normal salt. But some people use a [[https://www.amazon.com/GoodSalt-Substitute-Iodized-Mineral-Alternative/dp/B00UKSA5D4][low-sodium salt]] that has a mix of KCl and NaCl.

You should be able to get either version at a typical grocery store.

Some research shows that [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1627756][potassium lowers blood pressure]] directly. But, even if that doesn't kick in, it's a substitute that can let you cut sodium.
