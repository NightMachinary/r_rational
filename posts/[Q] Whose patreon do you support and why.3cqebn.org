Following my previous post, I saw many of you already use Patreon and support some independent creator. So I wonder, which writter / blogger do you support and what is great about their work?

Personally I support [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] and [[http://waitbutwhy.com][Wait but Why]].

Probably everyone already knows Mother of Learning.

As for Wait but Why, it's a blog that explain interesting stuff (e.g. Fermi paradox, AI danger, the why of electric cars, procratination, ...) in a nice easy funny way (a little ELI5 style).

Mother of Learning patreon : [[https://www.patreon.com/nobody103]]

Wait but Why patreon: [[https://www.patreon.com/waitbutwhy]]

*Edit:* Links to contents and patreons.


** At the moment just Wildbow, so that he may continue to write great works. (Author of Worm, Pact, and Twig).

I'm seriously contempting helping Tarol for [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Goblins]] as well, but decided on a wait-and-see to see if he is really back on his feet after last year before helping out. If he keeps his current pace up, then I'll probably support him in a month or two.

I give a dollar or two to all of these awesome creators. Everyone else, I only buy their merch. ;)

** Where applicable, links are to the first post/chapter/etc to encourage clickthroughs.

[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] - good story, supporting in the hopes it encourages quicker/consistent updates.

[[http://leftoversoup.com/first.php][Leftover Soup]] - It's a slice of life webcomic that brings up some interesting points of view. Doesn't meet the criteria for rational fiction, but quite enjoyable.

[[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2014/12/24/taking-root-1-1/][Twig]] - Wildbow's latest serial. Currently, I'm not enjoying it nearly as much as Worm or Pact. I enjoyed the tension overload from Pact and certain arcs of Worm, and I'm hoping later arcs of Twig can ratchet it up a bit. Plus, for me the monster of the week thing isn't as entertaining as the more focused arcs from the other two.

[[http://loadingreadyrun.com/][LoadingReadyRun]] - Canadian sketch comedy at its finest. There may be better sources of news, but they don't have those hats.

** Wildbow, because I love his stuff and he writes so very much of it so consistently... almost single-handedly keeps me supplied with reading material, and if he were publishing in the traditional way I'd be buying a book every few months. So it only seems fair to slip him a few dollars on a regular basis.

Haven't yet found anyone else with quite that same combination of prolific, consistent, high quality, and "has a patreon".

**** Nothing quite the same, but there are comics and bloggers that I would consider supporting if they were asking.

I've come close to adding Shamus Young to my list, and might well do if he shifts back towards long-form text posts rather than the videos that I don't actually watch (as he has suggested he might)

It's also possible that there are people I read who /do/ have a Patreon and have just hidden it well. Or there's odd cases like ViHart who has a Patreon /solely/ supporting videos where she counts down from the donation amount alongside a microwave timer, but says that her other projects are already sufficiently supported.

Oh, and thinking further... I may also have a previously unmentioned "under-funded" criterion; I look at the CGP Grey Patreon and he already has nearly $15k per video pledged and that seems like quite a lot so I don't feel too bad for not adding another $1

** I have a few small-amount patronages (total ~$10/month), and will probably add several more when I have more cash to spare. (Shadows of the Limelight/Alexander Wales and Alicorn come to mind.)

[[http://leftoversoup.com/archive.php?num=539][Leftover Soup]]/[[https://www.patreon.com/tailsteak][Tailsteak]], because it's a silly but very thoughtful comic on subjects near to my heart (random page chosen to be fairly representative).

[[http://stefangagne.com/floatingpoint][Floating Point]]/[[https://www.patreon.com/stefangagne][Stefan "Twoflower" Gagne]]: I loved City of Angles, and have been loving Floating Point so far. Not rationalist, but rational and well-written; uses the 'information and planning beat strength' aspect consistently.

[[http://thealexandrian.net/][The Alexandrian]]/[[https://www.patreon.com/justinalexander][Justin Alexander]]: Interesting thoughts on roleplaying games, Shakespeare, and occasionally politics, Russian theater, and random SF fandoms. This one I supported chiefly because the minimum donation was low, and there seemed like a very good chance that small amounts of funding would have noticeable effects. I'd recommend the blog to anyone where the topics sounds interesting, but wouldn't recommend sending another marginal dollar per post his way to someone with the same level as enjoyment as me.

** Here's one big question I've had about Patreon:

How much of a cut is taken by Patreon & Paypal? I've heard that Paypal & credit card fees are pretty steep when you only send 1$. I fear that donating $1 per month would compound that, so I've always used lump-sum paypal donations where applicable. Are there any "sellers" who can shed light?

*** Patreon's cut is 5%, with Paypal taking another 5% + $0.05 per transaction. So that dollar a month, if transferred through Paypal would amount to $0.85 for the author. Patreon does bulk processing in order to lower costs, so if you're giving $1 to two artists, the $0.05 fee only occurs once (and each would effectively be getting $0.875 instead).

Stripe has higher transaction fees than Paypal, but takes a lower percent of the total. I think the breakeven point between the two is around $8.

**** Thanks, that's quite helpful. The fixed $0.05 is not as bad as I thought.

So, to donate $12 to a single artist through Patreon via paypal puts $10.20 into their account, spread over a year. To donate via a lump paypal donation puts 11.35 into their account. That's fairly reasonable, considering that Patreon is essentially offering an online store service. For comparison, Bandcamp charges 10-15% including transaction fees.

Being a woman in public is controversial.
