** KEEPING THE DREAM ALIVE in the 30th inning with the SURPRISE COMEBACK.

But seriously, parading your mortal enemy around as a cloak? Cat learned better from Black than to do something so foolish.

I am disappointed, if for nothing else than the fact that I can't look forward to the next session of expected medieval battle spreadsheet wankery and have to wait for this side-plot to resolve.

  “Do you know why my arm keeps getting twisted?” I said. “Leverage, Thief. That is what I lack the most. They all have things I want or need, and I have precious little of the same. That little piece is a kind leverage. It may be that I never use it, and that within the month I'll shatter it. But there's a knot of choices right ahead of me, and I will not go into it having robbed myself of a card to play.”

  “She doesn't get to come back, Foundling,” Vivienne said. “Not after this. That's a line.”

#+begin_quote
  “I give you oath, Diabolist,” I said and I hardly recognized my voice for it was a thing of ice and iron. “If you do this, there is no place in Creation or beyond that will safeguard you from me. Not Heavens or Hells, not even if every lord in Arcadia swears to you. The doom I promise you will have men trembling in a thousand years when they speak of Akua's Folly and the woe that came from it.”

Though you know, I'm not even entirely certain if being cloak girl is sufficiently cruel or full of woe to fulfill that oath.

** I'm curious as to what exactly Akua hopes to accomplish with this. Does she still want to play the villain? Or does she want to set up her clone body for herself?

Also, Catherine has quite a lot of trust in Vivienne to give her the passcode for full body lock

Or maybe she's just into that and Aqua doesn't know the safe word ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

**** If Cat knows the safeword, then that means this is only a check against possession by Akua or some other external force. It wouldn't work against a Cat that's gone too deep into Winter, which you would normally think is the more pressing reason to have this precaution at all. Well, Winter Cat is pretty dumb and couldn't remember the details of the plan during the raid, so it might work.

Maybe all of the Woe know the safeword, so if Thief betrays Cat, any of them could undo the binding.

** Holy shit, this is pretty bad. Big question at this point is whether or not this represents a one-off opportunity for Akua, or if this first breach into Cat's body will allow her to make later attempts.

On the plus side, Thief and Archer might get that chance to stab Akua they missed in Liesse.

** I always wondered how that cloak has not been cut to ribbons in all the fighting that Cat does, and now I think I know.

I think narratively, the cloak is part of the Black Queen so it is also part of the "creationally fixed body" which would create the necessary link between Cat and Akua that would allow her to take over.

Otherwise it makes no sense (to me) that a soul imbued to an object would be able to jump out like that.

*** Remember, the cloak isn't just a cloak. It is an artefact.

#+begin_quote
  There a single silhouette rode a winged steed stolen from Arcadia, cloak of many colours streaming behind her. An artefact in the making, gathering weight with every fallen army stitched onto the rest. Already Akua suspected sorcery would slide over like like water off a duck's back, and it was still nascent to its true form
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  “The murder cloak, yeah,” Archer mused. “Called thus because you murdered someone for every piece you add to it.”
#+end_quote

While we've never had a full description of what an artefact is and what makes it different from 'normal' enchant, we know they can do things normal spells can't (the scrying stone captured from Akua), are very hard to damage (sorcery off a ducks back) and seem to gain power through involvement in epic deeds. From this I would guess that artefacts are the object form of Named. That's why the cloak is so tough

** You know, I realize that the Heavenly fences don't see much use in melee, that the army of Callow now has a counter for them and that it didn't move enough for them to be feasibly deployed for denying retreat, but it's kind of strange not to see /any mention of them at all/. It's partly Malanza's own fault, for letting the siege engines meet the only force that couldn't be easily covered by the panes and seemingly leaving the other flank with no priests at all, but still, not trying to box the enemy ranged units in is questionable at the very least.

And I don't think the Saint has been keeping a low profile either. Engineering anything like that is kinda contrary to both of their natures I feel like.
