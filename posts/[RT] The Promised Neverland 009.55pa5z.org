**** Not particularly stupid, but Emma trying to save everyone. But even then, the confusion of so many children trying to escape at once would act as a distraction that allows the 3 main characters to slip out.

** [[#s][]]

Fuck. Yes. None of that "Heros escape but leave every single threat behind to pursue them" bullshit here. At least in their plans. I'm happy the kids, for all their optimism in bringing along several infants to traverse what they surmise is demon land, aren't /complete/ moral idiots.

** 'Next Issue: The GFH Escape Arc begins'. Huh, I guess the escape is happening way sooner than I expected. Also, cold blooded murder is potentially going to happen. Norman and Ray are serious, as they should be. I just didn't think they would entertain the idea.

*** I think murdering her isn't the best idea because it will probably affect them psychologically and that could be a problem later and also it could make convincing the other children more difficult or and it's going to make Mama and the demons see them as bigger treats .So if possible incapacitating her(breaking her legs or giving her a serious injury ) would be better .It's good to see that they are serious an capable of at least planing things like that if necessary(we'll see if they are capable of doing them) . It's strange next cap the escape ,they don't have munch information so maybe something (the demons coming to collect them?)will leave them without time to keep preparing.

** The drawing of Mama's black helper is getting even more caricatural and unsympathetic. It's not very surprising given how racist people are in Japan (and in Asia in general) when it comes to black people but it's still a bit frustrating to see that.

**** Yeah, I don't think it's straight up demonising of black characters, just that they tend to use certain perspectives and caricatures to exaggerate the "evil" appearance of black antagonists.

We haven't seen enough antagonists to be sure, but it really makes me uncomfortable so far.

**** I'm afraid a lot of that is just unequal amount of details. Her ugliness comes largely from her nose and lips ("black people have fat lips, right?") and the kids have single-line (or invisible) noses and lips.

(Which is meta-level evidence that she won't survive long. Ain't no manga artist got time to draw all that.)

***** Yeah. Thick lips, wide noses. It's a frustratingly common pattern in manga.\\
It's worth noting that caucasian westerners are also often caricatured (blocky cheeks and chin, [[http://i.imgur.com/4xAsggs.jpg][this]] works as an example I guess), so it's not, like... it's not special treatment reserved for black people. But it's also undeniable that the treatment black people get is generally much less flattering.

And then there are examples like Eyeshield 21, which presents its [[http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/eyeshield21/images/9/9b/Patrick_spencer.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091227021851][black character]] in a very positive light. He even has to struggle against racism, courtesy of his american coach. He's not a throwaway character, he's not an idiot, he has plenty of good qualities.\\
And then the manga starts going on about all the natural advantages black people have in sports, and how their natural talents are like those of wild animals, etc...

It's sad. Japan is just a racist country I guess. In a patronizing way.\\
(qualifiers apply of course. Not everyone is racist blah blah)

****** It can't be helped with ethnically homogeneous countries like Japan. Most japanese people only see black or white people via how the media depicts them. Furthermore, Stereotypes and culturally accepted "common sense" informs the japanese media on how to depict black and white people. It's a vicious cycle.

*** I'm beginning to wonder if she isn't secretly a demon in 'human' skin.

These are completely over the top.

Like [[/u/Schpwuette]] said, there's a black kid who's normal.

Edit: Seriously, her biology seems to be nonstandard by how this chapter tells it.

**** I thing that maybe she could have been selected and trained to be fast and resistant maybe to catch children if they try to flee from the farm , or she was augmented by genetic engineering or in other ways .She seems to have too munch stamina and strength to be a normal human ,unless it's just a exaggeration because manga

** This chapter I got a strong vibe from "Assassination Classrom". I only read a few of the first chapter, but the premise is that an octupus powerful alien will destroy the planet (or was it the moon?) in at the end of a given timespan. The catch is that he decide to pass this time teaching to a class of children, while they are trying to kill him. He try really hard to teach and improve everyone of its students, focusing on each one point of strenght.

So could it be that Mama wants to get a vengeance on the aliens and is trying to raise an army? Every strange behaviour could be explained this way. She left the doll at the house to cause the discovery, is protecting the children and progressively making them grow and prepare for the future challenges. In this way, while Sister is thinking to be outplaying Mama, she is just a tool for their training.

If the outside world was thoroughly conquered a rebellion could only start from these farms.
