** Oh, heck yes. A good, crunchy fight scene, Cat acting like a hell of a villain, and the Saint of Swords showing us all what a badass she is. Given that she's capable of cutting through basically anything (apparently?) I wonder if she cut through Cat's mantle or something like that?

As an aside, I love that her mantle forces her to act like a stereotype of an arrogant villain. The Saint screwing with that might be a blessing in disguise.

** Great fight, Cat is learning the beauty of plots within plots. there are at the very least three different things happening in this incursion.

1 killing the commoner leaders of the crusade.

2 Stealing whatever Thief stole.

3 destroying even more the reputation of Amadis Milenan as a diplomat, first Arlington now the Daoine, The dude cant seem to catch a break.

I loved this line "...On the other hand, now it was four on one. My odds had just gotten a lot better." So badass.

You think that's what it was? While relying on an ability to make artifacts is slightly better than relying on the artifacts themselves, it still will inevitably end in them failing her at a crucial moment.

I think this pattern of three will be the death of the Saint of Blades, in the process leveling Catherine up in terms of narrative threat level and making her the true final boss of this Crusade. Cat, of course, has to break this story before it ends in her inevitable defeat.

At least that's my theory.

That said, I hope that she'll go the less direct way and instead will act through other Named. Not in sense of directly bestowing abilities, but more subtly, like appearing in a vision of a hero-to-be about to accept a Role from an angel to put it in a new perspective. Maybe even shield a claimant to the Name from the retribution for a failed test, like one run by the Seraphim in Ashur.

** The Saint really fucked up here. Winter was taking over, classic evil, just like it has for some time now and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8hkrht/rthf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_4_chapter_10/dyknohs/?context=3][just like I called last chapter]] it got cut away from Cat. See, we know for a fact that classic evil *loses*, it's in Winter's very nature. She likely could have lost the war tonight, becoming the Winter Queen in full and forgetting everything Black had taught her, not to mention her own peculiar version of sanity.

Now, she's probably not totally free, but she has *clarity* again, and hopefully that's enough for her to realize that she needs to cut winter out of her soul if she wants any chance of winning this war.

*** Yep. The best case scenario for the Crusade was to actually let Cat win here, as that would've irrevocably turned her into a monster, a fully Evil insane cocky bloodthirsty Fae Demigod, but that would've set Cat up for an inevitable defeat later. Whether that required the Saint of Swords' death is even disputable, since she could've let Cat rampage for a while and then retreated from a rampaging monster.

Now that Cat has been defeated in single combat in her berserk form, she has been set up for an arc where she relies less on Winter, learns to controls it better and eventually perhaps even gets rid of it.

Also, I wonder if Auger had any data on this, because this shit was planned. But at the same time, Cat's decision to go through with it was very quick and spontaneous, so maybe she was blindsided until it was too late.

** Wow, now THAT was a good chapter! I'd been somewhat disappointed in EE's writing style because Winter-Cat's personality so often seemed identical to non-Winter-Cat. But this chapter did a fantastic job keeping the two distinct and separate. Random thoughts:

Totally thought the chapter title was "balloon" at first. Oops!

#+begin_quote
  I could not help but be thankful she'd chosen to whittle away at *my trump card* instead of trying to go after me.
#+end_quote

I think this phrase is getting a bit overused, or at least it's getting used for enough things that it's confusing to know which is an /actual/ trump card.

Chapter 1: Trump card refers to Ubua's scrying artefact that now is the centerpiece of the Observatory.

Chapter 7: Multiple unnamed trump cards are mentioned as a potential way to block the pass and stop the invasion.

Chapter 9: The "real" trump card is the fairy gates.

Chapter 11: Sounds like the trump card here is the Wild Hunt. There is also a reference to the "card" she and Masego cooked up at the Observatory. /Absolute positioning/ isn't labeled by this phrase, but I'm unsure if it was in use during this sneak attack or not.

#+begin_quote
  none of the unconscious markers the mage had used were markers I was familiar with.
#+end_quote

I'm not positive I understand what this means, specifically the "unconscious" part. If I'm reading it right, it sounds like Cat was trying to find the officer tents' locations by using the mage's memory like an SQL database, but being unsure what primary key the mage used for "officer tent locations." And then trying to map those entries to her own mind's entries, which she brute-forced through Winter magic. Sound right?

#+end_quote

Sounds like between the last chapter's whistle and this quote here, we know what Cat is doing with the Named she's killed. I'm wondering how that is done - is it a Winter ability, or an outcome of when she stole *Take* from Diabolist?

#+end_quote

I wonder if we'll get the heroes' Names eventually. I always like learning more about the Name system. Here we have a caster, a knife-wielder, and a priest.

Given that she also refferred to Aspects as trump cards instead of powers that she could rely on, it's more in the sense of tricks that will guaranteedly achieve their intended purpose (equalizing her power to the opponent's for *Struggle*, looking into other dimensions for the greater scrying bowl, getting the army to wherether she needs quicker than physically possible for the fairy gates), but don't necessarily win her the battle.

Sort of? It's like using the locations you pass by every day as landmarks for things you move or don't use that often: individual for people depending on their routine and focus.

#+end_quote

In [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/04/11/interlude-stairway/][interlude Stairway]] Klaus Papenheim indeed refers to Chantant as the Alamans language, though his own Reitz is the closer equivalent to German, considering that [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/crowned/#comment-4207][in the Holy Roman Empire analogy for the Principate of Procer the Licaonese principalities are more or less Prussia, and Rhenia is Brandenburg]]: more an army with a country than a country with an army and all that. Chantant is likely the calernian equivalent of French.

#+begin_quote
  I'm wondering how that is done - is it a Winter ability, or an outcome of when she stole Take from Diabolist?
#+end_quote

She stole *Call*, which is now a whistle. *Take* is either the Aspect that was mentioned to grow beyond what an Aspect should be or, more likely, gone after her transformation, considering that *Fall* is the Aspect she still can use the remains of. Making objects out of souls is a fae thing: the invitation to Skade in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/12/04/fletched/][Fletched]], the barrier in the fortress of Dormer in the [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/11/20/chapter-45-falling-action/][chapter 45]] both were made out of some unfortunate mortal's soul.

#+begin_quote
  I wonder if we'll get the heroes' Names eventually.
#+end_quote

Unless one of the split armies would get into a pitched battle where Catherine has to devote enough focus to its Named, unlikely. Thief already mentioned that she found out some of the Names, and Cat only displayed interest in the Saint and the Pilgrim. Given that they are likely to split too, both are probably going to overshadow their respective sidekicks, not leaving enough narrative space. Well, that, or Catherine has some plans that dont include straight up conflict, in which case she may need to trick them or predict their reactions.

#+begin_quote
  “I am the Bone of my Sword..." and all that.
#+end_quote

Nah, not really. I mean, Nasuverse has some body-locked Reality Marbles too, and Shirou's "My face hasn't turned into swords yet" line made me laugh back then, but the closest thing we may be able to see is Catherine getting lucky and pulling off an Unlimited Lost Works. Otherwise the Saint is closer to Guideverse's elves.

Another hint about absolute positioning, it seems. Hierophant is evidently needed to cast... whatever she'll need to get her bearings, but I'm at a bit of a loss to how the subjective memories could connect to a multidimensional scrying tool. At least the military applications of this can be linked to the ability to open gates with precise positioning and timing, though that doesn't seem so different from what she's currently doing at the first glance.
