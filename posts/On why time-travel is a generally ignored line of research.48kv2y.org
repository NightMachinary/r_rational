** The reason you don't know about time traveling civilizations is because time travel allows them to enter/discover/create closed (but infinite) universe where they're the only effective civilization*, and given the insanity of the rest of the DC multiverse this is the only rational action for a sane civilization that cares about its long term survival.

And because of time travel, its impossible to observe. As soon as they escape the multiverse, they retroactively make it always have been that way. The only way for this process to fail is for them to prevent the invention of time travel in the first place (by accident or design).

The signs of successful time traveling civilizations are places where you would expect an advanced civilization to have developed, but it inexplicably never happened.

^{* See "The End of Eternity" for an example. Also, handwave handwave handwave.}

*** "The signs of successful time traveling civilizations are places where you would expect an advanced civilization to have developed, but it inexplicably never happened." Realistically some form of civilization would arise in place of time escapees?(if you believe that in all place life can arise, life will, than one form life disappearing merely sets the stage for another) Also the premise is odd to me, are you implying that every single time traveling civilization is perfectly rational?

**** If they stay in the DC universe they inevitably prevent the invention of their time machine (see Larry Niven, /Theory and Practice of Time Travel/), because that's the only stable causal loop.

*** No, Krona's interference is literally responsible for the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Or evil. Or the Antimatter Universe, where narrativium is reversed and the heroes always lose.

It varies with every telling, really, but "entropy" is the one the fans have latched onto.

I don't think it's ever been an enemy, though. You're probably thinking of the time Krona returned from the dead as a supervillain called Entropy.

*** Meh. Multiple-timeline time travel is no harder to deal with than the EWG multiple-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. In fact the apparent paradoxes are very close parallels to the various edge cases in the multiverse model. You can't stop the prophecy because the prophecy benefits from quantum immortality too.

**** Multiple timelines raise the question of an exponential flood of time travellers from possible futures, or they require an implicit iterative single timeline.

Not disagreeing, just elaborating.

***** Handwave 1: Time travel lets you /create/ alternate timelines by staying in an evolving (unstable) causal loop. To the rest of the universe you disappear, but subjectively you have forever.

Handwave 2: Each time traveler kicks off his own sheaf of parallel worlds, unconnected with those of other time travelers.
