** thanks to [[/u/leakycauldron]] for coining the term vampire puberty and for suggesting this concept for the interlude. i'm really glad i made this reader-facing as it adds a lot of cool background to the story!

this is a quick series of vignettes about a vampire who is experiencing the changes of "vampire puberty" over the course of years as he slowly loses the ability to metabolise food.

also makes explicit that vampires can't live on animal blood because that makes me annoyed

VFL Fandom is split on whether vampires sparkle in the sun or simply burn
