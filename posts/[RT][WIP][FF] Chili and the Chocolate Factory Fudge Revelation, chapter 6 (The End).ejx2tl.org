*** It does kinda bring up an interesting dichotomy between the audience of a fiction and the audience of a news story.

Like out here in the real world, everyone /knows/ that Wonka's factory is a mystical, questionable wonderland - but in the fiction, nobody actually knows what's going on in there. We all know about the tour that the original five went on - but in the fiction, unless someone wrote a tell-all book afterwards, the only thing anyone would know about is the resulting injuries.

We all have an expectation (because this is a fiction) to eventually know the full details and inner lives of the characters involved; but if this were a news story, it would cut out at some point and the rest would remain a mystery.

*** I think it's a story about a boy getting invested in something he has no chances of solving, and what's the better point to end the story on than the moment when his newfound hope to win the lottery is crushed?

Of course, it's Teddy's work, and so there's meta layer about getting the readers invested in the universe we have no chances of seeing fully, because we know it's Teddy and it's going to end abruptly. However, I'm not sure if this meta layer is the main one, or if it's just being used as a means to put us in the shoes of Chili and the rest of approximately 7 billion losers better, because it feels to me the core theme is the danger of lottery narratives and, worse, lottery narratives masking themselves as something you have actual input on.

Obviously, this is the point, we're being robbed of a satisfying marble, etc, but I wonder what the point of the point is. There is a clear and deliberate parallel between Charlie Bucket and the author. They wrote a whole tirade about how him doing a thing makes him an awful person, and then did that exact thing. Why make the people reading this into a billion losers, so to speak? Why write a story where you, yourself, are the villain? Why /not/ just do literally anything else with your time?

Reading back over this, it sounds like I'm upset, but I'm honestly more confused than anything.

**** At least half the reason I like the ending rant is that it matches pretty closely to my experience. I've been off-and-on suicidal for probably half my life, and while that's gotten better in some ways over the years it's also gotten worse in other ways.

5Gpants really captures how I feel about marbles some of the time, and while 5Gpants isn't real, they were written by somebody who /is/ real; and while I know, on a rational level, that my experiences are not unique and there are many people who have or had a situation analogous to my own, the effect of that is nothing like the effect of knowing that /this particular person/, in order to write 5Gpants, had to be able to at least /imagine/ what it's like to feel these things, and that this particular person /can/ (though they won't, because we likely won't ever talk with each other) say, "I feel this. You are known."

EDIT: I also appreciate that the author effectively telegraphed "This story won't be finished" in the first chapter and, in that light, actually did more to "complete" the story than I actually expected. I thought the story would just go on hiatus forever until it was mysteriously deleted one day, but instead we got a closing device which at least attempts to capture something interesting (i.e. the outside perspective of the ordinary person who will never know what happens inside the factory).

I imagine it's how film critics feel when they like weird movies that no one else likes. Points for interesting.

** I never thought I'd ever read something that would make me genuinely go '/oh wow/' in, uh, six chapters. What an excellent ending, lmao. Definitely not the one I was expecting, but it's the one that makes the most sense, and quite possibly the best, most "realistic" take on the original Willy Wonka challenge I never thought I'd see.

"The point is not to make one winner but a billion losers" is /especially/ poignant. Who thought about the millions of disappointed young boys and girls spending all of their cash on chocolate bars to win some absurd candy lottery in the original book? /All/ of that tragedy and heartbreak, all those tears shed when the final golden ticket was found by some nothing kid who didn't put in near as much 'effort' as you or your friends did? Certainly not Dahl. When you put it in /that/ perspective, Wonka turns into a genuine fucking monster, lmao. Just, /mwah./

(Of course, 'that's not what Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was about,' but this /is/ a ratfic after all. Exploring aspects of the source material that were underappreciated and taking them to their logical conclusion is the entire point!)

My only gripe with this story is that I feel like the medium fundamentally takes a bit of oomph out of the ending -- seeing it marked as COMPLETE in six chapters when, IMO, /expecting/ another chapter and /not getting one/ because 'we're the losers' makes up a substantial part of the impact. But I guess if I saw a fic this short that did such a great job of worldbuilding and setting up a premise within its first two chapters, I'd be intrigued to see how it could "properly end" (lol) so abruptly. YMMV, I suppose.

--------------

And as a bit of a sidetrack I suppose, I found it pretty funny that the girl introduced last chapter would be the most likely to 'win' the Bucket challenge by force of narrative convention, as opposed to our seeming protagonist in Chili. Shy, likely good-hearted, with loving parents -- prime protagonist material. (Though I'd imagine Chili shoving her into a chocolate river or something when nobody was looking.)

So is the joy of anticipation -- of hopeful fantasy -- not enough to outweigh the bitterness of disappointment?

** Question for anyone still here:

Assuming this /is/ the final ending, do you think that gaizemaze is using this last conversation to paint themselves as Bucket, laughing at us for having the audicity to want to LIKE something and KNOW something?

Or do you think they're painting themselves as JUROR, choosing to end the story before common sense would dictate because they believe it makes a better story?

I'm having a hard time deciding.

On the one hand, the reference to JUROR is almost explicitly applicable as the author trying to defend themselves against the accusation of doing the same thing Bucket is.

On the other, the derision 5Gpants directs at Bucket for not giving any answer to /his/ riddle is just as applicable to the author of this work for getting us invested in the same riddle and then not giving us an answer either.

I keep re-reading it and flip-flopping back and forth between the two positions. Is the author trying to crush the marble by not revealing the answer, or to just make a better marble by ending the story?

Had this been a traditional story (e.g. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), the next thing that would have happened would have either been Chillenial Lee solving the puzzle, or Chili doing the same. The former was planning to reveal the secret behind the solution; the latter is our POV character and would have had to solve the riddle in front of us.

Chapter 5 ends "right right right before" the Bucket solution was going to be revealed. Check.

This chapter, being the end of a work tagged as "completed," tells us that we're never going to get an answer to the Bucket riddle. Check.

I can make an argument for why gaizemaze /is/ Bucket, or why he /is/ JUROR, but not for why he /isn't/ one or the other. I can't even think of an argument for why there's necessarily a distinction between the two.

So, why, then? Why do you think he's JUROR and not Bucket?

** Thank you. I enjoyed this. This was a good poem. Pretending to be a story is a surprisingly good replacement for rhyming and such.

** I rather enjoy this ending if that is what it is. The recent trend in fictions that play with the audience is enjoyable. It really shows a fickle and playful attitude from the author.

My only dislike with this series is that it doesn't work as well read aloud as the original Dahl books did. It's mostly the chatroom sequences that throw this out. I see their purpose, especially when they dictate the audience feelings, they just don't read aloud well and even feel a bit clunky in my head. Likely my personal bias showing.

** Brilliant, and way too real for me, ending. Shame we don't get to see any more of this world, but I enjoyed every bit of this strange adventure. Hope to read whatever this guy does next

** The best comparison I can think of is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmFfTJlIvhQ][Lucy and the football]]. At a certain point, it's Charlie Brown's fault. Like, what the hell did you expect man, put that pattern recognition to work.

I can't remember when, but after a certain point reading these stories I figured that if I was going to keep reading and enjoying I'd have to make peace with the fact that I'd be eating a lot of shit. And I think I've made that peace at this point. Given the chance to go back in time and stop myself from reading this, or any of Korridor I wouldn't do it. But, still. Good grief.

At one point, Teddy compared their stories to the opposite of pearls before swine, and I thought that was very apt. We're surrounded by pearls. We're drowning in pearls. Pearls are being produced at a fast enough rate that I could spend the rest of my life doing nothing but consuming pearls and not catch up. I'm several chapters or volumes or episodes or gameplay-hours on loads of pearls right now, but damn if I'm not reading this shit the moment I know it's available.
