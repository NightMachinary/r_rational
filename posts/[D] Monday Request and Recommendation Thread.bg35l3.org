Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Some manga:

- [[https://manganelo.com/chapter/actage/chapter_1][Act-Age]] - A girl tries out acting. She does a bit too well. Good story, great art, zero sexual anything so far.
- [[https://mangakakalot.com/chapter/dz918039/chapter_1][The Hero is Overpowered but Overly Cautious]] - A goddess isekaies a dude to defeat a demon lord. He only engages when he becomes able to apply massive overkill. Great art, isn't particularly rational like the description may suggest, doesn't take itself seriously.
- [[https://mangakakalot.com/chapter/xy918167/chapter_1][That Girl Is Not Just Cute]] - Wholesome teenage romance with no apparent overarching plot. Seems that the author just wanted to draw some dramatic face shots. The art is great too, so it works out well so far.

The protagonist actually takes reasonable precautions given his situation, and the mistakes he does make are reasonable for someone who doesn't know the meta-knowledge of the genre/narrative he's now in.

**** It has a little bit, but it's clearly being played for laughs, and the hero is in some ways going to nonsensical extremes - attempting to buy 3 sets of armour (a spare and a spare for the spare) is an amusing gag, except they can't carry that.

Ultimately, I don't think it's going to last for very long, because the author will rapidly run out of ways to use the concept for jokes. It's not a bad manga, but taking the concept more seriously could have been pretty neat.

***** Mad-Eye Moody is very hard to play very straight for very long, speaking as an author. Preparation competes for screen time with action; and readers will vary widely in what they think is good preparation, so it's impossible to satisfy them that you're depicting the character the way they think a Moody should be played; and the hindsight is very strong with them, so any loss or setback will automatically be blamed on you having not written Moody well.

Alternatively, forcing the Moody into situations where they /have/ to compromise/gamble, either due to lack of resources or information, or time. Then the Moody's failures aren't due to insufficient paranoia, but just... guessing wrong.

***** True, I'd like to think that the author is setting up for a joke with the third time he tries something like that (first being the armor, then the holy water) with the punchline being he was planning on using Rista's gate ability like an RPG's infinite inventory, which is why he doesn't see a problem with buying in bulk.

As for how long it'll last, I guess we'll see! I'm cautiously optimistic (lol) it'll figure something out, considering people were commenting it'd run out of material to joke about since chapter two, and it's still going strong.

** Just finished the first season of [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/34599/Made_in_Abyss][Made in Abyss]] yesterday, and would overall give a strong recommendation, excepting some... peculiar choices by the makers. Nothing overtly sexual, and if you're used to anime weirdness it's not too bad, but enough that I'd hesitate to recommend it to a typical friend.

Overall quality of the animation and sound design is incredibly high, and the story quite interesting, basically following two children on a quest to reach the bottom of [[https://i.imgur.com/dXRwiPm.jpg][a large fantasy dungeon]], leaving me excited for a follow-up. It does get darker and move violent as the season progresses, but not as bad as I'd been led to expect. If you could handle a somewhat more gruesome version of the [[https://fma.fandom.com/wiki/Nina_Tucker][Nina Tucker]] storyline from Fullmetal Alchemist, as well as graphic depictions of e.g. bones breaking and people being stabbed, you'd probably be fine.

I don't know if our culture is too accepting of extreme violence or too sensitive to sexual overtone, but it really does feel like there is an imbalance; nevertheless, both aspects would rule out showing this to normie friends for me.

**** I guess I must be desensitized to it by now, because I can't even think of what you guys are talking about when it comes to sexual jokes in Made in Abyss. I think i remember the kids being naked at some point because their clothes got dirty or destroyed, but I seem to remember that being like when Goku was naked in early Dragonball or when there's naked toddlers in diaper commercials -- it's assumed to be perfectly nonsexual, so they don't even bother with the "coincidental censorship" thing using steam, hair, etc. Was there something specific you guys were talking about that I'm not remembering? I remember their relationship being rather wholesome...

Regarding 7DS, I agree that that the random /squeezing/ in EP 1 was a bit much, but the show is worth continuing IMO. You should give it another chance unless even the smallest bit of provocative content is an issue for you, since this show has markedly less sexual humor than many other popular shows. For the record, Elizabeth is the only character he ever does something like that to and it turns out there's an important reason for that related to their character histories, so it's not as if he's doing it to a stranger, even if it may seem that way at first. The question of "why only her?" actually becomes a piece of evidence that there's something the viewer doesn't know yet about the relationship between those two characters and is even asked out loud by other characters in the show. It also leads the viewer's thoughts towards an important question and reveal later on in the story.

That said, I'm not going to defend the presence of sexual harassment in the show too far. I'm sure they could have cut it out and replaced it with something else to serve the same purpose which would make the story easier to recommend to your average western viewer, but in the current shounen anime industry, it seems stuff like that is practically required just to keep up with the competition since "everyone's doing it". It's just the medium-specific instance of "sex sells". The particulars may be a bit more offensive to western sensibilities than our own versions of this maxim, but a mismatch of sensibilities is a fairly common cross-cultural phenomenon.

***** In terms of sexual scenes in Made in Abyss that made me uncomfortable just from my own memory there was:

1. Shoving a ruler up Reg's ass
2. Teacher threatening to tie up Riko naked.
3. Scene showing Riko naked tied up hanging from the air and struggling to get free. (Yikes)
4. Adult character inspecting Reg's penis against his will.

In terms of 7DS I wouldn't be surprised if there was a reason for it and it got better later, but yeah groping a distressed unconscious girl regardless of past relationship is fucked up and made me not feel particularly endeared to the protagonist.

Normally I don't think I'm very sensitive to this kind of stuff, but man something about the casual brushing aside of sexual assault in 7DS just made me deeply uncomfortable.

****** Huh. While I don't remember the ruler instance, for whatever reason, my mind just isn't making the connection between Riko being tied up naked and anything sexual. I mean, she's a kid---a tomboyish one with a rebellious streak who has never displayed any awareness of mature male-female relations. So considering that she can't be grounded because she has to work and assuming that they don't want to just beat or whip her since it would be cruel or may prevent her from working or she wouldn't learn her lesson that way, an /embarrassing/ punishment seems at least understandable, if not reasonable, to me.

If she were older and more mentally or physically developed, or if the males around her were not little boys with zero sexual awareness, it would /absolutely/ not be okay. But because of her young age, the absence of the kind of "girly" reaction that sexually objectified female anime characters typically show during wardrobe malfunctions, and the artwork style that presents her as androgynously prepubescent child (her body shape is exactly the same as the boys'), it just doesn't feel like something offensive to me. More like naked toddlers in a diaper commercial or little naked village children running around in historical dramas.

Now I'm wondering how much of my current mentality is just a result of desensitization and how much of it is an objective judgement. I'd like to say that I'm able to make a rational distinction between nudity and sexualization and that you're needlessly conflating the two, but it is indeed a fact that the squeezing scene in 7DS didn't bother me /quite/ as much as it probably should have... Something to keep in mind for me going forward I guess.

******* I think part of the disconnect for you is because none of the characters in universe consider it sexual, you don't realize that the audience is fully supposed to view it as such. One of the main... appeals(/barf/) of lolicon is that the childlike characters are too innocent and naive to know certain actions or behaviors can be sexual. Framing can tell the audience how they're supposed to react to a scene independently from the way characters are reacting in that scene, and made in abyss lingers on scenes of nude children /waaaay/ too long for it to not be a bit questionable of the author's intentions.

Also, I don't remember how explicit is was in the anime, but in the manga, the strung up naked scene is /absolutely/ supposed to be viewed as sexual by the audience. [[https://s5.mkklcdnv5.com/mangakakalot/m1/made_in_abyss/vol1_chapter_1_lq_oath_town_at_the_edge_of_the_abyss/25.jpg][SUPER NSFW LINK, DO NOT CLICK ON UNLESS YOU'RE OKAY WITH SEEING A NUDE BUT BARELY COVERED BY HAIR LOLI]]. Wow I even forgot one of the characters told her 'you can't become a bride anymore' and 'you don't even have pubic hair! I'm not interested in you' until I looked this up again. I couldn't read ahead in the manga after the anime finished because I didn't want to read something with shit like this in it. And it /is/ worse and more apparent in the manga, but they didn't end up removing everything in the anime.

And don't get me wrong, I think Made in Abyss has a great story. You just have to divorce the story and characters from some of the unfortunate framing. But the the shota and loli stuff detracts from it way too much for me to ever recommend it to someone who wasn't a lolicon themselves or desensitized to light lolicon by other anime.

******** Wow, that just seriously changed my view on the subject. When watching foreign media, I always take difference in cultural sensibilities into account and try to draw conclusions about those foreign sensibilities from the differences between them and western (or I guess more accurately, American) media.

When I was a kid and was watching Dragonball for the first time, I remember being surprised in one scene where child Goku was fully naked and they even drew a few curves to represent the genitalia since I'd never seen that in western cartoons before. But when it wasn't taken seriously within the context of the show, I must have come to the conclusion that "if the character is below a certain age or level of physical maturity, anime/Japanese people consider their bodies benign and not worthy of sexually-motivated censorship". This notion was reinforced for me when I saw a similar lack of censorship for children within Studio Ghibli movies (Princess Kaguya comes to mind as an example).

I don't think that conclusion is necessarily wrong either, but you're right that I did completely ignore the framing. Part of that is probably that I don't have enough knowledge about the particulars of visual media to even have a firm concept of "framing" within my mind (I'll only ever notice production or directorial techniques if they literally slap me in the face as being really cool or unusual), but I also probably put a bit too much confidence in the explanation I'd come up with without attempting to verify or disprove it. I was even aware that "lolicon" is a thing in Japan, but I never made the connection between it and the stuff that I'd seen. I guess I just assumed it was some deviant subculture I wasn't in contact with rather than something that subtly permeated even mainstream anime.

I guess it doesn't help that I don't really hold strong conservative morals to begin with and have some contempt for political correctness and censorship. I think the main issue though is that I tend to immerse myself in the worlds of the stories I'm reading/watching and accept the norms and moral standards of those worlds unless there's something that /seriously/ offends my sensibilities (but if something ever gets bad enough to do that, it's usually not /meant/ to be acceptable even in-universe).

For example, in a story I read recently, the MC and his love interest got married at 13-14 years old, but that didn't bother me at all. That said, I would /never/ support something that like happening in America today. Similarly, I'll often cheer for a villain being killed by the MC even though I don't at all accept vigilantism and revenge killing within modern society. I don't think that's all that unusual though. Hanging an orphan up naked for breaking the rules seems plausible and reasonable within the circumstances of that orphanage in Made in Abyss, even though I'd never consider punishing a child in that way in reality, so I never really gave it any more thought.

Anyway, thanks for the response. You gave me a new way of looking at things, but I'm afraid you may have damaged my ability to immerse myself in what I'm watching from now on, since I probably won't be able to help myself from noticing these kinds of production techniques in the future... Cheers

I think for early Dragonball that's absolutely the case. The loli/shotacon undertones usually only come with certain specific types of shows and certain specific target demographics. Dragonball was a WSJ series, so mainly targeted at male teens. Which is why you get so many boob shots for Bulma instead. /Those/ are definitely sexual, but of course they are, they're targeted at kids at the kind of age at which seeing a female nipple makes your day.

Now, if you watch something like /No Game No Life/, for all that I think it's a really fun anime... yeah, all the lewd shots of Shiro, the 11 year old genius gamer girl? Those are totally lolicon.

SDS imho is a pretty bad offender because it's not just a joke, it's also really unfunny. I don't mind immoral things happening for the sake of comedy - which is in general the case with groping or sexual harassment jokes. But usually you still get the sense that the author /disagrees/ with those things. Even good ol' Muten Roshi from early Dragonball would usually get his just desserts for trying to cop a feel, he was more like the Wile E. Coyote of perversion than anything else. In SDS, Meliodas just keeps groping girls, and he's supposed to be a heroic protagonist. He's not even really ever called out for it, nor suffer any consequences. It's just "haha groping is funny because boobs".

It is a mostly-rational fic with a few aspects of rationalism as flavor. Bob basically dies, becomes a corpsesicle, and re-awakens in a dystopian future as the property of a morally reprehensible government. The world is going to hell due to the damage humanity has done to it. The world is abusing corpsicles to create electronic slaves for use in exploring the universe for potential colony sites.

**** The Bobiverse books are pretty good as long as you're not taking the sci-fi too seriously, because some of the things that are treated as "whoa" moments in the novels basically table stakes in other hard sci-fi.

The other thing to keep in mind about Bobiverse is that Bob's not that smart, and he never really puts a lot of effort in to getting smarter. Sure, he's able to jack up his personal frame rate and spend longer periods of time thinking, but he never improves himself so that he can think better.

This may be an intentional choice by the author, because the versions of Bob that /do/ improve themselves in order to think better tend to stop being point of view characters and become Q-like "here's a new gadget for you have fun" supporting characters real quick.

**** The premise of Symbiote is as follows:

The Alien Argeon crash landed in area 51, and was approached by the US government. In exchange for assistance repairing it's ship, the alien gave the US government some alien technology. The key technology is a sentient, symbiotic organism that pairs with a human, giving that human a set of powerful new abilities. Once the ship was repaired, the government attempted to prevent the alien from leaving, and shot it down upon takeoff.

Our story follows the protagonist Bob as he discovers that he has a symbiote named Frank. With the government in pursuit, Bob attempts to use his new ally and newfound abilities to protect himself and discover how deep the rabbit hole goes.

The story has great action, a fast moving plot, creative use of a unique powerset, fairly rapid power creep, and decent dialogue. However, I would hesitate to call the story anything more than rational-adjacent. I would say this is a nice light read, entertaining and passingly well written for a fanfic.

The premise of Set in Stone is clearly explained in the prologue located [[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/backstory-revamped-into-prologue/][here]].

This story is extremely well written in my opinion, with the care and attention needed to craft a truly rational fiction. The farm-centric Stonepunk nature of this fic is extremely unique and well done. The main character and supporting cast are simultaneously simple country folk and complex, intelligent, multifaceted characters.

The main conflict in the fiction is logically coherent and yet comes off a little wooden at times. The conflict is part morality play, part rationalist experiment, a mainstay of rational fiction that remains an very difficult feature to fit into well written and well paced story.

While Symbiote is entertaining and worth a look, Set In Stone is a grand slam of a rational fiction. I think it deserves a place on the podium if I were to rank my favorite "rational" fictions.

***** Just binged set in stone after the top level recommendation. While I enjoyed it, I would not give it nearly the full throated endorsement you just did. The world building is amazing and the conflict and actions are indeed excellent examples of rational story writing with people who have well defined goals and pursue them in ways that make sense. But the dialogue. My God the dialogue. The author seemingly does not understand the idea of subtext. Everything, and I mean everything, is explicitly spelled out for the reader. There is zero trust that we can figure things out from context. It's written like it's for an alien that doesn't quite understand how human social dynamics work but is trying really hard to learn. And the fact of that matter is that VERY little happens. The entire plot of this story would be handled in the first 50 pages of some novels. Given how awesome the world was, the fact that so little happened felt like kind of a waste, like the author came up with s great universe and then couldn't figure out quite what to do with it.

Like I said, I enjoyed it and I would recommend it to fans of rational fiction, but it definitely has some glaring flaws.

And having been the one that recommended symbiote a few weeks ago, I have to say that these flaws seem to be a hallmark of his works. His world building and creativity are amazing, and his ability to write characters with clear goals who work towards them sensibly is great. But he needs to start work-shopping his dialogue or something. It's an unfortunate weak point in otherwise excellent examples of rational fiction.

****** I would second this criticism, and extend it from dialogue into the descriptions used. Not only is every thought and idea communicated explicitly and at length, it seems like every single action the main character takes is broken down and listed step. by. step.

Sometimes this is good, but after finishing a sequence describing a trip to a bathhouse and being treated to a lengthy paragraph on how /exactly/ the MC wrapped his towel and was careful to make sure his cameltote bag (which, by the way - boy did I misread that the first few times) was closed in exactly the right way...well.

  Does anyone have any recommendations for Audible?
#+end_quote

I really like the [[https://www.audible.com/series/Cradle-Audiobooks/B07GVRN95T][Cradle]] series and the [[https://www.audible.com/series/The-Travelers-Gate-Trilogy-Audiobooks/B00ZJ2XR18][Traveler's Gate]] series, both by Will Wight. I'd had Cradle recommended on this subreddit and really enjoyed it.

They're not Urban Fantasy like that Rivers of London series (which I quickly looked up), but the narrators for both are really good, especially Cradle. I'm rec'ing mostly because it's this sub, not because it's explicitly similar.

Though, [[https://www.audible.com/series/The-Dresden-Files-Audiobooks/B005NB2IG0][The Dresden Files]] seems more similar to Rivers of London, being both Mystery and Urban Fantasy. The audiobooks for that are supposed to be really good, and I really need to get around to reading/listening to the series.

--------------

Cradle is the only actually good Xianxia that I've read, and is really quite rational. The world makes sense, and all the characters try their best to solve their problems, and the main character often ends up solving things by being clever rather than raw power, since he's usually a lot weaker than everyone else. Definitely one of my favorite series now.

(Xianxia magic is generally improving your magical core to perform magic, often by using the magic of the world, while also improving your body. There's a ton of really bad awful tropes in the genre though, and every one is trash except for Cradle, which is amazing. I know, because I tried a bunch after reading Cradle, and they sucked.)

Traveler's Gate is also very good. It's much more Western in magical style. Not in the classical, DnD, do-anything Wizard, but like how various different Western magical fiction all have unique somewhat limited (in comparison to a do-everything wizard) magical systems. This trilogy is currently finished, though there will probably be future books at some point. This narrative arc is complete, anyway, and the series feels very well put-together.

I agree for the most part, but I have a few recommendations based off you liking Cradle.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/][White Collar Cultivator]] was pretty good with an everyman character isekaied into a generic wuxia world and with him digging into the mental differences between mortals and cultivators. He's basically using common-sense and his mastery over bureaucracy to stay alive. Unfortunately, WCC is dead so you might not like the abrupt ending.

You've probably already read [[https://www.amazon.com/Sufficiently-Advanced-Magic-Arcane-Ascension-ebook/dp/B06XBFD7CB][Sufficiently Advanced Magic]], but the power levels of Xianxia is very evident in the books and I think it's adjacent to the genre even if it's missing the Asian cultural influences.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][The Dao of Magic]] is a fantastic story about a man from Earth who seeks out to scientifically investigate Qi and wants to completely rebuild cultivation society into one where everyone isn't back-stabbing each other all the time.

***** I've tried all three stories you mentioned here.

White Collar Cultivator was definitely one of the better ones, but I got bored after a while. Kinda started to feel weird, since the main character had very little control over his own life. It didn't feel as story-like either, since it's a quest. I feel no desire to continue reading it, and I have no idea where I stopped (it didn't make much of an impact on me). Was interesting, but didn't feel very rational.

Sufficiently Advanced Magic was pretty good, but didn't feel like a Xianxia. Felt a lot more like Western Fantasy, and somewhat more like a gamer fic, in how it's [[/r/progressionfantasy][r/progressionfantasy]]. It's pretty good, and I do recommend for people to try it out if its synopsis sounds interesting to them. It's much better than a gamer fic though. I've already bought the sequel, but haven't read it yet. That said, it's not as good as Cradle and Traveler's Gate, in my opinion.

The Dao of Magic was absolute trash. I managed to read until chapter 25, I think, but I don't even know how I got that far. The best way to describe this fic is [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]]. The main character is awful and his intellectualism is more like a parody of one. It's a wankfest in how he can feel good about himself and being so amazing. The world itself feels dumb as hell and not rational at all. And around where I dropped it he started acting /even worse/, being /even less rational/. I fucking hate this fic and it was a waste of time reading what I did of it. A good premise though.

I Shall Seal the Heavens was decent (I finished the first section of it, I think). It's magic system is supposed to be somewhat decent, though it's not nearly as good as Cradle. My Disciple Died Yet Again started okay and just got worse. I read through the beginning of the third arc. I also tried skipping and reading arcs further along, and they were even worse.

What else? I'm currently following the Forge of Destiny rewrite on RoyalRoadl and it's okay enough to follow, but not that amazing. More down to earth than ISSTH. There was another fic in the ISSTH-verse that I tried and dropped. Savage Divinity on RoyalRoadl ended up kinda weird and I dropped it.

I know I tried other stuff too, but these are some that really spring to mind. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Cradle is far and beyond the rest; it's unbelievable.

Have you tried [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Forty-Millenniums-of-Cultivation/][Forty Millenniums of Cultivation]]? I was hesitant to recommend it because it had such a generic start to set up the tropes of Xianxia to have them be subverted later in the story. I feel that it only really begins to shine around a few chapters before the end of Volume 1 which is roughly around chapter 95. Even then it's a slow change as the world-building gets more and more developed.

You can read about when it was recommended to this subreddit [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4_rt/][here]].

The gameplay isn't particularly engaging and I'm not attached to the story, but I'm still enjoying it for the great and abundant worldbuilding. And even though I hate magical realism with a burning passion, in certain contexts I really appreciate it when a story drops evocative, fantastical aspects about the world but doesn't try to explain them much.

As an example, a passenger on my aether engine just told me about how the queen defeated the tyrant suns and acquired a treasure trove of time, which she uses for her own immortality as well as to reward to her faithful supporters for loyal service. My passenger hopes to be able to afford a small quantity of time once she retires, to stretch out her days of leisure. Very cool, right?

I think that /Set In Stone should/ be in way more people's top five rational fiction lists. His combination of modern scientific structure, anachronistic farm life, and lifelike character narration are priceless. Unlike many rational fics, this one has a happy and fulfilling ending.

It knows when to cut off the story, when another author would have bloated the work with an enjoyable but ultimately plot-irrelevant set of additional chapters following the building of the main character's farm. This isn't to say that this story is short on worldbuilding, or that I wouldn't love reading about the main character's continuing story.

***** Correct. I have rarely been able to find enough time to write in the last couple years due to being an OTR truck driver and working 70-80+ hours a week.

My typical writing style is to write in large blocks, anywhere from 8 to 20 hours at a time.

That is very, very hard to do in my current job. I live in a tractor trailer six weeks at a time, and my days off are pretty much jammed with non-driving things that I must do. There's also the patent.

Le Sigh.

It's even worse now than before, since I own the truck that I am driving. However, there are a couple potential changes in my life that I am working towards.

I have hammered out most of the issues in the patent application and will be continuing it 'in-part' soon, which will allow me to sidestep a lot of the worst pedantic non-issues that are being seized upon by the examiner (it's their job. Still annoying.) If I can get that patent, I suspect I can wrangle my way into rapid retirement with it, while still ensuring it actually gets exploited and not buried.

Failing that, I may also be able to start taking winters off once the truck is paid off. Winter roads are more dangerous, fuel is winterized and less efficient due to additives, and mileage rates drop in the last half of winter, so I won't be losing a great deal if my truck is paid off.

Stopping driving is not an option. I'm addicted to the road now. Even if I no longer drive commercially, I will have a RV or large cab truck and travel the country to see some of the incredible beauty from closer than the main roads.

I have also been listening to a LOT of audiobooks, and considering how they were written. From bad to good. I have recently finished a series where the author had a tendency to write very, very stilted, unrealistic, conversation. This is a problem I know I have had in the past, and one thing I need to address when I start writing again.

That said, I have definitely been working over my next story fairly extensively in my head. It's a return to the Reject Hero universe from the viewpoint of a powered individual with a body like a amalgam of Plastic Man and a clay Michelin man. His most powerful ability is his appetite. I fully intend it to be rational, but not rationalistic.

When I finally do get extended time to write, I fully expect to web-publish the rough story at a rather high rate of speed.

However, I cannot say when that will be.

I also need to find a medium to write in. Most forums are garbage to write in, and Google Docs is even worse. Wordpress made a lot of changes that I really do not like since I last wrote original works actively. There was a site called Jukeboz or something like that which looked interesting, but they shut down.

When it starts looking like I might have time to write regularly again, I will start seriously looking at somewhere to publish a blogfic.

- I was quite impressed at the hard-sci-fi-ish quantitative details! I don't know how much general preferences vary on this, but I found that the detailed weights/dimensions/considerations were specified much more than I expected, but they were not generally too intrusive, and seemed more or less reasonable when I stopped to consider/imagine the details. That must have been a lot of work!
- The reason I stopped reading was that I found it very hard to stomach the setup of the virtual world; once we saw Bob entering it post-arrest, it sounded a whole lot like a big single-instance superhero MMO (with private sublocations, sure). That seemed to me to be a very strange turn of events, and while upon reflection there were a few places (especially later in the story) where it seemed very difficult to find Watsonian explanations for characters' actions, this particular surprise seemed very hard to justify even on a Doylist level.

I mostly agree, but I'd argue that MC!Voldemort's seemingly insane approach to human interaction in this fiction actually makes a ton of rational sense given his background.

He was handed off to an orphanage, and raised in a world where magic isn't real. Then eventually some dude comes by and tells him "Hey actually magic /is/ real and also you're going to a magic school". He's then taken to a magic school, which is essentially an entirely different reality.

With *that* as your background, why would you assume that other things can't be real? Why spend time fighting people about some particular impossibility? Just accept that they believe it to be true, and act as if it were for the purposes of the current conversation.

If Lockhart claims to have defeated vampires in Albania while at the same time fighting wendigos in Australia, then what's more likely? He's lying, or he's somehow managed to cast a spell that allows him to duplicate his body? When magic is involved, it's genuinely impossible to know - so you're best off assuming the worst case.

I did it by downloading the Harry Potter-specific zip from [[https://archive.org/details/fanfictiondotnet_repack][fanfiction.net-repack]] and finding the single story in it.

For now, I have about 13 gigabytes of Harry Potter fanfiction downloaded to my computer and if there is anyone else who wants to look for a deleted story, I'm willing to look it up and share them if I have it. I'll probably delete them in a week or two. Make sure to include the author with the title if possible as well.

I'm not taking down the story I spent time looking for though. That link's staying up there for as long as possible.

Shame it ends mid-crescendo though.

** How does everyone keep track of updates on the various fics they read?

Some stuff gets posted here, but other stuff I've enjoyed does not. For instance, I'm now up to fate with WTC, PGTE, A Bad Name, Birds of a Feather, and half a dozen other fics scattered across fanfic sites, blogs, and forums. I've no idea how to keep track of it all.

I'm worried I'm going to keep reading fics until I get up to date, then forgetting they exist because I'm not aware of the updates.

*** WTC + Birds of a Feather are on AO3 which mean you can make an account and Subscribe to them for email notifications. Same thing for Spacebattles (A Bad Name). There's Watch Thread options for email notifications only when the author posts.

I think PGTE requires RSS, but if you frequent this sub, you're not going to forget it exists. But if you really want to track the gamut, set up an RSS feed for the compatible sites and use something like [VisualPing](visualping.io) to detect webpage changes for obscure sites.

**** I'm pretty sure it's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][this fic]], a Harry Potter fanfic with a rational-ish Tom Riddle protagonist and Ravenclaw Hermione.

It has some similarities to Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation or Applied Cultural Anthropology, and to Tabloid in the Spacebattles Worm fandom.

*** Since I'm a pack-rat when it comes to data, I usually download them to Calibre with the plugin FanFicFare. This way, I can be sure that I won't forget that they exist as long as they are in my library. I also favorite/follow the stories by using my accounts on fanfiction.net, ao3, SV, and SB. For any webnovels on a website like WordPress, they almost always have an RSS feed to keep track of.

The stuff that I usually have trouble following are webcomics since I follow so many that I dislike cluttering my emails with so many RSS feeds, so I just keep a list to bookmark and check in manually every few weeks to see what has updated.

*** I use RSS feeds for standalone sites and webcomics, and the alerts/subscription lists of other sites. This works very well for almost all of them. It means I have to check 5 different sites overall, but since they all show chronological order it's trivial to see which are new updates and which are old, and there's nothing forcing me to check every site at once.

The sole exception is AO3 which lacks native chronological ordering of subscription updates - for this, I use an [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extension-of-our-own/jpnkcocpogjbiihgcdionhcabgakcdgo][extension]], which does a pretty good job (but takes a little while to load.)

** [[https://www.choiceofgames.com/deathless/][Deathless]] on choice of games is a fun choose your own adventure with diabolical contract lawyers.

It isn't particularly rational but it is fun to play through. Most of the games on choice of games only give you the first installment free. I think this one is free for the first playthrough.

Is it this book, [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H1TQGC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Deathless]] by Catherynne M. Valente?

The title seems to match, but it doesn't look like it involves diabolical contract lawyers?

** Today I read through a lot of the /I'm a spider, so what?!/ manga (there's also a light novel). And it's really fun! It's basically a story about a girl getting transported in an RPG world in the form of a low-level spider. From there on she munchkins her way up the food chain (and the levels of the dungeon she's in). A bit of cleverness, a lot of humour, and a scrappy protagonist you really want to root for. It's a very enjoyable ride.
