Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** Most stories about simulated realities have the simulation being done on some kind of supercomputer and/or the people's own dreams. A much more interesting story would be people being emulated on a non computer substrate- for example, [[https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/470007b39d192]] (one of the most underrated stories I've read). Imagine one day, everyone starts having their thoughts jumbled and objects malfunction or disappear from reality, because a ship's engines blowed some plants around.
