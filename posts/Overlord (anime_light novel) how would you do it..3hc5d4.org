So recently I saw the new anime Ovelrod, read the manga, read the light novel and was disappointed about how incompetent nearly all characters are. Especialy the main ones.

If you were in place of Momonga (a level 100 lich with a full guild of lvl 100 loyal NPCs taken to a fantasy world very at first glance no one more powerfull then lvl 60 existed) how would you proceed?

Would you try the world conquest? What would be the first steps

*** It's not so much him losing his morals, as him losing his ability to feel strongly about anything for more than a few seconds and him valuing his mostly evil minions and guild higher than anything else in the world. He is willing to sacrifice people for his people's wellbeing and isn't bothered by instincts like revulsion anymore.

He also can't just hole up in his guild, because some of his hundreds of minions need food and the building regularly eats money to work.

Read the lightnovel instead of the manga, it contains more information: [[http://skythewood.blogspot.sg/p/knights-and-magic-author-amazake-no.html]]

*The Following contains vague spoilers up to volume 6*

Current goals:

#+begin_quote
  Find other world-travellers
#+end_quote

- He plans to make the name of his guild known world-wide

  - As of volume 6 he has told a total of one surviving person that name. That one probably told the local king.
  - I'm not quite sure if he said his name while someone was spying on him, I think he didn't.

#+begin_quote
  Gain more income than he requires upkeep
#+end_quote

- He and a single of his minions are posing as adventurers.

  - Please note that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of intelligent minions, a large part of which are more powerful than any single mortal known so far in the story. At least a dozen have human forms.
  - Some ideas I had for making money: Hiring some out as top-class mercenaries, plain banditry, locating ore veins and mining via superior magic, killing dragons and stealing their hoards, taking over some remote countries and taking their taxes, gating/teleporting into vaults and taking all money.

#+begin_quote
  Produce consumables
#+end_quote

- They are starting to production of low-level scrolls and potions. Some efforts toward food-production are made.
- Some consumables simply cannot be created, because they were bought with cash instead of in-game.

I think your brain fizzled out there.

***** Possible. It was the third time I tried to write that post because I somehow accidentally lose my posts on reddit extremely easily. Also, it wasn't really something I thought about previously. I think he told the village in the beginning, Gazef, the lizardpeople, most recently that one maid... and I can't think of anyone else at the moment.

******** Really? Oh. Back when I wrote that I was thinking there was some sort of grammar mistake because it felt like there was something missing or out of place in terms of sentence structure. I was tired, so I must have made a mistake. Or do quotes automatically edit themselves if you correct the original post?

** I'd probably do the same in the beginning, but after rescuing the top warrior and close confidant of the king I would probably continue getting closer to the kingdom under the guise of the powerful magician.

The kingdom is kind of desperate because of the Empire that wants to conquer it, as well as because of corrupt nobles etc. At the same time the King and that one Princess already have plans to improve the kingdom, they simply can't do them because the nobles are too powerful.

By helping the Princess I would slowly try to gain more power in the kingdom and maybe take it over. With the overwhelming might of the guild it might also be reasonable to start conquering the Empire instead of being conquered by it, depending on how much of my power I would be willing to reveal.

At the same time I would have the various minions play spies and earn a lot of money. Many of them are more powerful than anything else so far in the story. Even if they encounter an enemy too powerful for them, some can create teleport gates within seconds and most can communicate instantly via scroll or spell. There are few actually dangerous scenarios, from what has been revealed in the story so far.

How so? Anime-only watcher, haven't really seen anything that points to any of the characters being incompetent. Altough it might be a little difficult to discuss it considering i haven't gone through the source material.

*** I was probably exagerating. The basic ideas of his plan (gather info, hid the base, try to enjoy life as an adventurer) are the same as what I would do.

It is just sometimes the executions of those in later chapters (show all your NPCs full power to a village when you said it is better to hide our true strenght, not trying to learn new magic/martial skill to see if you can level up)

**** Keep in mind that he didn't know how strong his enemies were, so he went full power from the beginning to avoid getting murdered if they were as strong or stronger than he is. That seems the rational choice to me.
