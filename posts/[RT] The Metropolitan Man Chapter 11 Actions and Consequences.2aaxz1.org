** Yay! I was sad for a moment when there was no chapter on Sunday, and then the chapter came out and now I'm happy. Good work.

I found Lois Lane's response to discovering that [[#s][spoiler]] pretty chilling, and her character all story has struck me as cynical but realistic. Having Lois on Lex's side will make things that much harder for Superman.

I'm excited for the finale, in particular because the dramatic tension makes any degree of resolution seem possible, ranging from Superman / Lex / Lois dying or getting exiled, to the complete destruction of humanity. I could even see Superman getting "redeemed", in however many ways that could play out.

***** Superman dies, victim of a clever plot from Lex where a still unaware Lois has a critical role. That's the expected part to say the least.

But the realisation of the plan makes Lois understand Lex is not the good guy in the story, nor is she. She gets to appreciate what a great gift for mankind could Superman have been if only mankind had been ready, if people like her and Lex had done more to help it mature than taking advantage of its flaws (sensalionist and crime lord are not exactly jobs improving the world).

Then mankind keeps on being stupid and starts world war 2.

***** My concern is that I don't see how the story can end without seeming either rushed or cheap.

I can only think of two endings that would really make sense: Lex kills Superman, or Superman gets sick of us and flies off into space.

Option 2 is unsatisfying and seems out of character. Superman is pretty well defined by his desire to be human and his (few) connections to humanity. I don't see him discarding those.

Option 1 is the more obvious one, but it feels either rushed or cheap. Superman has senses out the wazoo and moves so fast that light stands still. The Kryptonite would have to shut him down instantly (which it typically doesn't), or he could run out of range and then fry his attacker with a look. And if it were an instant-win button, then the entire story would boil down to "Superman is invincible! Oh no, oh no, oh no...oh wait. Ok, fixed it."

On the other hand, you've done a great job so far, so I'm sure you'll come up with something interesting.

***** I'm not sure, I'm enjoying being immersed in the world so far, and reading about the behind the scene machinations. Perhaps it's more a feeling of not wanting the immersion to end, rather than wondering how it will all be resolved.

And as [[/u/EndlessStrategy]] says, any opinions from us might ruin the suspense!

***** An interesting feature of the story has been how we have not been in Superman's head except for what he has shared with Lois. I think it might be interesting to see how he thinks . . . if that's even possible from the way this story is told.

Frankly, I could see the story going pretty much any way and still being satisfied with it. It's not the destination, it's been the journey. As others have expressed, the world has been very engrossing. I'm a little disappointed that it will finish so "soon", but that's just my normal reaction to reaching the end of any good book.

***** Um, my whole life I've just consumed literature uncritically so I'm not sure I'm qualified to tell you how it should end. For me, the joy is in seeing how someone else thinks it should end, someone who writes well.

Superman could be defeated, killed, imprisoned, put into stasis, brought down a few pegs, neutralised completely, replicated, converted, sent packing, caused to abandon us, used to defeat an unexpected existential crisis, joined by more kryptonians, any of those or other things that I haven't thought of and I'm sure I'd enjoy it if it was written well.

Is that weird? Am I literarily challenged if I would be satisfied by such a broad list of endings this late in the fic?

***** I'm not sure about the rest of it, but I want someone to explain to Superman why he needs to be neutralized. It may not be practical in real life of course, and rational fic is all about practicality, but it doesn't feel fair to punish someone without explaining why they're being punished.

***** 1. A big confrontation between Lex and Superman. Just as a lot of the fun of HPMOR is Voldemort interacting with Harry, your story would be a lot more fun with those two interacting.

2. A tie up of several storylines- Lex murdering Superman's mom, Superman's change in morality, Lois' hate for Superman, the government's response to superman.

3. People not behaving stupidly. It's very obvious to us as readers that Lois Lane trying to kill Superman would be a very bad idea, and that Lex's actions have been far too aggressive towards superman- not taking care of the boss criminal, killing his mother, the bombings. The world getting notably worse because the supposedly intelligent people made no effort to avoid emotionally attacking the alien god would be bad.

*** I think she is very reasonable. Reacting with fear to a being literally taking her life in his hands for a thrill ride seems a more natural response than becoming an infatuated little girl, at least for an intelligent woman. I don't really agree with how she blames him for not saving the world 24/7, because if superman started as an evil warlord than everybody would be pretty ok with that person deciding to be a normal guy for a while instead. But in the end it would be a lot stranger for me that a mentally healthy woman would expect to have a serious, balanced relationship with someone who is, for all intents and purposes, a god.

**** I agree with you and [[/u/Yxoque]], blaming Superman seems wrong, but her fear is reasonable. And her actions are consistent with her persona and the context.

But I'm more questioning her role, her existence as a character. She's clever, but not as much as Lex, nor powerful, resourceful enough to match either of the protagonists. She's manipulated by Lex, and the object of infatuation of Superman. As far as we can see now, there's no way she's gonna be anything by 'herself', she's trapped in a weak condition and was trapped from the very beginning.

I cant decide if that means her character is only a device, not actually a person, but a way to help make a story for rational!lex and human!superman, or her character is meant to give us a taste of what it would be like to be caught in the clash of two superpowers.

****** I cant agree to call her "clever" when her most recent actions will cause deep emotional damage to an already emotionaly unstable god. In her current situation, she can expect only two outcomes of her actions: either Superman will learn the truth at some point and experience the heady feeling of betrayal at her hand, or she's gonna have to hide the truth forever. Whichever is most likely...

***** I'm not entirely sure why she has to have a purpose as a character in the story. As a rational fanfic, I see a merit in being handed a cast and simply explaining a rational progression given a set of physical laws governing the hero's powers and a choice of psychological profile for each cast member.

In that perspective, Lois doesn't have any more "purpose" as a character in a story than I do. She is a person that exists and was singled out in the original work, so it makes sense to include her in the rational fic regardless of her literary role.

*** I can understand most of her actions and thoughts. Fear of Superman is, in my opinion, a pretty reasonable result. But blaming Superman for not saving the world non-stop is pretty wrong. It's not like she is constantly doing everything she can to make the world a better place. She still has social encounters and fun things in her life. Sure, Superman doesn't /strictly/ need food or sleep, but it makes him feel more comfortable. I can imagine that being Clark Kent is part of what keeps him sorta sane.

I don't think that actions like [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-3/page-40-2/][this]] (spoilers for the webcomic Strong Female Character) can be expected just because a character has superpowers. We tend to believe that humans (and by extension, sapients) deserve to feel comfortable.

Also lots of her thoughts raise questions in my mind in the ramifications of society if there were no privacy beyond thoughts, everyone could see through walls and hear anything. Certainly no crimes beyond crimes of passion, but everything else is quite interesting.
