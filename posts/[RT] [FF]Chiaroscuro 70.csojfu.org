*** I did not write as it have been often posted before here. This was to notify that the new chapter is up.

It is the standard Naruto fanfic but people are LVL 1 intelligence and Kakashi is the best troll I have seen in fiction so far. Not troll as in "Lol I'm so random", but as in "He has a method to his madness and carefully prepares stuff and then blames it on luck."

World politics in a ninja world are also among the best I have seen in naruto fanfics.

*** It's been posted here before.

It's a Naruto fan fic focused on shikamaru. The fic uses world building established late in the anime to make a more coherent rendition of the story. The characters behave intelligently, and the story explores the intricacies of human mental health through subtle side plots.

** I hadnt seen it update since chapter 67 so I got a delightful bunch of chapters to read through.

For two of those I kept on mixing this with The Need to Become Stronger, cosntantly worried about how The Enemy was working his plans. When I remembered that was from another story I reread the chapters.

I find myself worried about several things. Fuu, I now believe he is merely a smokescreen or distraction for Danzo's real plans. Possibly suborning a different clan altogether, or just to keep Kakashi and co occupied.

Secondly, Ino's section just threw up so many red flags. From the chekhov's gun of her moral dilemma argument with Shikamaru, to the whole introspection about freedom. I feel like Tobi wants Kakashi to become Hokage.

Furthermore, I find it disturbing that Kakashi and the Hokage didnt look into Kakashi's sudden lack of recall as something worth investigating.

The tension is creeping higher and higher but I love it so much.

I read it as it was put in by the Tsuande under hokage orders during the operation. It was the only time when kakashi was vulnerable enough.

Fuu is probably a distraction to occupy people attention. Even if you know that he ia a distraction you still need to spend time thinking about him in all your moves.

Except it occurs in Ch 68 and Kakashi doesnt have surgery until Ch 69. In fact it was part of the conversation of the Hokage ordering Kakashi to get the procedure done.

Yeah, that's what I thought too
