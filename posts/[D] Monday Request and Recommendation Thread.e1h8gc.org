Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/do0x61/rt_c_ff_demonology_and_the_triphasic_model_of/][It's been recommended here before]], but not in a Monday Request and Recommendation thread, so I'll throw it out:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593][Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach]] is a fanfic of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens_(TV_series)][Good Omens]] TV series, though I've only read the books and didn't miss much.

The premise: After the events in the book, mostly everyone "normal" forgets about the almost-apocalypse. Crowley and Aziraphale move in together. However, Crowley still gets flashbacks to when he drove to Aziraphale's book shop and found it in flames with his partner nowhere nearby. At his partner's urging, he books an appointment with psychotherapist Aubrey Thyme. The story is told from her PoV, and is rational - perhaps even rationalist - in that the characters have their own consistent personalities and goals, their own hangups, and strategies.

The story uses the therapist's PoV very well, in that it talks about the current state of psychotherapeutical research and common strategies. The beginning was especially amusing, because Thyme is a very sharp and observant person, but she has /absolutely/ no frame of reference to approach a literal demon with.

The book managed to keep my interest throughout, and I almost read it in one sitting. It sticks the landing, too, and leaves the characters with a satisfying conclusion.

Fully understand: very little - you find out about all the relevant background information as Aubrey does. There /is/ something that Crowley refuses to tell her and you never find out what it is in the story, but it's not required.

Appreciate: you will not appreciate this story unless you've either read Good Omens or watched the recent miniseries. It is fan wank of the highest caliber, giving closure to a story you didn't even realize needed it.

**** Hm, Crowley and Aziraphale's arc is roughly half the story. That would be required knowledge. The second half is barely touched on at all.

I'll put the relevant bits in spoiler:

After the Earth was created 6000 years ago, Crowley was the snake who tempted Eve into eating the apple of knowledge. Aziraphale was the Angel who guarded the gate to Eden through which Adam and Even were exiled; he gave them his flaming sword. They were then sent out by respectively Heaven and Hell to keep tabs on humans and further their respective sides' agenda. However, they both came to... apprechiate Humanity, and each other's company, more than their superiors.

Azi set up a bookstore, while Crowley had an apartment. Both often met up during their tasks, tipping each other off about bullshit their bosses were pulling, small favours like that.

So when Crowley gets the task to start the apocalypse, the Final Battle, he and Aziraphale work together to stop it. I /think/ in the TV show they have an argument about running away from earth to Alpha Centauri, but I'm not quite clear on it, it wasn't in the book but is referenced in the fic.

Then Azi is sent to heaven while his bookstore is burnt down by a Witch hunter, and Crowley arrives on the scene to find the store burning and his friend missing. Later, they meet up and stop the apocalypse (part of the second half of the plot which is irrelevant for the fic).

In the end Heaven and Hell try to execute them via respectively holy water and hellflame for being traitors, butt hat fails, because they switched bodies and thus were immune to the chosen execution method (this is not in the book, but I looked it up because it is relevant for the fic). Now everyone is afraid of them because they don't know /what/ they are, and leaves them alone.

***** My issue was 2-fold: firstly, it feels like 3/4 of the book is internal monologue and/or dialogue between characters rehashing how terrible they are and all the terrible things they have done and figuring out how to move past it and live their lives anyways. On it's own, it's an interesting idea, but it seems like that is the arc of EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER. It gets old pretty fast and means that not very much actually happens, despite the book being pretty long.

My second issue is probably less generalizable: part of what I really liked about the series was the descriptions of interesting/novel ways of using the magic system, which is nearly entirely absent from the last book.

I'm not mad I read it or anything, and the story feels relatively finished, which is nice, but it was definitely a LARGE drop off in quality compared to the earlier books in the series.

****** This one can kinda be explained because Rain apparently did something very risky/dumb when he got a rare class and overmana'ed, which allows him to learn really fast. So he can mentally min/max his build mentally because the hardest part is remembering the calculations, not the calculation themselves.

I kinda doubt they don't know math because you need math for all sorts of things: construction, finance, trade, cooking, medicine, manufacturing, tax collection, just off the top of my head. Though I think they don't have a standard system to measure distance either (IIRC everything is "strides" so I'm not sure if that's relative or what). The upper classes could be keeping advanced maths a secret, but that would make life (for them) harder in general.

Or it could be an over-reliance on their system interfaces, that gives them what they need so they only do very basic calculations or just go with what feels right.

******** They understand the /concept/ of nothing, they just don't have a /symbol/ for it. Rain also explained it really badly - he used "1" and "10" and how adding 0*10 to 100 gives you 100. Which makes sense to us, but there's no reason someone using a different system would get that. Roman numerals worked well for almost 2000 years without a zero.

I think the idea of having nothing, or no effect, shows they get the concept. But the idea that /nothing can be something/ is kinda hard to wrap your head around. It took us until the 13th century before we got 0. We invented calculus and algebra without 0 being around.

e: This is how Jamus explained to Rain why they got along without it,

#+begin_quote
  “See here? These are numbers in my language. That there is the symbol for ‘one', and those two together mean ‘ten'. The round character on the end is a zero. When you write a one and a zero next to each other like that, you get ten. Two ones next to each other make eleven, a one and a two is twelve, and so on.”

  “Oh, I think I've heard of this.” Jamus said, “The position of the digits matters, right? Twelve is one ten plus two ones?”

  “Yup, you got it. So ten is one ten plus zero ones. A hundred is one hundred, zero tens, and zero ones. Written like this, see?” Rain pointed. “The zeros are there to pad out the number, that way you know the one is in the hundred's place.”

  “Humm. I can see the appeal, but-”

  “But what?” Rain sighed in exasperation. “These are much easier to work with than your numbers are. See here?” He pointed to some scribbles on the opposing page. “I was trying to do math with the value system you all seem to use, but it did not go well. I had to keep converting back and forth. How do you even multiply anything with these?”

  “Most people don't bother, or at least, not to that level,” Jamus said, nodding to the cramped script in Rain's notebook. “For day-to-day life, simple ratios are enough. Overkill, even. Knowing that a skill will boost damage by one part in ten is good enough.”

  “Come on! You just used a fraction for crying out loud! How can't you have zero!?”

  “I don't know what to tell you, Rain,” Jamus shrugged. “As I said, I've heard of systems like the one you are describing, but it isn't what I was raised with. Some people don't even see numbers when they interact with the system. If you want to know more, you'll have to talk to a real scholar, not just a dabbler like me. Remind me to introduce you to Staavo when we get back to Fel Sadanis. I think you'd get along.”

My issue with Rain is that he seems incapable of learning. Even after he gets burned time and time again for showing off his unbalanced magical abilities, he just goes ahead and does it again. He is incapable of keeping a low profile mere hours after thinking how fragile his build is.

Literally this dude gets back from multiple brushes with death, the need to be discreet hammered into him, and the first thing he does is charge thousands of mana into heating pads in minutes, in a quest that almost everyone in the guild is probably familiar with and will know how abnormal that is. Let alone the above-discussed "hey dudes who are supposed to protect towns from OP adventurers, have I ever told you that I could kill hundreds of people here in less than a second with no warning, and have previously displayed no hesitation about using unknown AoE spells in public?"

I've read ahead in the patreon chapters and Rain is getting more discreet, but I think the author is showing him learning incrementally. First Rain is learning to not say anything explicit to the Watch other than what's needed to answer the questions. Then he's learning to hold back with his skills instead of going as strong as he can.

It's an alternate reality where the universe has a positive-definite Riemannian metric, rather than a pseudo-Riemannian metric (i.e. our universe.) An entire alternate physics spills out from there, which the characters exploit to save their world. One of the things it does is occasionally stop the action and pose thought experiments which demonstrate elements of cosmology. For example, red light is slower than violet light, so why is the sun white? (Because it doesn't matter how fast an individual photon is. If you send out 10 red photons and 10 violet photons, they're all going to reach the destination at some point. Since the rate of entry is the same, the rate of exit will also be the same).

The first three or so chapters are a bit dire, and I don't think you'd miss anything particularly important if you skipped straight to chapter 4, but at that point it really takes off; the story manages to blend good cheer with a post-apocalyptic setting in a really intriguing way.

I don't think this story's been recommended here before. The premise is of a speedrunner that's specialising on a particular game accidentally ending up in that game when trying to find yet another glitch to shave off some more time from his runtimes. The writer likely drew inspiration from Castlevania / Metroidvania games, as well as games like Dark Souls and Mass Effect.

PROs:

- excellent worldbuilding --- meticulous and carefully designed locations, characters, world lore, and character backstories;
- the writer's [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork][ShownTheirWork]] about speedrunning communities, as well as their mentality, subculture slang, and so on;
- good-to-excellent characterisations: the protag feels like a speedrunner, the vigeogame's main characters have unique and detailed backgrounds, the videogame is populated with random encounters that can leave an impression, etc;
- due to its premise has a vibe of mid-to-late chapters of a time loop story;
- features some beautifully implemented rare-to-encounter ideas.

CONs:

- the first several chapters are a bit rough around the edges;
- the story's technically abandoned after the ending of the first plot arc. That plot arc itself can be treated as a good enough ending point though;
- a few eventually revealed (non-critical) explanations are somewhat lacking;
- ? it's not trying to meet the established standards and expectations of a "properly well written" story;
- ? to me, at least, it felt like the game's characters' personalities became somewhat subdued in the second half of the story to accommodate the planned plot progression. Though perhaps this could be explained by the protag being able to "push the right buttons" due to knowing from all his replays how each character would react to a range of possible inputs.

*** [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]] has some excellent worldbuilding. There are 22 hermetic pathways to power, each involved taking potions made from monsters. The main character, a Chinese keyboard warrior, was isekai-ed into the body of a recently dead magically-induced suicide victim in Magic Britain, trying to find a way home in a deadly world.

The first volume builds up slowly and felt like a magic buddy cop webnovel, but the end of the first arc made me fall in love.

*** "The Iron Teeth" has good world building and features a goblin main character living in a fantasy world. The MC is pretty rational although he's about half alien/animal intelligence. I particularly enjoy the fight scenes in it, they feel realistic to me.

Minor spoiler: if you find Blacknail's limited intelligence grating I encourage you to power through for a while.

That's occasionally lampshaded though, so I suspect there's some unrevealed backstory that explains it.

And people do try and munchkin their builds by concentrating on activities that promote the build they want, or refrain from activities that might lead to undesirable builds.

They don't /quite/ squeak over to such drastic revolutions as steam power or the printing press, but are nevertheless centuries ahead of their time.

Also my sense of what's good has probably been thoroughly corrupted by years of reading litrpg, webnovels, and questionable fanfiction.

There's also Richard K. Morgan's Altered Carbon, which explores identity versus body in a world where both can be swapped around at will. Also, ultraviolence.

There's David Brin's Kiln People, which again is all about identity and stuff. Unfortunately it's a one-shot, not a series.

If you just want unrecognizably far future madness, there's Dan Simmons' Hyperion series - it's got tech so far advanced it's basically magic.

Some of Iain M. Banks' novels also deal with identity though I don't know if it's a major theme most of the time; you might particularly like the opening of Excession, though.
