** I'm very curious about what their 'modern' programming languages look like.

Obviously, they've grown and changed as time went on, and they have techniques (and artificial aides) we don't have presently.

But it really seems like 90% of their job is just thinking, which seems to be a pretty sweet deal if you can get it.

I'm kinda leaving it deliberately underspecified because I don't feel competent to predict the evolution of programming languages accurately beyond the very near term. Roughly the idea in my head (which should be considered more "author headcanon" than canon) is that rather than having a small set of languages, they have a whole "tree" of languages which start from simple cores and compile down to the next level, with an awful lot of formal verification and analysis happening at each translation level, and an awful lot of focus on interoperability standards.

It would be absolutely maddening to work with unassisted, but fortunately they don't ever work with it unassisted.

This too can be yours for the low low price of 10,000 years of toolchain development. ;-)

Curious case about the languages available to us:

Lots of work is done in C transparently, i.e. one /almost/ never has to go to the level it compiles into (machine codes, represented as assembly code). Then there're interpreted languages / VMs, and one almost never has to go to the C/CPP-representation under them. And recently some made translated languages on top of both ([[http://cython.org/][1]]) ([[http://coffeescript.org/][2]]), but didn't entirely manage to organize toolsets for the transparency, i.e. if something goes slightly wrong, there is still a need to go into the underlying representation.

The lesson is here is not clear, but it slightly suggests that making a translated language is cheap, but making a toolset to avoid dealing with stuff it is translated into is hard and expensive.

And then there's the point of actually /spreading the learning/ of a language, and of how best to use it; a notable example in scripted languages is perl as compared to python: in a way, perl could be used about as conveniently as python is (with a little less sugar), but it did not nudge toward those practices, and lots of perl code thus became write-only code.

***** The issue here is mostly precision of semantics and correctness of conversion. Many languages, especially older ones, don't have a precise formal semantics that tools can work with, or use system quirks that are incredibly difficult to model. Even then we're seeing some progress with formally verified compilers and the like.

If you have correctness, then the problem becomes performance, and things like linear type systems can help with those when they start becoming more prevalent.

**** My guess is this is it, since learning that PTY stands for "pseudoteletype" begs the question "what is a teletype" and you pretty much inevitably wind up learning the history of early time-sharing systems, the rise of glass TTYs, the history of terminal emulation and the properties of PTY devices as they are exposed through and used by POSIX-compliant systems ("What's POSIX?" asks Arthur and the can of worms goes on.) It's all interesting history and useful for modern programmers using POSIX systems, but would probably eat up the rest of Arthur's afternoon without getting them closer to solving their problem.

As for the gendersnowflake... it seems like a pretty natural progression of culture that we just collectively stop caring about gender. Once you drop all the biases that people of a certain gender are likely to have certain characteristics, what's the point of keeping the pronouns?

eeh. In a contemporary software /development/ shop, yes, absolutely. The protag is not,primarily, a software developer, though; they are more of a software maintenance engineer.

Even in contemporary reality, programmers who maintain legacy enterprise software systems, systems that major corporations depend on, this "if it ain't broke don't fix it, in fact, don't even look at it funny" rule is often effectively law. And that's just when large amounts of money are at stake - when people's lives are at stake, you don't go tearing down essential bits of code that've worked reliably for decades just because they're ugly.
