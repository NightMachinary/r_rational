Anywho Eaglejarl is writign a rational superhuman story, storms give people superpowers but also can mutate them and any animals or objects they touch.

He is posting chapters on his mailing list. There is catch though, every chapter link last about 2 days and then is deleted, being then only available on Amazon for purchase.

In case you've missed it here are the chapters in unlisted pastebin dumps and his mailing list. Check it every day, I almost missed the second installment.

Part 1 [[http://pastebin.com/dMCC8887]]

Part 2 [[http://pastebin.com/q3v5qjLX]]

Mailing list [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dks-writing]]

Just to remind chapters are free in 1-2 day period after posting and then it goes on Amazon on sale.


** This, uh, is kind of a dick move man. The whole reason he's doing it this way is because Amazon has strict rules about having that stuff available elsewhere, and he's a regular here so he wouldn't even be able to argue he hadn't been aware of it.

You could be putting him in a very awkward legal position.

** Oh. My. The horror. The horror.

Someone is mirroring my work without my permission. You terrible horrible no good very bad person, scold scold.

Well, since I can't stop you, I will say that I hope people enjoy the stories and feel a powerful desire to [[http://bit.do/books-dks][go out and buy them]], or get on the mailing list and receive all my future stuff for free, or get a [[http://bit.do/ku-free-trial][Kindle Unlimited]] account for $10 / month that will let you read my stuff and other people's at no extra charge and also pays us.

I will also comment that if you'd like a more memorable URL for the mailing list, it's [[http://bit.do/dks-list]].

Also, it's either "EagleJarl" or "eaglejarl". Both or none, please.

EDIT: Also, you shouldn't have to check the list, it should get emailed to you. Check your mail settings on the list.
