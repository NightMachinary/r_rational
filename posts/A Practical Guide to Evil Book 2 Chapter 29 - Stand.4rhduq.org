** I think Cat's final Name could be the overarching conflict of the story. Callow views itself as a force of good and therefore produces Heroes. Black is trying subvert this plot by changing Callow into a place that no longer produces Heroes. By taking Cat under his wing he is looking to change the narrative through Cat. This has worked so far as Cat clearly has the evil side of Squire. However as this chapter shows, Cat still has the Callow identity and I expect that to through a wrench into Black's plans. I wouldn't be surprised if the name that Cat comes into is a new name that blends the pride of Callow with the ruthlessness of Preas.

**** It's more or less the most consensual guess. Though maybe because of that the author will throw in a wrench?

****** So no pulling a Robert Jordan? Though I think [[/u/Friedoobrain]] was suggesting you had anticipated the possibility, and either accepted it, or subverted it already.

******* Aah. Then all I have to say on the subject is that the Name system isn't one that lends itself well to shades of grey. Roles push people towards extremes, and keeping yourself on the middle road always comes at a price.
