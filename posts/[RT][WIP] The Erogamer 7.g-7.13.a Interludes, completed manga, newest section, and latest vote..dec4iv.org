** Susan Calvin is really different in "Liar!" compared to "Evidence", isn't she? I'm glad Asimov didn't stick to her first characterization. (Re: Susanne Kelvin and the "Liar" chapter in Erogamer.)

Edit: wow, failed my google-fu check. I don't know how that was possible.

Should not have taken me a whole day to reach that conclusion.

** Nice Worm reference. I really love this story, but I'm also really not comfortable with how the author treats rape and consent. I'll keep reading the story, but I don't like that part of it.

***** Oh gosh. I haven't read the latest chapters and it's been a while. The story covers lots of fetishes. Tons of BDSM type stuff. Tons of Exhibitionism. Lots of mind bending and disturbing philosophy as the world slowly transforms until everything is about sex.

If you are talking about the Rape, the readers pretty much voted against it for the majority of the story. Eventually the author was like "look guys, rape is my fetish so it's happening. You can either have the character experience it on their own terms or I'll just write it into the story somewhere". I'm paraphrasing badly, but the forum was persuaded to vote for a rape scene in which the main character put herself in a situation where she knew she would be raped. MC thought she could handle it but it ended up being worse than she expected. The entire scene is point of view from her and every detail is described including her mental state. She is mentally harmed from the experience and takes a while to recover. I haven't read everything after that but there may be more rape scenes later.

****** I think you're misremembering some things about how he expressed the thing about the rape.

For starters, the voters *did* vote for the rape in question -- it was only *after* the majority voted for it, and some people were upset about the outcome of the vote, that he said (in part to console the people in question I think) that the rape would have eventually to be dealt with anyway -- but he didn't say something as blunt "I'll just write it into the story somewhere" AFAIK.

And IIRC he didn't bring up anything about it being "his fetish" or not, he said that from a Doylist perspective, Cindy has this part-fear, part-kink, part psychological hangup, that made her being raped to have to be dealt with *eventually*, (and he also said that there had been points in the story already were a different worse roll, might have led her to encounter rape already -- e.g. in the strip club, where a bad roll had already led her to be harassed and blackmailed -- it could have been even worse with as worse roll)

***** These are the content warnings as the author describes them in the start of the story:

#+begin_quote
  Content warnings: Body shame, noncon.

  Spoiler: More detailed content warnings.

  *Body* *shame:* The protagonist's view of her universe does not always reflect her universe accurately. And her universe may not reflect the beliefs or values of the author. That said, this protagonist is definitely not fat-positive.\\
  *Noncon:* Noncon is not a primary focus of this story, but it's something that happens in eroge, and it's explored to a sufficient extent that anyone who stays away from even non-poorly-executed noncon should stay away from this. By-chapter trigger warnings appear for heavy but not light triggers.

  Further triggers may potentially be added if the story goes there. Loli/shota will never be a thing, and the protagonist is never going to get it on with her Mom.

  Never forget, IRL there's no "dubcon", just con and non. Sane people use condoms and safewords.

**** Well, I hope he doesn't act that out in real life. He seems to go to ridiculous lengths to come up with elaborate scenarios where rape is supposed to be ok. I mean, he literally pulled a "he rapes but he saves" with a rapey Dexter character in the latest few. Dude's got issues.

***** While I kind of agree, it should be noted that you're talking about one of the most common "weird" fetishes to the point where it's basically a mainstream sexual fantasy. Saying "I hope he doesn't act that out in real life" is a bit much.
