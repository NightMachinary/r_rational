** Reading this one chapter at a time can be painful sometimes. This was a good one, but I want more. I'm waiting on reading the 3rd novel for the same reason. Don't want to start it then get drip fed.

Excited for speedtest. I wonder if there will ever be an opportunity for Speedtest 2.0 on a planet they don't mind truly destroying.

*** I understand. I wish I could put out chapters up to my standards as fast as I used to. Flicker does get opportunities for more tests of her abilities in Maker's Ark. Since you haven't started it yet I won't spoil it for you 8-)

** Flicker starts to move on.

Chaser and Jonathan appear in [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/123437156356/vignette-cat-fight][Cat Fight]]

The gelato shop in Florence is Vivoli. It had very good gelato in 1985, and probably still does 8-)

** Okay my previous complaint of everything coming to a head is withdrawn; this isn't a sidestory it's a full background prequel.

I am still looking forward to (things I like in makers ark): flickers spear, and the war against the homewell things that think of humanity and demons as bugs nesting in a rotting everett branch, and more transhumanist lessons from /Learning is about to occur/ but I'm really enjoying this.

*** It didn't start out that way. I used to think authors talking about how their short story involuntarily turned into a novella were exaggerating, but once it was clear to me how the chronology had to work, it worked best in a single story 8-). And I haven't forgotten about Maker's Ark, it's still percolating along in the background (it's mostly the "meanwhile on Earth" stuff causing the problem) and there are parts of Princess that are foreshadowing.

**** Yeah, I see the one character you are foreshadowing and the (spoilery pun): table full of WMDs in Chekhov's armory he can become.
