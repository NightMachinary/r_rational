** Oh hey, I forgot about this one. I wonder how far it's gotten since I stopped reading.

Oh, it's dead. Well fuck.

***** Because there's no tag for "Dead", and tagging it "Complete" would have been a blatant lie.

******* I don't think that we need one. That said, a [DEAD] tag would be clear enough if someone wanted to include it in their post. Tags aren't really regulated. (I don't think that it's common enough to for us to put it in the sidebar, especially because people rarely post abandoned works.)

******** If you are maximizing for number of readers, then sure. If you are maximizing for enjoyment then I think its better to let people know in advance so they can decide for themselves how upset they are going to be if the story stops at an incongruous point.

********* Perhaps something like Discontinued then. The poster can always say it advance after posting. A lot of really great rational fics haven't been completed, it's sad to think that I might not have gotten to know them in the first place if I saw the Dead tag and decided it isn't worth my time to invest on. And who knows, seeing an influx of interest the creator might even get set out on continuing the story again. I feel it is detrimental overall to discourage people from possibly reading something they might love.

*********** I would be in favor of DEAD, since it's a lot more clear than DIS. I think if someone knows that a work is dead they should make it abundantly clear when posting it.

******* I enjoyed this fanfic a lot, and I recently came across it again. It hasn't been posted in 4 years, and the sub was a lot smaller back then, so I decided to repost it. That's all there is to it.

****** Huh? I've always had to manually write the tags in as part of the title. Couldn't you just type [DEAD] or something like that?

I've even typed in [Comedy] when I posted about a joke challenge '[Comedy] Piss off [[/r/rational]] in on sentence. Go!'
