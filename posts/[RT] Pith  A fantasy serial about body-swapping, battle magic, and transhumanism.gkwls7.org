Hi all. I've been writing a fantasy serial called [[https://pithserial.com][Pith]] for the past year, and thought this community might be interested. It's got a hard magic system, mind-enhancing powers, and strategic main characters, with a dose of transhumanism on the side.

Here's a synopsis:

/All humans possess a Pith, the essence of a mind where consciousness, reason, and emotion reside. Those who study its power can control their surroundings, move from body to body, and alter the very fabric of another's thoughts./

/In a dying empire surrounded by enemies, two rejects from their city's magic academy become mercenaries:/

/Ana, an idealistic girl trapped in a body with a terminal illness./

/Wes, an arrogant noble exiled from his family, his name wiped from his memory./

/As they fight for their lives and face moral quandaries, they must forge their identities in a world where the human soul is a tool, a canvas, and the deadliest weapon of them all./

It's not as rational as some of the stuff here - characters make mistakes and act against their self-interest - but I'd still argue it fits a lot of the tropes.

[[https://pithserial.com/2019/05/27/1-a-the-caterpillars-dilemma/][Here's the first chapter]]. Fair warning, it's quite dark, with some notes from psychological horror and cyberpunk. New updates get posted on Mondays.

If you have any comments or non-spoilery questions, I'd love to hear them! And if you read it, I hope you find it enjoyable!


** I really like it!

I'm also curious, is there a specific reason you decided to host this on your own site rather than an aggregator like RoyalRoad? It would make it a lot easier to get new readers if it was on another site.

*** Thanks! I like the freedom and fine-tuning that my own site gives me. But like Pirateaba and nobody103, I'm planning to cross-post to RR once I have a bigger backlog of chapters and can drop them all fast. My normal posting schedule is slow for web fiction, and that can make it hard to get noticed on the big sites.

(Pale is a story set in the same world as Pact--not exactly a sequel, as I understand it. It was originally named Poof for some reason, but that opened up a whole can of worms (har) for being a slur in Britain and also sounding silly so he retitled it)

** Okay, I've caught up with the story, and so far the greatest flaws are:

- There isn't more of it.
- It doesn't update on tuesdays, wednesdays, thursdays, saturdays and sundays.

The first flaw should fix itself over time though.

Seriously, I'm having a hard time conveying how much I like the story so far. The characters are on point, and I even find myself liking Wes, despite what an absolute scumbag he is. The worldbuilding is great, and every chapter I find myself giggling when the story adds another clever tidbit about how society integrates clones in good or bad ways.

You should probably post a new thread for every chapter. I know I want to comment on some things but I don't really like the wordpress comment box.

Also, any chance you'll post a world map at some point? I'm having a hard time keeing up with the different place names and ethnicities.

** Does anyone else think that Ana is an unusually good person? I get that it's a literary conceit, that the main character almost has to be morally noble.

Still, if I were in her position, with a power that seemed almost purpose-built for theft - and if I really needed money to save my life... I suppose that she's ashamed about stealing from her parents, that that might move her away from making a habit of it. There's also presumably precautions and ways people try and prevent people like her from stealing on a long-term basis.

#+begin_quote
  Likewise when she attempts to save those people from being tortured to death. Wouldn't even a good person leave rather than try to do something about it, given their very limited powers at the time? Especially given Wes's arguments?<!
#+end_quote

I suppose such people do exist in the real world and maybe I'm being too edgy. It's an interesting issue with rationality in fiction. If Ana was more pragmatic as a thief, she'd have made more money (maybe?) or have otherwise scammed her way out of death. If Taylor was more pragmatic in Worm, she would've joined the Wards or not gotten ensnared with dangerous criminals on a fool's errand trying to uncover Coil. Even in Worth the Candle, a 'pragmatic' Juniper might've bulldozed through a lot of diplomatic problems with soul magic or just killing whatever was in the way. But people don't really act on this birds-eye-view of pragmatism, choosing what values they hold in order to achieve their objectives. The values define the objective most of the time.

I guess more interesting stories come when people decide what to do in somewhat unrealistic ways, then try and achieve their goals as cleverly as possible, given the restrictions they've placed on themselves.

*** I think it's a mix of compassion for people in her economic bracket, a knowledge that if she does get caught she might die, and the idealism that Paragon seems to be trying to grind into society (Strive to become an Exemplar). The latter being referenced so often that it has to have a deeper societal meaning than we've been shown.

It's mostly a way to practice my storytelling while providing some entertainment to friends and family during quarantine while introducing them to good stories. Especially one friend who loves a good web serial but is dyslexic and has trouble reading them himself, so if there isn't already an audiobook he usually misses out. But I think he'll really like this one, so thank you.

** Oh, huh! I was surprised to see this here - I was thinking of posting it myself at some point since I saw you link it on a different forum, but I never got around to it due to fussing over my own work.

It's a good story! Very tightly written, and exploits the reader desire for catharsis for the injustices the main characters suffer masterfully - there's something about the way you write body/mind incongruence and betrayal from figures who should be trustworthy or caring that really captures the sense of something sacred or primally important being violated. It makes it difficult to stop reading, even against my better sense.

It's also very bold in how un-wishfulfillmenty it is for Ana in particular, considering how characters like that are usually written, even if the tease at the end of the first arc is agonizing. It has the potential to climax this part of her story in an either incredible moment of relief or an absolutely heartrending tragedy.

I also like the worldbuilding. It's unique and interesting without being too indulgent, unlike most of what I write, which goes right off the deep end.

** I've read through the first section of the story and I don't think I'll be continuing from here. This isn't a criticism of the writing quality or anything, but being a trans girl that has some experience in being in a shitty body I don't like, I have to say that Ana's sections are too harrowing for me to deal with. Everyone is just absolutely awful to her, she has no hope, they fucking force her to go back into a masculine body after destroying the one she stole... yeah. I wish you well, but I find it hard to read stories where I want everyone in them save the viewpoint character to die horrible painful deaths.

** Good first chapter, I liked it! I'll continue reading.

Minor note: I was a bit confused when you first mentioned smoke, as before only steam was mentioned. Made sense later on when I read about the cigarrete. Idk if it's worth changing.

#+begin_quote
  I wiped sweat off my forehead and dried my hand on my white dress shirt. Steam rose from the stoves in the middle of the kitchen, filling the room to the brim. It drifted into my eyes, making them sting.

  I waved my hand to clear the smoke and glanced around the room.

  Clutching a cigarette in her fingers, she looked over her shoulder to breathe out a cloud of smoke.

Also random question - is it convention to not tab paragraphs for web serials? I've noticed that authors in books generally tab their paragraphs (ex: Stephen King) but web serials like Worth the Candle, Worm, and Pith don't.

*** I type up my serial in LibreOffice with a tab before every paragraph. Then I copy-paste it into Wordpress, which removes all of the tabs. I could probably work out some way to indent, but it wouldn't be worth the bother. I suspect RR does something similar.

Indenting is useful to visually offset paragraph starts, but that's probably less useful in online works where you can simply increase spacing between paragraphs for the same result. I imagine books don't do that because paper costs money.

You have a really good setting! I like the characters too. I'm sad Kaplen died - hopefully the story is less grimdark than worm? 😬 The quality is really good, I think you could self-publish it.
