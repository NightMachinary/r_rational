** I miss Zombie already. I'm really hoping that the Dead King will send her back repaired as a little nod of respect. My head canon is it'll be like when Saladin sent Richard the Lionheart a new horse after his was slain in battle.

The drow are really growing on me. The "ask tomorrow" is one of the more badass things in this story, and there are a lot of contenders.

*** Catherine took the Zombie halves into her extradimensional storage space, so the DK doesn't get his grubby hands on 'em.

Totally agreed about the "ask tomorrow" line. That's a thing of beauty.

**** Oh, that's right. Looks like Cat will have to have the miracle man work on Zombie then. He was a pupil of the Dead King for a bit, I'm determined to believe that my dreams aren't crushed and we'll get Zombie back.

*** If it's DK, he'll send Zombie back, packed with explosive poison.

**** As we saw with Ranger, Neshamah only does « polite nods » as diversion and stalling tactics. Any practical thing he can do first, he does, thoroughly.
