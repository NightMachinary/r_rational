** I feel bad for Taft. He just wanted to give tours and be with his wife. Instead he gets to see if the bottomless pit actually is. For everyone else that Joon and co. have killed, they at the least signed up for guard duty or an equivalent. Lots of the people they killed were also either evil in some way, or at least complete assholes. They generally knew what they signed up for. Taft had a cushy job acting as a tour guide.

Anyways, I've forgotten a few minor things about some of the entads, and was hoping someone here remembers.

Fenn had her artillery bow, and it has a limit on the number of artillery shots she can use. How does it recharge? And is there a limit to the number of charges it can hold?

How does Grak's axe work? It makes his hair grow, but I forget what the condition is to use that ability.

Is Ropey more durable than a normal rope?

And I suppose one more question relevant for this chapter: Is Amaryllis planning to just store months/years worth of excretion in Sable? This would be an inconvenient time to discover whether Sable has a limit to its sorage capacity. I suppose she can dump everything into the pit every time she comes out of the HTC, assuming Zona allows it.

*Narratively,* I am confident in saying that Amaryllis won't die because she doesn't know how gas exchange works and never pulled something out of the backpack to convert carbon dioxide back into oxygen.

Honestly, they should just let Amaryllis have everything they can provide her with. Including all their weapons. She has plenty of time to, say, get good with bows or Anyblade. It's not like everyone else will get more use of them in 45 minutes than she will in a month.

The backpack is especially great for her because she doesn't even need to cook, just pull out whatever hot food she wants. Same with books or items. I mentioned a wiki walk in my other top level comment, and I think it's a good analogy. She'll want lots of random information that is impractical to load up ahead of time.

** (I feel that this is separate enough from my previous comment to warrant a new one)

I really want Amaryllis to come out of the HTC having gone through an equivalent to a wiki walk or twenty. Joon may be decently well versed on Earth's culture and some aspects of technology, but being in high school I doubt he really comprehends how advanced Earth is compared to Aerb. Aerb may have a few electronics, but is medieval in a number of ways. I want to see Amaryllis marvel at some of the things that modern Earth people kind of just take for granted. Intercontinental flight that is only subsonic because it's more fuel efficient rather than physical limitations, global communication, vaccines and how multiple diseases have been eliminated or virtually so, the luxuries that are available to even the poorest people in the first world, the wealth of information available about all aspects of nature, women's rights, the near complete lack of monarchies in advanced nation's, and so on. Hell, the entire concept of a globe Earth and orbital mechanics, since she lives on an explicitly flat one. Imagine explaining to someone on Aerb that we sent up some humans to another planet that's thousands of miles away, launched on a vehicle the size of a skyscraper that goes up due to a barely controlled explosion, that said vehicle was single use only, and that we thought it a valuable use of resources to send up a hammer and feather to test the known effects of gravity, and a mirror to measure the speed of light. Oh, and we also brought back some rocks. We did all this to prove that we were better than some other nation that we kind of sorta weren't at war with. Oh, and if we did go to war with that nation, it would probably kill everything.

Data storage! How could I forget. Try explaining to someone who thinks of "computer" as a profession that we have devices that fit in your hand that can hold libraries worth of books, meter scale resolution maps of the entire planet, hundreds of thousands of paintings, and it's available with a few days' wages at the lowest you're legally allowed to pay people.

*** Aerb isn't the Harry Potter magical world. The biggest thing that will come up when Amaryllis reads up on Earth is that she'll be amazed by the lack of catastrophes. "If we went to war with [Russia], it would probably kill everything" is really cute when Aerb really did have a thermonuclear war, and it ended up with nukes being excluded.

Earth has advantages in the form of plastics and electronics, and everything else is inferior, at parity, or blocked by some aspect of Aerb. (And possibly plastics aren't on Aerb because they don't have petroleum.)

- Intercontinental flight - Worse than teleporting, plus dragons\\
- Global Communication - They've also got global communication\\
- Vaccines - Worse than Aerb medical magic\\
- Luxuries - We haven't seen Aerb be any worse than Earth\\
- Wealth of Information to anyone - Not an advantage in a world where knowledge is literally power, and power keeps killing billions\\
- Lack of monarchies - Aerb is superior if you live in a world where levels and stats are real, and arguably democracy is similarly untenable in said world\\
- Orbital Mechanics - A cute but useless endeavor on a flat planet\\
- Traveling to the moon - They already did that with an entire population\\

We've got arguably a better economy (although they've got some post-scarcity stuff going on) and better electronics, but Aerb isn't full of backwards rubes.

**** For a number of your points, the results that Aerb have accomplished may be better, but I wouldn't say that the achievements are comparable. Intercontinental travel on Earth is accomplished through massive engines that push our knowledge of material science, aerodynamics, and mechanical engineering to their limits. These engines represent millions of man hours of testing, design, and analysis from some extremely smart people. On Aerb, some guy made these magic things one day, in a feat that no one can replicate, and now you can teleport. It's a similar story for vaccines, and space travel. The medical magic is more comparable to medical science, but I don't get the impression that they are siginificantly refining their knowledge of the field over time. Not to the same degree, at least.

Does Aerb have global (or whatever the adjective is when the world isn't a globe) communication at decent speeds? They have radio, but I can't remember a time when messages have been sent across the world.

I'm not sure what youre saying about your point on monarchies. Joon and co. are the only ones who have to deal with levels and stats.

Aerb medical magic is post-singularity compared to Earth Medicine. They can cure any disease that doesn't have magic backing it, instantly fix any wound, bring people back from being cut in half, etc.. A generic doctor can go get a bachelor's degree at the Aethenium of Bone, setup a practice, and heal people of mortal wounds for reasonable prices in an afternoon. How much more advanced do you want?

Aerb has global communication fast enough for information about Amaryllis to every keystone on the planet. They can bulk send materials, and news (being inorganic) gets instantly transported.

--------------

Everyone in on Aerb has levels and stats, it's just that Joon can see the information on companions and he levels a lot faster. 'People' like Quills aren't just doing things that normal humans can do except better, they're performing genuinely superhuman acts like blocking bullets jedi-style. High level characters are vastly more powerful than the common populace. It's unlikely that 10,000 commoners with guns could deal with Aumann and his party.

On an idealistic level, a philosopher king who is superhumanly wise and confirmed to be moral good is absolutely better than a democracy. Such a person can't exist in real life, but is fairly straightforward to find on Aerb.

We know that wisdom and knowledge and cunning are stats, we can reasonably extrapolate that people have 60+ in a skill (because Fenn is amazing with a bow but isn't the best archer /ever/), and we know that takes at least 20+ in a stat to reach that skill. Joon reached the point where his personality would diverge too much due to stats at 7 int/wis. If you add it all up, this means there are people who are literally orders of magnitude more wise and intelligent than the general population. Aerb also has ways to objectively measure morality. Boom, philosopher king.

On a practical level, democracy only works because of the implicit threat of force of the populace. A state can only survive if it has a monopoly on violence, and democracy ensures that the greatest possible force (the majority of the populace) is always on the side of the state. This comes crashing down if the greatest force isn't the populace, but a handful of adventurers.

Dragons having a chilling effect on air travel was intended from the start; that passage was originally intended for ch 9, when they arrived at Silmar City, but I didn't like how it played with the pacing, given that it would have extended a "lull" in the text.

More seriously, every writer struggles with negative feedback, but in Ace's case, it seems generally unproductive or incompatible criticism that you can't act on and it's wasted effort trying to respond when you're hounded by (often derogatory in tone) complaints of the same gist. It's a downside that comes with having an online presence as a web-serial author - people will dislike it and express it. Book writers talk about developing a thick skin, but they don't really have to deal with a bad review until their work is finished and the distance is already there. It might be useful to not treat all criticism as equal(ly reliable) or meriting a personal defense.

If you're invariably fixated on the need to respond, then it could be constructive to get RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) and set those comments on ignore indefinitely until it loses its immediate demand on your attention. I think dealing with these comments is more distracting when they're directed to your latest chapter than if they refer to some previous arc. At any rate, substantive criticism will recur and crop up again from multiple readers.

I do dearly hope the negativity doesn't deter you from the comments because I've always enjoyed the responses and seeing how comments occasionally leave traces in subsequent chapters. Please don't ignore all the love!

A lot of the criticism I get stings, but is nonetheless helpful, or at least confirms my own understanding of what problems I've been running into. When I write I'm usually /really/ close to the work, and unable to see how it looks from the outside; I've posted chapter thinking "ugh, that was garbage" only to have people say that they loved it, or I've been anxious about whether it was any good only to get great feedback. Sometimes stuff like "this scene didn't have clear enough or high enough stakes" hits me like an epiphany, and I instantly realize what the problem I'd been having was, I just hadn't been able to figure it out because I was mired in trying to use the wrong methods to fix the uneasy feeling I had.

... and then there are other kinds of feedback that are just negative without offering anything, or which come down to disagreements about what the story should be, or which point at trade-offs that I decided to make and just say "hey, there was a downside to that trade-off", which I already knew. Or people who just say "kinda garbage, didn't get past ch 11, don't understand why people like this", and logically, this is someone for whom the story didn't work, but it still kind of hurts to get rejected like that, even when you weren't trying. And yeah, some people are just assholes; I've gotten PMs from people that just wanted to let me know how much they disliked me personally for writing a story they didn't like.

I think there's a limited amount of negativity that I want to let into my life, and that's why I've scaled back on reading and replying to comments, which I never did all that much to begin with. I don't want to dissuade people from giving feedback, even if it's negative, especially in a public place where it's meant for other readers or community members, not me. It's more the tone and form of some of that feedback that gets to me, which I'd rather not subject myself to.

********** Other thoughts, mostly addressed to [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]]:

If earning enough money through Patreon to be self-employed is the goal, then CRJ/AW will need to commit to financially-minded managerial decisions for maximizing voluntary patrons. pirateaba has had the most explosive web serial earnings increase that I know of ([[https://graphtreon.com/creator/user?u=4240617][interesting graph for tracking Patreon growth]]) since she made the decision to add that $5 tier last year and it's been steadily rising for two main reasons (as I see it): (1) she's written an amazing story that people like to read and (2) she's a writing machine who consistently puts out at least two ~10K word chapters a week.

WtC started last year and its reader-base has also been growing. CRJ/AW has put out an average of ~7-12K words a week the past 2 months and I think that's more than enough to attract a regular readership. However, I think some factors are limiting its Patreon growth:

1. AO3 is excellent for readers (e-books!!) and has nifty in-built features for authors (the mouseover character sheets are great). But as far as I can tell - since I don't have the statistics for how many new viewers find it by exploring the site, it's a poor venue for attracting more readers - at least the type of readers who are looking for and would be interested in an original litRPG like WtC (AO3 does have a reputation for fanfiction and smut). By comparison, posting on RoyalRoad gives stories a huge influx of readership if they're popular because the reader-base is specifically looking for these types of stories (arguably a trade-off at the cost of reader and feedback quality).

2. Patreon tier amounts. WtC is currently at $1.9 per patron and it seems 101 of the 103 patrons are pledging the only option of $1. With higher tiers, there should be a marked increase in the average. And if low effort rewards like access to the latest chapter are thrown in, who knows? It does come with the mental shift of treating the story (at least partly) as a source of income, as opposed to the free personal story that WtC is written as.

3. This one is more iffy. But creating a site for WtC (like the ever popular Wordpress) may be useful to exert some overt ownership over the story. A site tailored specifically for WtC makes the story seem like a product and WtC like a brand - much more marketable to potential Patreons. It's also a place to build a community around, as I see many programmers around who have offered a place to host or can contribute to polishing such a site. *Especially since finding that Patreon links are banned on AO3. Also, fanart!

Important/obvious caveat: one story isn't a sustainable long-term source of income. No matter how popular it gets, WtC appears to have a clear ending in mind; so unless it's deliberately prolonged into a decade-spanning epic, it will end as the main reason people pledge.

I think more tiers are definitely an idea we will move on, although deciding on what rewards they come with will be tricky. I think possibly giving access to the next chapter a day before it goes on AO3 would be good, but he is concerned about segmenting his audience and the discussions.

He has a website already and it wouldn't be too much work to add WtC to it, possibly as a subdomain so that it could have its own branding/theme.

It's very convenient that the latest WtC discussion is centralized in the [[/r/rational]] threads, but I don't think segmenting the discussion would be a disincentive for readers because other stories also work with the similar problem of discussion dispersed across multiple forums. The [[/r/rational]] crowd and predicted majority of free readers that usually hang around for the discussion will still be there once the threads are posted. It would mainly hurt enthusiastic Patreon readers who are eager to discuss the fresh chapter but wouldn't have an outlet. That'd be another benefit of having your own site and hidden comment section ([[https://wanderinginn.com/2018/04/17/4-29/][example]]). Another possibility taken out of pirateaba's book is to create a Discord channel for discussing all of wales' works and give Patreons exclusive access to a live-discussion WtC-spoiler channel. Discord is also a way to plant a seed for building a community around alexanderwales as an author to support, rather than say, a writing hobbyist. Downside being another thing to keep track of.

I don't think a one day advance is sufficient incentive for someone to subscribe to (for example) a $5 tier. It's the itch of wanting to know more, but having to wait several days, that likely drives people to commit for a month of hair-tearing-cliffhanger-free relief.

I just checked the website on mobile and it has a neat and very readable interface. I don't know how much trouble it would be to copy over the more complex bits of formatting (character sheet) and how it would look on mobile.

Another stray thought:

Crossposting on a site like [[https://royalroadl.com/][Royalroad]], even temporarily, may be a useful way to reach a new "market." I know crossposting is a terrible and evil chore, but fantasy/litRPG writers who later branch to publishing their finished work on Amazon have found a lot of success by posting their "draft" version on RRL. It's a free way to get (usually generic) feedback and reach a large audience at the cost of crossposting annoyance and possibly a hit to respectability for posting on a site of mostly amateur writers.

********** Digging around, here's a response from the author on higher tiers:

#+begin_quote
  The problem with higher tiers is that I don't really have much more to give. I'm actually not quite writing as fast as I can, given that I still watch television and read books, and occasionally pump a few thousand words (or a half hour of editing) into other projects, but I really don't want to suffer burnout, nor promise that some of the other works I have brewing will come to fruition.

  I suppose that I could offer acknowledgements or cameos or something. Actually, probably not cameos given that I have a problem with money dictating art, even in ways that don't quite matter to the text itself.

  I'll have to take a look at what other people are doing, I guess. Let me know if you have any suggestions.
#+end_quote

And my response:

#+begin_quote
  I saw your front page post saying you're not offering goals; I didn't mean higher tiers with rewards but adding extra tiers as a kind of decision simplicity (a bit late but I just checked and patrons can write-in a higher pledge amount). The higher tiers don't strictly need to come with progressively better rewards (e.g. [[https://www.patreon.com/user?u=4240617][pirateaba]] of The Wandering Inn).

  Or work with creative rewards. I'm thinking something like the pastebin you linked of one of your past campaigns. Presumably you have a huge archive of those and if they're not private or too spoilery for WtC, worldbuilding geeks, aspiring DMs and such might appreciate them. Tangentially, I've been feeling it's a shame WtC doesn't have a banner on topwebfiction despite being in the top 15. Perhaps there could be a tier where some of the money can go to commissioning art or book covers and those patrons can vote on...whatever.
#+end_quote

By decision simplicity, I meant something along the same lines as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8882ln/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_8687_headdown/dwjxz6l/][the post I linked]]. There are surely patrons who would pledge more, but one tier gives the illusion of one choice.

I really like pirateaba's system of funneling patrons to the "reasonable" tier of $5 and offering them the satisfying reward of reading one chapter early (and voting on side stories). It's the only tier with a reward, and anything higher is just the generosity of patrons who want to give more (and a snazzy Discord channel tier). Practically no additional effort besides setting up a place for Patrons to access the latest chapter and it's much more attractive as a purchase perk if updates are frequent/consistent.

    If dragons were in fact a consideration from the start, a lot of people and situations our heroes encountered should be the result of dumbest decisions that other people made.
  #+end_quote

  Your comments, especially lines like this, read as really rude and aggressive to me, as well as completely lacking in the principle of charity.
#+end_quote

Huh, i was talking about people in the story aka government and ruling class being dumb.

1. Larkspur using 5 helicopters to chase people when he knows dragons are a thing was dumb and desperate in my opinion.

2. Using airplanes to drop prisoners while every flight is valuable and needs to be negotiated for is a dumb move from the ruling party.

3. Having multiple worst accidents when as you said "dragons only crash airships as last resort" is incompetence and stupidity from people that made those decisions.

I never tried to insult you personally or say that you are incompetent or dumb, even if i hated the story i would not do that. You do great work writing and creating your world. But i notice problems that should not really be problems, but they are because there are a lot of blanket statements about the world, that get disproved\dropped when it's convenient for the story.

It's the exact problem that we are having here. You perceived me saying "it's dumb" as a personal attack when in fact it wasn't like that. I see those "revelations about the world" as spur of the moment changes sometimes, because you write weekly and often more than one chapter, so it's reasonable that you can forget things.

#+begin_quote
  I left you a comment explaining my stance on exposition
#+end_quote

I think i mentioned it in that thread, but here it is again. Not describing the whole world at once is fine. Text upon text would be boring and pointless. But Juniper was obseessed with helicopters for a good amount of chapters and "you can't fly them cause dragons" was never a counter point and it would only take 1 sentence. Plus dragons appear only in chapter 82 in a small paragraph, that is easy to forget and to me it reads like a justification for using a train that didn't need to be there.

I dislike elements of the story and especially stuff i see as unwarranted inconsistencies, especially when they crop up, but i like the overall story. My problem is some things are a heavy focus and crux of the plot for a group of chapters, but when they get dropped, forgotten or completely invalidated by introduction of a magical item and when cycle begins anew with a different thing. It is pretty much D&D adventure, but the problem is the world is consistence and power spikes\drops are that more noticeable for me.

#+begin_quote
  You probably disagree; that's fine, but with due respect, I have my own opinions about how to write, and have disagreed with pretty much every "add more text" solution you've suggested, especially since the more I try to communicate, the more you find to criticize
#+end_quote

That's fine, but my point often is don't add that text, don't use blanket statements, because when you need to work them in for the whole world or all balance crumbles or you set limiters that don't feel natural in the next story arc. Character seem to bounce from ultimate power and a lot of solutions, to no power and all the solutions.

This is me being arrogant, but you could have easily said "Dragons are a thing in this particular region, not all of the Aerb., or here is 1 especially active dragon resides" have Juniper joke about " I told you we should have stolen that helicopter, it would be so much easier to fly". But the problem is now "dragons are not acknowledged when Juniper talks about helicopter and narrative of him piloting one", "Him wanting a helicopter is not mentioned when they would benefit from flying in one".

#+begin_quote
  I don't want to write "Mary and Juniper sit in a room while he gets things explained to him for several days"
#+end_quote

Yes you are right in not doing so, but one of my "gripes" was in the chapter there Juniper and Mary literally set down and talked in a room for the whole duration of it.

Edit: I have a perfect analogy about how i feel about dragons. You know when shows introduce brother\daughter\lost cousin of the main character and try to make it look like he was a thing all along. That's how i felt with their sudden and brief appearance.

#+end_quote

Me saying there are flaws or asking if other people see them as flaws is not a personal attack against anybody.

All that aside. Even famous meme of flying on eagles is explained in LoTR by enemy also having flying units and constant mention of dragons long before they even needed that.

1. Story starts with him and presumable the princess of said government dropped from a plane. She never talks about dragons.

2. Anuman hovers in a helicopter and Juniper mention being a pilot. Again no mention of dragons.

3. Five attack choppers chase them, Junipers wants to take one as a trophy. No one conunterpoints it with - well dragons.

4. Dragon mentioned in Uthers assistant\love interest Morana(man that's an unfortunate name) "Three months in, she was skinned alive by a dragon" No one mentiones theri alliance

5. First real and only mention of dragons in bulk is that small paragraph about (we can't fly so let's take the train).

My point is there was 0 establishment to that and it didn't even need to be there. I noticed it not because i "hate the story" or specifically focused on air politics, i noticed it because it felt forced and Juniper was were much focused on flying before.

I don't try to be an asshole and hate on anyone. But can you tell me with a straight face that reveal of Dragons own the skies doesn't seem out of nowhere and that all of the major villains just happen to be lucky and own flying vehicles with no one ever caring about that?

There's also a difference between discussing/deconstructing the consequences of a dragon confederacy with readers versus calling the dragons an "afterthought" like the author just half-assed their existence into Aerb.

1) Why would Mary have any reason to tell a complete stranger about dragons? "Hey stranger, don't you think it's weird that they flew us here in an airplane? Want to hear about dragons while we prepare our getaway?"

2-3) Helicopter travel over short distances != long distance air travel over dragons' territory. Alternatively, "hey we're in an emergency right now, but what's really important is the remote risk of dragons swooping down on these copters!"

4) "Morana was skinned by a dragon and now's a good time to tell you about the Draconic Confederacy since the dragons' chilling effect on air travel is directly relevant to our talk about Uther and narratives right now."

5) Compare to ch. 82. "Hey we're traveling by train. Why are we using trains when Aerb aerodynamics isn't far behind Earth? Is this a good time to talk about dragons and their influence on air travel?"

I still think the problem is the story takes routes in the D&D adventure so it comes with it's strengths (building on the fly, changeability, adaptability) and it's weaknesses (weak connections between places, imbalance of powers that is hard to address, ways of solving conflict)

You can run the numbers; there are five hundred dragons, and the surface area of Aerb is ten times that of Earth, which means that it's like fifty dragons holding the entirety of Earth's airspace. Each would be responsible for about four million square miles, or about a square about two thousand miles to a side.

The /individual/ odds of an aircraft being attacked by a dragon are, therefore, low, so it's not really a "don't fly or you will be struck from the air by a dragon" type of thing, it's more "an aircraft needs to fly pretty much every day, full of passengers, for three years, in order to pay for itself, which means 13,000 hours in the air before it's turning a profit. If the odds of a dragon attack are greater than 1/13,000 per hour, then planes are unlikely to make a profit. (And obviously a plane crash isn't just a matter of not being able to make a profit on a plane anymore, there are significant expenses involved in clean-up and liability, which can be handled by insurance schemes, but almost increase time-to-payoff for someone building or buying an airplane for commercial travel.)

But the dragons /don't/ really attack, they have a regulatory agency that constricts air travel to within certain quotas, times, and places, with various penalties for infraction going all the way up to "a dragon notices and destroys the plane and everyone onboard" (though it's more "one of the reporting apparatuses notices and informs a dragon" than a dragon actually noticing). All of that results in a chilling effect on aviation -- but not an actual /halt/ to aviation.

There was 5 helicopters chasing the party that took off from a pretty populated area. You might say it was prince being desperate, but why exactly there were 5 ready to fly helicopters in that area and no one even said "Boy, Larkspur and goverment is gonna get a nice scolding from dragons".

I write my long essay like paragraph for that exact to avoid that confusion, so that my points are explained in detail and reason for their existence is provided to the best of my effort. The worst tone i intend to convey is "Really, i don't see it like that" or "Sure, but i don't buy this explanation" or "I'm kinda doubtful". I want it to be "sassy" at worst.

I fully admit that my points especially in the early posts are kinda of a structural mess, they are probably full of typos and read like a direct mind transmission on to paper. That's why i tried to structure them more, cause someone gave that advice. Next step was to limit the number of points i bring up.

I can't really do anything about the complaint of "you act like you are right". Well, that's why i try to be detailed as to why i believe in what i believe and if i didn't think it was true to some extent why would i bother talking about it in the first place. (see already a repeat of my earlier point) I change my opinion on some stuff or somewhat, but it can't be a straight 180, otherwise i didn't have that opinion in the first place and was posting to only pointlessly say "this is bad or this is good". I'm not going to 100% agree with people, but neither should they. Thanks to some feedback i started organizing my posts somewhat better, even test posting them somewhere else to see how the formatting is, they are still a mess, but i'm slightly better at it.

Funny enough i found another, this time pretty small question to ask people about, but i will not do that, cause i promised to not ruin stuff for others. Most of my questions carried intent of "How do improve if i was an author or people i interact with would do it in their work", because i think a lot stuff in this story is world prime material for munchkinry and i would not want it to exist in those obvious ways, cause it breaks immersion in some aspects. This is the selfish aspect of my posts.

When you're at a distance reading a story, you can just say "don't give in to temptation" and then the hero won't. People who want their relationships to last shouldn't put themselves in situations where there's any possibility of trouble.

Who's your favorite pornstar?

Well, i'm kinda older than Juniper and currently single, so i wouldn't really care. I would say you have a point, but when i'm in a relationship and someone looking hot and being close is enough for me to cheat, i might as well end that relationship, cause it's going nowhere. Plus, unlike Joon i have multiple look only types that i would consider gorgeous and even when personality is a factor after some time even if the girl looks like she is my dream.

Considering Joon spent enough time with Mary already she should know better or stop lying to himself. Like every past insert paints him as caring about Tiff or girls being more than just cute dolls, but every interaction on Aerb is about "Boy she is so hot and that one is so hot too", i'm exaggerating, but he talks about how girls that he interacts with "are hot" too much.

I don't think that's true. He has, like most adolescent males, a part of his brain that's constantly nudging him to mate with attractive exemplars of the female sex, constantly reminding him that they're there (and even more, accessible if he just made the effort, or not even that in the case of Val), and constantly putting on the top of his mind their attractiveness. Despite this, Joon puts in the effort to "behave honourably", focus on the things that the group has to manage, maximise utility for the whole of Aerb, and think of his female companions like very complex people rather than the mere objects of his desire.

The only peculiarity being that the author doesn't care to mask the sexual aspect of the human experience, and I'm completely down with that.

** Putting pieces together. Most of what we get about Tiff comes from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27769455][chapter 42]]:

#+begin_quote
  “I did [like Arthur],” said Tiff. “And I knew that he liked me. I kept waiting for him to ask me out or even just confess to me, but months and months went by and he never did, and then my interest started to fade because there was this other handsome boy, so what was I supposed to do?”

  “Yeah, I am [an asshole],” said Reimer, rubbing his forearm. “This difference between the two of us is that I know I'm an asshole, and you prance around like you were his bestest friend in the whole world. You and Tiff could have told him, he'd have been upset but at least it would have spared him being made a fool of. He died a virgin, pining after her, and you were just laughing behind his back about what a moron he was.”
#+end_quote

So Arthur either didn't know or had only guessed about Tiff and Joon when he died, and she probably got the tattoo as a commemorative thing. Zona is Arthur's memory of Tiff, not Joon's. That's why she's different, Arthur didn't know her so well.

** Various thoughts- (warning - I'm a munchkin)

Sounds like Kuum Doona is not the best permanent base after all. "Tiff" seems unstable at best. If they could win her over it would be OK, but I think Amaryllis is a lost cause.

On a related note (from chapter one), CHA: Charm - How much people like you. Used to convince princesses, barter with barmaids, or plead for your life. LOL, nice use of "princess" instead of "party members". That said, I betcha that if Joon had more SOC, he would not have had any trouble using the chamber for free or having unfettered access to the fortress.

It's increasingly clear to me that MEN/magic is the thing to focus on, for a few reasons

- In general, having many different schools of physical combat is not so useful: you can't take advantage of your axe skills and bow skills at the same time, and trying to switch between them incurs a cost. However, each magic can (in general) be switched between seamlessly. Likewise, each magic taps from a different resource (although some, such as Gem, are distasteful). Still and Revision magic seem especially useful for survivability.
- Soon, 2-3 party members will have Symbiosis, so simply having the ability to use the bone magic+essentialism trick gives them a huge advantage
- It makes the party far less predictable: nobody expects the bow expert to have crazy magic skills, too.

On a related note, you really need to unlock and level as many magical skills as possible to take advantage of its potential. This is likely actually quite easy, and the party is likely to finally have the time to do it once Solace brings the locus back. In the simplest case, you just teleport into the city for the appropriate athenaum. Creep around and find an unwitting subject who's out for a night of drinking. From here, the options are endless!

- "I'm writing a novel with a water mage in it. I'd like to have a realistic training sequence... care to show me just the very first exercise you were ever taught? That's all I need, and I could make it worth your while"
- Hire a water mage for some petty task. Establish rapport in doing so. After all is done, offer more money to get a 10sec lesson.
- (act drunk, or be drunk) "Dude, my friend's totttaaallllyyy full of himself. He says he can pick up a bit of any magic just by trying the first exercise for a second or two... Wanna help us settle a bet? I'll give you $10k when I win ;-)"
- Creepy games involving using soul magic to copy the appearance of their best friend, seducing them, applying the fools choker on them, temporarily modifying values, etc
- And then just pack up ASAP and teleport to a new city. For all cases, give yourselves fake faces just to be safe. Rinse and repeat
- Getting this for fire and water magic seems like an especially good idea, in light of what I say below

After doing that for any reasonable magic, it would be a good time to consider re-speccing. Do the sacrifice again, but this time save a bit of extra skill so that you can boost skin magic as well. Re-spec out of anything that you get from symbiosis, and likely into magics and things which your team does not have access to. Use scar magic (skin boosted to high levels) + soul symbiote to give everyone scars (the soul symbiote has good synergy with this). Focusing your points into MEN gives you extra flexibility here.

Once your Soul magic is at a decent level, it might be a good idea to flip-flop your points back and forth between SOC and PHY, depending on the situation and provided that you don't lose virtues to do so.

Likewise, since they'll have time after this, it seems like a good time to start building their technology base. None of the exclusion zones are urgent matters and they have almost no immeadiate threats, so preparation is key

Perhaps the right answer to saving the locus is simply to get Grak or Joon up to super competent at Warding, and extend the interior dimensions of the bottle? Make the bottle larger on the inside and it'll be stronger, giving you more options. Or just combine Art and Essentialism on some later Sacrifice so you can interpret what the Locus' soul is telling you.

Magic is interesting in Worth the Candle, because it appears to be sorted into a relatively small number of related categories. We've only really explored the first of these in depth, but I wouldn't be surprised if magics within a category are interfaced with in similar ways...

- "soul": blood bone carapace ink pustule skin (scar, tattoo) essentialism (not quite the same)

- "force": constriction still velocity vibrational

- "elemental": fire flower glass ice steel water wind wood

- "mental" (??): gem library revision

- "unsorted" druidic gold spirit(?) ward

Speaking of Spirit, I would have expected Joon to ask for a quick lesson in the Spirit blades after the rescue. Doing so would likely unlock that telepathy trick, too.

**** That's true, but he has a number of skills that he hasn't properly unlocked yet. Given some initial book learning, he should be able to unlock still, velocity, vibrational, revision, water, and fire magic. Then also get engineering and a few of his less used combat skills maxed out. After that, he can still do normal learning through the books stored in Sable or the backpack. He would be limited by the size of the room, and given that I doubt he could max out fire or water magic, but even some simple fire spells used by multiple people could provide a nice combat advantage. There's also thinking of ways to use his current abilities better, rather than simply making them more powerful. He hasn't tapped into soul magic body enhancement significantly as of yet.

There was another comment in this thread that I think makes a better case for why Joon shouldn't go in with Amaryllis. Fenn can't go in because she would annoy Mary way too much. Amaryllis is extremely attractive to Joon, and that attraction is returned to some degree. Joon and Amaryllis living in such a small confined space together, with basically complete privacy, is potentially very bad for Joon's current relationship with Fenn. It's best for him not to put himself in the situation in the first place.

Hopefully, Fenn and Joon could use the room for a subjective month or week, where they could both train without the potential problems of Amaryllis and Joon sharing the room.

They've been thinking about it in passing but not going into detail examining it.

My brain has opinions about commas; I don't know if those opinions reflect english grammar, so take those complaints with a grain of salt. LMK if those are too opinionated, and I'll try to stick to just typos next time.

#+begin_quote
  It had been coined by Fenn, but the ‘tele-' prefix meant ‘far', and all arrows, almost by definition, were already traveling across great distances, and further, the telearrow didn't actually go any further than a normal arrow, and in fact, due to weight, balance, and worse aerodynamics, tended to go quite a bit less far.
#+end_quote

I get that it's probably intentional that this scans poorly, but maybe if some of the commas were semicolons ("distances; and further", arrow; and in fact") it wouldn't be quite that extreme? I had to read this sentence three times to parse out which clauses were independent ;p (is 'and further' about the great distances, or a variant on 'furthermore'? etc)

#+begin_quote
  Amaryllis had freed both her armors from the armor, while one hand rested gentle fingers on the glove, feeling its magic, the other held a pocketwatch, which was counting down the seconds
#+end_quote

"gentle" feels out of place there, did you mean "while one hand rested gently on the glove"?

Also feel like you need either a full stop after armor, or some kind of conjunction after the comma. "Amaryllis had freed both her arms from the armor, and while one hand rested gentle fingers on the glove, feeling its magic, the other held" seems to scan better.

#+begin_quote
  arrow fired against glass, metal, or stone, would be too likely
#+end_quote

Don't think the comma after stone should be there. "arrow fired against glass or stone would be too likely" -> "arrow fired against glass, metal, or stone would be too likely"

#+begin_quote
  which would slow down the glove-carrying shaft of the arrow. A fast-bonding adhesive would then be carefully applied to the arrow before it was fired, and ideally it was stick to a wall, which would allow Amaryllis to get out of the glove, stick herself in place with the immobility plate
#+end_quote

in 'would then be applied ... before it was fired' the then seems off, messing up the chronology; 'stick' is repeated twice in short succession (try fix?:

"A fast-bonding adhesive, applied carefully to the arrow before it was fired, would ideally stick to a wall, allowing Amaryllis to get out of the glove, fix herself in place..."

#+begin_quote
  For that, Amaryllis had specialized tools, not just ropes, pitons, and a harness, all things she'd bought way back in Barren Jewel for the assault on Caer Laga, but a wound crossbow that she loaded with a heavy arrow, the end of which was attached to a length of thing, elven-made rope that had been purchased at great expense.
#+end_quote

don't think you need a comma between thin and elven-made; the comma after 'specialised tools' should be a colon, the commas around 'all things' could be hyphens:

"specialized tools: not just ropes, pitons, and a harness - all things she'd bought way back in Barren Jewel for the assault on Caer Laga - but also a wound crossbow that she loaded with a heavy arrow, the end of which was attached to a length of thin elven-made rope that had been purchased at great expense."

#+begin_quote
  The steel-tipped arrow was fired from its specialized crossbow, hurled across the relatively short distance separating them, then broke off part of the wall where it struck and fell limply down, trailing rope behind it until Amaryllis grabbed the end and began pulling it back up to reload it.
#+end_quote

The arrow changes from object to subject in the third part of the sentence, and I feel like you need to make that explicit; "then it broke off part of the wall where it struck", maybe? As is the transition is jarring.

*** I hope that they can negotiate to keep the glove, backpack, and teleportation stone. Everything else is replaceable to one extent or other, but losing any of those three would severely hamper their ability to do anything in the future. Losing Sable means that they have about a thousand pounds of gold that they would somehow have to store in a secure location that they don't currently possess. Losing the teleportation means they have no ability to actually get out of the pit, much less move around Aerb at a non-glacial pace. And the backpack provides huge utility in it's ability to just conjure food, information, and gadgets at will. It's an almost strictly better version of the clonal kit. All three have no replacement, while losing some useful armor or a versatile weapon is harmful but only mildly effects their overall performance.
