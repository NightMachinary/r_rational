** It probably says good things about my narrative familiarity that loud warning bells went off in my mind when 'it' happened.

Perhaps a little odd that, once knowing both motive and opportunity, Cat couldn't guess (abnormally slow on the uptake) that the semi-major war asset she was escorting had been targeted in her absence until it had been pointed out to her.

Specifically:

Reader: "AHHH someone is doing things to the semi-major war asset while he's unconscious! Check that he's okay! ...What, he's suddenly barely breathing now when he was unable to sleep restfully before!? That's even worse! Why aren't you worried!?" --later-- Cat: "This man and the man who were doing something to the semi-major war asset just now are both TOOLS OF THE DEAD KING! Got it!" This man: "By the way, you seem completely clueless, but the man who was doing something to the semi-major war asset just now... DID SOMETHING TO THE SEMI-MAJOR WAR ASSET!" Cat: "What, he did something to the semi-major war asset! Oh NO! Curse my inability to put two and two together without being spoon-fed the answer by my enemy!"

(Actually, why give her warning and a dramatic standing-up at all, when the effect would be better with surprise from behind? What's the Dead King's game here, or is he being controlled by rules like the Fae were?)

In any case, more silliness before I end this edit:\\
"Hum! I realise now that you and that person who earlier fed me that weird-tasting soup were both assassins! Happily, while I still have my full health, I fear no enemy! Why are you laughing? What, you're telling me that that weird-tasting soup fed to me by that other assassin... was poisoned!? Curse the unfathomable depths of your scheming!"

*** On the other hand, we get the benefit of only seeing the most important things that happen to Cat.

That priest had a perfectly plausible reason to be there; the vast majority of the time, when one of Cat's trusted subordinates is acting slightly unusually, there's a perfectly good reason and the subordinate is not, in fact, a shape-shifting undead abomination who ate the actual trusted subordinate and took their appearance. It's not like the priest wasn't part of Cat's group, or like she gave orders that nobody approach the Apostate.

Given that her only hints were "these people have ill-fitting clothes" and "this knight went into a fight I wasn't told about", she caught on rather quickly, all things considered.

*** The Dead King is taking a few pages out of Kairos' book, or more likely the Tyrant took a few out of his. Remaining alive as an active villain requires that you stay plot-relevant, and the best way to do that is to directly interfere with the main characters and make sure your interference is known. If you avoid the heroes, you're liable to lose relevance and die offscreen. If you infiltrate their camp and never make the infiltration known, they'll be discovered at whatever time is most inopportune and you'll not gain much. If, however, you create a dramatic scene where the heroes catch on only just too late and cackle about your brilliant genius as your newest minion rises to slay your pathetic foes, you remain /highly/ relevant without endangering your physical person.

Neshamah has survived this long because he's carved out a niche as the thing which goes bump in the night. He's the greater power which could always be behind any plot (but usually isn't), the nightmare whispered of in campfire tales, and the reminder that all humanity stands forever on the edge of annihilation. This is an incredibly safe position for a villain to take, as it requires him to take very few risks. He doesn't even need to leave his Serenity to maintain that story...except when it begins to fade.

At the beginning of this tale it had been 700 years since Calernia had last heard from him. His relevance was fading into myth, and so to prevent himself from also fading he had to remind everyone why the Hidden Horror is called a Horror. He'll prosecute a brutal war, kill millions, pick up a few new Revenants, and then retreat back into the Serenity for another 700 years, the myths sustaining his Role revitalized and his position as the Greatest of Evils cemented.

And so he's going to make mistakes. Obvious ones. He's going to play up the role of the fiendish foe to five ferocious firebrands, escalate rhetorical as well as military tension, and become remembered once again as the King of Death. Because all of this is an act. His victory comes in /losing/ the war, in his foes escaping annihilation by the skin of their teeth before he's forced inch by inch into retreat, pyrrhic victories for the heroes secured each step of the way. To win this war militarily would be suicide, as that would just guarantee the raising of a Hero with a +100000000 Sword of Dead King Slaying. Losing this war, slowly, and with great sacrifice from the heroes, will win the battle in the only conflict that actually matters to him: that for his own continued existence.

**** That's his contingency plan, I think. It's not a bad one, and keeping a constant pressure makes it possible for him to dictate terms of engagement -- just as the epigraph in chapter 1 said: /"“In the conduct of war offence is commonly preferable to defence; for in attacking a general acts according to their own designs, while in defence they act according to the designs of the enemy.”/ The Grand Alliance is dancing to his tune, and since this is still the early game, he can shape the mid- and end game as he chooses.

However, consider the raising of the hero with +10 sword of DK slaying -- didn't Scorchio fit that groove perfectly? Special kind of magic that seems to disrupt the Dead King's ways, a mysterious heritage and a magical sense for plague and plague carriers. Finds a tainted village at the last hour, sacrifices his personal looks and health to prevent disaster, then is found by the premium warlord fighting the Dead King -- who just happens to share about ten thousand plot-relevant points with the kid.

Scorchio was basically a dagger with "Kil ded king pls" engraved on it, handed to Cat on a silver platter. Promptly taken out at earliest convenience. At the perfect time, later on Cat and Scorchio would be surrounded by other Named and soldiers paying attention. Before Scorchio would have probably gotten away from a direct assault or even an assassin if sent directly at him.

It blew my mind to consider that /this is what he's been doing for millennia./ There have to have been dozens, hundreds if not thousands of Named rising from his atrocities and /he killed them all and raised most as Revenants./

It also can't have been 700 years, Triumphant was something like 400 years ago? Less?

In any case, this is his best shot in all of Neshemah's existence, probably the best one he's going to get, ever, with several of his enemies also being the enemies of the Bard, the political and military situations being what they are as well as the greatest Heroes being on the rise or past their prime. The Bard's greatest plots shattered, the nets around him gone.

I believe that Neshemah might be gearing for a completely /new/ endgame. Death ruling over Calernia, a permanent Creation-residence for him shaped from half of Procer, a completely new form of existence, something like an Evil Choir? I have no idea, but I think simple existence shouldn't be considered his endgame.

***** I think Scorchio's death is an excellent example of what I'm talking about, actually. He was taken down efficiently, almost instantly, and Neshamah revealed a new resource in the process. He's taking actual existential threats very seriously and exterminating them the same way Black spent 20 years doing in Callow.

But he isn't putting the same effort into the war at large. He's being slowly pushed back into the Kingdom of the Dead. According to Cat, the Grand Alliance is seeing success on all fronts. Brutal, costly success, but success all the same. We've heared of a few Revenants like the Lord of Bones, but nothing he hasn't been known to use before.

He's had at least 400 years to experiment and develop, but he's sending the same Bones, Binds, and Revenants now as he did for Triumphant. And we know he has developed. Why isn't he sending armies of shapeshifting, amorphous undead who can eat an entire legion with barely any sign? That messenger Cat recieved back in Book 3 that impressed Masego so much, why aren't we seeing more of those? The seeded plague might be new, but a child with a barely developed gift and one unusual trick entirely neutralized it. /Neshamah isn't trying./

Just as the answer to the question, "Why didn't Voldemort owl everyone hand grenades?" was answered by, "He wasn't trying to win the war as Voldemort," the answer to the question, "Why isn't Neshamah using all his resources?" is, "Winning this war is suicide." The war is the play he's putting on, rather than an end in itself.

Could be simply because of Scorchio, and what he implies. A lull in the fighting, with the living allowed to reclaim the ground, means that Named will be found there and then, instead of during a heated battle where they come from behind to save the day. It's as simple as controlling the engagement.

In addition, he's fighting war in at least four fronts, based on the Prologue. Or more. We don't know how much he delegates, but we can probably surmise some independence in his undead.

Because they're too many to name. Hanno fought two interesting Revenants in Winter 4. Sure, they won, but they lost 20,000 in Cleves. With the Dead King using minor tactics and bottom-of-the-pile Revenants. Cat says straight off that if Razin and Aquiline meet a Revenant they're just dead.

Apologies in advance for wall of text.

- *Reliability.* Cat could have wielded a magic sword, or a crossbow or something /more advanced/ than a sword but she just wielded a regular blade. Why? Because it gets the job done, you can replace it easily and when you're expecting to fight Named, reliability and /inevitability/ is what you go for, not the flashy things, because they will break when you actually need them.
- *Resources.* If it takes him 1 effort to raise a troop of special undead and 0,0001 effort to raise a few shambling corpses, and those shambling corpses still kill some of your opponents, why on earth would you NOT spend less for more? Heck, this book started with the Dead King maybe getting a hundred or so minor undead behind enemy lines, they got into a village, slaughtered them all, raised and boom, instant army. Resources used: about zero. Resources denied to enemies: Some. Death and destruction: Gained. A few of them spreading plague for funsies, hey why not?
- *He actually does.* Cat mentions that there would have been massive casualties and collapsing fronts already. Who's to say he doesn't use those there?
- *Strategy.* You don't use your best foot everywhere. You have specialized troops for special purposes and have a generic approach for most situations. Case in point: Shield walls. Assassins, shock troops, fliers, Neshemah uses all of those, but they're force multipliers, not basic troops in an of themselves. His go-to tactic is the same Bones Ghouls and Shufflers. And why not!? It still works, and it would have eaten the north if Cat hadn't showed up.
- *Named.* We should always remember that Nessie is used to fighting a side with a large number of Named. That requires a special style. A basic pressure from zero-weight undead is more than enough if you just have enough of them. And Nessie certainly does. Named will get tired and make mistakes. All the while the regular soldiers are dying.
- *Morale.* How do you beat an enemy that doesn't stop? That just keeps coming day and night? That requires an iron will, and keep on doing that fight for years and yours will be sapped. Oh, and the /one more trick/ the Dead King has? Cat mentioned that horror is a pit, and the Dead King is slowly, inexorably, dragging everyone in it.
- *Each trick has value if played separately.* This plague thing is a bottom-of-the-pile zero-value fire-and-forget effort. Let's not forget the Dead King reminisced to the Bard how he was foolish enough in his youth to think that plague was an actual tool. His minor effort, low value off-the-cuff blow killed hundreds and could have killed thousands and ended any progress the Grand Alliance would have had for months if not a year. Neshemah can just go over his list of monstrosities slowly, each trick eating up a Hero or a Villain or a few thousand troops, all the while grinding away with his basic troops. It's a plan with inevitability, just the way he likes them.
- *Again, morale.* So someone sees a new type of ghoul or a spell or a revenant, it kills a few hundred or a few thousand /(heh, throwing that out like it's nothing)/. Then the next trick comes. And the next. And the next. It becomes a question of how many does he need vs how many does he have.

However, all of the above is chaff. The real reason he's not using super undead... is because he doesn't have to. He's got the Grand Alliance where he wants it with minimal effort and he's not in a hurry. Also, the Iron Prince mentioned that against the Dead King even a single mistake could turn into a complete disaster. So it would seem that his general method is to keep the pressure on and capitalize on any and all mistakes and win in the long run.

#+begin_quote

As I mentioned earlier, he doesn't think of plague as being anything beyond a curiosity.

  #+begin_quote
    “I was young,” Neshamah fondly remembered. “And still believed plagues to be valid method. You were quite severe in chiding me, I recall.”

This was a joke, and it still cost the Grand Alliance a Named dagger aimed at Neshemah's throat and almost cost it thousands of lives and half a year.
