** Just read your first chapter.

In order as I read:

-the comical ineptness and malice Iruka shows towards Naruto reeks of bad fanon. I think you try to justify it through the "foul chakra" reference, that Naruto somehow makes people angry at him, but I still don't think its a good plot point.

-Your Sasuke is completely different from canon, in the worst way possible. Who says this: "“You see, Sakura,” Sasuke continued,

“What you just saw was no duel. This boy attacked me, the last member of the noblest clan of the greatest country, while my back was turned.” He slammed his foot onto Naruto's left shoulder and repeated the procedure of before. “A crime that, I think you'll agree, should not go unpunished.”"

-And this: "“... and honestly, you're lucky you got off so lightly,” Sakura continued unabated. “I mean: Once Sasuke comes of age he'll be the Lord Uchiha, and you attacked him out of petty spite. They could have executed you, for that!”"

-Really?! You're going with an interpretation of clans that has 0 basis in canon and basically does nothing but make your fic dark and Sasuke comically evil.

-"The Inuzuka were half-feral themselves: They acted almost entirely on instinct, and challenging the alpha was both first and second nature to them. If this new teacher did not prove himself somehow, there would not be much done in the way of teaching before the final academy exams arrived."

-sounds weird as hell. I guess your ninjas very inhuman in mindset, which sounds... interesting, but ripe with potential for characters that are hard to sympathize with.

Chapter 2 Comments:

-"“Oh, it's just you. For a moment there I thought you were Ino, or better yet, Sasuke come at last to profess his undying love for me.”" --No one talks like this in real life. or like this:

"“This isn't one of those stupid tricks where you're pretending to ask for help with your exams, but really you're just trying to get close to me, until one day I let down my guard and in a moment of weakness allow you into my heart, is it?”"

Your descriptive writing is actually quite good, though a little overdone and lengthy. We don't need 3 paragraphs on Sakura's pink room-- one would be enough.

"Sakura's mother looked over her shoulder with a benign smile even as she was pushed out the door by her daughter. “So is that your new boyfriend? Whatever happened to that noble Uchiha boy? This one looks kind of cute too, in a dopey sort of way..."--I've never met any parent in my who is that obvious;y clueless. You're overdoing it here again.

Random comment:

-Not sure if you're trying to stick to canon, but FYI your interpretation of the substitution technique is not a canon one. In canon, substitution is high speed movement + distraction object, and its generally used when the ninja using it is substantially faster than the ninja its used against. So its a lot less useful than people think. Its not really a 'switch'-- its more "I run really fast, grab something, run back, leave it where I was, hide, and use the momentary distraction to attack from somewhere else."

-Another deviation from canon: In canon, transformations are completely physical. See: Naruto being thrown as a shuriken, Kiba and Akamaru doing a combo transformation, Naruto and Gamabunta doing a combo transformation, etc. They're just usually not that strong, so they're useful for hiding and deception but not for hitting someone. So "physical illusions like the transformation or clone technique must work by bending light as well" is not canon at all.

-Your mizuki knows far too much for a random chuunin, or really, for anyone who isn't part of the Hyuga clan.

"There was a polite cough behind him. “I'm afraid Hinata-sama's mother died from her illness a few years ago. I believe the two of them were quite close... it can't have been easy for her, growing up in that household with only her lord father and his servants to raise her"

"Though based on the rumours going around, it seems like her younger sister might replace her for that position, regardless. I'm afraid one simply cannot be the heir to Konoha's greatest remaining clan without also being a great ninja in one's own right. The clan would never accept it.”"

That's the kind of info Neji knows, Hiashi knows, Hinata knows, and the elders of the Hyuga know, but why would anyone else? That kind of stuff would be kept secret.

K, so it might sound like I hate your fic. But I don't. I'm just being super critical because I think that your writing is very technically strong (MUCH better than your prologue, IMO) but your characters and minor worldbuilding details could use work.

I'll be awaiting more updates, and good luck :)

*** Tips for becoming better at dialogue:

1) Write a script and ask people to or act it out yourself.

2) Open a novel and read the dialogue.

3) Have a fast-paced IM conversation with someone.

- “Oh, it's just you. For a moment there I thought you were Ino, or better yet, Sasuke come at last to profess his undying love for me.”

Would turn into (not correcting for character since I don't know who's speaking):

“Oh, it's just you. For a moment there I thought you were Ino--"

"Piss off."

"... or better yet, Sasuke come at last to profess his undying love for me.”

"You really talk like that, don't you? Huh."

4) Do or watch long-form improv.

5) Read a script written by Aaron Sorkin, then the script for The King's Speech. Which is more real?

6) Read whatever is the current best faithful, non-modernized translation of The Tale of Genji or Snow Country to get a feel for Japanese dialogue translated well, if you're trying to account for the Japanese background of Naruto. Anime dialogue isn't very good, generally, instead depending upon style and voice acting skill. Most people can't speak as eloquently as Japanese voice actors, so anime is a poor representation of human vocal intercourse. Hence the novel suggestions.

#+end_quote

That surprises me: I remember fanon being that everyone in the village is evil and wants to kill Naruto for no reason, except Iruka and the Third who are the only good ones.

In canon Iruka was always a bit of a prat, screaming at his students whenever they did not obey him. He only became nicer to Naruto after Naruto brought up his parents, and since that did not happen here...

I agree that the chakra thing is a bit of a weak plotpoint though.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This might be a case of YMMV. Everyone who comments keeps saying things like "X is bad, Y is good!" while forgetting that there are others who say the exact opposite. Remember, canon Sasuke was just as divisive amongst the fanbase.

I'll tone Sasuke down a little, as well as the reference to the Inuzuka.

#+begin_quote
  In canon, substitution is high speed movement + distraction object
#+end_quote

I'm aware of the original explanation given by Sakura, but Kishi completely contradicts this when characters use it to teleport out of their restraints (Sasuke vs Kakashi, Pain vs Jiraiya...) So I have to make it consistent somehow.

Given that both replacement and body-flicker are described as involving high speed movement, I think my interpretation is reasonable.

#+begin_quote
  In canon, transformations are completely physical.
#+end_quote

Kinda true (It's actually more like a shadowclone 'shell' around the user that breaks when damaged), but the problem with this is that such a power is completely gamebreaking, and it's never explained what the limitations of such a power would be. As such I elected to nerf it to prevent it from dominating the story.

Considering that regular clones definitely /are/ purely illusory, again I think it makes sense to say that the two techniques work in more or less the same way.

#+begin_quote
  Your mizuki knows far too much for a random chuunin
#+end_quote

Ah, but this is rational!Mizuki, and I bet someone like Kabuto would know at least as much.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Cheers! Again though, it's surprising to read this because I have had at least one author that I respect tell me that the prologue is much better written than chapters 1-3!

**** Transformation is not game breaking at all.

1. Breaks easily unless you have a special technique like a combo technique like Kiba and Akamaru or Naruto and Gamabunta. Those special combination techniques seem to relatively limited in usefulness or costly (Kiba doesn't use his 3 headed wolf thing all the tone-- it's a finishing technique.)

2. Ninja fights involve lots of physical impact, so if something breaks easily, and it hits an enemy that can withstand being punched into solid rock, take down giant bears, jump 30 feet at minimum (all part 1 Sasuke feats) then that technique isn't useful for anything except stealth. And in fact, thats what it's used for. Naruto, probably the most skilled user of it, uses it to trick enemies until he can deliver a finishing blow. Ways to counter: passwords, code words (ala Chunin exams).

So I don't see how it's game breaking.

You're right about inconsistency of substitution, but those uses are very rare and it's generally only used against opponents that are much slower than the ninja using the substituon-- Kakashi vs the demon brothers, orochimaru vs Sasuke in the Chunin exams, etc. All ninja can escape from restraints pretty easily-- see Sasuke escapinf Naruto tying him up in early canon. So it's not inconceivable for someone to quickly untie themselves and substitute to trick an enemy.

Re: clones

The academy technique is illusory but every other clone tech uses is solid in some way.

Re: shadow clones

They have varying levels of durability. Early Naruto shadow clones break easily. End game Naruto shadow clones (in fight against kaguya and against Sasuke) survive immense damage. Seems to be a matter of number of clones made and the skill of the user.

Re: writing

The prologue felt very stylized, like faux!mythic, and while that style can be good, it's usually overdone. IMO you're a great writer when you stick to the regular style, but it's hard for anyone to write a long scene with mythic style.

Re: Sasuke

Canon!Sasuke, until the Kage Summit arc, is very sympathetic. He's honorable, brave, never needlessly kills someone, but also kind of a sarcastic jerk sometimes. Here he comes across as a pretentious jerk who relies on his clan name for respect. Very few good qualities. In canon he isn't interested in social domination or respect. Here he loves it. Completely opposite characters.

*** Canon of that show is pants-on-head retarded. It embraces all the worst shonen anime tropes with a zeal I've not seen before or since. One character with any development, (Sasuke, and he has a shitty character arc) a nonsenical world domination plot that relies on the power of narrative causality, ignoring whatever in-universe rules previously detailed so the MC can power up with power of FRIENDSHIP/DREAMS, and plot holes the size goddamned Hummers. Attempts to make the story a bit less dumb are commendable.

**** I disagree with most of your statements. There are some plot holes near the end that were poorly foreshadowed, like kaguya and zetsu, but overall I thought the series held together pretty well. There's a Naruto reread thread on spacebattles that shows how much of the criticism of the show is, actually, quite wrong. I recommend check it out, or rereading the manga yourself.

I'm also not sure why you think no one had character development except Sasuke. Counter examples: Naruto, Sakura, 'Hinata to some degree, Gaara. All changes from part 1 to part 2 and changed even more during the end of part 2.

***** In defence of Tracers' claims:\\
1) Naruto IS typical shonen, but that's also why it's so popular as an intro to anime.\\
2) Characters do have development, but most only have the extremely lazy "start out bad, then turn good" character arc. Look at Neji: Starts out as promising character, then is turned into a Naruto fan through the power of face-punching, then... nothing.\\
3) The world domination plot is indeed idiotic: The moment Madara actually TRIED he succeeded in capturing all 9 beasts in a matter of minutes, yet he makes his plot that convoluted?. Throughout the whole story the main villain, who was unkillable and could teleport anywhere instantly, took 16 years to do... nothing.\\
4) Power use is often clever and interesting, but they are also forgotten or invented as the plot demands.

I love Naruto for the setting, the great fights and of course magic ninjas, but it certainly does have big weaknesses!

** Nothing in the three chapters has captured my interest or differentiated this from other Naruto fanfiction. In other words, you need a stronger hook.

I can tell you are putting good effort into it. I'd like to see what you have in store.
