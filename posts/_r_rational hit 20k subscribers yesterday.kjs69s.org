** What's our engagement like? Are there any websites that can scrape subreddits and say how many accounts are active at any give time (e.g. a sliding window checking for 2 or more posts in a 2 month period, or something). Though I guess lurkers shouldn't be discounted, either (nor users who browse without accounts --- is there any way to check unique pageviews or other analytics?).

The sidebar says 89 people are currently active, though /it is/ Xmas eve haha. That's about as many usernames as I might vaguely recognize from here, personally. I'd also wonder how many “subscribers” correspond to individual posters, too (I've probably used maybe half a dozen + accounts in over a decade of posting on Reddit, all of which would be subscribed to here haha).

**** I would guess a lot of people come from the Bay Area, since that's where the broader neo-“rationality” movement is centered. Or maybe at least the Western US Seaboard. Over half of Reddit looks to come from US / Canada, at any rate.

*** I think that's what "X users here now " is for. That said, I haven't found anything good in the submissions recently, so I've stopped looking at them. The weekly threads are really the only thing I occasionally check.

**** Gotcha --- I always thought that was for a narrower window, like how many people might be logged in with a tab open in the last 12h or something (as in, those users are “actively” looking at the front page). Googling quickly I can't seem to find a reliable answer though haha.

These days I mostly just stick to the Monday rec thread, too, alongside occasional periodically updating fics that get top-level posts.

Though I don't think they track the "users here now" number, but there a bunch of other similar stats.

***** Sigh. It's a joke, a copypasta. I thought this post needed some livening up. It's always a coin flip whether these will be understood as a joke or taken seriously

****** Ah. I did wonder about that, but decided it didn't look that way. Are you interested in improving your model of whether a joke would work? If yes, I think some constructive feedback might be helpful.

I think the reasons this one didn't work in my case (which may or may not be the reasons it didn't work for [[/u/liquidmetalcobra][u/liquidmetalcobra]] et al.) are as follows:

1. The template/pattern isn't very common. I've never seen this copypasta before, and TrendingBOT isn't a very familiar presence/annoyance to me. I imagine if you'd used something very cliché like the Navy Seal Copypasta, or if your target was one of these spelling-correction bots, it would've worked better.

2. It wasn't over-the-top enough; it seemed too genuine. I don't see TrendingBOT very often, and so I don't expect /others/ to see it very often, which made it seem plausible that someone mistook its post for a non-bot post. And if it /was/ a non-bot post, I would've had a similar if significantly less emotional reaction ("is it really so important that we need to have a top-level post about it?"). If the copypasta expressed not mere extreme annoyance, but an overblown, melodramatic, totally implausible tale about how this post ruined your life, I think it would've worked better.

Well, take it or leave it.

******* I do appreciate the feedback! Other people have said things similar to point 1 before, but that's just how I meme, I purposely avoid the most common ones. That does mean they land less often, but that's the risk I have to take!

Now that I'm thinking about it I've had more success using ones bragging about how smart I am, using stupid examples. They still get downvoted usually but they get much more fun replies.

2 is funny because in my mind, that's exactly what I thought would make it obvious! No one would actually have an emotional reaction to a post like this, so I thought it /was/ over the top. Crazy that it had the exact opposite effect!

Now that's the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] experience I like to see: a sharp turn from a hostile exchange to reasonable discussion once a misunderstanding is cleared up.

Hmm. The pattern I matched it to was people being aggressive at "clueless outsiders", which happens pretty often. Consider the following examples:

- Someone asking a question about a local topic, of the sort that you feel they really should know the answer to. (E. g., "why are you bothered by plot holes?".)

- Someone unselfconsciously expressing a weird, unpopular opinion.

- Someone being loudly enthusiastic about something perceived as irrelevant.

All of these betray not only a deviation from the in-group's shared beliefs and knowledge, but /ignorance/ of it. And if it's done publicly/visibly enough, it seems as if this /outsider/ feels /entitled/ to the in-group's attention or endorsement, despite failing to spend any time researching it or understanding what it's "about".

It's one thing when someone openly and knowingly disagrees with the tribe: this still shows they're engaging with it, invites grudging respect and counterarguments. Similarly, if someone asks a stupid question, or goes on a rant about something weird, but /shows understanding/ that the question is stupid/the rant is weird, that would often be given a pass. But an unselfconscious, public show of ignorance of the tribal norms combined with a digression from them in a weird, low-status direction? That marks one an acceptable target, invites /mockery/. And this is what it felt like you were doing: targeting someone for caring strongly (so strongly as to make an entire post about it) about something as lowly and unimportant as the number of people subscribed to this subreddit.

Looking back... Ironically, that made (in my eyes) your original comment an example of the very thing it was supposed to be punishing: it looked like you thought you were representing the will of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] in enthusiastically putting TrendingBOT down, while I knew you were totally off the mark, which made /me/ want to put /you/ down. Shame on me.
