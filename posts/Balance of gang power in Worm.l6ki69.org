I'm rereading it (I think this is the third time through), and something jumped out at me which I'm sure has been brought up but I've never encountered an explanation before: There seems to be a gross power disparity between Brockton Bay's gangs. At the start of the story, there are three known major players in town: the Merchants, the ABB, and Empire 88. The first two have three super-powered members apiece, while E88 has ... crikey, I lost count, and can't be bothered to check the Worm Wiki. Leaving out Purity who quit a while back, you've got Kaiser, Hookwolf, Night, Fog, Fenja, Menja, Rune, Othala, Stormtiger, Cricket, Victor, Crusader, and probably some others I've forgotten. The Neo-Nazis have at least twice as much muscle as the other two gangs put together.

This situation would be understandable if E88's capes were a lot of low-rent bums like Uber and Leet, but pretty much all of them are quite powerful. By comparison, all three of the Merchants are pretty meh; I could picture Stormtiger and Cricket taking a day off to liquidate them. The ABB are better, but it's hard to picture even Lung standing up to all that concentrated firepower. Kaiser did pretty well with just his valkyries for backup. Bakuda and Oni Lee are dangerous, but again not insurmountable. Those other gangs are competition for criminal market share, leaving aside Skidmark being black and the ABB being explicitly nonwhite. This equilibrium should have collapsed in favor of Nazi domination some time ago, especially before Purity quit. Anybody care to venture why it didn't?


** Aside from all the issues of who beats who under what circumstances, you're forgetting the most important faction: the Protectorate. They're the strongest locally and have massive power they can call in. Any potential fight against other factions needs to be planned out to: be worthwhile (is the territory worth the losses), be winnable, AND not bring down the Protectorate.

Fight takes too long? Protectorate. Too close leaving your faction weak? Protectorate. Too much collateral damage? Protectorate, maybe even a national response.

The Protectorate are the ones in story that have to condone major faction wars for them to happen such as vs the ABB. They're also generally trying to preserve cape numbers, so cape murder would draw their focus. Later they lose a lot of power and get manipulated, but at that point things are overall breaking down.

Other considerations: ABB capes are powerhouses and have powers that lend themselves to larger fights. Bringing more people makes Lung stronger faster and Bakuda's bombs hit more people. Oni Lee is also a nightmare in larger fights with explosives and friendly fire, but is even more concerning if he's out assassinating people in daily life. E88 might be able to ambush them, but there's a lot of ways it could go very wrong.

The Merchants are too good at running and being annoying. They aren't worth the hassle to hunt down for bad territory.

*** Another significant consideration would be that E88 are openly white nationalists and admirers of fascism. All of the strength that OP is describing is likely necessary to allow them to be a major player in Brockton Bay /at all./ Their willingness to be relatively passive is why they can remain a major player.

The need for strict cops-and-robbers is even greater for them because their optics are terrible from the start and they represent a /political/ threat to the status quo as well as a criminal one. The background of their group would be fascinating to explore as well as the idea of politically radical parahumans.

*** The Merchants are a direct affront to Kaiser's stated values (admittedly, Nazis can be hypocrites), and as Skitter finds out, you can't hold territory without standing to protect it. As for the ABB, in practice they have a mixed record. Bakuda is sufficiently unhinged that she fails in an ambush against the Undersiders minus Bitch and under circumstances where Skitter is both reluctant to use her power and hampered in its execution. Effectively, she was fighting pre-fridge Grue and Regent (minor power only) with intel support from Tattletale and limited help from Skitter. While aided by a small army.

Oni Lee is more of a problem, but against the sheer number and variety concerned I don't see him winning. Oni Lee vs. Night and Fog? IIRC he needs line of sight to teleport somewhere. And of course Skitter knocks Lung out twice, bio/chem attacks being a significant weakness, and you'd think somebody would have figured that out with such a substantial problem staring them in the face. What happens when Lung breathes Fog? Has Stormtiger never tried to waft a whole tank of sarin gas into his airway?

As for escalation and the Protectorate, you have the problem that Bakuda and Lung's powers are both inherently escalating factors. Bakuda always causes collateral damage and Lung basically turns into Godzilla. The situation should at least have degraded to the point where it required PRT intervention some time ago. Some of Kaiser's obnoxious ubermenschen should have gotten angry and wiped out an ABB cadre, forcing retaliation by Lung taking out a couple of city blocks.

(this is sort of an omnibus reply, since I'm outnumbered in this argument; I think you cover most of the others' objections thus far, and apologies for those I've missed)

**** Actually, re: Lung, a few other objections apply. First, it seems to me that another natural counter to Lung is to apply force so rapidly that he cannot be expected to grow bigger to compensate in time. Given Bakuda's talent for devices which do that, plus her instability and megalomania, I would expect Lung to have died some time ago.

Failing that, it may be that the ABB's natural nemesis is not E88 but Coil, because Coil has hired the Travelers. A fun Lung prank:

1. Find out when Lung is going to be outdoors at a known location, or arrange for him to do so.
2. Put Trickster on location in disguise.
3. Hire a small plane to fly overhead and drop a mannequin from a significant height.
4. Trickster!

This may be repeated indefinitely if it fails, varying the height to see what works best. Coil may use his power to deny Lung experience with these attempts, or just do it repeatedly and let him remember so he develops a crippling fear of appearing in public. If he does happen to grow bigger for the few seconds he's aloft, the beautiful thing is that gravity scales up against its opponent too.

(if Coil gets bored doing it with Trickster, a variant would involve Ballistic and a fully-loaded semi truck, but this has limitations)

***** You appear to be going from the misconception that Lung's baseline is "normal human" and he gets stronger with his transformation, but he actually starts from a powerful parahuman with the inhuman toughness and rapid regeneration as a baseline and only gets stronger from there, to where he can rival Endbringers.

Also, Skitter didn't knock out Lung by herself. His healing was fighting off her toxins (he was defeated, yes, but not knocked out yet, the Undersiders ran) and then Armsmaster used his specially made tranqs which took him out

It's very much, kill him on the very first moment of the fight or you lose. He took a blow from Leviathan that destroys his bones and organs and was back into it moments later before being anywhere close to Leviathan's size. At half-leviathan size he could outheal Leviathan. He survived one of Scion's golden light blasts.

****** And yet a dab of Newter's psychoactive goo puts him under in seconds when he's big enough to weigh over a ton, and fighting mad to boot; it's roughly equivalent to spraying an elephant in the eye with a dash of fentanyl and having it fall over. Following that, having his eyes gouged out is implied to be something that he will take a long time to recover from. Let's face it, Lung's powers of regeneration are poorly and inconsistently defined.

I proceed under the assumption that, if Ballistic sent that semi full of bricks accelerating into him at hundreds of mph from point blank--easy enough to arrange with Trickster--he would have pretty much all of his internal organs liquefied in half a second, and consequently die.

Also, why does Coil want Lung dead? Again, he's got long-term plans which involve the world not ending and could probably benefit from Lung, one of the most powerful Parahumans, still existing.

For the territory? Yeah he could probably take much of the city, but to what end? He has infinite money thanks to being both short and long whatever stock he wants. He keeps his operation relatively small.

******** 1. I'm saying Lung's durability varies so wildly for story purposes that you can't stake a clear position on what would or would not take him down. I assume the Trickster-Ballistic scenario would snuff him (starting from baseline) because anybody who couldn't be snuffed by that would be practically indistinguishable from Alexandria and he doesn't get treated as quite that heavy of a hitter.

2. E88 still should have dominated through simple numbers--Lung can't be everywhere at once and isn't particularly clever or effective as a leader. Also, again, intrinsically escalating power. Kaiser, by contrast, seems perfectly competent at leadership.

3. Coil's whole schtick is to take over the city, which he does. He emphatically doesn't have infinite money; he dies because he runs dry and Tattletale can outspend him. If anything, he might have challenged the Empire via the Travelers, but they're very new to the area and have their own agenda.

However, the single likeliest outcome would still be Bakuda wasting her boss to take over. She can (don't tell me her bombs can kill Crawler but not baseline Lung) and she's certainly crazy enough to try.

Bakuda has triggered and been recruited very recently:

  I shook my head, “I know about Oni Lee, and Grue mentioned fighting him. I've never heard of Bakuda.”

  Armsmaster nodded, “Not surprising. She's new. What we know about her is limited. She made her first appearance and demonstration of her powers by way of a drawn out terrorism campaign against Cornell University. Lung apparently recruited her and brought her to Brockton Bay after her plans were foiled by the New York Protectorate. This is... something of a concern.”

** I think you are somewhat misguided in labeling The Merchants a major player. At the start of the story Faultline, Coil and the Travelers are bigger players and the Travelers are ultimately Coil's henchmen.

I went back to 5.01, the chapter when all non-ABB villain factions in Brockton sit down to discuss the ABB, to check and I feel the pecking order is made pretty clear.

  Another group arrived, and it was like you could see a wave of distaste wash over the faces in the room. I had seen references on the web and news articles about these guys, but they weren't the sort you took pictures of. Skidmark, Moist, Squealer. Two guys and a girl, the lot of them proving that capes weren't necessarily attractive, successful or immune to the influences of substance abuse. Hardcore addicts and dealers who happened to have superpowers.

  Skidmark wore a mask that covered the top half of his face. The lower half was dark skinned, with badly chapped lips and teeth that looked more like shelled pistachio nuts than anything else. He stepped up to the table and reached for a chair. Before he could move it, though, Kaiser kicked the chair out of reach, sending it toppling onto its side, sliding across the floor.

  “The fuck?” Skidmark snarled.

  “You can sit in a booth,” Kaiser spoke. Even though his voice was completely calm, like he was talking to a stranger about the weather, it felt threatening.

  “This is because I'm black, hunh? That's what you're all about, yeah?”

  Still calm, Kaiser replied, “You can sit in a booth because you and your team are pathetic, deranged losers that aren't worth talking to. The people at this table? I don't like them, but I'll listen to them. That isn't the case with you.”

  “Fuck you. What about this guy?” Skidmark pointed at Grue, “I don't even know his name, and he's sitting.”

  Faultline answered him, “His team hit the Brockton Bay Central Bank a week ago. They've gone up against Lung several times in the past and they're still here, which is better than most. Not even counting the events of a week ago, he knows about the ABB and he can share that information with the rest of us.” She gave Grue a look that made it clear that he didn't have a choice if he wanted to sit at the table. He dipped his head in the smallest of nods in response. We'd discussed things beforehand and agreed on what details we'd share.

  “What have you done that's worth a seat at this table?” she asked Skidmark.

  “We hold territory-”

  “You hold nothing,” Grue answered, raising his voice, his powers warping it, “You're cowards that hold onto the areas nobody else cares about, making drugs and selling them to children.”

  “We sell to everyone, not just-”

  “Find a booth,” Grue's echoing voice interrupted him. Skidmark gave him a look, then looked at the others sitting around the table. All still, every set of eyes he could see behind the masks was staring him down.

  “Assholes. Puckered, juicy assholes, all of you,” Skidmark snarled, stomping off to the booth where his teammates already sat.
#+end_quote

The Merchants are literally denied a seat at the table. The same table the Undersiders, a bunch of teenagers with one or two jobs under their belts, have a seat at.

The Merchants would go on to /become/ a major player, but only because they didn't show up for Leviathan and were able to exploit the damage inflicted by the Endbringer on infrastructre and other gangs. Even then, they only lasted a few weeks before being casually massacred.

Regardless, you are right that there is a serious imbalance in Brockton Bay. Empire 88 has more capes, and strong ones, then any other villain faction except Coil and Coil is deliberately obfuscating how many capes work for him. E88 even has international support from a nazi group in germany.

The ABB has been able to hold out against them mostly because, as others have said, Lung can stalemate almost anyone almost all the time and that is all you really /need/ when the PRT showing up will end most fights.

But it's important to note that the chaos in Brockton during the time of the story is essentially kicked off by the ABB making a power grab and getting crushed.

But the ABB is literally just Lung. Lung can take on the entire E88 roster at once and not lose. Lung fought Leviathan to a standstill until Japan sunk under his feet

He didn't win, but he didn't die either and against an Endbringer that's saying something.

Lung is an A tier parahuman. None of the other gang members are even B tier except maybe Bakuda, who is in his gang, and Othala who gets bonus points for being a healer. The next closest is likely Hookwolf, who is apparently super tanky.

The rest have generic ' only good at street level fights' powers. No major game changers.

** If I had to venture a guess, I would say that short of outright genocide there's no way to really eradicate every single other gang. What I mean is, we know E88, ABB, and the Merchants are the big names /right now/, but we don't know much about what Brockton Bay looked like five years ago. It could be that E88 has destroyed other gangs in the past. But there are still people in town who, being otherwise inclined to start or join a gang, can't or refuse to join E88. And there are still neighborhoods. Am I remembering right that Lung had a HQ in something akin to Chinatown? I can't imagine that E88 would /care/ what was going on there.

Ultimately, they're not really in competition for criminal market share, either, in a couple of ways. Firstly, in that people exist who want to do criminal trade (drugs or whatever) who can't or won't go to E88. Merch and ABB fill those gaps without actually taking anything from E88. Secondly, in that they might not be involved in the same - or all of the same - criminal enterprises. Again, consider neighborhoods. It doesn't do the Empire any good to try to run a protection racket in a neighborhood where they have no presence, so the others doing that doesn't cost them anything. If the Empire is all about prostitution, someone else selling drugs doesn't cost them anything. (Obviously this is oversimplified, but you get my meaning.)

So, yes, it would be entirely possible for the Empire to roflstomp the other gangs without much effort, but aside from their own prejudice and willingness to commit hate crimes there's not necessarily anything to be gained for them by doing so. Especially when running a cape-fueled gang war on that scale has a non-zero chance of attracting the attention of the Protectorate on a level that can't be swept under the rug. Even if they could survive that, it's the kind of thing that makes life very expensively worse, makes business harder to do (because they'll keep picking off your minions), and just overall a bad time.

The ABB is, as someone else has already said, literally all Lung. The rest, especially the normies, is commentary.

The Merchants were a non-entity, as you would expect.

There's also the fact that the E88 has no way of holding non-white neigborhoods without extermination. No amount of capes will stop the people from simply murdering gang members out of self preservation. Especially a Neo-Nazi gang that hates their existence and will only brutally oppress them. The only way the Empire could've dominated is if they weren't Neo-Nazis.

If the E88 did try they would quickly veer into the territory of actions that would unite Brockton Bay as well as maybe even bringing the greater Protectorate on them.

** Does the E88 actually participate in organized crime? The ABB is stated to do all the usual crimes and has sex trafficking shown in the text. The Merchants are almost entirely characterized by how they relate to the drug trade. The E88 hands out cushy jobs at Medhall to compensate its toadies, but it sounds like Medhall's revenue streams are all actual legitimate business. There's a dog fighting ring, but even that seems like it's Hookwolf's pet project and not a major part of the organization.

It could just be that they're not really a rival to these other gangs in material terms. Beating up random minorities is core to their ideology, so they have to posture like they're actually fighting the other gangs for control. But at the same time, do they actually want to win the rights to sell drugs in a predominantly minority neighborhood? Or are they just going to make a show of force, move on, and then control of illegal activity in that territory goes back to the status quo?

Then again, Wildbow repeatedly mentions the E88 having "territory" or "turf," so maybe he assumed the E88 was actually doing something with it. Or he realizes they don't do anything, but Taylor doesn't.

Another possibility is that the E88 was always split into the factions we see after they lose their leader, so they didn't actually have the unified purpose and ability to deliver a unified strike that they liked to pretend they did.

  The people that had come in with Purity were other members of Empire Eighty Eight.  Krieg, Night, Fog and Hookwolf.   It was interesting to see, because as far as I'd known, while every one of them had been a member of Empire Eighty Eight at some point in time, Purity had gone solo, while Night and Fog had splintered off to form their own duo in Boston not long after.  All reunited, apparently.

  That wasn't even Kaiser's entire team.  Aside from the rare exception like Lung reaching out to Bakuda when she'd been at Cornell, it seemed that most groups recruited new members from within their own city.  Kaiser was different.  He was one of the better known American villains with a white supremacist agenda, and people sharing his ideals were either recruited from other states or they came to him.  Most didn't stay with him for too long, for whatever reason, but it still made him the Brockton Bay resident with the most raw parahuman muscle at his beck and call.

** In addition to the good points already raised, E88 politically finds the presence of minority gangs to be beneficial to them. Non-cape white residents who fear the ABB and Merchants are more likely to support or at least tolerate the E88, and may even become radicalized by the threat of those gangs.

Kaiser may speak a mean game against minority capes - he may even mean it - but he has a good reason to hold off on his ultimate goals for at least a while longer.
