***** Have you read Charles Stross' [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html][/Accelerando/]]? /Rapture of the Nerds/ can be likened to the story of those left behind on Earth during the events of /Accelerando/. They aren't the same universe by far, but it's a useful comparison, and provides a link to a story in a similar universe but a different perspective.

*** +Eh, I don't know...+

Wait, no, I was thinking of /Makers/ (which has a significant Disney plot too). Great book, but not utopian at all.

I have a significant Doctrow reading list, and this just moved up just behind the last third of /Pirate Cinema/.

**** You don't consider it utopian? Why? It seems to have all the general hallmarks of a standard utopian society. You are immortal to the point where if your sick you can get a new body, you can work on anything and be rewarded for it in a non-abitrary way, there is a near endless supply of resources, and its all self-governing.

Also I loved /Pirate Cinema/, and learned quite a bit from it as well. I think my favorite one at the moment is /Little Brother/.

***** I don't consider it utopian. It's not post-scarcity, injustice and brutality still occur, there isn't true health, and governance is external.

#+begin_quote
  You are immortal to the point where if you're sick you can get a new body
#+end_quote

The "new body" technique in /Makers/ had significant downsides for the early adopters, including having to eat ~9000 calories per day and eventual metabolic failure.

#+begin_quote
  you can work on anything and be rewarded for it in a non-abitrary way,
#+end_quote

Only if you gain attention and support from a community willing to support you. It's already true today. It's how the FOSS world operates.

#+begin_quote
  there is a near endless supply of resources
#+end_quote

Why set up shop in a garbage dump, then? Why were people living in the slums? If there were truly endless resources, if we truly lived in a post-scarcity society, then there would be no economic reason for poverty as seen in /Makers/.

#+begin_quote
  it's all self-governing.
#+end_quote

But is it, though? If I recall correctly, the federation of printed museums had legal issues, meaning that there was governance outside of the free-market systems depicted in the majority of the novel. By those standards, we're already in a self-governing system. And if we're in a self-governing system, why did that one maker get shot in the face with a rubber bullet?

If you want a truer utopian society, try /Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom/, where body replacements are available, scarcity isn't a problem, rewards are reputational (Whuffie is a neat currency idea), and everything is an ad-hoc-racy.

PeridexisErrant got /Makers/ and /Down and Out in The Magic Kingdom/ confused, but didn't beleive that the lather was still a utopia story. Makers is most certainly not Utopia, though it does raise some interesting questions about information value, group think, and story structure.

Edit: Also Whuffie is an incredible idea, like reddit on a grand scale. I wouldn't mind paying for things with karma.

** In the unusual but excellent category, I have to reccomend /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To the Stars]]/.

It's a far-future AU of /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/, which went through WW3 before achieving post-scarcity space colonisation. Everything was going beautifully until the aliens started attacking...

Of note: fantastic worldbuilding, treatment of bioenhancement (mental and physical), Friendly AI thanks to a Wish, and the main characters from the anime - now 400+ years old - being terrifyingly competent compared to the young main character. Humanity basically got the good ending... and then sideswiped by aliens.

Magical girls only showed themselves in public after the aliens attacked. Before then, they merely ran a lot of companies from the shadows. You could say that it was a realistic projection of the future, but everything changed when the Pseudocephalopods attacked.

** I think Friendship is Optimal comes closest when it comes to a single individual's well-being and values. Once you get over the initial shock, you could live in that kind of world for a long, long time. And it seems truly fun. The only bad things are that the world doesn't seem to have any true randomness, they don't have access to the real world, and they aren't "free" the way I understand freedom.

**** I actually don't think it's that strange. I mean, the 'Superhappies' utopia in Three Worlds Collide is even more different and some people have still defended it. I have the feeling that if you seriously started implementing the [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition][Coherent Extrapolated Volition]] of humanity and let it reach its conclusion, FiO utopia would be child's play when compared to that - which is an argument against FiO utopia of course.

#+end_quote

Some people will defend anything. Some people have defended Robin Hanson's Malthusitopia of uploads. You should ask yourself whether these people value what you value, and whether or not you can consider them ethically rational, /before/ considering their defenses/endorsements to be genuine evidence in favor of some particular scenario.

I mean, as long as we're talking ponies, plenty of people have actually endorsed the nastier versions of /The Conversion Bureau/. That doesn't mean those stories aren't /blatantly, genocidally evil/ and /outright bullshit written by misanthropes/.

(My apologies for the vehemence, as I really quite like canon!MLP and can't stand seeing it mixed with genocidal evil.)
