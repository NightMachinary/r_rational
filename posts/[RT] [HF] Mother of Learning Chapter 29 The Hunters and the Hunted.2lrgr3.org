** This fic is an absolute delight.

Is Red Robe hunting down the soul magicians? If so, why hasn't he gotten around to Silverlake yet? When he does, will he find Zorian? :E

The wolf shifter tribe seems like it will be a very interesting plotline. I look forward to seeing that explored. And will it have any relation to the Silver Legend? That description almost begs "werewolf" ...

This world is just so rich; I can tell the author has spent a lot of time mapping it out. Kudos to them!

*** There's one case with clear MO of Red Robe (the man found with no apparent cause of death), but others are not so clear. For example, the very first man is missing for two month when it's not even the end of the loop. And there's no corpses in most cases, just missing people. Why would Red Robe go to extra trouble of hiding the bodies (every restart!)?

All this may imply that someone was snatching soul magic specialists /before/ the loop. Maybe even to setup this very loop.

Yeah, every legend is true and all. I am looking forward to learning more. It is an amazing world.

**** Teleporting to them could be difficult, since Zorian won't know where they were at the start of the loop. Alternately, they could just have been killed before the time loop started, since Red Robe doesn't appear to like using Soul Kill that much, as he hasn't just used it on everyone who might oppose him

If they were killed just before the loop started that would be interesting information and it would be worth researching who did it.

We have some evidence that Silverlake is non-trivially hidden, and little to no evidence that that's the case for the others.

** And now I'm thinking about all the ways to enchant a rifle.

Strengthened barrel. Magically straightened barrel. If you linked a divination spell of where it would hit to a dancing light spell, you would have a magical laser sight. Build in a cleaning spell and a cooling spell to let you shot more rapidly. Alchemical hollow point ammo...

*** I think the main issue is that he needs to kill a super tough magical spider. A tougher barrel or better aiming isn't going to do that. He could enchant himself to aim better if necessary for that.

He could just make his own gun. A cannon isn't that hard to make, especially if it only needs to fire once.

**** I'd say Zoltan needs to get or replicate with magic something akin to modern anti-materiel rifle (or WW2 anti-tank rifle) to get effective firearm against the spider.

And to do that he mostly needs to increase projectile speed (assuming it has decent 8-10 mm caliber already).

And with that stronger barrel would help as it allows for bigger charge.

****** Shrug off /civilian/ firearms, IIRC. If Zorian can make something big enough, it should work.

Also, it seems that the thing should be easy to lead into a trap. It avoids dangerous glyphs and moves towards harmless ones -- you've got a herding mechanic there.

******* He doesn't have any gun making skills. It could take him months to make a good enough gun. That was why I suggested he make a quick dirty cannon which serves as little more than a metal container containing some explosive which fires a lot of metal pellets at something. Single use. Or he might be able to steal a legacy cannon from somewhere, something old enough that the military don't care.

The trapping might be doable, but it could take an alternate route- it is shockingly agile, you can't really herd it to a predesignated route that easily. You know it will be somewhere in the area of the weak magic but not specifically which tree it will take, and trapping everywhere may be a bit beyond his skills. For that I'd probably want to recruit an expert trapper to help him.

**** I'm not thinking he will create a modification that applies spell formulas onto the bullets. It could have several different effects which he could select by using a dial. Then he could use mana crystals to charge the bullets. This negates him needing to make the bullets himself.

*** No. And I don't think I could, even if I wanted to - while the setting is heavily inspired by D&D, it really doesn't follow its rules. The mages use a CRPG-style mana bar instead of spell slots, there is no easy healing anywhere, there is no xp cost for making magic items (only time, mana and materials), everyone is basically a glass cannon (no levels and corresponding bonus HP), non-mages are fundamentally disadvantaged against spellcasters with nothing to balance it out, etc.

I /will/ write up the setting as the story goes on, and will probably post it upon the end of the story on some site or wiki - but it will be pure fluff. Nothing playable, I'm afraid.

**** A sort of adaptation like yours isn't that uncommon.

[[http://www.narutod20.com/downloads/]]

There's a Naruto rpg. It deals with the sorts of issues you mention, as does the source material, d20 modern.

1. [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/magic/spellPoints.htm]] spell points are a common variant of the magic system.

2. Shields would replace HP and provide 'easy healing'. They're a durable protection that can regenerate fast.

3. There is actually an 'xp' cost for spells as I note below.

Not that you have to or should, but it wouldn't be that hard to adapt dnd rules to your setting.

I'd probably replace levels with mentorship. You do killing monsters and jobs and such and get xp. This xp can be spent on spells and magical items. Each set of spells and magical items and stats unlocks a level with a particular mentor which grants various benefits like new resources, new books with reduced costs for certain things. If you're spending your time making magical items you're focusing your effort and experience on doing that and it's assumed that whatever advice and experience you get from your mentor will be focused around that magical item. Generally, as you move up the circles you'll gain access to increasing resources and prestige.

Wouldn't be that hard to make one.

*** I have been trying to write it up for D&D and initially made a system in D&D and it sucked because in trying to get a vague match you needed loads of absurd mechanics. In compromising to make it truer to the story ethics and system it turned out very not D&D like.

I'm doing a roleplay of it now though.

*** I have never read a superhero comic in my life, other than a couple of issues of batman as a kid (I was not impressed). Superhero comics were never very big in Croatia. I grew up reading comics like Tex, Zagor, Alan Ford, Dylan Dog, Nathan Never, Lazarus Leed and so on. I'm pretty sure they're Italian, though I neither new nor cared about that when I was a kid.

So yeah, if something seems to be a Marvel/DC reference in my stories, it's probably not. I only got interested in superheroes due to the recent proliferation of superhero movies, television shows like Heroes, and because of the Worm Webserial... and even then I just casually skimmed through the various superhero wikia for amusement.

**** Gotcha. Just a bit of a coincidence, that's all. That's always a pain -- given the amount of stuff out there, it's hard to NOT have coincidental match ups between what you write and something else.

****** Well, red robe did go through them like a knife through butter. I was actually thinking they just did it once, to make Zorian think the aranea were gone, so he doesn't try to make contact with them again.

As zorian notes, if red robe actually can wipe souls like he claims, the invasion should be trivial. Permakill a few key people each reset, eventually there is nobody powerful left to resist.

** I wonder how well the trick with turning the ground into liquid and back to solid would fare against the GH. Basically he needs to immobilize it without directly applying magic to it. Maybe the ground under its feet could be turned into quick drying cement? Or the cement could be temporarily held in stasis to keep it from setting, until the spider touches it, at which point the stasis spell could be cancelled so it falls in and gets stuck.
