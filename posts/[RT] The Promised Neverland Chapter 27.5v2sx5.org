** Gah. 13 minutes behind you.

I'm not a fan of the mushy moments, but breaking Ray's leg is a clever idea, but could so easily backfire on them.

*** The plan is breaking his arm , which it's les likely to backfire.the becoming very ill part it's the more dangerous one ( I can't think any way to do it that isn't dangerous like consuming sublethal levels of poison ). I saw some similar ideas somewhere last week but I can't remember where. The fact that mama doesn't seem to have though they could do that is really suspicious , especially nothing prevents them from telling all the other children the truth if mama ends up shipping them , so I' m wondering what is her plan .

** God damn, Norman tried /really/ hard to die there. I'm glad the other two were having none of it. Emma's solution is ingenious.

*** They're kind of ignoring the fact that /someone/ is going to get shipped out at some point. If it's not Ray or Norman, it'll be another kid.

**** Didn't she move up the shipping date in order to get rid of Norman, though? If she can't get rid of one of them, the next regularly scheduled shipping date isn't for a while yet.

** "Already knew from the start", huh? What exactly is that supposed to imply? I mean, "the start" in Ray's case would be his early infancy, not exactly a time where you're capable of being cognizant of such a thing.

** Am I the only one who thought about Donal Trump jokes when they were mentioning possible security upgrades and the wall around them?

Also, their plans are getting increasingly unrealistic. Even if there are no visible security upgrades, just adding guards around the wall would make any escape impossible.

*** I think it's possible that mama won't reveal that norman escaped and will lie to her superiors . Anyway it's not really necessary, Norman could breack his arm and consume subletal leves of poison to prevent mama from shipping him in time.their plan is riskier than that but it gives them an enormous advantage , it's possible that the demons will put more guards , but then they would have to ensure the guards can be seen from any high point in the farm , and it is probably expensive to have guards or they would already have them,so I think it's more probable that they will just add more humans to watch them ( which can't be that expensive since they killed crone).
