Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

********** That's not my question. Most of those links say, unsurprisingly, that gambling is more common among poor people / poor people are overrepresented among gamblers.

My question is whether poor people spend more on entertainment than well-off people. Intuitively, that's unlikely to be the case - obviously well-off people have more money to spend, so are more likely to have expensive hobbies. If it turned out that it's indeed the case, then we could conclude that poor people /could/ get more efficient entertainment by spending on whatever the well-off people are buying.

But if not, then is it really surprising and/or wrong that poor people are overrepresented in moderately-cheap-per-instance entertainment like lottery, alcohol or tobacco, and underrepresented in expensive entertainment like theatre, fancy dinners, etc?

Let me reiterate: my thesis here, from the beginning of the discussion, has been that rather than poor people being 'irrational' in spending on lottery etc, they're fulfilling the need for entertainment in whatever ways they can afford. The solution to that is not taking away the entertainment they can afford; it's making them less poor so that they can afford better entertainment.

Addiction disables conscientiousness. Of course we should make poor people less poor. But the state is exploiting its least-privileged constituents for income. That is regressive wealth redistribution, which is the opposite of making poor people less poor.

** So I was watching the Supergirl pilot last week. It was disappointing in a number of ways.

But specifically, reading some of the rational stuff here and With This Ring has dampened my potential enjoyment more than it would have otherwise.

Supergirl gets into a fight with a super-strong guy with an ax. After getting sliced up with it once earlier in the show, during the final fight, she gets the ax away from the guy. So does she:

1. Use the ax against him?

2. Break it immediately?

3. Fling it away into the ocean, or otherwise remove it from the immediate fight?

4. Stand around posing for the camera, and then allow the bad guy to pick up the ax and try to chop her with it again?

The answer is of course (4).

It is not quite the level of stupid in season one of Flash, where he's fighting the two guys with hot and cold guns. There, instead of using his super speed against what are two baseline humans with fancy guns, he stops a distance away from them, allows them to keep shooting him with the fire and freezing beams, and /slowly/ walks between the bad guys until the hot/cold beams are pointed directly at each other, and then zips away, which allows the guns to shoot each other and get destroyed.

I could kind of forgive this if Barry hasn't already demonstrated fast cognition (by reading a book in a second or so), if he had at least been spinning around at the time, allowing his hot side to be cooled off by the cold side and vice versa. But instead he's just going to rely on his regeneration, and try to suffer as much as possible. It was literally the most painful way to end the fight.

Or he could have just stayed away and pelted them with rocks or something that doesn't require him to be continuously be frozen/burned.

I'm now used to Paul/Pavel/Grayven plotting a FTL transfer, zapping the bad guys with a railgun (or something less lethal if appropriate) and getting it done with a minimum of fuss. Spoiled, I am.

Edit: grammar.

And you can totally have that with two people seeking a quick, final victory! You can get that ebb and flow from characters utterly intent on pulling out all the stops and fighting each other to the death with no regard for anything else.

The problem comes from inexperienced (or bad, or lazy) writers who want that drama but aren't able to think up a good way to get it. So they have the hero throw away his gun and "settle it honorably", or something stupid like that, which is lame. It's ignoring one half of the balancing act between pragmatism and drama, when if you're good enough, you can have both.

*** The Flash is my favorite superhero, and I watch the show, but I find it so painful sometimes. Why is the guy with super-speed getting physically punched by people who only have super-strength? He's demonstrated the ability to move fast enough that he's a blur, why are villains still capable of landing a hit? They've slowed him down a lot on the show as compared to the comics, but he's still fast enough that guns should be useless against him too. In the period between them lifting the gun to aim and having it pointed at him, he should be somewhere else. It's frustrating.

I've been watching Supergirl, for some reason, and find it about on par with other comic book shows, which is to say lacking in both intelligence and worldbuilding. The Red Cyclone episode pissed me off enough that I haven't seen anything after that, but I'm a glutton for punishment, so maybe I'll at least read some reviews of it.

Even if he doesn't avoid being in the line of fire ahead of time, he should still be able to just dodge bullets. It would be the equivalent of baseline humans dodging cars, in terms of closing speed vs. his perception speed. His opponents aren't typically going to be able to re-aim to track him either.

** Please [[https://np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/3zpqku/holy_crap_the_otherkin_vs_transactivist/cyq1vt6?context=6][evaluate my evaluation]] of [[http://www.annelawrence.com/brain-sex_critique.html][Anne Lawrence's evaluation]] of Chung's and Hulshoff Pol's relevance as rebuttals of Zhou's and Kruijver's results regarding the size and cell count of the BSTc as an indicator of transsexualism in particular, and as rebuttals of the entire theory of 'brain sex' (brain gender), that is brain features that strongly indicate gender identity (while not excluding the existence of brain features that strongly indicate genetic sex and sex hormone exposure), in general.

I previously only read Hulshoff Pol's study regarding gross brain volume as a result of cross-sex hormone exposure and presumed that gross brain volume was the trans-indicative feature being proposed by Zhou/Kruijver, and that Zhou and Kruijver were the only results relevant to the 'brain sex' theory. I made this assumption in good faith of Lawrence's intellectual honesty and credibility as a presumed scientist (though she has an MD in anesthesiology, a PhD in sexology, and an MA in psychology, she does not in fact appear to be very scientific).

I was hesitant of Lawrence's intellectual honesty and credibility, given her wholehearted acceptance of Blanchard's typology of transsexualism as either 'homosexual' (androphilic) or 'autogynephilic' (gynephilic) and etiology of transsexualism at least in the latter case being conditioning from autogynephilic masturbation. This typology and etiology is unsupported, insulting, and harmful, and it's a bit of a nightmare to hear that Lawrence is (was?) in WPATH and Blanchard is (was?) on the DSM-V committee regarding gender. I was willing to bite the bullet, however, so I stopped my examinations at Hulshoff Pol's results and the fraction of Lawrence's critique that was presented to me and was prepared to accept that 'brain sex' as a whole was debunked.

I should not have. After a perfunctory visit to /Wikipedia/ for biological indicators of transsexualism, I discovered that not only was Hulshoff Pol completely irrelevant to Zhou, Kruijver, and Chung, not only did Zhou and Kruijver control for sexuality /and/ cross-sex hormone exposure, contrary to Lawrence's misrepresentation, not only did Chung not raise serious doubts about BSTc size and cell count as an /indicator/ (though it still indicates reversed causality, as the BSTc becomes differentiated in adulthood (though BSTc may still be part of the direct etiology of dysphoria itself)), and not only does Chung itself theorize a brain-anatomical explanation for BSTc's delayed differentiation, there are now /four additional studies,/ three on brain structure, one on brain response to pheromones, that all support the 'brain sex' theory. In other words, the TERF site that the quote was probably pulled from denouncing 'brain sex' and the presentation of Lawrence's critique in TiA as "debunking" 'brain sex' is outdated at best.

So, first of all, presenting Lawrence's critique as a "debunking" of 'brain sex' in general without doing further research is intellectually dishonest. If you don't think to check the Wikipedia article for more up-to-date results, you're not even /trying/ to reach the truth, you're trolling for the first remotely plausible thing supporting your preconceptions that falls into your lap. Second of all, Lawrence's critique is intellectually dishonest itself. Her "second most plausible explanation" relies on invalidating the reported sexuality of the Zhou/Kruijver subjects by appealing to autogynephilia: the 'homosexual' (androphilic) transsexuals were mistaken in their attraction to men; they were instead attracted to themselves having sex with a man as a culmination of womanhood, and so are instead 'autogynephilic' transsexuals. This is blatantly motivated reasoning, and relies on the unsupported autogynephilic etiology to support the typology.

Her "most plausible explanation" relies on an even grosser misrepresentation. Her entire debunking relies on exposure to cross-sex hormones explaining the trans-indicative difference in BSTc volume and cell count. To do so, she points to Hulshoff Pol, which reveals that gross brain volume is affected by exposure to cross-sex hormones, and that cell count is a probable affector in brain volume. The problem with this is of course that Hulshoff Pol does not in the slightest look at the size or cell count of the BSTc itself, so it cannot be counted as an overturning of Zhou/Kruijver or a non-replication. Indicators of genetic/gonadal sex do not contravene the indicators of gender identity. In addition, Zhou and Kruijver themselves address exposure to cross-sex hormones! This is only covered as a complete afterthought to the "debunking," with Lawrence minimizing their importance, referencing only two controls and ignoring the other ~six, including among them a trans-indicative transgender with no orchiectomization or cross-sex hormone exposure whatsoever.

The biggest problem, however, with Lawrence's explanations, is that they rely on Zhou/Kruijver being undermined by Chung and rendered irrelevant by Hulshoff Pol. Hulshoff Pol, however, is irrelevant, Chung does not undermine Zhou/Kruijver as an indicator, and subsequent results continue to point to 'brain sex' as a valid etiology of dysphoria, though neurological intersexedness itself is underexplored and itself has an unknown etiology. Lawrence's explanations are in light of a debunking that was entirely illusory.

  We took a look at this BSTc thing you were talking about. Men and women /do/ have differently sized BSTces, but they're not different until puberty. Transsexuals report that they're the wrong gender before that.

But that's not what we were really studying.

#+end_quote

So ...

You're right that Lawrence is a fucking moron without an ounce of intellectual honesty and deserving of no credibility (my words, not yours). She's sensed weakness and jumped on the opposition so that she can champion her own pet theory. "You say X and I say Y. Here's some evidence that it's not X. Therefore it's Y." This is a crystal clear false dichotomy and she should be ashamed to have published that paper.

/But with that said/, I think you're being driven by your personal biases. The Zhou/Kruijver studies do control for cross-sex hormones, but do so in ways that I find extremely suspect and non-conclusive. Namely, their six transsexuals had been on hormone therapy for many years. The studies then compare those transsexuals against subjects who had been exposed to only brief periods of cross-sex hormones, with some being as short as a month. The BSTc volume/count might change over /years/ of hormone therapy but not over /months/. This is a hypothesis they did not test, nor control for, nor mention. They also did not test non-transitioned transsexuals, which is another significant weakness of the two studies. Further, while their controls were exposed to cross-sex hormones, they weren't exposed at the same dosages, in the same ways, etc. It's apples to oranges in far too many ways.

Hulshoff Pol /is/ a serious blow to Zhou/Kruijver, because it kicks one of their legs out from beneath them, mainly their contention that hormone therapy couldn't possibly be the reason for the difference in BSTc volume/count. In fact, I would say that it becomes likely that hormones are responsible for what Zhou/Kruijver saw. The only saving grace might be that the interval period for the Hulshoff Pol transsexuals was four months, which is less time than for two thirds of their controls. But since it's another apples and oranges comparison (this time, total brain volume to BSTc volume/count) that might not be enough.

That leaves you with the subsequent results you mentioned, which I haven't read. But if you want my opinion, Lawrence is a crank trying to advance her own Freudian agenda and Hulshoff Pol does cast significant doubt on Zhou/Kruijver (though I wouldn't call that a debunking of brain-sex theory, nor would I say that the hormone explanation for their results is necessarily correct, not without further study, this time hopefully with more and better data).

S1 had an adrogenic tumor for "more than 1 year," S2 had an estrogenic (totally real words) tumor for "at least 1 year," S5 was orchiectomized and had "antiandrogen treatment" (?) for the last two years. FMT stopped taking testosterone three years before death. S2 as well, but FMT and S5 in particular placed strongly in the male range, S5 attaining abnormally outlier levels, and S1 also placed strongly in the female range.

It is the weakest part of the studies, to my frustration. A lot of subsequent studies used transsexuals with no exposure to cross-sex hormones, however. Luders had 24 untreated MTF samples for the right putamen result, Rametti had ?? untreated FTM samples for the fractional anisotropy result, and Berglund had ?? untreated MTF samples for the pheromone response result.

One problem I don't like is that Zhou/Kruijver use the same samples. Gender-linked INAH3 was found in [[http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/12/3132][*Garcia-Falgueras*]], though LeVay also reported a sexuality-linked INAH3 in men. They used the same samples, with four additional MTF samples, however. They possibly used different control samples as well, and may have gotten more S samples, I didn't check.

An interesting result I'm finding in Garcia-Falgueras is that they measured total brain weight, which I imagine corresponds to gross brain volume, and that total brain weight does not correlate with the volume of the uncinate nucleus nor the subnuclei they were measuring. This was probably done in response to Hulshoff Pol's results, as it was published in 2008, two years later (they even categorize by Blanchard's typology and find no result, this may have even been done in response to Lawrence and friends). So there is at least reason to believe that the BSTc and INAH3 would not relate to gross brain volume. I will update my skepticism accordingly, however. The dearth of control T samples is a major problem with these results.

Replication with more experimental and control samples would be ever-so-lovely. I hope MRI develops enough to be able to distinguish the BSTc and INAH3, and possibly to count cells, because a major hindrance to these results is that they have to be obtained post-mortem. Otherwise I would gladly volunteer. :P

Thanks for the in-depth response!

If I can write roughly 6,000 words per week that I'd be more or less happy with putting online, would it be better as:

1. 6,000 words once per week
2. 3,000 words twice a week
3. 1,000 words six times a week

*** I think it's important that the update length match the sort of story you want to tell.

Regardless of how many words they have, each update should feel satisfying and complete. Not that it oughtn't end in a cliffhanger, but it the scene it narrates, and the arcs it traces, ought to be self-contained.

Short updates work best for intensely episodic material: A lot of characters in short vignettes, a relatively loose timeline, and no space for extensive exposition. A story with many short updates will tend to feel faster and less coherent.

Longer updates allow more time to get comfortable with individual scenes before the narrative jerks violently towards a different one. There's more room to relax, reflect, and discuss. The larger the update, the truer that is... to the point that a finished thing, published when it's done can proceed at whatever pace it needs to.

That said, frequent updates are a /lot/ more likely to build reader loyalty than infrequent ones. Checking for new story pieces twice a week builds a stronger habit than trying to remember once a month. Waiting for a whole book to publish drives steadfast fans crazy, and makes the rest of the readership ignore you entirely.

  "Within minutes," Blake said, "A bomber will fly over and deposit a small nuclear device on this square. I doubt if we have time to escape. But we cannot allow this...thing...to continue running wild."

** I finished reading Frankenstein's Monster today. It's a good book, and deserve its status as a classic, but it maybe hasn't aged well. Leaving aside all the stuff in the side bar, it takes place in a world where people who experience something traumatizing can fall sick with fever and delirium for several months. More than once. Also, spoilers for the rest of the comment, I find it difficult to sympathize with Frankenstein. He spends months putting together a body (without using corpse parts) hoping to create life, then when it awakens he is so terrified of it that he locks himself in his room for a week hoping it will go away. Which it does.

Then months later when it confronts him and begs him to recognize it as a thinking, feeling being who wants to be good and doesn't want to live alone and shunned in the wilderness, he calls it a thing of evil that shouldn't exist. So... it kills his friends and family and taunts him until he goes mad. After hearing several times over the years that the monster isn't evil, I wasn't expecting it to go all Monte Cristo on him.

*** In Frankenstein, the obvious theme is you shouldn't dig up corpses and string them together to create life because /no/. (Which I don't really agree with.) But the deeper theme is that Frankenstein didn't create a monster out of corpse parts. He created one out of mistreatment and neglect. I think the author meant to show that Frankenstein's real mistake was in being unable to accept his creation and treat it decently. This extends to real life in that, while people aren't creating literal monsters out of dead bodies, they ARE creating monstrous human beings due to the way they treat them.

I wouldn't call the monster good. But I would say that it's turn to evil was understandable, in the same way that I'd say a serial killer who became that way due to years of abuse is understandable. Acceptable? No. And it's probably too little too late at this point, so put them down. But it's less their fault and more their environments. You're a product of it, after all.

Background: In the last few years I determined that I really strongly enjoy computers/programming and am fascinated in the science behind them to the point where I take MOOCs and do side projects (website building, Project Euler, games) and at work I jump at any chance for VBA, data scraping/analytics, process control. I follow a pretty broad range of science topics, but computer science is the one that I find myself consistently excited about. And last, as I mentioned, I have a dearth of anyone who can relate / talk to about it, so it's a lot of hours spent satisfying myself that takes away from everything else.

My goal is to put myself in the position where I'll at least be doing something I think is exciting (I know work isn't exciting in general, but I'd like to at least be doing work that will let me take some of those side hours away to be spent on friends/family/other interests, plus be in an environment I would actually meet people with similar interests).

  Specific fields I've dug into and enjoyed: 1) Data science, which is the one I have the most actual work experience with and have studied related fields (statistics, etc.) to get to work. 2) Natural Language Processing 3) Machine learning (neural networks, etc.) 4) Artificial Intelligence/Quantum Computing, like everyone else.
#+end_quote

Those are basically all the ones that involve statistics. Have you tried any that don't involve statistics?

********* Ok, then. Time for a couple of suggestions. If you're going to go back to school, maybe you should specialize in computational statistics and/or machine learning rather than in "computer science", which is usually taken to mean something more like "computability and complexity theory" at the postgrad level and "software engineering" at the undergrad level. You should take a look at some comp sci fields that don't involve statistics, to see if you like them. Many of them (computability, complexity, programming-languages theory) are more "rigid" and "logical" than statistics. Let's list some out:

- Theory (computability, complexity, programming-languages, graphs, algorithms, combinatorics, etc.). Generally more reliant on discrete mathematics and rigid proofs than on statistics or continuous analysis. You need to know at least the undergrad basics, but you don't need to specialize in it.

- Computational science, which often mixes in continuous math and non-computer sciences in something of the way statistics does.

- Systems (which I work in). Operating systems, embedded, hardware engineering, networks, databases. To work anywhere "real" you'll definitely need to know about databases.

- Software engineering. Fuck that shit, IMHO, but it does pay to know the undergrad-level basics just so you can work somewhere: build systems, version-control, testing practices and frameworks.

********** I had planned on finding a program that was especially good for one of those fields, but I thought it was just that- a specialty. So the major would still computer science and I would still be required to take all the pre-reqs that implies? Which, although I have only light exposure to those via skimming textbooks, MOOCs, concept Youtube videos, etc. I'm actually interested in learning the general curriculum as well.

I can dig a little deeper into the specific fields, but then any advice on the next step? For example, I had the vague plan of getting a job in an area with a good comp sci program and working while getting company to pay for the pre-req programs and building up qualifications to actually get into a good program (not necessarily that one). Any suggestions, corrections, or other factors I should consider?

Edit: Also, thank you again for taking the time to do this.

Yes, but specializing doesn't just help for your specialty, it helps for (in my experience) getting enthusiastic about stuff and going in-depth, which then gives you reason to learn more general-purpose stuff in-depth too. It's a virtuous cycle.

Call up someone in the department you end up wanting to get into, and ask, as an adult to another, what the requirements are. Chances are, if you've seen science stuff before, you're a leg-up on most applicants to undergrad programs already.

I've also gone really basic in the past and just used Notepad, but now I only do that if I want to clear my head while writing.

** How much do you care about spoilers? Do you avoid them? Are you indifferent toward them? Do you actively seek them out?

--------------

I don't care at all about spoilers, myself, especially since I do so much re-reading of books. Just a few hours ago, for example, I was reading for the second time the incredible climax of Chapter 66 of Book 2 of /[[http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=157898][Look to the West]]/ ([[http://pastebin.com/1gcLRhRm][Pastebin of summary and relevant excerpts]])--and, even though I'd known what was going to happen beforehand, it /still/ sent shivers up my spine. Likewise, I was just as thoroughly amazed by [[#s][Sakura's climactic clash in /Time Braid/]] in my last five readings of that book as I was when I first discovered it. I have less information on television series and movies, since it's rather rare that I take the time to re-watch anything--but I can't say that I care about spoilers in those media, either.

*** If the plot development is, as Aristotle recommends, both surprising and inevitable then finding out about it in advance will be almost as satisfying as finding out in the moment. When it feels good, and the story makes sense, then I want to go through it again looking for the foreshadowing.

If I've had that part of the plot spoiled, then I get to do that foreshadow hunting /the first time I experience the story/. This isn't a bad thing.

If the story isn't worth experiencing a second time, if the development comes as a shock because it's surprising /rather/ than inevitable, if results don't match set-up and there's very little foreshadowing to uncover... then I'd still prefer to have that development "spoiled" so I can get my disappointment out of the way and enjoy the story for what it is.

There can be enjoyment in being surprised by a non sequitur like there can be enjoyment in being startled by a jump scare. I've personally enjoyed both from time to time. I /prefer/ deeper sorts of emotional and intellectual attachment. The latter really can't be spoiled.

This doesn't come up in very many stories, but being spoiled can prevent you from going /misdirection/ hunting. If you already know what the solution is, then you wouldn't even notice how an author can play off of your preconceptions to mislead you without ever lying or noticeably covering something up.

*** If I know the plot of something beforehand, I usually end up wondering whether my experience would have been different had I not known. This isn't all that serious, but it is irritating; I've lost an opportunity I can literally never have again. On the other hand, I can (and usually will, if something was any good) rewatch something after ward to experience it with foreknowledge.

I do suspect there's a sensation of sudden insight that's lost if a twist has been spoiled. I enjoy reading fan theories that seem to put everything into a new context; why shouldn't the same be true if they're within the work itself? A joke isn't as funny if you're told the punchline first.

I also enjoy guessing what might happen, especially if I'm watching something with friends and can come up with silly theories - this is effectively spoiled if I know the whole plot beforehand.

With all that said, I will often spoil things for myself simply because I think that having my curiosity satisfied is more valuable to me than the experience of potentially experiencing something "unspoiled". It's not the most important thing ever.
