** I believe it would probably be more economical to run personalities that didn't self-destruct through successive educational cycles, as they would presumably get better at their craft the more practice they got, & also would have a proven track record of not self-destructing.

When they finally did, you'd then just use the last iteration, the one that self-destructed, as your labor-force until some other personality reached a higher number of cycles or was performing better by whatever metrics were used to measure value.

I'd also try to keep as many persons around as cost-effective long-term storage allowed for, because they'd each have different strengths, & the quantum randomness of the universe would mean that just because a given personality iteration would suicide most of the times it was run, eventually one would come where it didn't & would move to a higher iteration quantifier.

**** I have mixed feelings about this. In most cases, I feel that existential dread that comes from the idea of being a copy that's simulated briefly, then deleted, but this story felt surprisingly hopeful. I don't think coming into existence, spending a few hours on an interesting project, then ceasing to exist is necessarily an awful experience. It could even be pleasant, if the conditions are good and the work was something I enjoy doing.

***** It's like fetishized capitalism. But instead of disposable bodies, disposable consciousness. Anyone who's seen Black Mirror knows that this is an evil.

****** Extrapolating from fictional evidence. Even if you grant the moral equivalence of ems and humans, what's evil about providing someone's copies an endless stream of enjoyable experiences?

******* Because it's not endless.

The copies are terminated forever.

It's not bad because it's like black mirror or whatever, it's bad because it's creating and killing people that generally would not want to be killed, even if some of them are accepting of their deaths.

And even if they didn't it would be still pretty much be slavery, if the end can't choose what to whith their time and who to work for.

***** Interesting how it can be a horror story or just a humorous deconstruction of an idea depending on if the reader buys into the anthropomorphization of simulated life.
