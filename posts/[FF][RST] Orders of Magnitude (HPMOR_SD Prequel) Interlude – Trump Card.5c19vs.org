** When did you schedule this little political tie-in?

But I must say that Umbridge or Fudge would be a better analogue for Hillary than Hermione. Malfoy, if it must be one of Harry's peers. Hermione is closer to Bernie, advocating hope and idealism that doesn't pan out in our world.

You insult my mental image of Hermione through that characterization. Though I agree that canon Voldemort is a good analogue for Trump.

*** I actually wrote the entire thing last night. I just posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5c19vs/ffrst_orders_of_magnitude_hpmorsd_prequel/d9t2q2b/][this comment]] talking a bit about the writing process.

Agreed that Hermione was not a perfect analog for Hillary. I seriously debated who to use as the stand-in. Originally I was going to go with Umbridge to reinforce the "lesser of two evils" theme that seems to have pervaded this election. But it just didn't make sense as to 1. why Umbridge would run against Voldemort, and 2. why Harry would feel broken if Umbridge lost.

I admit I hadn't considered Draco, and I think in many ways it works better than Hermione, but it just doesn't quite make sense why Draco would be running against Voldemort rather than sticking to the Malfoy family tradition of being second-in-command to whomever happens to be the ruling party (in which case, the Malfoys would be poised to come out on top regardless of the resutls).

*** I sincerely doubt NanashiSaito was comparing either candidate to any HPMOR character at all. I feel it was meant to be a commentary on the government, election system itself, and how divisive the country got rather than on the people themselves.

** I've got to know. Is this a deliberate reference to the presidential election results from today?

First you use the word 'Trump' in the chapter title, and then you talk about an election scenario in the chapter.

If you did do this intentionally, would you still have posted this chapter exactly the same if the presidential election had gone the other way?

PS Wonderful chapter by the way!

*** It was very much deliberate - I actually wrote the entire thing last night around 1 in the morning once the writing was on the wall. I had already intended for Quirrell to refer to the events at Estremoz in a future interlude, so much of the dialog was already floating around in my head. And of course, I lifted a large portion of the dialog straight from HPMOR.

I would not have posted the chapter if the election had gone the other way. I am not particularly fond of either candidate. But, because almost every prediction had Hillary pegged as the overwhelmingly likely winner, the Trump victory was very shocking, and thus likely to be a lot more divisive.

At first, I wanted to address the point that, regardless of who won, the country was still split roughly 50/50, with both sides pretty vehemently abhorring the other party's candidate. It was going to tie into the whole, "nobody really thinks they're the bad guy, everyone is always picking between the lesser of two evils or the greater of two goods." But then it got pretty preachy so I cut out that dialog.

** But those elections weren't Hermiony (or even Umbridge) vs Voldemort... Umbridge vs Lockhart is more like it.
