It isn't too hard to find a good Beta Reader in general (or at least it hasn't in my experience), but for writing rational/ist fic it can be a little harder.

I was thinking about doing this already, but now that weekly writing contests are going to be a thing, I think that there might be an interest in a general "Beta Reader / Writer Match-Up" thread.

If you're interested in being a Beta Reader for a story, then say what sort of things you're interested in working on, and anything else that might be relevant.

If you're interested in finding a Beta Reader for your story (or for a series of stories, if this is for the writing contest), then talk about what you're writing or planning on writing.

Or, you know, do whatever you think will be most effective. >:]


** I'm getting ready to restart writing "S.I.", the first part of which is at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AU8o3wSAiufh-Eg1FtL-6656dNvbCFILCi2GbeESsb4/edit]] , and I can still use all the beta-ing I can get. In case you haven't caught previous posts on it, it's RST, HSF, attempted-MK, and TH: A cryonicist wakes up after the Singularity, gets stuffed into a new body, and tries to deal.

(Before I start writing new story, one of my preliminary tasks is, in fact, going to be catching up on on the betas' comments and suggestions that have built up while I was not up to writing.)

**** Close; it's the one where something like that happened, but a lot of said swarms have stopped working, leaving a whole lot of messiness to be dealt with by the rural survivors.

** I'm cool with being a Beta Reader for anything, but especially fantasy.

On the science fiction end I really like interesting aliens, but if you need somebody to check the accuracy of your page-long equations then I'm not your guy.

** I would be interested in having a beta reader, but I'll be upfront about the fact that (with the exception of Team Anko) I'm going to sell the things that I write. Beta reader would, of course, get free copies.

*** I would be very interested in Beta-ing for you. Rational!horror is a pretty new subgenre, so you're probably going to have a lot of influence and codify much of what future readers of rational!horror expect to see.

I think that gdocs would be best for Beta-ing, but I can work through sending emails back and forth too.

(Or something else; if I didn't mention something, it's probably because I didn't think about it, not because I inherently disapprove)

***** The whole thing started when...I believe it was [[/u/TimeWinders]]...asked if there was any rational horror out there. After some discussion I ran a Kickstarter and wrote [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00V52XRIE?ie=UTF8&redirectFromSS=1&pc_redir=T1&noEncodingTag=1&fp=1][Baby Blues]] and [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00V4ZIEMQ?ie=UTF8&redirectFromSS=1&pc_redir=T1&noEncodingTag=1&fp=1][Pay Attention]]. (Those are links to Amazon eBooks.)

Pay Attention is the story of a group of rationalist friends who do a seance as a lark proposed by a woo-woo friend, and the fallout thereof. Baby Blues is the story of someone escaping from Rikers Island prison and fleeing pursuit. Both are rational horror.

As an aside, I think that Baby Blues is the best thing I ever wrote. Certainly it's the one I'm most proud of. It was also the easiest -- it poured itself into the computer with almost no effort and required little editing. It seems to have been effective too -- I've had multiple people email me to say "oh my god, I just finished Baby Blues, and it was horrifying!" Fortunately they all went on to say they liked it or I would have misunderstood. :>

Actually, I say BB was "little effort" but that only refers to the writing. I did a crazy amount of research that included heat maps of police crime statistics, tide charts, maps of the currents in the East River, sunrise/sunset tables, and Google street view to locate real-world elements I needed for the story. Every place that's mentioned is a real place, except for one.

****** Do you still have that information?

Something that I'm planning on doing when I get the time is organizing all of the information that I've had to track down for my stories so that other people who write something similar won't have to, say, spend six hours on JSTOR looking for something to get That One Minor Detail.

** I'd be pretty interested in being a beta- All the constructive criticism given on this sub has really gotten me excited about the writing process. Like most people here, power system design is of particular interest and for sci-fi, alien races (I'd also be willing to try my hand at necessary calculations for hard science, although I'm no XKCD).

** I'm looking for a beta reader for a serialized original webfiction that I'm starting up called "Horismos".

Drawing a fair bit of influence from Sam Hughes (Fine Structure, Ra) (maybe too much), it's fairly hard science fiction with a rational bent.

Probably going to be slow with the writing, though.

No aliens.

** I already have a beta reader for /Shadows of the Limelight/ but I'm working on some shorter pieces that I might eventually like some feedback on before trying for wider distribution. These would be mostly fantasy, and not full-tilt rational; one "weird west" detective story, one fantasy-kitchen-sink mini adventure story. Or maybe some other things.
