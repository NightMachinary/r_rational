Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

I know that it's possible to write an autobot that can automatically post an update link to reddit for when a story is updated. But we don't do that. Instead we leave it up to the people who frequent this subreddit to manually do it themselves.

Would people prefer to leave it up to the whims of chance that certain stories get update notifications here, or to switch to automatic notifications and lose out on the karma points?

Note that I have no plans yet to actually code up an autobot for this unless a lot of people here mention a desire for it. In which case, I'll post a top-level post for further discussion first.

With some reasonable thresholds for enabling/disabling (has to be more than 50 upvotes to start autoposting if it's not currently being autoposted, has to be more than 50 downvotes to stop if it's currently being autoposted (numbers for example only.))

The mods should have override access; that'll prevent gaming the system with vote manipulation (this is already what's in place to prevent spammers from taking over the subreddit, so I don't see that as a step down.)

It's very serious. If you and everyone you live with are able to work from home and willing to take the quarantine seriously, then isolating in the city is safe enough. Whether that's preferable to going back to the farm is up to you.

I also expect the situation to last a very long time in the US, and any other country relying on social distancing to manage the pandemic. Until the government is able to implement case-tracking (very skeptical the US can do this) or a vaccine is developed (could be a year), the disease will pop back as soon as social distancing is relaxed.

There are different ways of looking at 'overblown'.

Do I believe that shutting down our entire country / creating a new Great Depression / allowing a massive expansion of government power is worth the difference in the amount of lives saved between a full country lockdown vs a series of more targeted quarantines? No. I think there are several more efficient ways of handling this that won't have as many long-term ramifications. I further think that these aren't particularly hard to see but are driven by systemic bias on the part of decision makers and media (eg, everyone making decisions lives in big cities, and the risk to rural areas is minimal and doesn't merit lockdown).

But for *you* is there any value to leaving your isolated farm to rejoin society? No also. There's no society for you to rejoin. Everything's closed by law.

You had an extended discussion in mod mail over when, why, and how we moderate the subreddit. Posting inflammatory stuff like this is unacceptable, as is spamming it across three comments in this thread. If you do this again, I'll give you a temp ban, and if you keep doing it after that, I'll just outright ban you. If you want to have a discussion about moderation, there are better ways to do it.

You could have said "I disagree with the moderation of this subreddit", or outlined ways in which we fail to moderate in accordance to your standards. You could have posted what you think are particularly damning responses by the mods. Here's a portion of the discussion, quoted:

#+begin_quote
  How is chili and the chocolate factory rational, rationalist, rational-adjacent or anywhere near any universe where rationality is at least on the cusp of existence?

  #+begin_quote
    We generally don't remove things for being "not rational enough", so long as they're clearly fiction. If it were getting downvoted to the negatives, maybe we would remove it, but it's one of the more upvoted works on the sub. I personally wouldn't consider it to be rational fiction, even if it's written by an author who has a grasp on the concept, but again, "rational enough" doesn't tend to be something that we police -- if the sub is failing to discriminate on this specific work, I think that's probably okay, or there are reasons that it has appeal to the general audience.

    #+begin_quote
      So any fiction of any kind written anywhere can be posted to this sub, so long as it's clearly fiction? Are there post frequency limits? Am I allowed to start hitting up this sub with daily chapters of Agatha Christie and other public domain books and if not, how are those stories different from what's being done here?

      #+begin_quote
        Am I allowed to start hitting up this sub with daily chapters of Agatha Christie and other public domain books and if not, how are those stories different from what's being done here?
      #+end_quote

      Do you think that doing that would add value to the community or result in highly upvoted posts? Actually, to just answer the question outright: no, you're not allowed, because it would be taken as a protest action that I don't have the time or patience for. You would get an immediate, permanent ban.

      #+begin_quote
        If your question is "what does [[/r/rational]] see in Chili and the Chocolate Factory", then I think that I might be able to answer that:

        - Examination/extrapolation of an implied Dahlian expanded universe.
        - Reference/understand/parody of well-known rationalist ideas/trope e.g. AI box, CISPR
        - People searching for answers to puzzles
        - Metatext
        - Eccentricity and absurdity The fact remains that it's highly upvoted, and the bar for removing highly upvoted things is very high, as is the bar for removing things that mods consider to fail the "rational" aspect of "rational fiction". I don't plan to take any mod action on it.

        If you really hate it and/or think that it doesn't belong, downvote it and move on, or leave a comment on how you think it's not a good fit for this sub (ideally with some charity toward the people who clearly do think that it belongs).
      #+end_quote
    #+end_quote

Your characterization of this stance, in an unrelated question that's not about moderation, is "the mods do not moderate". It shows no charity toward our position, nor is it clear. It exists only to slam the mods and/or get people riled.

As I told the mods was going to happen, because going to a place where people go specifically because they like something, tends to be useless for discussing why that thing is bad.

#+end_quote

It was about the general goings-on of the sub and I think moderation should be an important part of that. I think lack of moderation is an important going-on in and of itself. I don't think it's fair to characterize moderation discussion as being completely unrelated to a question about what is going on with the subreddit. Sub moderation is what shapes a subreddit, along with submitters and to some extent voters. Though what people upvote tends to be more or less samey outside of political subs.

#+begin_quote
  You could have posted what you think are particularly damning responses by the mods.

I don't publicly quote private conversations without permission. I also thought the general apathy towards removing things, not posted by me and that are not porn or non-fiction, was more disagreeable than anything in particular.

** Not trying to be pessimistic or anything but this economic/labor question has been bothering me for a while:

Doesn't the prevalence of essential employees working for the same pay during a pandemic mean they were "over paid" before? If we are willing to keep working jobs at higher risk, due to the pandemic, for no increase in personal benefit doesn't that indicate we are willing to take worse cost/benefit jobs in general?

I'm not advocating that anyone quit, especially if your work saves lives, but from an economic view raising the job risk significantly without increasing compensation would be expected to encourage people to quit their jobs. Or is it just that the loss of other jobs raised the value of any current jobs enough to compensate? In the USA this could be explained by people needing job's medical insurance, but I'm not hearing about this in other countries either.

*** Yeah, the limited available jobs increases the availability of individual workers and those workers' desperation for some kind of employment, so quitting is just as impotent of a threat as always.

Also, iirc, not many groups of employees in the US have collective strike or bargaining organizations, so there's no way for workers to negotiate greater pay in response to the exposure risk.

*** I would argue no, using analogy with gasoline consumption. As gas prices go up, consumption of gas does not significant decrease. As much as people grumble, they still need to get to/from work. Over the short term, demand for gas is very inelastic. Over the long term, though, people adjust their decisions to recover gas usage. This may be by buying a more fuel-efficient vehicle, by moving closer to work for a shorter commute, or by pushing for expanded public transportation. Over the long term, demand for gas goes down, even though it didn't in the short term.

Applying this same logic to essential jobs, in the short term, it is very difficult to quit when living paycheck to paycheck. Rent still needs to be paid, and food needs to be purchased. In the short term, supply of essential workers does not dry up with drastically changed working conditions. Over the long term, though, people will preferentially avoid taking essential jobs, driving up the wages required to compensate.

Also, this is all with the caveat that economic predictions are based on the assumption that people are inherently rational, and that the market is always at equilibrium. Neither of these are particularly good assumptions at modeling groups of humans.

*** Price in a market is a function of supply and demand.

People don't want to go into work because of the virus, so supply has gone down. You would expect a wage increase from this.

However, jobs don't want as many workers, so demand has gone down. You would expect a wage decrease from this.

Demand has gone down a /lot/ more than supply has, so we're lucky we've seen wages stay the same.

We've seen wages stay constant, partly for press/image reasons, but also because constructive unemployment (and the costs of hiring) is temporarily way up, which means the market will adjust much slower to everything. Plus, it's only been two months.
