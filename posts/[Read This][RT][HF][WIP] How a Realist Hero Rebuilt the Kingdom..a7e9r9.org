  O, Hero!" With that cliched line, Kazuya Souma found himself summoned to another world and his adventure--did not begin. After he presents his plan to strengthen the country economically and militarily, the king cedes the throne to him and Souma finds himself saddled with ruling the nation!

  In order to get the country back on its feet, Souma calls the wise, the talented, and the gifted to his side. Five people gather before the newly crowned Souma. Just what are the many talents and abilities they possess...?!

  What path will his outlook as a realist take Souma and the people of his country down? A revolutionary transferred-to-another-world administrative fantasy series starts here!

I have finished the first Volume it has good points and bad points. This seems to be an independent development of the rational genre in Japan so it may be rather weak compared what you typically read. On top of this it has the hurdle of trying to get ideas across the language barrier which I think it is successful at.

I can't stress this enough it is very much an estern work. In the same way you might drop the phrase David and Goliath and expect me to know both what book it is from and what idiom it represents this book expects you to be familiar with popular estern books like "Journey to the West" and "The Art of War"

If you are already an anime/manga fan I highly recommend this. If you are just a rationalist fan I cautiously recommend it. Any way here is to the hope you enjoy the story. Have a beautiful day.


** Read about half of the first book. The biggest problem with this series is that to make the main character "smart" it makes everyone else incompetent. There isn't much depth to this novel either. It's just basic problems and basic solutions. It was rather boring to read.

Could you give me an example ? I am halfway through the second book and other than the king I don't remember anyone being incompetent. Although I do agree the story is weak and could have been done better.

** I recommend the 3 star and lower ratings on novelupdates. They are often quite helpful. [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/genjitsushugi-yuusha-no-oukoku-saikenki/][Link]]

To quote from my own review from long ago:

- The MC's luck has reached the counter-stop. Every plan goes off perfectly, he randomly stumbles upon or predicts all potential issues early enough to avert them.

- Everyone important / intelligent believes him immediately. And becomes a subservient follower immediately.

- There is a harem drawing nearer and nearer. He still resists (for unclear reasons and typical MC thickheadedness), but everyone else already accepts it. It seems forced, as everyone else is in a monogamous relationship. At least there are some actual, if unconvincing, reasons for the girls to want to marry him.

**** Have you tried Japanese light literature and normal literature? It's not light novels, but it has works such as */The Twelve Kingdoms/* (十二国記), */Seirei no Moribito/* (精霊の守り人) (unfortunately this is not fully translated), */Kemono no Sōja/* (獣の奏者), and */Kamisu Reina/* (神栖麗奈). They might not fit here, but you might finally escape the wish-fulfillment and harem of mainstream light novels. I'd personally recommend the */Boogiepop Series/* which is currently being translated, and my most tentative recommendation for this sub is */Rokka no Yuusha/* (六花の勇者) which is a mystery, fantasy series.

***** It is easier to tune the recommendations I get in Western media. I can't tell if that was sarcasm so I am gonna assume it was not. I disagree the type of wish fulfillment is different not less.

***** It is just the title for all recommendation threads. Although I did format it improperly. It should look like this [RT!] You get dinged by the mods if you don't put it. Lol took me forever to remember to do.
