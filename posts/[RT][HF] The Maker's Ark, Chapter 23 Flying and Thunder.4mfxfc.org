** Poor Flicker. It must be sooo frustrating to fly at just 4g.

*** Yeah, I've had the idea of Jetgirl teasing her about that for a long time--except Flicker has a very real phobia, and Jetgirl is her friend, so she wouldn't.

** Does Flicker have telekinesis? Could she use her "momentum transfer" to move the ground out of the way before she hit it?

Edit: I just realised Osk wasn't being metaphorical. "Donner" literally means thunder. How long have you been planning this?

*** Osk was being both metaphorical and literal. I don't remember when I first came up with the idea of his name being significant, but it was while I was writing the first book. It's been an active potential plot direction (I don't do detailed plots in advance) since Call.

I've been wondering if anyone who knew a little German was going to speculate about it for a while 8-)

Edit: Flicker's momentum transfer is primarily for balance--it's very diffuse for everything else and she only has crude control. When she pushes too hard, she has no more control over where the ground goes than someone running in mud does over where the mud goes 8-)

**** I am native german speaker, was mildy confused about the nameDonner, but did not draw the connection. The norse God and Donner dont share any symbolic signifiers at all, Which Made the lexical clue of their Names irrelevant to me.

***** I didn't want to make the connection too obvious except for the name, but Donar/Thunor/Thor had lesser known connections with fertility and healing.

Of course he uses a guitar instead of a hammer, and the lightning he uses to throw his thunder goes through an amplifier and speakers 8-)

*** Thanks! One of the things I was struggling with with during the hiatus was trying to get back my judgement of what was good, what needed to be tossed, and what was not perfect but good enough. Took a bit, but I hope to eventually salvage some of the storystuff for later chapters.
