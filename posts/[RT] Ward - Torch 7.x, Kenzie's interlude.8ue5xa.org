** In case you've missed it, Ward (aka Parahumans 2, Worm's sequel) is still around, though it's been a while since anyone mentioned it.

The last chapter, told from Kenzie's POV, is both the longest and one of the most intense that Wildbow has ever published. As always, trigger warnings for various forms of domestic abuse apply.

**** It's been a bit of a slog. Ward is getting better as it comes into focus. It's just not as intense and the premise of heroes and villains still bothering to use the elaborate costumes post apocalypse feels a bit contrived.

Though the story seems to be heading towards the final collapse of that system.

*** Although excellent writing, and although I love both /Ward/ and [[/r/rational]], I can't see this anything but shallow signal-boosting that has no place in this subreddit.

Edit: to me, putting Ward in [[/r/rational]] is a common case of not all “good fiction is rational fiction,” that's all. It's very good, but it is not the something like /Twig/ or /A Practical Guide To Evil/.

**** I went over the little checklist just to make sure and both Worm and Ward definitely follow them. Not sure how this specific post is shallow signal-boosting...

***** Ward is popular or well known enough over here that it doesn't need signal boosting to be honest. Neither does aPGtE and that gets every chapter linked. There's plenty of discussion to be had about rational elements in Ward's chapters even if, and I'm not saying it isn't rational, not all of Ward is considered rational fiction.

**** Correct me if I'm wrong, but Ward is rational fiction right? I can point to the link to [[/r/parahumans]] in the sidebar as evidence of that.

Edit: I'm not 100% correct about the sidebar, read this comment chain for details if you want.

***** It's a contentious issue. See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1ryg4s/worm/][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/34e51q/q_what_do_you_dislike_about_worm/][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3q4uod/d_mr_yudkowsky_on_the_lack_of_munchkinism_in_worm/][here]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3o2czl/qso_im_finally_getting_around_to_reading_worm/][here]], for a start. Also, note that [[/r/parahumans]] is linked as a related community, not an endorsement for or against Worm (or Ward) as "rational fiction". (I'd argue strongly for that subreddit as a related community, while also arguing weakly against the works as being within the genre, but I don't want to rehash those arguments again.)

****** Ahh thanks. I won't rehash the argument either, I guess the discussion here was should Ward be allowed to be linked here. That's a moderator decision though in my opinion.

******* It's definitely allowed to be linked here; mods aren't really in the habit of declaring something to be inside or outside the genre, except for particularly egregious cases, and I'm not aware of many times that something has been removed for being "not rational enough".

****** This is why I'm curious to see how our new definition of rationalism will look like. I just spent a little time looking through several posts, and many of the arguments people make can be rationalized by the opposing party and so on.

It creates such a diverse discussion because people's definition of rationalism seems to be highly subjective (excluding a few points, such as being evil for the sake of evil, for example).

I worry that our rebranding will be a result of the louder people trying to limit what is, in my opinion, a subjective discussion that /can't/ be nailed down to a science.

******* I /personally/ plan to argue for a more subjective definition, one which allows for larger shades of gray and tries its best to get at meatier things than just "oh, there's a plot hole".

***** This is a bit backwards, assuming that the subreddit link (added because of Worm) automatically means that Worm's sequel /must/ be rational.

(I haven't read Ward myself (more than the first few chapters), so others will have to take up the definitional slap fight as is tradition.)

****** Well, it's focused on characters and how their decision-making impact their lives, and it's very thoughtful.

Whatever subtle quality we're looking for here, it definitely qualifies.

******* Twig focused more on hyper-intelligent characters overcoming their mental militations and had transhumanist themes. Other than that, I'd personally say they qualify equally.

******* Ward has been sparse on clues, but it features a thoughtful protagonist examining a posited but unspecified negative codependency somewhere within the social network of a small group of troubled children. Wildbow is still adjusting the balance between action to defuse the codependence and the protagonist's anxious speculation over the possibility.

I suspect that the finished work will qualify for the sub, even if the serialized version is a bit of a reach.
