** I am pretty convinced this is intentionally over the top. The truth is too convoluted, and too dangerous for public consumption- I think Harry knows perfectly well that the inner circle is going to question him, and he will have to explain things, but I think he is creating the public facing myth- he knows that this event is going down in history no matter what, and he has already seen how the stories get out of control, he is simply laying the foundation for the best public outcome.

******** Well the eye of vance is never described as being specialised to see things without being detected and I highly doubt that voldemort wouldn't have some spell that let him know (even if he can't obscure himself) if he was being observed by a very specific magical artefact wielded by one of the most dangerous men in Britain who would actively hunt him.

The alternative is that Moody just needs to be able to be within zoom range (from any direction since he can see through solid objects) of whatever he wants to know If this i the case he must go on frequent strolls through the ministry and just casually finding out every state secret and basically anything else he wants to know....which is silly.

True, but in this case he doesn't have much of a choice.

He just discovered that he is Voldemort's eigenself. Then he took the Stone, which it turns out combined with the True Patronus Charm is a resurrection device. Then he killed many Death Eaters, many of whom were very politically connected, and erased and transmuted Voldemort to bypass his defences.

In addition, he lost his greatest and most powerful political ally in the process. Possibly both of them if Malfoy finds out Harry killed his father.

That is not information that is conducive to him living a long and/or happy life in any way shape or form if it gets out to the generally irrational and still-much-more-powerful than him rest of the world.

Sorry, Google isn't turning anything up. Wiktionary gives "own" or "self" as possible meanings and I think I'm getting the idea from there (and context), but it's a better idea to just ask like somebody who's been living under a rock.

***** It's a term from some science fiction stories, most notably to me /Accellerando/ by Charles Stross.

An eigenself is another person who, at one point, was either a copy of your mind-state or branched off for the same original mind as you did. In some stories it also covers people who are from different Everett branches (alternate reality selves) but I use it here in the first definition.

Eigenselves will retain the memories of their progenitor, and likely most of their morals, but will have different life experiences and so can still change significantly.

I'm not saying it won't damage trust and all that other stuff, but in this world/society, if someone tells you that kind of secret AFTER you become a perfect Occlumens then it seems like it would be easier to forgive them lying to you until that point, especially if you warned them that there were secrets you'd been keeping from them.
