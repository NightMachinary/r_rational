I just sample the book on Amazon (great book thus far!). However, I noticed that the price was set differently every time I reloaded the page, ranging from $12.39-$7.95, [[https://imgur.com/a/TWgg9KQ][even after instantaneous reload]]. I don't want to give my money for some sort of experiment here, so, if you've bought it, what is the actual price of this book?


** That's very strange. I set the price to $9.99 USD, so if you're seeing weird price dickery, that's on Amazon's side. :(

** I can't even find it on Amazon - what sorcery are you using?

I mean....

PERVERT SORCERER is BLOCKING access to NEW STALKS. I WILL DESTROY YOU AND IMPREGNATE YOUR PERVERT WOMEN.

edit: NEW STALK is being RAVAGED.

*** The delay on Gumroad is due to a dumb mistake on my part. If you pre-order there and send me an email, I'd be happy to set you up with the book asap.

** Why not buy it at the lowest price offered? Assuming you'll still get the book no matter what price you pay, you wouldn't be 'giving your money for an experiment', you'd still be buying the book.

Unless you suspect this price experimentation is all Amazon's idea, and Max Harms didn't authorise it (or did so accidentally or reluctantly) and would rather you paid $12.39. In that case, you should pay $12.39.

It was a stable Â£6.99 for me on UK Amazon (which converts to about EUR7.97 and $9.81, so $7.95 seems like a good price and $12.39 seems like a bad deal). I tried downloading the sample to see if that changed the price, but it didn't make any difference.

** I just bought it via Amazon for $9.99.

Speaking of which, does anybody have a synopsis of the previous books in the series? I read them both over a year ago, and I'm kinda fuzzy on the details...

** I got the same [[https://imgur.com/a/4uaQV0u][thing]] after a bit poking with Tor browser. My suggestion is to buy on Gumroad, it should work with any e-reader out there.
