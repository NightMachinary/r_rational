I kept thinking it might've been referring to how crawling is sneaky and how he might've sneaked Archer/Rogue away but that sounded dumb.

** I just read the entirety of this on my phone thinking it was the first chapter -- a link to which the author seriously needs to place at the end of the summary post, preferably along with another link to the table of contents.

That being said, I have no idea what's going on, but I like what I've read. I really enjoyed the prose, which I found to be very expressive and evocative. So here's to diving down a new rabbit hole.

** #+begin_quote
  maybe one of these days I'd have to sit her down along with Archer for a friendly talk about Why Other People, Who Are Not Us, Matter.
#+end_quote

If any of you watch the good place this reminds me a lot of a certain scene in the second season.

#+begin_quote
  “Is that a bedsheet?” 
#+end_quote

This is such a perfect thing for the heirarch. I like to imagine that every time it happens someone in the army tries to take the bedsheet clean it, mend it, embroider it etc. so he just gets another fresh dirty one each time.

Though as a representative of the people he would ensure Fair Compensation rather than engaging in Tyrannical Appropriation of the Property of the Common People.

#+begin_quote
  Akua said. “Queen of my heart, shall we proceed?”
#+end_quote

At this point Cat is just ignoring the blatant flirting which amuses me greatly

#+begin_quote
   So we resumed our advance as if we were untouchable, and so went untouched. 
#+end_quote

The bluffing her way into things (like stopping the cavalry charge) is becoming Cat's signature move.

#+begin_quote
  “Did one of your most infamous emperors not style himself Traitorous?” Kairos said. She laughed, rather cuttingly. “Traitorous?” she smiled. “Oh, youth. You are barely even a Malignant.”
#+end_quote

The most Praesi burn ever.

#+begin_quote
  “I am more than blood,” Akua Sahelian hissed. “I am more than what I was made from. But you, Kairos Theodosian? You are the apostle of the cage, the congregant of scrapped iron. 
#+end_quote

Another reference to the “we can do better” theme? Akua has realised she can't just lean into the Praesi history of madness, evil and treachery but she has to overcome it and use the good parts of it to become something more. Don't know why I didn't notice the parallel with her and kairos before, they both wanted to be old school villains in rebellion against the new wave of “practical” evil.

** So, like, for a while now I've been on the "Kairos' endgame is to put the Gods Above on trial before the Hierarch" train. If so, he needs the Bard/Intercessor, since she is the one who speaks for them.

​

He may also need Cat, since her Crows (I've been thinking of them as Gods Between) may be able to threaten Above/Below that they will join with the other. He wants them to blackmail the Gods Above into speaking directly through Bard, use other means to get her to cooperate, and then put her on trial before the People.

*** I don't know if the Crows are as much Gods Between, as they are basically Angels for below, their power almost 100% from below, gifted through the sacrifice of their people on the alter that was the Everdark to achieve immortality for the rest, and finally completed with the seed of Godhood that was Cat's mantle. Gods Between isn't a bad name for them, as it's not like they follow Bellow's orders or anything, but they are most certainly not neutral in any way.

** Worth noting Kairos, who can no longer tell lies without keeling over dead, just told Cat that "a greater game is in the works than [she] suspect[s]." Granted that's pretty vague, but it's unequivocally true.

*** Kairos is not an Oracle, he's merely constrained from uttering falsehoods. So this says merely that Kairos believes there's a greater game afoot (for Kairos's personal definition of “Greater”, “game”, and “afoot”). It may be more constrained if he also has to use words unlikely to be misinterpreted by Cat.

**** There's no indication that it's what he believes to be true instead of literal truth - he in fact assumes the latter as soon as the sentence is handed down, by testing it, saying that they'll be seeing him again. I don't know exactly what you mean by Oracle here - he statements are literally constrained by future events if he's talking about the future, but he'll die as soon as he says something incorrect, so it's not really helpful.

*** No, it means that he believes it is the truth, and he doesn't know what Cat is thinking. Allowing someone to speak only 'absolute truth' would result in God-like levels of omniscience as they could just create a list of something--say enemy troop positions--and then just attempt to read the list. If you can only speak absolute truth, you'd only be able to say that list item aloud.
