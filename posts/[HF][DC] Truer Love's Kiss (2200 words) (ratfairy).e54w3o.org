** The commentary on the relative uncommonness of cryopreservation here doesn't reflect reality very well, I'm afraid. In this fairytale setting, the cost of cryopreservation is near zero. Presumably they need someone to stack the patients efficiently in the crypt, but that would be the work of a few minutes for about four people. After that, no human effort would need to be expended on maintaining the preservation, as Elsa's power presumably maintains the structure of the crypt as well as the preservation of herself and her subjects.

In real life, cryopreservation has significant costs. Yes, the monetary costs are paid by taking out a life insurance policy on yourself, but not everyone can realistically afford even that. The costs in human time are also many times larger. You need a team of around six people on-site to begin the preservation, then you need people to maintain the facility and the dewars, all for an arbitrarily long time. I'm not sure I believe that, if human effort were almost entirely removed from the equation, cryopreservation would be nearly as uncommon as it is.

**** Most trips are cheaper when you know they are one-way. It's true that peasants who aren't in the immediate vicinity of the capital might have difficulty, but anyone with any kind of property or business to sell could make one trip if they sold everything. People in the real world don't do that sort of thing because there's almost nothing in the real world (aside from arguably cryopreservation) worth throwing away literally everything for. In a world with objective examples of successful resurrection from cryopreservation, however, it should be well known that this is a real, worthwhile thing.

That's not the world we live in. The total cost of getting cryopreserved is a significant fraction of the lifetime earnings of most middle-class Americans. We also have no examples of successful resurrection. Yes, I agree with the argument that the likelihood of resurrection from cryopreservation is unknown, while the likelihood from any other method is zero under current understandings of physics, but there is no proof of tangible benefit. Rather than asking people to go to a specific location for a procedure with known efficacy, current cryopreservationists are asking people to pay large sums (over long periods) for a procedure with unknown efficacy.

I am personally convinced that cryopreservation is a good idea. The only reason I am not signed up is because, like so many other members of my generation, I cannot afford it. I also happen to be young enough that de Grey's most pessimistic estimates of life expectancy escape velocity would be sufficient to save me, but that's beside the point. The world presented in this story is different enough from ours that I do not think the arguments presented in it apply to ours.

"Truer Love's Kiss." [[https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/fiction?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG][#Fiction]] [[https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/long?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG][#Long]] [[https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/submittedstoryidea?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG][#SubmittedStoryIdea]], also [[https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/essay?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG][#Essay]] [[https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/writingadvice?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG][#WritingAdvice]].

There is a cruelty to the fairy godmothers, though they don't mean it that way; there is a cruelty to their love of lessons and surprise twists. If a man falls ill of a deadly sickness, his fairy godmother cannot just heal him. Oh, she has the power to just heal him, to be certain. She has the power to transform mice to coachmen, if she pleases. And if you are a human you have the power to thrust your own hand into a fire and leave it there to burn. But it is not in the nature of a human to do that. And it is not in a fairy godmother's nature to just heal a man's sickness and be done.

So I knew, I knew that moment when we were all gathered in the town square. That very moment a fairy godmother pronounced before us all that Wolfer had been put into a healing sleep from which he would waken with a kiss of love that was pure, I knew. I knew my own kiss wouldn't work.

Right as the fairy godmother finished speaking, everyone turned to look expectantly at me, the one who Wolfer had promised to marry. If I'd had the power myself I might have cursed them, for humiliating me so. Did they understand nothing of fairy godmothers? If it had been that simple, the fairy godmother would have imposed some other condition instead.

It still hurt. It's one thing to laugh to yourself about how your own passions don't resemble the fancies of a silly little maiden, and another to be told that the fairy godmothers also find your heart's warmth lacking.

But I tried it. Of course I tried it. I knelt before the fine white cotton bed on which Wolfer had been laid to rest, hands clasped in repose like the guest of honor at a funeral, and I tried it. The lesson might be that I did love him that much after all, and shouldn't have let a fairy godmother trick me into doubting. It might be -

It wasn't.

I straightened up from the fine cotton bed, looking away from where Wolfer still lay unmoving. I did love him. I did. I just didn't love him enough, or my love was insufficiently pure. I'd been angry at Wolfer sometimes. There were aspects of him I did not love. Anyone who'd damn me for that had no love themselves for human beings. With thoughts like that I held back my tears.

I think it must be that fairy godmothers don't care as human beings do, or maybe can't help themselves from acting in this way; for if they enjoyed the hurts they deal us, they'd have the power to hurt us more.

Wolfer's mother and his father and his sister, at the least, didn't curse me for failing. They had their own inevitable failures to bear. One by one they knelt before Wolfer's bed and laid their own kisses each to his forehead.

But Wolfer did not waken.

"Don't be ashamed," Wolfer's mother told me, after it was done. "If you love Wolfer as much as his own mother does, that's nothing to be ashamed of."

"What do we do now?" said the sister, looking from one of us to another.

"I'm thinking," I said.

"In a practical sense," the father said in a thick voice, "we must set up a sign by Wolfer's tannery that there is no business to be done there for now. Someone must see to the hides he has in process. His garden must be kept, his hound fed, and precious things taken from his home where they would be unguarded."

"But who is to kiss him?" said the sister. "If none of us, then who?"

"I'm thinking," I repeated.

On the first day I made guesses. Who in the village could have laid their eyes on Wolfer, or had his eyes lay on them? What was it that Wolfer liked in a woman, if that woman wasn't me? Of such truths about themselves, fiances are little inclined to tell their fiancees. In truth I had been curious, but I had not asked; I regretted that now. But if Wolfer was awakenable at all, there must be someone who loved him, or someone who he loved, with the love of a maiden's fancy and a passion out of stories. I had to stay upon that hope if I wanted to continue.

Wolfer had praised my hair for being golden like the sun, and Shileia's hair burned a brighter gold than mine. So to Shileia I went, saying that although I had no idea who, there must be somebody in the world who loved Wolfer more than I, and so I was going to everybody that might possibly be, with no specific ideas and no offense meant, to say that if so they should please just kiss him - yes, I did love him myself, but I wanted him back - if I'd been trying to stop other women from kissing him, in this situation, it would have made me the worst manner of - no, I wasn't accusing Shileia of trying to steal him, we couldn't help who we loved -

By the third day I'd given up on having horrifically awkward conversations with people who insisted on taking offense like the utter idiots that they were. Instead I asked the Oldest Elder to pronounce before the entire village that if any woman thought they might love Wolfer, they were to try kissing him, and nobody would be held to blame. There was an hour of the night set aside for it when the act might be done in privacy.

Still on the fourth dawn Wolfer lay still. Ten times at least that I knew of, his lips had been taken, and I owed favors for it.

On the fifth day I announced before the whole village that if, perhaps, the person who loved Wolfer was not a woman, he should please kiss Wolfer anyways. There was a scandal at that, and one person clutched at her necklace and pretended to faint. I think I will never deep down understand how the people of scandal think; I cannot imagine what it feels like from the inside to be one of them.

On the sixth day I asked my elders after the lore of fairy godmothers. I asked after kisses, and pure loves, and enchanted sleeps.

"Have you considered that maybe the kiss isn't supposed to be on his lips?" said Old Grandma Ogg, but she was shouted down by several others that at least our village's fairy godmother wasn't one of those fairy godmothers, for which we could all be grateful.

"The thing that worries me about the enchanted sleep is that it implies a delay is necessary," I said. "It implies a story with a lesson that can't be learned today, for some reason. What if Wolfer's true-enough love won't be born for seven hundred years?" What if the only way to love Wolfer 'purely' was to know almost nothing about him, as of a maiden coming across his sleeping form a thousand years hence when his name had been forgotten?

"Aye, many of the most famous stories are like that," said Old Grandma Katarina. "Queen Elsa froze her sister and her sister's husband both, until the alchemists came up with a cure for his Necrotic Wilting. Took half a decade, that did -"

"Queen Elsa wasn't a fairy godmother!" Old Man Tanly interrupted. "No fairy godmother ever puts somebody to sleep for five years exactly. When fairy godmothers put somebody to sleep it's either done the same season, or a century after. Or at least after everybody they know is dead."

My hands clenched, where they lay upon my dress, but I said no word.

"I wonder why the fairy godmother added the requirement that the true love be pure," said Old Maid Melenna. "Well. I suppose I'm not wondering, really. We can all guess what Anneke and Wolfer have been doing." She gave a disapproving cluck of her tongue with deep satisfaction.

I went on sitting and listening. Perhaps, at some point, one of them would say something important.

On the seventh day, I was asked by the Oldest, in solemn tones and in the presence of witnesses, whether I had any more ideas to try for waking Wolfer.

My heart froze in my chest. "Of course I do," I said at once.

*** "Such as?" said the Oldest.

"For one thing, I still think we should have everybody in the village kiss him," I said. "Forget about guessing. Just try every possible match. Some young maiden might be too shy to come forward, or some old man -"

"You know we can't do that," said the Oldest.

"It would only take half an hour," I said. "We're talking about literally three minutes of any single person's time -"

"What other ideas do you have?"

"Travel to the city and find someone more versed in the lore of fairy godmothers," I said.

The Oldest clacked her tongue. "Is the wisdom of your own elders not enough for you, child?"

"Wolfer still sleeps," I said.

"Then wisdom is not the solution, for that we have tried."

The sheer folly of the statement floored me so, I could not respond in time for what was said next.

"We will build Wolfer a place to sleep until he wakes," the Oldest declared. "His house and business will be given to another. A memorial service will be held for him at the morrow, to say us all our farewells, for it may be that we will not see him wake in our own times."

I said nay, but I was not heard.

At the wake-without-a-funeral, Wolfer's mother and father wept over his living body. As though, for him to be declared dead in the eyes of society, made him dead; as though the possibility of his return meant nothing to them, if others did not name him living? If this was what they called family, then small wonder that their own kisses hadn't sufficed. I watched with stony eyes and kept my silence. To say what I was thinking out loud would only have hurt Wolfer's own bonds and ties, come the hour of his return.

At the last Wolfer's sister cried over his body, and brought before him the young hound he had been raising to say its own farewell.

The little creature had no idea that Wolfer was supposed to be dead, of course, only that it hadn't seen Wolfer in a while.

So the puppy licked his face.

...

"I am told," Wolfer said to me afterwards, "that you went before many women of the village, guessing who might love me. And that you asked them - indeed begged them - to kiss my sleeping lips."

I sat with my hands folded in my lap. "Yes," I said in a controlled voice.

"Some people seem to think this means you must not love me very much," Wolfer said, in cautious tones.

"I am not sure that I understand their way of thinking," I confessed.

"Me neither," said Wolfer. "To me it seems like, fairy godmothers and their definitions of love aside, and the other people in this village and their definitions of love aside, you have demonstrated a great deal of love for me."

My heart began to beat again. I went to where Wolfer still sat recovering on his bed, to sit beside him and lay my own head against his. "And the fact that you appreciate that is why I would take you as a husband before all other men," I said, trying to put all the real affection I had into my words. "Maybe the lesson the fairy godmother was trying to teach was that, while human beings may love, asking for any human being to love 'purely' is asking the impossible."

"Should we even care?" Wolfer said. "In the end, fairy godmother lessons may make sense only to the fairy godmothers themselves. Even if sometimes the story has a moral that makes sense to us humans, we don't know if that's the moral they had in mind."

It was a very sensible remark, and it affirmed to me again that this man of all men was one I might sleep beside without strangling him.

And we lived ever after, sometimes happily and sometimes not, for such is the fate of beings as complicated as humans. In time our children were all grown and my own breath grew harder each winter, so that I thought the end of my own life might be drawing near. Then Wolfer and I journeyed together (as strangely few folk do) to the great crypt where Queen Elsa sits self-frozen, kept undying by her own power for the sake of what her power preserves; and we threw ourselves together, hands bound by ribbons, down the icy slide before her throne. In time to come, we would be brought forth from that crypt, by beings more straightforward than fairy godmothers. Their aid meant nothing and taught nothing, except that somebody had wished us well. And as one who had tried it both ways, I found it a more pleasant lesson to learn.

*** *** ***

This came out of asking for help with short story ideas at a Gratitude Day party. As I then had to expand upon, for a short story plot, you need (1) a *conflict* and (2) a *resolution* to that conflict which (3) can be depicted using only a *small* amount of development.

Lacking item 1, you don't have a story idea, you have a story setting or a story element or one event inside a story. 'Premises' like "What if Naruto was on fire?" can be generated without end, but aren't yet even the seed of a story; it's not a difficult or very valuable part of story-generation.

Lacking item 2, you have only a question - one whose answer, if it is answerable, might be a story idea.

Lacking item 3, you don't have a *short* story seed, you have a novel seed. That's why finding a fascinating conflict (item 1) doesn't yet do most of the work when searching for a *short* story idea. Most possible resolutions to a conflict won't have the rare, valuable property of only requiring a small amount of development beforehand. The hard work is finding a conflict with a possible resolution that can be a *short* story.

In this case, as Erica Anneke Edelman retells it, Jonathan Wolverton had poked himself on one of Erica's needles. Erica then threatened to break up with Jonathan if her kiss didn't wake him up, but said that, if so, she'd take up the quest to find some other lady or lad to do the job. This was presented to me as the story idea "What if your kiss wasn't true love enough to waken him?" I said that this was an interesting idea to use for requirement 1, a conflict, but this conflict needed a resolution that could be depicted after only a small amount of development. After which Erica thought a moment and said, "His puppy licks him." Whereupon I clapped my hands together and shouted to the whole room "Yes! That works! That's a resolution that only takes a small amount of development!" and I wrote the story that same night.

You may perhaps think that the actual story written contains theme and emotion that isn't explicit in the conflict "Her kiss didn't waken him" and the resolution "A puppy's lick does". But that part feels much more reliably doable than 1-3, which is why I don't list "4 - potential for depth" as a necessary requirement. The subtask "find a bunch of depth to put in" doesn't have a completion-probability so low as to call the supertask into question if not addressed in advance. In this case, for example, I initially thought the fairytale's moral was going to be about polyamory; after the first draft I went back and edited those parts out. In retrospect, of course, if you are hunting for emotional depth, the more interesting part of the premise "What if her kiss didn't waken him and she had to look for somebody else?" isn't the part where she's looking for somebody else, it's how she feels about her own kiss not having wakened him. And of this you must find something to say that is not the first cliche that comes to mind. But that sort of thing, I can figure out on my own, often by leaving it up in the air to figure out after I've begun writing - so long as I've gotten the *much more difficult* requisite of a conflict resolution that only requires a small amount of development.

Unless specific to that particular afterlife is a prohibition against killing one's self, or some other goal that requires one to actively avoid death.

I remember once playing out a thought experiment. How would one create a Christian evangelism-themed video game? Instead of fighting enemies, one would convert them. Ah, but they might backslide and lose their faith. Well then, we just kill them after they're saved. There they go, straight to Heaven. But that's murder, and it puts the main character's soul in danger! Ah, but if they're saved and in the best place possible, doesn't that make such a murder a /good/ act?

***** Obiously you have to kill everyone as babies which most likely go directly to heaven whithout needing to risk them not being converted.

And yeah also kill everyone converted and try to convert and kill everyone else. You are probably going to hell for it because Christianity seemingly runs in the kind of deontology that makes murder wrong regardless of the fact you are literally just sending them to a better place , but it would still be the most heroic act anyone has ever done . Somebody has to and nobody will and all that.

Fortunately almost no cristian actually thinks like that, humans have mechanisms to prevent us from taking our beliefs too seriously because our abstract beliefs are usually wrong.

Problem is now that we have science which alows us to actually get correct beliefs it's difficult to get people to actually take their consecuences seriously for stuff like xrisk, climate change or whatever.

I prefer functional descriptors to labels. In the case of this thought experiment, I fall back on "the ends do not justify the means." As a Christian, I see a choice as moral only if both the means and the end are not sinful by God's standards.

******* Yeah, that makes sense I guess. I was thinking what my own vague position on morality says about killing people in a world were killing people just sends them to the afterlife, in cases where sending them to the afterlife is preferable to the alternative (a possible hell or whatever).

And I don't see killing in that hypothetical world as very bad. Death doesn't seem to be that big of a deal if the afterlife is better than here. It would be still a bit bad since you kind of temporarily separate them from their families(although you could also convert and kill their families) And they might not consent to be killed which makes it more dubious. But if hell Is really bad it might be justified to do so anyway, especially if convincing them to let you kill them might cause them to not go to heaven because of the suicide prohibition.

And I could totally see parents wanting to send their children to heaven after baptism if there was obious evidence of heaven, and obious evidence of the possibility of either hell or ceasing to exist for adult sinners. Even if that risked their own souls.

I imagine in the hypothetical world where evidence of the afterlife is obious and there's a prohibition against suicide a lot of people would kind of want you to kill them or at least allow you to. In wich case I don't see any problem whith doing so(unless God also counts that as suicide).

If it would be good to kill them if they don't want to be killed is a more complex situation that kind of depends on the details of why. Babies don't know enough to care about that kind of thing so the morality of killing them becomes more about what the parents think.

But of course I don't want to convince you you should go arround killing babies :b I didn't think you were Christian and was just assuming you subscribed to the usual consecuentialism arround here. So I was mostly memeing.

The whole morality based in God thing is really weird to me because I don't see any reason to care about the standards for morality of some entity outside myself, unless I know the entity shares mine. And entities that don't just send everyone to heaven don't seem likely to share my morality but that's a diferent discussion.

**** Hmmm.

If necromancy exists in this world, and the ghost of a particular person can be summoned, then one form of testing whether a ghost is still the underlying person or not is to attempt to summon up the ghost of a person still living. If the summoning succeeds, and the person is unaware that it even took place, then that suggests that the ghost has nothing to do with the person. If the summoning fails, or kills the person, then that implies that the ghost is the person, shorn of their flesh.

If the summoning works, is noticed by the person but does not kill them, then this implies a number of things; most of all, that further investigation and experimentation is required...
