[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/worm-time-of-perils-worm-oc.5344][This story]] is about a natural genius inserted into the universe of Worm. Written by the author of Saga of Soul.

I'm not really sure I can call it entirely rational or rationalist, since the protagonist tends to make predictions with 10dB levels of confidence from data I wouldn't think warrants that big of likelihood ratio. On the other hand he is supposed to be a self-trained rationalist super genius, so it's kind of believable to me. He's akin to a more believable Sherlock Holmes.

Rational(ist) or not, this is some good competence porn and I highly recommend it.


** I'll second that. It's not the most rational thing out there, but it should be enjoyable for many of the subscribers here, I think.

** Yeah, not very rational, someone mentioned that he always gets the canon answer to every question but the author hides it by making it part of a series of guesses so it doesn't look like an asspull. He does it a lot.

It was entertaining though, and I liked that you're not really meant to sympathize with him given his reasons for his annoying attitude, but at the same time it kind of kills the immersion since there aren't any likable characters you can identify with. Taylor is basically a side character with no agency in this fic.

He's also steamrolling through every challenge and the only thing that might give him trouble seems to be Coil, unless we get a fakeout like what happened with Control, which I really disliked. I hope the author handles that fight well.

Can you elaborate? I found him pretty damn likeable, although dropping the whole tired 'egomaniac supervillain supergenius conquers the world' backstory wouldn't hurt. His position on utilitarian 'end justifies the means' strategies seems to be 'tried it once, didn't work out, now I'll never take this seriously', which is rather weak. Either this viewpoint comes from his traumatic heel-face turn, in which case he's not rational enough, or it's simple author's fiat, which means the story is not rational enough.

To be fair, he's supposed to be a top-tier player in his universe, it's quite natural he's steamrolling everyone so far. He's fighting eldritch civilisation-destroying abominations using his intellect in backstory, can't expect him to struggle against a couple of thugs. Simurgh, Coil, and Contessa should present more of a challenge.

HE'S ALIVE!!! HORRAY!!!

And now to read and measure it's quality.

EDIT: just finished the prologue, while not completely rational and scientific, the protag does correctly guess at what is going on with the world by providing clues already known to the reader. As well as recognizing the biggest threat to any rational plans, that is to say, Ziz.

** Not very far into it, but the MC makes a few unjustified leaps clearly informed by source material, and is very familiar with local politics shortly upon arrival because Internet.

Otherwise, it suffers from some of the same problems Worm does. Worst being, strangers to one another laying all their cards on the table.

*** Could you specify what exactly you refer to as 'unjustified leaps'? It's hard to judge how accurately one could reach the correct conclusions by analysing the information on the internet, if one were actually smart experienced and rational, unless you are all of that yourself. To me, most of the inference seemed fairly plausible.

**** A lot of it is plausible, no doubt. Also, I separate his predictions into strategic, operational, tactical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and political. My biggest problems were with the last two.

What I mean by unjustified is that he's simply reaching. He has this conjecture spamming mode, which is good for low hanging fruit/obvious shit, but then as he picks more particular pieces of conjecture as more likely it's just there. There's no stacking or parallel observations which narrow his ranges or alter his focus. His ranges just include some asinine shit, obvious shit, + canon answer. It's flat. I can't sufficiently explain this. It's not a deal breaker, because it's not too bad. It just induces a mild eyeroll.

As far as his familiarity with BB gang politics are concerned. That is somewhat over the top. The public is simply unaware of the inner machinations and convoluted alliances and deal making involved. Hence the desperation IRL for "transparency."

Many a white man thought they could show up in the middle east and do the same thing as Warren. The idea is laughable. Yes BB is a town, but the same principle applies.
