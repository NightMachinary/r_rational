** Can I take a moment to rant and rave about WTC for a bit?

I've been on this manga/isekai kick for around a year, searching for whatever scraps of escapism I could get. In my search for a Light Novel translation that I could stomach, somehow I ended up on [[/r/rational]].

"Huh. Worth the Candle: Self-Insert, LitRPG, Alternative Universe - Fantasy. On this weird subreddit about that one "what if Harry Potter made sense" fan fiction(eww) that gets posted as a reddit curiosity every quarter."

At this point I got blindsided by this fully loaded Australian road train of a story.

I don't even know where to start. I don't even have the dictionary to express the ways I enjoyed this web serial. I don't understand how a work of such scale and quality can exist in the first place, let alone patiently waiting around for someone to read it on some god-forsaken fanfiction archive without asking for money upfront.

There's the infinitely tessellated grid of Aerbs to get lost in, the complicated cast of companions following Joon, some frankly bizarre plotlines, the narrative dissecting itself and every other story I've ever seen, played or read along with it, the examination of what kind of person could actually enjoy getting Isekai'd, just quality fantasy schlock in general, transhumanist dreams and nightmares, the fact that there's seemingly no big bad to the story, apart from the story itself...

And that's just a fraction of what WTC has on offer. And then it's all kept in check by the [[/r/rational]] brand of magic sauce of "having the story make sense". I'm sold on the concept.

I don't know if I'm just showing how poorly read I am - and the fact that WTC takes time to explore this with Valencia sperging out over Harry Potter just makes my head spin - but this is special. Capital S life changing kind of Special.

Can I now think about anything that isn't this cursed text, please? It's been almost a month. Absolutely outstanding work.

But I agree that, along with the pacing, the "textbook"-like exposition is one of the book's problems. Sadly he has no financial incentive to ever give the book a proper edit.

It probably makes more sense after reading /Harry Potter/, but I didn't think that series was very good, so I don't know if I'd recommend that. You definitely don't have to read other web serials referenced by /HPMOR/; I didn't (unless I missed a /Worm/ reference), so I didn't get some of the jokes (unless I saw them pointed out somewhere), but none of it was significant enough to matter.

There is a great /Puppet Pals/ reference, though (which I also didn't know about until someone pointed out the reference).

***** Fanfiction doesn't exist. There is only fiction, some good and some bad. The whole concept of fanfiction as a distinct and separate category was arbitrarily created by big business interests which killed the public domain and then brought about the cultural stigmatization of any works that build on an idea or concept which someone else is already profiting off of -- works which would have otherwise entered the public domain ages ago, especially if you account for accelerating cultural change as a sort of "inflation" on how quickly a work becomes cemented in common culture and the public consciousness.

I could write an entire novel by myself, but if it builds off of or references any ideas or concepts that somebody else is making money off of, then that person owns my novel in full, even though they did not write my novel. Luminosity by Alicorn is what Twilight could have been if its author were more intelligent and sensible and better at writing. And yet Twilight gets to be shared on platforms where the generally public will actually be able to see it, in bookstores and libraries, while the much higher quality and thought provoking "fanfiction" is forced to be relegated to obscurity, and thus censored. Stephanie Meyer has a virtual monopoly on novels which build on or remix Twilight, and any such works exist only as long as she permits them to, even though some of those works are significantly better than the original Twilight.

Sturgeons law 90 percent of everything is crap, but "original" fiction has access to gatekeepers in the publishing industry who clean up all the crap through editors and rejections.

"Fanfiction" is barred access to those gatekeepers, and so readers have to wade through heaps of garbage to find the gems. This reinforces the stereotypes about "fanfiction" and thus prevents people from caring about the death of the public domain because they dont know what they've lost in the process.

****** Fanfiction literally means fiction written by fans of a work, mainly using concepts from that work. It exists, and the name is fitting.

Even if you were arguing it's an useless word, I find it useful to know whether something is say a Naruto fic before reading it, because then I know (/edit: for the vast majority of fanfics/) I have to have watched or read some Naruto in order to get the most out of it. It's a good thing that fanfics aren't expected to reintroduce every single basic concept and character, and that can only happen if you're told you're expected to experience the original work (which obviously means that's also valuable. Yes, even Twilight).

I think what you're actually saying is that IP law is too restrictive, and I wholeheartedly agree, but you're choosing the worst way to express that.

I'm not sure I agree with this point, I never read a few fictions that some of my favorite fanfictions were based on and I didn't feel anything was missing.

******* I'm totally not. I'm telling things exactly as they are. Do you really think Scott Alexander wrote Unsong because he was a fan of the Bible? Or that Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote HPMOR because he liked the original Harry Potter series? "fanfiction" isn't always written by people who are fans of the "original" work. Prequels, sequels and "missing scenes" written by fans of the "original" work is such a tiny fraction of the overall space of possible "fanfiction".

​

Yet because people think that's what "fanfiction" is supposed to be, that's almost exclusively what you'll find on websites which host "fanfiction". Meanwhile, entire alternate universe retellings and remixes are in the tiny minority, even though they have a lot more room for innovation. Depart too far from "canon" and hardly anyone wants to read your work. Because if you do something that's too original, making an entirely new canon of your own, well, they could easily get that from non "fanfiction" works which are higher status.

An example: Reading the original Harry Potter series is not necessary to understand or appreciate [[https://hpmor.com][HPMOR]]. However, reading HPMOR is necessary to understand and appreciate [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][Significant Digits]].

Publishers are slowly catching on to the potential of publishing webfiction in hard copies because it's a conservative industry. With american comics nowhere near as popular as manga, comparatively, publishers don't already have a habit of publishing cheaply made, niche works.

What /would/ need to happen for the english-language publishing business to thrive on publishing webfiction would be to drop the prices on both books and ebooks by quite a bit, reduce editorial oversight of YA books, and introduce more works targeting towards young boys (think shonen and younger seinen age), because young boys currently read at rates far less than girls. But in the english language market, Amazon's monthly kindle offering is already sort of the beacon for publishing polished webfiction, and with its exclusivity contract, publishers can't pick up books by authors on the platform, so they can't see the promise of webfiction because it'd already out of their reach, for the most part.

I used to think that the publishing industry was pointless, just a middleman taking a cut from the authors but no longer necessary in the days of Amazon and Lulu. Now that I've published a few things I realize that a publishing house is extremely valuable, because it's a one-stop shop for editing, cover creation, and marketing. Those are things that you can either do yourself or pay for individually, but there is definitely value in having someone else do it.

Still, getting your work out to the public for sale is not difficult.

****** mol has significantly worse prose. i wouldn't say /bad/, per se, but def mediocre. the lower end of what i would expect if i were to go to a bookstore and pick up a random novel. wtc is comparatively much cleaner.

looking at the first few paragraphs of each from the perspective of some hypothetical editor, this is pretty obvious:

#+begin_quote
  Zorian's eyes abruptly shot open as a sharp pain erupted from his stomach. His whole body convulsed, buckling against the object that fell on him, and suddenly he was wide awake, not a trace of drowsiness in his mind.

  "Good morning, brother!" an annoyingly cheerful voice sounded right on top of him. "Morning, morning, MORNING!"
#+end_quote

even aside from the trying-too-hard "zorian", there's some pretty flagrant overuse of adverbs, the prosody is at odds with the content, etc. this is text that i can read without discomfort (we won't, at least, find a mistake in grammar until the fourth paragraph), but i certainly won't enjoy it.

#+begin_quote
  I strained against the collar that held my neck in place, trying to get a better look around. My hands and feet were both cuffed, with thick metal bars connecting the cuffs to each other, resulting in no give at all. I had a gag in my mouth as well, but that was a little bit looser.

  Five seconds ago, I had been passing notes in fifth period English.
#+end_quote

this isn't stand-out prose by any metric, but it's certainly competent. the only major complaint i have is with "but that was a little bit looser", which is awkward, but it's also clearly necessary to maintain the sentence pacing. i don't immediately know what to do to improve it, which to me is a good sign. the scene-setting is inoffensive, the punchline is punchy, and in all this prose smoothly conveys me to the parts of the work that i'm interested in.

as an aside, i'm surprised that [[/u/Namlis1]] says that they have a distaste for fanfic; ime the general quality of writing for fanfic is miles higher than that for original webfiction. the only webfic authors i've been able to tolerate have been wildbow and aw, despite what probably are more than a hundred attempts at reading other popular web serials. by comparison maybe one in twenty stories on sv have prose i find tolerable.

i suppose the difference in our experiences is probably due to fandom and platform; the average pmmm fic is miles better than the average worm fic is lightyears better than the average hp fic, and likewise for ao3 vs. ffn or whatever

********* The biggest one was the inherent inconsistency in the premise of being in another world. In the first few chapters, the main character repeatedly makes statements that imply a strong familiarity with the world - even taking into account the subconscious "other" following her. It ended up just feeling like a poorly fleshed-out excuse for a self-insert.

That being said, I think I'm jumping off the train now. I was interested with the trope subversion of being a low-powered nobody, especially since the rest of the story seemed to be trying as hard as possible to be a Mary Sue setup. It seemed possible that she would start to leverage engineering and science, but then the story took an easy out and went full Mary Sue ("What's this? I was wrong all along! Your powers are amazing and rare!").

It is also comically cringey at times, which is not at all helped by poor writing:

**** I recently started reading MoL due to this post and, well, I don't think it's well written. It has some things that are very jarring to me, namely the consistent past vs present tenses and the use of formulaic idioms and expressions just for the sake of it (in places where they make little sense or are just unnecessary).

I don't mean to dish on it, this post is to ask: does it get better? I got to chapter 4

***** Yes, absolutely, the first chapters are years old, my tolerance bar for bad english is really high (a symptom from reading machine translated Chinese webnovels) so I'm not always the best judge, but it definitely get better quality as it goes. I started to see the difference between proper published novels and web novels as the difference between a recorded album and a live concert performance, one is edited and corrected to perfection while the other is more raw and rough cut, but no less impressive, and more so in some cases, they both have their appeal, if a few rough chapters of grammar aren't your cup of tea then stick to the published novels.

*** Can I just piggyback off your comment to rant and rave about how intelligent /Worth the Candle/ is?

For example, when they are discussing the Demonblooded Festival, Juniper remarks on the injustice of executing someone just because of how they were born, and Grak mentions that the Demonblooded is supposed to be a criminal. The second I read that, before I read the next paragraph, I was thinking "wait, that doesn't make any sense. Assuming this festival is held once a year, isn't it an astounding coincidence that they always have a condemned Demonblooded on hand for execution? How many Demonblooded are there in this city, and how many murders or whatever can they commit?" Then I read on and I was gratified to see Juniper echoes the exact same thoughts I had, because that's the /obvious/ thing for an intelligent man to wonder when he hears that.

Another example, when asked why she wants to become a combat mage, Lisi casually replies that it's her comparative advantage. She doesn't even have to explain the concept; Alexander Wales /expects/ his audience to be familiar with the idea of comparative advantage, or willing to research it, and he's justified in that assumption. And yet again when Oberlin mentions talking to Finch securely using one-time pads, without bothering to explain what they are or how they can provide secure communications in a society without computers.

You don't /see/ this shit outside of rational fiction and maybe hard science fiction (Greg Egan is the only professional author I can think of who writes like this). I'm guessing if you tried this with a professionally published work, some editor would slap you down and tell you to stop alienating normies. And for all I know he would be right, and a book without these things would sell better. But, dammit, I /want/ fiction aimed at people like me!

/Worth the Candle/ is smart fiction with smart characters written by a smart author for smart people. I can't tell you how /refreshing/ that is.

I think you very much underestimate the reader base of sites like fanfiction.net, archiveofourown.org, etc. And to a lesser degree, a subreddit like this one.

I suspect there are five to ten thousand people reading this serial. I can't even guess how many people were reading Worm as it was written. If you want to compare to published authors with tens of millions of readers I guess that's small potatoes, but the average published novel only sells something like 5000 copies in its lifetime, and might gather some multiple of that in readers from used sales and libraries and such. Compared to that, stories here are not at all "god-forsaken".

The story has close to 4K kudos on AO3, which would be consistent with about half the readers taking the time to click that little button, about what I expect as far as engagement for readers. Reddit somewhat recently removed the ability to see hits on posts, but when had that, threads like these were between 2K-3K, which again, is about what I expect for engagement (i.e. most people just read the work and none of the discussion). Tracking hits from just before a chapter is posted to roughly a week after is probably one of the most accurate ways of getting numbers, and by that metric it's ~7K.

It was interesting and gripping in its own certain, maybe clinical way, but I didn't engage with it. I didn't care for the characters much, nor did I find myself caring much about the world around them. The time looping nature of the story reseting any character development doesn't help.

The more I think about it, the more MoL sounds to me like a "hard" Sci-Fi story. It's built solely around a neat concept and the author sees where he can take it, within its rigid ruleset. It's just set in a fantasy setting incidentally.

***** It's really close to finishing. Probably just a few more chapters left. (Since the story is about a time loop, and they just left the time loop, now they just need to resolve everything. There's a lot of plot threads though.)

The author updates regularly every three weeks and have been doing so since he started (~2011 I think), though occasionally he says he's going to have to postpone a week. So technically it might be a few months until the absolute conclusion, but the progress is very steady.

If you don't want to repeatedly F5, you can make a fictionpress account, which you quickly do with a Google account, which emails on an update. The story is also split into three parts, so you can read the first two and wait until this sub explodes that it's done sometime before the end of the year. No need to compulsively update.

I've been occasionally throwing stuff onto the page for [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Earth][Earth]], which basically tries to collect everything Juniper's ever said about Earth and its locations in the story.

In terms of new templates, I've thrown together a couple of disambiguation notices to put at the top of future pages: [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Disambig2][Disambig2]] (for two similarly-named pages) and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Disambig3][Disambig3]] (for when three or more might be confused). The new [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Flashback][Flashback]] template can be used to mark a character who only appeared in a flashback in a summary's cast page. Oh, and maybe check out [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Fanart][Category:Fanart]] - a place where I'm looking to collect any and all unofficial art that gets produced for the story.

Finally, I've also tried to give something of an overhaul to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorthTheCandle][the TVTropes page]] for the story. /Worth the Candle/ should interest TVTropes users, but the story has very few crosswicks there and I can't imagine it gets much traffic from the site as things stand. If general wiki editing isn't your thing, but you know a few relevant tropes, maybe throw them up - and don't forget to link to the story from the trope pages themselves.

My thanks go out to everyone that's contributed over the last month, even just in the form of pulling out key information from the text for others. If you want to show your support for the story by helping out, just say hi in the wtc-wiki channel of the Discord server (linked at the end of the last chapter) - *no experience necessary.*

Likely just a coincidence or nod given the style of WtC isn't generally to reference things like that for plotlines, but Harry Potter IS already relevant to the story and it would definitely be entertaining in a Juniper-exasperated-by-the-game-world way...

** For some reason this update feels shorter even though it doesn't have less words than previous ones. Was it the long wait (I know, I know, Christmas)? Or that we're again on the brink of Happenings™? Next update can't come soon enough.

Incidentally, even though as far as I can count Raven was the 7th person to get the companion status, do you think that Fenn getting completely removed from the GUI means it's possible that we'll be picking up another companion here? If so, hopefully that's Reimer (or even Tiff) rather than Lisi as I'm with Reimer on her being kind of threatening and we already have Bethel to fill that role. Though I'm afraid that the No Longer Dice Guy would probably find it amusing to hoist a (excuse the weeb terms) kuudere vs. yandere tug of war on our dear Juniper.

** so we got an ominous line during valencia's point of view: that she's tried to manipulate people before (implied: it went poorly). obvious allusion to fenn. she came off as somewhat addicted to using devils.

we also got a few more chekhovs. it is probable that juniper will eventually interact with fake tiff, fake other friends, fake parents, in descending order of likelihood. it also seems reasonable that the next arc after the athaenium will involve the penndraigs.

finally there was the thrown away line from the instructor about walking a path made by others. this is, of course, exactly what juniper is doing, so it could either be a reference to uther, a reference to the dm, or a new subplot.

i am still waiting for a dmpc reveal or similar. none of juniper's close companions have tried to stab him in the back yet; it's unlikely none of them ever will.

**** oh yeah meant to include that. it reminded me heavily of something i can't place. had sort of a “he loved big brother” vibe but that's not it.

it's also an odd line to write, because grak's warding makes him an essential member of any team like juniper's, all the time. he is useful basically every chapter... but /narratively/ this often gets skated over. (they entered. grak set up wards. the others began talking while grak sat silently.)

i wonder if the author is deliberately highlighting a difference between normal usefulness (setting up wards) and narrative usefulness (advancing the plot by getting info). grak is keenly aware of what happens to narratively-irrelevant characters.

so it may mean more than just his declining mental health. i don't think it makes sense viewed through that lens, because if grak values himself only in terms of helping juniper, he knows his value lies far more in warding than in intelligence collection. in my opinion the line only makes sense narratively.

/Based on what we knew before/, Grak's whole section in 143 has pronoun-use problems, both on da nad own part and when da thinks about other dwarves like the police-folk. It's plausible that it's Juniper-as-Narrator being his usual chauvinistic self in his 3rd-person-omniscient insights into Grak's thoughts, or even that this is a /deliberate/ demonstration that Grak has internalised the Imperial perspective on the issue, given the other insights the chapter offers into Grak's self-image issues. But on the off-chance it's just an oversight, better to point it out than not.

And then links to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16690513][this]], which is the first half of that chapter, from Grak's POV, with Groglir pronouns.

Also, the Grak quest update in chapter 106 doesn't use the dwarf pronouns, despite using them before and after that specific update, and the game layer seemingly always using them. (ctrl+f "when he's amassed")

Another long running goof is that Quest Complete and Quest Complete*d* are used arbitrarily throughout the story, too many chapters to list.

And finally, in what might be one of those issues only CRJ can fix, the quest "We're Going To Need Books, Lots of Books" was never completed despite the fact it really should have. I suggest completing it right after Raven gives the new date of the apocalypse in chapter 131 (ctrl+f one hundred twenty left) or at least mentioning its lack of completion somewhere.

Which, if you think about it, the first chapter is just about the least optimal chapter to be the worst chapter, because it turns off a bunch of people right out the gate. Thankfully it's short.

The land of Pai Shep is now guarded by a single warrior-farmer, his fields impeccable, his power absolute.

You're right that the average combat-minded Aerbian would never dedicate precious time to Woodworking because they simply /don't know/ the secrets of reality. But it's different for Joon or any PC with a GUI because they have the knowledge that there is a worthwhile (for a certain /worth/) virtue at the end.

I think the Woodworking 100 reveal was an intentional tease. There's guaranteed to be limitations, but it's a wink from the DM that even worthless-sounding skills can have a huge payoff. Yet Joon isn't likely to achieve 100 in any skill naturally and will probably never find out all the virtues. The morals are (1) choose wisely for those 40 skill slots and (2) soul magic is OP.

*** Either he doesn't care because it's not a priority compared to the secrets of the universe (manual of his home game) or it's an extension of his attitude towards his past life. He doesn't want to know anything about his doppelganger's parallel life because of all those awkward interpersonal issues.

Though Joon's situation is really fun food for thought: if you were sent to a parallel alternate universe where you replaced "yourself," what would that be like? You meet your friends, whose mannerisms match perfectly but share a set of experiences just different enough that you're always aware of the transposition. Even without the falling-out and drama, I'm not sure if I'd ever be able to feign memory loss and integrate back into that uncanny valley.

Maybe Arthur went through a similar experience, at one remove. Unlike Joon, all the familiar faces and characters he met only resembled his past on the surface or metaphorically. I could see where he started treating everyone as NPCs, as -without the tug of a goal like Joon has with The Lost King- his whole life is a divine joke.

** Oh wow, this is a long one. Here's my stream-of-thought, on second read:

#+begin_quote
  When the counter-imperialists failed to seize power for themselves, as everyone thought they would
#+end_quote

- Everyone thought that they'd seize power, or that they'd fail to seize power?

#+begin_quote
  “Not sure,” replied Pallida. “Ransomed it off, maybe, but that's always partnered with its own problems, because naturally, people don't want to give you money, they want you dead and their stuff back.”

  True to her word, Pallida left us behind when we got to the campus proper, insisting that she was going to ‘do her own thing' and would meet up with us later
#+end_quote

- I'm getting strong "Fenn's new PC" vibes from Pallida. Similar humor, similar background, showed up a little before Fenn died...

- Also, she's totally going to get a warrant on her head before this arc is over.

#+begin_quote
  “Helps me think,” he said, frowning at me.

  “I know,” I replied. I designed the he'lesh. “It's my understanding that it's not considered rude to ask which you just took?”

  “Indignation,” replied the bursar, narrowing his eyes at me. “You want to skip not one line, but two.”
#+end_quote

- So this species needs to take drugs to feel specific emotions or mindsets? That's an interesting concept.

#+begin_quote
  "No, no, I told him that I could arrange it, but I never said that it would be completely without caveats, and because there's no money changing hands, my hands, are, eh, tied."
#+end_quote

- That seems like a really easy to solve. How expensive can it be to bribe a unique-in-the-world academic institution that's powerful enough to control its own city-state and.. yeah, okay, I see why it might be too expensive.

#+begin_quote
  You must take classes, at least for long enough that you can have four instructors sign off.
#+end_quote

- Uuuuugh. So it's not just a sidequest, it's an /open-world/ sidequest, where you have to win over multiple NPCs each with their own problems and agenda. The DM /really/ liked his "Return to school" level.

#+begin_quote
  but it would be better to not have it come to light that the bursar was using his discretion in such a manner.
#+end_quote

- Well that doesn't look like a Chekov's gun at all, especially since you're the second person to mention this.

#+begin_quote
  Things started clicking into place. “I was,” I said. I shrugged. “Trial by adversity.”
#+end_quote

  The first night they had slept together, he had been hesitant, but she had removed his clothes with deft fingers and pressed her skin against his own.

#+begin_quote
  She had thought she could manipulate people before.
#+end_quote

- Dew it!

#+begin_quote
  “They're about a young orphan who becomes a wizard. Would you like to read them?”
#+end_quote

- This whole Harry Potter thing reminds me of a passage from Glimwarden:

#+begin_quote
  (It was with some dismay that Melanie realized Eden's Waltz was an overly sugared coming-of-age story mired in its own unreality. The author of The Cafard's Contradiction was using the book to say something subtly unkind about Odessa's naivete.)

  “She has the Dagger of Dreamspeech,” said Amaryllis. “She can look into our dreams.”
#+end_quote

- Well Bethel keeps getting creepier.

#+begin_quote
  “Speak like that inside me again, and I'll kill you all.” She began ripping Tiff apart, limb by limb, moving with furious calm.
#+end_quote

- At some point, Joon needs to have a serious conversation with Bethel about the appropriateness of death threats in a functional relationship. They're treating it all as a joke when I feel this should really be more of a dealbreaker, given how easy killing seems to be for her.

#+begin_quote
  “So send Tiff a fucking letter then, asshole!” asked Reimer.
#+end_quote

- In retrospect, "Not checking up on your previous identity's relatives and telling them what happened" is a decision that makes perfect sense as a PC, and makes you look like a complete scumbag as a human being. Joon is essentially treating the Aerb version of his friends as completely disposable and not worth the time to interact with them. I mean, obviously there are opsec concerns there, and it's not like Joon has the free time to rebuild his relationship with them... but on the other hand, they're probably the people in Aerb most able to understand what Joon is going through, and they probably /do/ have intelligence that Mary could conceivably use.

#+begin_quote
  “You're weak,” Raven replied. “You were also impaired, but beyond that, you were weak. I'm not at the peak of my power anymore, and even then, the fight we had, it was like you were one of the enemies I sometimes had to deal with on my own, not trivial, but not strong. The kind that Uther could kill by the handful as a prelude to the real battle. The kind of enemy that I would fight one-on-one while the real battle was happening elsewhere.”
#+end_quote

- What the hells was Uther fighting by the end of his reign, and how the hells was he fighting them? Raven is making it sound like a succession of DBZ fights, but realistically, I'd expect these kind of fights to end much quicker than in DBZ, because whoever is stronger would likely be an order-of-magnitude stronger, and probably experienced and pragmatic enough to go for the throat from the get go.

#+begin_quote
  "Maybe he would have, if she hadn't tried so hard to force women on him."
#+end_quote

- That does sound a little odd. I mean, I can totally buy Uther wanting to stay faithful, but this feels a little bit forced. Plus it still feels like an un-fired Chekov's gun. Although maybe Zona just /really/ wanted him to be happy.

#+begin_quote
  There was something off about the wine we were drinking, and when we opened the keg ... I still have trouble with wine sometimes.”

- Wait, no, she was /drowned/ in the wine? What the... why?

#+begin_quote
  I took me a moment to realize that she was talking about Reimer, who had been toiling away in the other room. I got up, took one last look at Bethel's impassive face, then went to go join him.
#+end_quote

- I don't know why, I keep imagining Bethel as Moira from Overwatch. Probably the stern personality and affinity for murder.

#+begin_quote
  “I want more,” I said. “Everything that you can remember. Everything.”

  “I'd be here all night,” Reimer complained.
#+end_quote

- All things considered, Reimer is being a pretty good sport about this. The money probably helps, but he could probably poke a lot of holes in Joon's cover story if he didn't feel like playing along. I know if /my/ long-lost friend showed up, claimed to have amnesia, and instead of asking about our home life, wanted a complete description of our tabletop games... I'd probably be way more frustrated than Reimer.

#+begin_quote
  He'd been reticent to let them in, but Valencia had taken the reins, and from there, it hadn't taken her too much to get him to open up. My dad, the real one back on Earth, never opened up, except a few times when he was drunk. [...] After a search of his house, which he'd for some reason consented to, they had gone to my mom's house, which had produced nothing worthwhile, then over to speak with a few of the fake versions of my friends, none of which produced any fruit.
#+end_quote

- That seems surprisingly smooth. Nobody question an heavily armed squad coming in from nowhere and asking questions about Joon?

- The way Joon keeps insisting that Aerb's versions of his friends are fake is a little sad. I'm kind of hoping that we get so see them interact with the cast (especially Mary and Grak, since Fenn... well, she's dead).

  If you are a combat mage, you will likely be working for either the Third Empire or one of its member polities at the behest of Sound and Silence.

More insidiously, sometimes the powers-that-be wish to limit casualties because of how it would appear to the public, even if that requires risking a mage's life.
#+end_quote

- Oh wow. I don't know if this is because Anglecynn is a seriously militaristic country, because combat mages are special forces and expected to act like it, or just because he personally had a rough career, but this guy /doesn't fuck around/.

  The first concrete action that the Second Empire took was to topple the troll kings and institute leadership of their own, administrators who would oversee what was only barely a government and institute the particular type of planned economy that was in vogue at the time. They dealt with the inevitable problems that follow from that sort of thing, which the Second Empire would become well-acquainted with over the years, dissident populations, asymmetric warfare, worker strikes, and the general problems that come with governance by force rather than governance by consent
#+end_quote

- In general, I love the concept of the Second Empire, and it's definitely something I'm going to steal in future fantasy stories. It's not especially original (evil empire with general Nazi parallels), but the execution feels like something I've never seen elsewhere (except a little bit in /Shadows of the Limelight/). The Empire isn't just evil, it's broken, and that broken-ness defines everything it does, how it operates, how it fails to operates, and how entire civilizations saw themselves even centuries after its destruction.

Now that she mentioned it, I could clearly see how Sound and Silence might have to have some kind of provision for her species.

Well, in a more general sense, actual Nazis are also this. “Final solution” not originally meaning “extermination” is one example, but also, well... nationalism (in the sense of “states should be built around nations”, like a certain modern democracy that shall not be named) being /the/ idea of the new age, every European intellectual thinking eugenics is the hottest idea ever 'til they actually tried it (/cf./ communism, not in the US-politics sense, but in the original one), generally researchers doing what they thought best with the same abandon they always had but now with state resources and direction (thankfully Heisenberg was shit at project planning, but Sakharov still had to learn the lesson the hard way later, and Teller never did). Nuremberg looking long and hard at the 19th-century idea that allegiance to your country is in itself a virtue and deciding to raze it and salt the ashes was also a big, big change at the time (still is for some in the US, or at least so it looks from the outside). Nazi leaders don't fall into this pattern, and I wouldn't call it the main one, but it's certainly there.

** Alas, I'm late to the party. A few thoughts of my own:

- What if one sidequest is Joon reconciling with all of his friends - each has a substantial slice of his quests? It would be worthwhile to ask if Aumann was a quest for them, et cetera. That would make for a surreal experience for fake-friends, as their fantasies become reality in a strange way.
- I always wondered what the DM said to Joon. I guess we know one of them now: most likely, that Joon got an offer to be taken out of his world and placed in a simpler one without the hells and grimdark of his current world. Less likely, but the last two redactions become obvious now too

#+begin_quote
  “I'll do it,” I said. “Can I ... what happens to me, when I leave Earth? I'd like to leave a note or something.” /If I was really here, was Earth even real?/ “I don't want to hurt anyone.”

  “An alternate Juniper from another world takes your place,” he replied.

  “Oh,” I replied. “Okay, I guess that works. Unless I win and become God?”

  “Then you can do whatever you want, if you feel like it,” he replied.

  “And that's the whole deal?” I asked. “I go through to this place, Aerb, I play the part of a hero, I fix everything there forever, if I can, and in return ... I don't have to worry about Earth?”
#+end_quote

- What if Joon decides that he wants to go home and make amends, and the final boss is other-joon who has been questing back at home? Winner gets to go home, loser is dead. This doesn't make a ton of sense, since there's less questing to do on earth, and Arthur is a better final boss, but it's also a fun idea.
- On another note, the combination of the Void and Sable has not been adequately explored. If the void effect goes through "six inches of flesh and bone, half an inch of steel, or five hundred feet of air", then you can apply directionality to the void effect by simply wrapping it in a cube of steel at least 1.1 inches on a side (well, only the base is flat, the other sides can be a sphere to save on mass). Remove a cone from this cube to define the direction in which the void propogation will happen, and design the object so that it triggers instantly upon being exposed to light. Activate them in an extremely dark place, with known orientation, and suck them all up with sable. The next time you're in trouble, and OK with an indiscriminate destruction, unleash a bunch of those puppies in the direction of your foe. You can now stand in one place, your allies all behind you, and blow away your enemy with ease. Unleashing several at once would allow you to destroy the intervening air before it can be sucked in from the sides-this would improve range.

  - I'm sure that all of this will raise the ire of the Void Beast

** Yay new WTC, now I can stop checking for new chapters every day...

until the itch comes back.

The tides joke caught me by surprise.

** Good mix of intrigue, exposition and humor hear. I loved the classified bit. Hope things don't get too dark suddenly with this plotline. I'm going to saw the sinister plot is either going to be a world ending threat or have very mundane reasons behind it.

** I want an update on how Ropey's marriage has changed Bethel's personality. She seems maybe slightly nicer?

** Thought on the last line of 142, before I read 143:

It's interesting that the Reimer/ Reimer-clone only recognizes Juniper, and not Raven, who's standing right there. Probably not actually Reimer. Maybe someone who knew the Aerbian Juniper? Or someone left info by Arthur.

** Great story as usual

I am a little confused about the beard and cleanliness thing. What's unclean about a beard? You wouldn't tell someone to shave their head to get over something because hair is unclean, seems strange to say it about a beard. Is there some cultural dwarf stuff I'm missing?

Edit: Also I love Reimar, munchkinning everything, being an honest dick. He's my favourite character

*** It's weird because dwarves always have a beard in fiction, but in reality it's absolutely a thing to have an unkempt beard when you're depressed. Presumably it's more of the second thing than the first and Juniper noticed.

**** Messy hair isn't the same as being dirty. I imagine for dwarves naturally grown beards are the same as naturally grown hair.

Are people given advice to comb their hair when they're feeling depressed? Is that the analogue?

** Late to the party, but is Magus Oberlin, the combat magic instructor from chapter 144, inspired by [[http://www.pathguy.com/]] ?

Clues:

- Pathguy is XYY, which is mentioned in chapter 145.
- Pathguy has a page about the buzz cut, which is specifically called out about the Magus
- Magus Oberlin's method is extremely matter of fact, as is Pathguy's
- Pathguy is super into worldbuilding and it's likely that the author has read his stuff. See [[http://www.pathguy.com/planes.html]]
