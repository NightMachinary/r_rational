** at some point, can you talk about the concept of structured spells vs. moldings? it seems like moldings use up no air, but structure spells do... so is there a difference in how he treats the air in either case? if his moldings get strong enough to carry things then could he carry them indefinitely because his air is not used up? can a sharp molding harm something like an aerial slash?

*** Great request, I'll bring up the topic again when Seti starts learning new stuff at Prestige and some munchkinery happens. For now, just note that moldings have zero effect in the real world like structured spells would. I might edit chapter 8 a little to clarify that part, but nothing that would alter what's needed to know up to this point.

**** So it's basically making mana shapes and not air shapes? If he shaped air, it would have effect on real world.

***** The confusion here is likely my fault for failing to comprehensively put what's in my mind on paper, though the questions will let me edit stuff to know how to word it!

In my mind, I see it like mana shaping (similar to Mother of Learning). The difference with my story is that there isn't a physical representation for it (like pen spinning, burning cards, etc).

The mana "shape" affects the mancy to make the shape or whatever, but it wouldn't affect the real world since the molding would be technically a zero-grit thing.

Basically, we can walk through air without resistance rather easily (zero grit) but can feel a light breeze (tier one grit). The moldings cannot be seen nor felt physically, which is why perception is needed. Someone could technically walk through the moldings and not even know they did so.

Another analogy could be like a stick-shift car: moldings would be a permanent first gear ride, whereas spells would be the fifth gear. Use this analogy loosely, but it should give the idea that moldings cannot overpower spells.

****** So does some air move with it or is it just mana?

******* For aeromancers, the air particles are what moves in response to the mana. But to anyone without Seti's perception, it may not be air at all since they wouldn't see or physically feel anything regardless.

We'll touch upon moldings again in Prestige, and will even see someone else's moldings to get a better idea of how other non-aeromancers do it.

** I like your story, but I wish I got into it when you had 100 chapters already. Waiting a week per chapter is tough ;_;

Keep up the good work, I want to see where this goes!

*** The story is planned out all the way to the very end and the conclusion of every major plot point. Details include knowing who dies, how characters develop, and major plot twists. Some smaller inbetween stuff is subject to change, but I don't see myself changing anything big.

That's assuming I write that much lol, so I did mark several locations where a story could technically end early and still be somewhat satisfying, despite not finishing all plot points.

***** Oof, this is hard to do lol. So quick fun fact: we were supposed to enter Prestige as of Chapter 5 (and be neck-deep with that section of the story as of now). But I wanted to try to make this story as rational as possible, which pushed things back a bit.

I would like for the Prestige-Champion part of the story to end around Chapter 25-30, but we'll see if that'll actually happen.

Overall story word count might be more than where MoL is now. Take that with a grain of salt, as I may decide to cut some mini arcs depending on how the pacing is.

****** I really like that you dont push the story to hard! Some scenes of leisure just add to the world, story and characters. So please keep up the good work = ) Its really fun so far and I really hope to see more of Setis Family and the so far mysterious mother.

**** Looks better, but take my advice with a grain of salt. I think I just dislike the term dragonspawn.

I find it heavily couched in a negative connotation and feels like terminology that only comes up in fantasy writing. Young dragon, initiate dragons... hard to figure out a replacement term used in a modern society that does the concept justice. You might also have some luck mixing it with Italian terms to fit more with the mafia vibe, apprendista, erede, giovane drago or something of that mix.

As you can see I am incredibly biased.

I mean, I thought while reading that that was the point of the term; a label by the mainstream media to cast new scions of the Families in a negative light, right from their debut.

***** Ayy I like some of those words. I'll keep what you said in mind for future title stuff.

Oh, and for a fun fact, the term dragonspawn comes from the word Bhaalspawn, which makes its appearance in Baldur's Gate, a cRPG game I played recently a few months back and may or may not have influenced some stuff :o
