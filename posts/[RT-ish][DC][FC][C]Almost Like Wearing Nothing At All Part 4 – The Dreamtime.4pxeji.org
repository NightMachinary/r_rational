*** Ugh, normally I like reading about villains and mentally disturbed characters, but Tavish was just too much for me. ;)

Nice ending to the story!

** Wooo! Invincible Naked Amazonian Grandmother! Was hoping she'd get to confront the gods about how messed up the world is, but that ending is pretty good too.

** Nice story! I like how you played with a ton of tropes in this story, like Kill the Healer First, We All Meet At an Inn, Battle Monk, The Gods Did It, and of course Bikini Armor. And just the right length too, well done :)

** I didn't read this chapter yet, but I have an UI request. Maybe it's not important but here it goes.

When you posted part 3, I read parts 1, 2 and 3. There are "pingback" links in the end of part 1, for parts 2 and 3. But there are no pingbacks in parts 2 and 3, which makes it somewhat harder to go to the next part.

Also:

Let's chat for a few Tavish -> for a few moments/minutes, or for a little

ideas about hot wot do things -> maybe this is intentional :D

*** For a few was intentional. It's common phrasing here... but I see your point. The next one: clearly needs fixing. I will add the ping back links.

** Nice conclusion. Unexpected, and I cringed a bit at the thought of [[#s][]]

Good job m8!
