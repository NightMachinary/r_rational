I should probably just say "this is good enough" and post it on ff.net, especially because it's not in active development (and if it does ever go into active development, this would just be the first chapter - I've sort of moved to thinking it works as a standalone).

I mean, I'm not a Tarzan fan by any stretch of the imagination, and yet I will still read that Tarzan fic that you've mentioned in the past.

#+begin_quote
  *Foreword*

  I have endeavored to keep this story as accurate as possible, but I must admit that where the truth could only be guessed at, I have made my guesses. I shall also caution that this story has not been kept free of outright fabrications. There were places where a flourish was needed, and where dramatic license was taken. Do not mistake me though; I have pored over a multitude of documents, including those taken from the trials, and where possible I have spoken with the survivors. It may seem to the reader that I want it both ways --- that I want the story to be seen as accurate but not find myself beholden to the truth of history --- and it may be that the reader is correct. When I was approached to write this book, I was given the task of turning a pivotal event in Britannia's history into a personal one. If a few useful lies needed to be told along the way, so be it.

  Our story begins with a young girl on a steamship off the coast of Africa, and ends with the crucible in which the modern world was forged.

"Well, um, er... It was totally intentional! Yeah. Totally intentional. It's supposed to be reflective of how the /fake/ author didn't do a tip-top job of writing this thing. Yeah..."

****** That's a great intro, foreword rather than foreward right?

Just the idea of a twist on Tarzan is going to appeal to a number of people on this subreddit, certainly hits the mark for the demographic.

Is there any reason you don't post them if they're written, might the feedback give you clues as to whether to put more time into it or let it stay?

#+end_quote

Er, right. Fixed that, thanks.

The reason that I don't post things as they're written is usually that I don't personally like reading stories that go "dead". You get three or four great chapters, and then it just comes to a complete halt for months or years while the author gets distracted by other things. And then as an author, if you post something obviously incomplete, you'll get people asking you when you're planning on picking that thing back up again.

I guess I would rather just post the whole thing in one go once it's done and get the feedback then. If I post things to get feedback, I would feel like I was crowdsourcing beta-reading, and I already have my wife for a beta-reader.

**** Reminds me a bit of this short story by Cory Doctorow, "To Go Boldly" (found in /The New Space Opera 2/), where the "Enterprise" (with names changed for copyright reasons) runs into an alien ship that's super-tiny, and they all beam down to the nearby planet and get in a fight, only for the alien to be utterly shocked that the Federation has the technology to convert people into data and then reform into new bodies, but never think to just save the data patterns in case something happens- he's not actually physically present in the ship, just a program running on the computer (a copy of the original back home); after all, if he only has one instance and gets killed he's dead forever. What kind of idiots wouldn't make backups? Or even realize that they could make backups, instead of slinging around their only bodies in a metal can around the galaxy?

  */Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead/*, often referred to as just */Rosencrantz and Guildenstern/*, is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_the_Absurd][absurdist]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism][existentialist]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragicomedy][tragicomedy]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Stoppard][Tom Stoppard]], first staged at the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe][Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1966. The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare][Shakespeare's]] /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet][Hamlet]]/, the courtiers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern][Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]. The action of Stoppard's play takes place mainly "in the wings" of Shakespeare's, with brief appearances of major characters from /Hamlet/ who enact fragments of the original's scenes. Between these episodes the two protagonists voice their confusion at the progress of events of which---occurring onstage without them in /Hamlet/---they have no direct knowledge.

********* Ask your wife-to-be, but you can do a pretty tasteful non-denominational wedding. All you really need is an exchange of rings, some vows, and a few readings. My wife and I picked these three readings:

#+begin_quote
  *Goodridge v Department of Public Health*

  "The exclusive commitment of two individuals to each other nurtures love and mutual support; it brings stability to our society. ... Without question, ... marriage enhances the welfare of the community. It is a social institution of the highest importance. ... Marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family. Because it fulfils yearnings for security, safe haven, and connection that express our common humanity, ... marriage is an esteemed institution, and the decision whether and whom to marry is among life's momentous acts of self-definition."

  *Excerpt from Timequake by Kurt Vonnegut*

  My uncle Alex Vonnegut, a Harvard-educated life insurance salesman who lived at 5033 North Pennsylvania Street, taught me something very important. He said that when things were really going well we should be sure to notice it. He was talking about simple occasions, not great victories: maybe drinking lemonade on a hot afternoon in the shade, or smelling the aroma of a nearby bakery, or fishing and not caring if we catch anything or not, or hearing somebody all alone playing a piano really well in the house next door. Uncle Alex urged me to say this out loud during such epiphanies: 'If this isn't nice, what is?'
#+end_quote

And then "Roads Go Ever On" by J.R.R.Tolkien as the third, but that's too long to quote here.

The issues would come if she wanted to be married by a Catholic priest, because they have their own thing going on. Otherwise, getting someone to do the ceremony is the only thing you need; talk to other atheists to see what they've done, but there are a number of progressive churches out there that will be more than happy to help you.

**** I personally love all of Scalzi's work. In terms of sort of light sci-fi in the same vein as "Redshirts", try "Agent to the Stars" or "The Androids Dream". They're both stand alone sci-fi with great humor and amusing premises.

The Androids dream actually starts with a chapter long fart joke. Swear to god. It's hilarious!

I actually read Agent to the Stars back before he was even a published author - he posted it as a "Shareware Book" on his blog.
