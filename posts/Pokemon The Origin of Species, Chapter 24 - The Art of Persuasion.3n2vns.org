** Hey all, welcome back! Two things of note unrelated to this chapter: First, I finally got around to updating Chapter 1 to improve the characterizations of Red and Blue off the bat. Second, I finally completed and uploaded a digital copy of the full flowchart that Red used in Chapter 20 upon noticing that he was upset. I put it in an earlier post, and here it is again:

[[https://i.imgur.com/q5tYYSA.jpg]]

All feedback on either is appreciated, as always!

As for this chapter, I just want to quickly note that the grant application and endowment process for research is far more streamlined and rapid in the Pokemon world than ours. Red's experience, grueling as it is, is not at all representative of the full struggle researchers in our world go through.

I'll get around to another major edit wave for the chapter sometime tomorrow. In the meantime, feel free to post any typos I missed in response here.

** In a previous chapter, you mentioned that letting Blue win in his first match against Brock would have set a bad precedent storywise, that you felt it would reinforce a stereotype of him. Yet you also mention, and Blue laments, that the current Elite Four members were undefeated. I don't think this is something Blue himself would casually overlook. Why /doesn't/ he manage to achieve what they did? What did they do that he didn't? What didn't they do that he did?

As a rational fiction protagonist, he should perhaps want an answer to this before he comes back, and "use a stronger pokemon" shouldn't be the whole of his solution without some reflection, it would feel nearly as cheap to the story as being handed the victory in the first place. Now perhaps it can be part of it. Shiftry is Dark. Did Agatha win her gym trials with a strong lead of ghosts and poison? Did Bruno win with rocks and fighting? If so one might deduce that matching pokemon to your personal type affinity is important, and justify Shiftry.

Or perhaps, the exceptional circumstances by which Blue's skill and friends for backup led him to own a massively overleveled pokemon ahead of the gym rating schedule (first badge, oh, and my guy's level 30 btw, pikachu, quick attack that rock to death) - in exactly the same way that the Elite Four have managed. Through personal risk and hardship, they get powerful pokemon ahead of schedule and so blow through the tiered ranking system that didn't plan for that.

Or maybe I'm just full of it. What do you think?

*** As [[/u/Alphanos]] said, Blue had delusions of grandeur: he's definitely above average in skill, but he was trying to beat the records of his idols, not just getting his badges faster than they did but also assuming he'd be undefeated. He lost because he simply didn't put in the time or training that he needed to make sure his pokemon were strong enough or well trained enough.

As for "use a stronger pokemon," there's definitely more skill involved in that than in the games. They try to put a soft limit on how powerful your pokemon can get too early by making your pokemon occasionally not listen to your orders if they get too high a level: I believe the threshold before the first badge is level 30 pokemon and up stop listening to their trainer.

But while a good idea and a cool concept to reflect the trainer's lack of experience making it hard to control more mature pokemon, it's poorly implemented. Level 25 is more than enough to beat the first badge, hell, level 20 is even overdoing it. On top of that, the power difference is just so strong between levels that even if your pokemon stops obeying you all the time, as long as they get one attack off every few turns they'll still melt whatever's in front of them.

So yes, Blue's idea (because he still wants to win quickly) is to put in the time and training not just with his other pokemon, but also to train his unruly shiftry for the raw power he needs. Having such a strong pokemon is an invaluable asset, and taking the time to train it properly should be a high priority for any trainer that gets one.

Blue had two competing goals: to win undefeated, and to issue and complete the required challenges in as short a time period as possible. I believe it was mentioned that those who were able to complete the challenges undefeated took longer to do so. It's only natural that it would take longer to be assured of success. Blue impulsively tried to shave off time in his speedrun attempt, but he wasn't ready, so he ended up failing the undefeated goal by prioritizing the speed goal.

Also, despite him being a main character of the story, there's no inherent guarantee that his talent and capabilities match all of the famous trainers he's comparing himself to. Wanting something and working towards it aren't always enough. Even among Olympic-level athletes, not everyone can be a world-record holder.

*** Hey, thanks for the typo spot and the feedback. I actually thought of just showing what she writes, but had two problems with it: 1) It would mean a chapter with pretty much zero dialogue and all exposition, and 2) It would miss an opportunity to show Leaf and Laura's relationship develop "on screen" rather than as an informed trait.

That said, I probably didn't get the balance of information and immersion right. I had the same problem with chapter 6 originally, and ended up rewriting it after publishing to make things more compelling.

*** It's simple. in the games, adult pokemon are substantially stronger than the basic ones. shiftry is fully evolved/metamorphosized and with the removal of general levels as per the video games, or at least the loss of the interface, this is one of the most obvious patterns- raichu can do more than pikachu, which is generally true. plus, while shiftry aren't amazing species in top-level play in the games, they are a substantial upgrade from squirtle, pidgey and rattatata, while a smaller downgrade from from other potent pokemon, like steelix and alakazam. compined with type advantage, (shiftry is grass/psychic, and onix's special defense is mediocre.) shiftry is a very dangerous weapon against brock's pokemon, and that's why blue wants to use it.

** Ok so first of all, good chapters all around lately, I haven't had the availability to comment on the updates but I've read them all as they've come out and I've appreciated a lot the full characterization of the universe as well as the gradual build up of the characters and their reactions and expectations to the society around them.

Pulling now from two different but intertwined points, I would like to explore again the idea of scientific publications on the Pokemon world.

The first is simply this, are there no state/country grants? You mention the Pallet Lab as an option, but even if there are more organizations and private companies performing research all around I would imagine the governing bodies(which I'll honestly admit I don't really remember which structure you've described as having) possess a general research grant proposal system to prevent from any one lab unfairly advantaging their local researchers instead of the most skilled ones. This would not be necessary to be a current option, because I would assume this would be similar to our world, and like many countries, those specific grants would be open for submission on a strickly defined period of time with annual regularity. This ties into my second point.

While Red is pre-committing to stopping his investment before it gets out of hand, and even though he added the "for now" on his project, it's also a common behaviour for people to have an inertia to resume their previously abandoned projects. Would it not be more realistic considering his character to also stipulate a future point where he might approach this idea gain, re-evaluate its worth and perhaps repeat the process? After all seasonal interest might also have an influence in his various rejections.

I brought up the first point because I thought it would work well with this second point. Postponing his grant applications until the annual grant proposition period seems like a reasonable and well defined goal for a rational Red.

Perhaps I'm just over thinking this because I'm more involved with this kind of stuff nowadays, but either way keep up the good work.

Possibly, but I think his perspective is that he'll find so many other things to potentially research that short of some other new observation making this one relevant again, it won't need to be revisited anytime soon.
