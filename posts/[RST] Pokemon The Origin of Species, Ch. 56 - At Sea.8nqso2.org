Okay but more seriously, great chapter. It's really nice to get back to Red and Leaf after a pretty long time with just Blue's group, Red meeting president Silph was pretty cool, Red's caught the preparations for the attack on the S.S. Anne but doesn't realize it yet, and... um...

...Oh, who am I kidding. As awesome as this chapter is, too much of my processing power is taken up by an infinitely-looping squeal at the cuteness of Red's crush for me to make any sort of rational commentary. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be listening to /I Ship It/ for a month.

** Now I'm really conflicted. The obvious thing for Reds personal growth and career ambitions would be to stop being a trainer, yes. I thought as much back when he talked with Sabrina. On the other hand, that would be crap for the story. Splitting the party temporarily is one thing, but a permanent split wouldn't make sense.

Here's my prediction: Red will decide to stay with the group for a while longer, a few months or so. He will justify it to himself by saying "a few months won't make a big difference over the span of my life" and because he doesn't want to leave his friends. It will also be because of his crush, but he won't admit that to himself.

*** I honestly think a 6 to 18 month separation for the group would be pretty good for where the story is right now. Blue is coming down off a harrowing encounter that cost him his strongest Pokemon, and nearly got them all killed. At the same time, he seems to be responding really well to the environment of Vermilion Gym, and so I can really easily see him just throwing himself into that fully for a while, especially when the next gym is Erika. After the boat stuff, there's definitely enough weird stuff going on to potentially keep Leaf busy piecing together loose threads, and that could easily lead her to branch off into Red's mom's story line to actually progress the plot. Meanwhile, Red can take some levels in Wiz, flesh out the Mewtwo storyline a little with Sabrina, and maybe publish a paper or two.

Plus, there's all sorts of stuff that naturally would bring the party back together in the near-ish future. Blue is definitely going to want to train his Abra for Erika and Koga, and will probably need Red's help. Leaf would probably be the one who first stumbles upon the whole Lavender town mess, and will probably want some reinforcements to help save Mr. Fuji, which just snowballs into invading Silph co, the radio tower, and then the Rocket lair.

*** Given the indication that Red's going to ask his mom about Silph (and we all know the mess involved with that), I feel like the story's nearing a tipping point, the start of Act 2 if you will.

Red's got a once in a lifetime opportunity to get just about the best psychic training possible, Blue's gathering a following and exercising his leadership skills independent of the group. Leaf has the foundations laid and basic lessons learned to start pursuing stories on her own and earning acclaim as a journalist.

I figure that these competing pressures will soon come to a head and have the group split up temporarily - a few months, maybe a year or two - before they reunite in Act 3 once whatever Team Rocket's doing comes into full force and the heroes need to save the day.

*** Honestly I see this dilemma as a non-issue. Red should just continue journeying with his friends until Blue and Aiko finish off collecting their gym badges. That would only take a year or two max with their skill levels, I imagine. Meanwhile, he can continue growing his talents for training and catching new Pokémon to help him with his research, as well as working on his psychic abilities himself and chipping away at new research work.

It honestly seems like Red is acting like he has less time than he actually does when realistically, unless he meets an untimely end, he has plenty of time.

*** Planning for the future is well and good, but I think we're all about to learn a more important lesson: opportunities happen before you're "ready" for them.

My guess is that Red's current emotional conflict will be resolved when the plot swoops in and forces Leaf and him to save the ship (for some unknown value of "save"). Additionally, just to make the choice for Red more clear, I wouldn't be surprised if Sabrina ends up implicated (/we do know she is working for Giovanni/).

Well, look how late it is here. I guess I will have to leave my extensive comment for another day. As always an amazing read, really enjoyed it. I hope we reaf fans get more love like this, and red makes the right choice.

Btw, I'm begining to think that I should make a list of questions I want to ask you, I keep thinking more and forgetting them. Here is the newer one: how do you deal with special berries, like the ones that help you resist a specific attack type? Are there any legends about power granting berries, like the liechi berry tree at Mirage Island?

Special berries exist in some forms, but many of them don't function the same way as in the games, since they're so tied to specific and arbitrary game mechanics. But one berry has already been mentioned as something Red fed his Pichu to make his electricity less risky to train with, so things like that are generally what I have in mind.

It already means that in English too, viridian is just a fancy word for green. Honestly, I think Viridian Forest is kind of a silly name to begin with, but then again, most pokemon city names are like that (I think all generation I names are colours).

Back in the Grand Old Days of fandom on Yahoo Groups, livejournal, private archives, and finally Fanfiction.net, in the late 90s and early 2000s, the term "lemon" was used to describe a fanfic with explicit sexual content, because for whatever reason people were allergic to saying "explicit sexual content," "porn," or similar things. This was mostly a thing in the anime fandom communities, though it spread by cultural diffusion into others.

The fact that people no longer know what I'm talking about when I refer to it 1) makes me glad that fandom has grown up enough to use real words 2) makes me feel like an Old Man of the Internet.

Wonder if Bill was involved in this too, if not for the programming then at least for the financing. For that remaining blind spot of underground pokemon, it can probably get the pokemon under its own command to use Earthquake for massive damage - but that's probably too prone to collateral damage to actually be a viable idea, outside of extreme situations. Hm.

The way you ended that chapter was very poetic, how Leaf's own comment on splitting up unknowingly echoed Red's own decision and dilemma.

The story implies that the native language of Kanto is Japanese.

So why does everyone speak English exclusively?

Older generations are shown as still using some Japanese (Koga "about to lapse completely into Japanese" in that interlude; or Red's dad commanding his Mightyena in Japanese).

The younger generation also seems to know Japanese (Blue's "sakki" and Red understanding his dad when he talked in Japanese).

*** Yeah I wonder if this will be more like the Anime's SS Anne with the Rocket attack rather than the game's just-another-dungeon.

If so, I look forward to Red's rationalist interpretation of Mecha-Charstoiseisaur on the talking Pokemon island. ^{/s}

I've definitely been expecting it to be a Team Rocket attack on the Anne like in the Anne-ime, but I'll admit I hadn't drawn that thought to the logical conclusion. XD

** Man, if only he had a way that he could visit his friends whenever he wanted, a method whereby they could all instantly transport themselves to an agreed-upon meeting location on the weekends and transport themselves back when they were done.

I mean, sure, it might be difficult to acquire the method of transportation, so it would be helpful if that had an expert or two or three or four who could assist them in getting more of said resource.

They can do a timeskip if they want, but any implication that he won't see his friends for months or more is downright silly.

** Not exactly related to this story, but to a rational interpretation of pokemon in general.

I'm writing a story that isn't exactly a rational fiction, but uses a rational setting (consistent rules, realistic). As part of the this, I've been reworking all the mechanics of the games into something that makes more sense. One thing I'm not sure about is how to do a rational explanation or alternative to pokemon evolution by trading.

I have two ideas at this point. 1. In the wild, evolution by trade is actually a result of migration 2. Results from moving between different "packs" of that species, like when a male lion leaves the pride it was born into to make or take another.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Thank you.

*** I like both those ideas, and considered similar things before giving up on the idea altogether as too game-specific. If I tried rationalizing that then what about holding items while being traded? Or evolving with another pokemon in the same party? (It's not like they're actually next to each other when they evolve, one is in its pokeball), or holding your 3DS upside down?

*** I also planing to write a rational pokemon fic .(well a pokemon mystery dungeon quest inspired by this and mfd more specifically) and have been trying to justify some really gamey bits of canon, but I think I haven't though of trade evolution yet. I think you should just ignore the trading part, and just think of it as an abstraction of more specific evolution mechanics. Maybe metal coat for example just represents the Pokemon eating a lot of metal , or maybe its an item that the Pokemon has to be in contact whith for along time . Kadabra could need the psychic contact of multiple psychic Pokemon and trainers or something like that .

*** I do remember that originally the plan for golem and machamp was that they had to be traded with each other a la escavalier, but it got dropped.

Since trades are executed digitally, and both golem and machamp are very rare among trainers in rby, there could be a data corruption concept. note that machoke gains a pair of arms and graveller loses it.

For Alakazam/gengar, I could see an interpretation that mediums and psychics are studying different aspects of the same phenomenon and only by being exposed to both types of trainers can a kadabra or haunter reach its full potential.

  The sheer amount of these things that have come out in the past couple of days is itself a problem. He sees comments by people already complaining about how it's clogging up news feeds. Sites that allow for user voting have thankfully responded swiftly, consolidating them all to mega-threads or downvoting them into oblivion, but that latter just risks a negative response to /any/ future claim of measurable basis for psychic phenomenon!

  If someone had asked him yesterday whether he'd ever be upset at his research being cited in dozens of papers, he'd have said the more the merrier. But... not like this. His work is being used to justify all sorts of sensationalized nonsense.
#+end_quote

Wonder if all these articles coming out of nowhere, simultaneously, are enemy action to muddy the field, drown discourse in a thousand disparate theories, and keep researchers away from finding out what some 3rd party already knows. We know Giovanni is heavily involved in research involving psychics and has been established to use heavy-handed and partially transparent tactics to achieve his goals (e.g. the psychic cellphone texting with Leaf) ...
