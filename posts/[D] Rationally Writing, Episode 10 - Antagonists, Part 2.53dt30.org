** Just binged this series recently, and it's been very nice. It's interested me in reading Pokemon: The Origin Of Species, as well as Shadows Of The Limelight and Glimwarden. (I was already a fan of Alexander Wales' fanfiction.) Haven't gotten a chance yet, though.

*** I highly recommend all of the above.

Glimwarden is, apart from its fantasy elements, almost painfully believable, which speaks to either thorough research or an unfortunate familiarity with bureaucracy and petty politics. The fantasy elements and characters are also engaging and intriguing. It's one of the serials I read as soon as possible after each update.

Shadows of the Limelight is a very interesting setting. The "superpowers /but.../ tied to your notoreity" aspect makes it very different to the usual superhero fare. At the same time it does a better job of explaining some superhero tropes (e.g. the perpetually escaping villain) than traditional entries in the genre.

Pokemon: TOoS is excellent, though there are so many angles currently being explored in the story that it's hard to say what its eventual theme will be. At present it's a fantastic rationalist take on the Pokemon setting with engaging characters and writing, and has room to grow further.

I could gush about them more, but I think this should be enough.

**** I've just read the first four chapters of Shadows and the problem I have with it is that the characters are almost completely defined by the roles they play, which makes them boring since they don't have any personality below the surface. It's like watching a reality show from behind the scenes, how do you write a compelling narrative when your story is about people who create false narratives out of their lives?

*** Glad to hear it! I'd definitely be interested in hearing what you think of Pokemon, when you get around to it.

** Welcome back everyone! Today we explore how to match antagonists against protagonists, how villains should push heroes, and other ways to structure compelling antagonists and conflicts.

Also, if you'd like, stay tuned until the end for our first advertisement, which doubles as a book recommendation. It's after the outro music because we'd like to try to keep them unobtrusive, but we'll also be recommending a different book every episode to try to keep them interesting.

Thanks for listening, and all feedback welcome!

** All Star Superman had interesting take on themed antagonists. They were misconceptions and wrong takes on Superman. Atlas and Samson were dumb brutes forcing themselves on Lois. Kryptonians were colonizators feeling superior. Black kryptonite Superman was coward without powers, when figthing with stronger enemy. Zimbarro was outcast, couldn't connect with anybody around him.

*** Never read that one. Is the animated film a good adaptation?

**** No, original story is too episodic to be properly adapted into movie. Some subplots were removed and the rest feels disconnected. Lots of interesting metacommentary and de/reconstruction is lost in the process.
