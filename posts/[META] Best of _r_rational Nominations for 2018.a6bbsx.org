Welcome to the inaugural Best of [[/r/rational]]!

This is the voting thread. The categories are:

- Best Post\\
- Best Comment\\
- Best Munchkinry Question
- Best Munchkinry Response
- Best [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][Weekly Challenge]] Entry
- Most Helpful Worldbuilder
- Best Off-Topic Discussion

Whoever wins will be get reddit gold, as will the person who nominated them. You *can* nominate your own posts and comments, though make sure that they're actually good. You can nominate multiple things, though don't nominate your own stuff twice in the same category. Obviously all your nomination posts should be links to [[/r/rational]], with some additional notes below. Also obviously, the post/comment should be from 2018.

Nominations and voting will close on January 5th, after which we'll have a results thread. This thread will stay stickied until then.


** Reply to this comment with your nomination for *best off-topic discussion in [[/r/rational]] from 2018*. (This can be from one of the Off-Topic threads, or something sufficiently off-topic within its parent post.)

*** u/cthulhuraejepsen:
#+begin_quote
  Similar to a comment in the thread you linked, it seems like you could kill the entire [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community by putting a slow acting contact poison on a book labelled "Descriptions of infohazards", and then wait a week for it to be shared to and by everyone.

(Tempted to also nominate 108 Terabytes per Second but then I'd fall into a slippery slope and end up nominating all of their short stories)
