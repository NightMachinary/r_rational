[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6def1q/biweekly_challenge_low_budget/][Last time,]] the prompt was "Low Budget", and our winner was [[/u/arenavanera]], with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6def1q/biweekly_challenge_low_budget/di27otv/][their story, "A boring test in a room"]]. Go read it now, and [[/u/arenavanera]], congratulations on your second win!

This time the challenge is *Gods*. You are free to take this in whatever direction you please, whether the god(s) in question are literal or metaphorical, whether they're actively present in the story or merely discussed by the characters. If you're writing a story that involves a real world religion, try not to be a dick about it. In issuing this challenge I'm largely thinking about Scott Alexander's work (examples [[http://unsongbook.com/][A]], [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/][B]], [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/][C]]). Remember that prompts are meant to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, June 21st.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules

*** I like it! I was expecting a story where he picks a munchkin power and somehow escapes the cost, but was pleasantly surprised. (Not because I don't love munchkin stories, just because it's fun to have some variety.)

*** If I were in his position I'd try to find anyone else who made that deal and see if there were any hidden downsides. Also, I'm surprised he didn't think to ask. From pretty much the beginning I was wondering if he could find a god that would just do absolutely nothing.
