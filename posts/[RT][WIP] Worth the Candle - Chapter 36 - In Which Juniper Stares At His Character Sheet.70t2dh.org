** My first proper update and I'm just in time for the title drop! I picked this story up a couple of days ago, finished it in under twenty-four hours, and already want to go for a reread, so let me join in with the chorus of praise here.

Anyway, going through the chapter.

#+begin_quote
  Well, no, that was the wrong question. The real question was the proper way to minmax
#+end_quote

In my head, this just buries the question. After all, Juniper's got to decide what to minmax /for/. Genre conventions and what he's been through so far would push him towards trying to be a combat monster, but it's not like that's the only option. He could probably go off and, I don't know, open up a bakery if he wanted (or join an acting troupe). Or he could try upping his social/intelligence abilities and being the guy who hires out adventurers to go out and complete quests for him. There are so many options if you step back from trying to break the game and instead look at changing the game.

On a semi-related note, Joon's earlier speculation on whether the game is railroading him (w/ the cowardice trait and the princess plothook) is making me think he should check in with Arthur's writing about Refusing the Call -- if Arthur was dealing with the same problems there might be a clue there.

#+begin_quote
  it was clear that the game was actually changing things in my head.
#+end_quote

Somehow, I keep forgetting that this exists as a very good reason not to go messing about with Mental abilities (or to a lesser extent pick up skills, raise loyalties, or interact with the game /at all/ really). I don't think I've seen another litRPG or story that really delves into this whole extinction of self idea. It's terrifying and I love it.

It's also ramping up the existentialism a whole lot which brings us to:

#+begin_quote
  WARNING: COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT HAS CAUSED PERSONALITY NETWORK TO EXCEED HOLISTIC INTEGRITY THRESHOLDS. REVERSING AND REFACTORING EMULATION TO WITHIN HOLISTIC INTEGRITY THRESHOLDS. ENABLING TRI-STRATUM PSEUDO-INTELLIGENCE INJECTION SETTING TO COMPENSATE.
#+end_quote

Well that's terrifying. I was not expecting that from this self proclaimed self-insert litRPG portal fantasy that seems to be sort of moving towards harem shenanigans and general overpoweredness. That's actually a little bit bone chilling as far as plot twists go.

But there are probably clues buried here. A cursory google of “Tri-stratum” points to a theory of intelligence that seems to match up at least a little with the ways skills and abilities operate (although that could just be a bit of coincidence given that they're both modelling similar things). I kind of want to skim through Eclipse Phase in case there's any inspiration for the themes/execution here, because that might point in certain directions for this story.

#+begin_quote
  And the message, about exceeding personality bounds, said that they had put in bounds to keep me from becoming not-Juniper.
#+end_quote

I can't quite decide if this is comforting or not. It /probably/ is, but everything going on here is somewhat horrifying, for obvious reasons. It's enough to throw everything about everything into doubt.

Still, I guess that the only real answer at this point is to “push forward, try not to think about it, focus on other things, do what needs doing” like Joon said.... Although the fact that he holds that attitude, and conviently has a history that leads him to respect the world as real, is in itself suspect because if I were an all powerful DM, those are the values I would want him to hold

That aside, I doubt Juniper is going to be able to avoid picking away at this, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this revelation shakes things up going forward.

Also, I find it sort of funny that in a chapter called “In Which Juniper Stares At His Character Sheet”, the character sheet never actually makes it on screen (not that I think it should have).

*** I don't necessarily buy that "personality bounds" == becoming NOT Juniper. It's a Ship of Thesseus paradox in that if you change out the part of you that is run by intelligence why should you be considered a different person anymore than if you lifted weights to change the part of you that is muscle mass.

#+end_quote

I like the Animorphs: The Reckoning take on a similar-ish problem, which points out the "distinction between the object and the meta---between that-which-changes and that-which-guides-the-change" (and that just turning the dial up on all traits equally might lead to a problem, because even if those traits are kept in a constant ratio, the payoffs from them might vary at different rates).

Getting overwritten by some higher power is a problem because it's not a natural change, or one that you would lead yourself to. Normally when people change over time there's still a continuity of self, where you can trace a clear line between who you were and who you are, and all the steps in between. That's not really the case if suddenly something outside of you reaches in (even if you're "choosing" it by applying points) and starts fiddling around with the building blocks of your selfhood. Suddenly there are these big open question about how related the different versions of yourself are to one another, and whether the different states could actually link up to one another without this outside intervention - the clear line is broken, or at least blurred.

(I think the closest real world analogue here might be people who suffer from brain damage leading to personality changes/amnesia/etc.)

I guess ultimately this is a question of how you want to measure identity/self, which is somewhat arbitrary. Personally I think you need to look at it in a dynamic sense more than a static one - who you are at a given point in time has to be considered in the context of how you got there.

And while it's really hard to differentiate between internal/external influences, or to have a definition that doesn't arise at least in part from "outside" yourself, the idea of having an unknown force that is operating under unknown guidelines and is separate from everything else in your reality suddenly rewrite everything about you is a little more outside influence than I'm entirely comfortable with.

But the fact that the Game seems to be trying to preserve Juniper's personality seems like it would be good news - if you trust the program, you can probably ignore a great deal of this. Although that's another issue entirely..

** So, if I'm reading the error message right, Joon will not feel any smarter or be able to reason better if he continues to pump MEN, but he will gain "pseudo-intelligence" that will allow him to use skills as if he were smarter. Like being able to program really well even if he couldn't reason through the logic or math being used, he'll be able to cast spells or use magic that normal people have to be able to reason about sort of "intuitively"

Nice way to sidestep the problem of your main character making himself smarter than the author.

*** If that's the case, I'm curious to see what happens if he pumps Soc to a similar level, since at least Ins seems to imply that it also hones your ability to think. It seems like capping how intelligent he can be in every way he can tune, provided you trust the game's claim to retain his essential personality, would be the biggest gain he can presently access.

That being said, I feel like he's basically ignoring how mages tend to work in RPGs... His current magic may be crap, but in genre those abilities tend to grow quadratically, with late gains making up for a puny start. Gem magic 6 may be useful only for a light show and blood magic 12 only useful for some epic jumps, but Gem magic 20 and blood magic 20 might make him into a Dragonball character. You just have to see how those skills level.

** Great chapter.

Just a quick thought. The three substats of MEN don't seem, by themselves, to increase intelligence. Cunning, knowledge and wisdom are all things that can be learned & improved through "natural" means, although your intelligence is probably a practical limiting factor, and so increasing these stats beyond a certain level probably does require increasing overall intelligence if the system didn't want to cheat in some way. My question is, does increasing MEN (or any of the superstats) have an additional synergistic effect over and above just increasing the three substats? There is a separate number for MEN, PHY and SOC; is this just a representation of the substats or does it have some meaning of its own? I'm extremely curious to see what happens if he increases CHA and POI (so his SOC stats become 3/4/3) - will SOC also increase (from 3 to 4)? If it does, that's some evidence that it's just a function of the substats, while if it doesn't, that suggests SOC might have some function of its own. It might be worth the potentially inefficient use of attribute points to test this out; it might be an additional reason to favour less specialisation.

Overall, very impressed with the story so far and looking forward to seeing where it goes.

** So I've been bingeing this fic for the last few days, and I have to say that I'm really enjoying it!

This chapter certainly took a dark turn, but that's probably to be expected when the story concerns someone inside a game. Especially when your own mind is directly mechanised! It actually seems to show a degree of caring on the part of the DM (to use Jun's name for whatever agency is running this show) that raising mental stats appears to insert thoughts into his stream of consciousness where possible, as opposed to directly altering his mental processes themselves. This seems /somewhat/ less intrusive on his personhood, as fuzzy a concept as that is to begin with. The fact that the agency creating the game took that kind of trouble is certainly interesting.

--------------

Typos:

The generalist approach would have left me with *an* 9

The puzzle took *for* form of blocks

blood magic was ‘hidden' MAD because it was mostly *+a+* melee-combat oriented

but +I couldn't+ I couldn't get the clonal kit

and (if) it was possible within Aerb

--------------

Other misc. that I might have misread:

#+begin_quote
  which meant that it was probably in the form of (MEN * (MEN - 1))
#+end_quote

When Joon had 12 as the mental exhaustion cap, didn't he have 5 MEN (per the last stat sheet)?

#+begin_quote
  then I would put points into PHY when capped on SPD (putting them into POW when capped on POW)
#+end_quote

Putting into POW when capped on POW? I didn't understand this part.

*** Fixed all the typos, thank you.

As for the other two:

I changed it to (WIS * (WIS - 1)), though really it's possible that it's either that /or/ ((MEN - 1) * (MEN - 2)), because they've so far gone up in tandem. I think there's not really a point in there being a digression on that there, except for the sake of completeness.

I changed the wording somewhat to clarify:

#+begin_quote
  then I would put points into PHY when the skill was capped on SPD (putting them into POW when it was capped on POW)
#+end_quote

If you can go to three times the primary attribute and five times the secondary, then you're always in one of three states:

1. Limited by the primary
2. Limited by the secondary
3. Limited by both

And those states help define what you should spend your points on to end up with an optimal build.
