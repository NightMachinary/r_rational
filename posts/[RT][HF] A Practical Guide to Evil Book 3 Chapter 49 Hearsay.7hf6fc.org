** Who also thinks Black is going to be like Voldemort now?

Cruel, cold and practical with a central flaw in his thinking. A flaw his enemies will capitalise on?

Malicia's words are evidence that The Black Knight is on his way out. If he had kept his composure, his cold practicality, his distance, he had a good chance of finally flipping the tables of the story. But the Bard and Fate knew exactly where to hit him to knock him off his game.

And the Knight is off his game. Mistakes will be made.

The era of the Calamities is at an end. The Woe that arises from the ashes will devour Creation whole.

****** Could be, its a inherently a Orc name though.

From what i understand, a name is born from a culture, and Cat is Calowan to the bone. It be weird of her to take up a Orcish name. There's also the issue of the mysterious parentage. Its been lampshaded a few times that if you are a hero with unknown parents, you might as well prepare yourself for the crown early. The sticker is of course that Cat ain't no hero. Plus she is "daughter of no one and nothing." a pretty fundamental part of her identity. Also, she's the only living noble of the kingdom of winter. That should probably mean something.

So i don't think she will be the Warlord, i don't think she will be the Black Knight (Nor the Gray knight, if anything, in that case it would just be Knight) but i don't really know what she will become instead.

Honestly, i was already pretty surprised by Hierophant

******* after the last few chapters away from Cat's pov, I am starting to wonder if it's possible she could end up as the White Knight. first thing is that Black didn't form a pattern of three - he assumes that this means he will die soon, because White is supposed to be rivals with a different Black Knight. It could also be that White is the one scheduled to be replaced, so that the new White Knight can be his rival. in addition Cat has been strangely, uncharacteristically heroic ever since she accidentally forced that winter fey to monologue. I would not be surprised at all if the heavens were in the process of attempting to force the mantle of hero on her again. next is the narrative power of a student having to face off against her fallen mentor, who is clearly a very important person to her.

also, if she does end up with a hero's name, it would be neat to see her powers get all mangled. radiant icy necromancy is one of the most trippy combinations for powers I've run into in a while.

though in all honesty, I fully expect her to end up as something totally new instead of any sort of Knight or Warlord or Queen. like what happened to Anaxares, and similarly just as much of a surprise to her as to us.

Also, does anyone else think Malicia's deterrent isn't Still Water but Diablolist's superweapon? Still Water will trigger a crusade and she seemed to disapprove of it. You need something scary enough that even a Crusade is out of the question. If Still Water could have been that deterrent Malicia would have started work on it herself.

**** Which obviously won't work. It a plan divorced from the realities of the narrative of the world.

A villain can't expect to point a doomsday device in any direction, and expect it to last. She even expects it to be used by Akua, and her to keep it after. Its like her cackling at the top of her lungs "No one can stop me now! Not even the lone hero!"

****** Possibly, the problem with that is that its not her weapon, its Akua. And Akua HATES Malicia's way of doing things. It won't be a subtle. Its going to be something grander than ever before.

Akua has already resigned herself to her loss to a hero down the line. She is much like Tyrant in that regard. They spit on the ways of Black and Malicia, they are traditional villains that will end themselves in a dangerous plot that will have them remembered and curses in the same vein as the triumphant

******* there was that whole chapter where her new Name was revealed where she talked about becoming better than her ancestors. there were some hints there that what she is planning is similar to the way Black does things - orthogonal to the normal way villains are supposed to act, and possibly also to the methods Black and Malicia favor. I would be most surprised if her weapon ends up just being something that is obviously a weapon.
