  Lastly, a bit of a contest. I've always been dissatisfied with the last line of Chapter 14 (Esplin). If people are interested in submitting their own suggestions for what Esplin might think to himself, in that moment, I'm certainly interested in stealing them. =)

Contest thread /go/

Here is the last chunk of text from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12964264][chapter 14]]. The line in question is in bold:

#+begin_quote
  /So. You have a new enemy./

  Opening the refrigerated compartment, I withdrew one of the small, disclike packages and removed the foil wrapping. Breaking it into quarters, I set each piece at a different corner of the large rectangle painted on the floor. Stepping on top of them, I felt an anticipatory thrill as my hooves began to pulverize and absorb the stringy substance.

  <Yes,> I said thoughtfully, relinquishing my hold on Alloran so that he could speak freely once again.

  <And yet you intend to continue exactly as before.>

  I closed my eyes, feeling the Yeerk-flesh slide up my legs and into my stomach. <Not exactly,> I said, and I lowered the barrier still further, allowing Alloran a glimpse into my own thoughts.

  /1417 Bayview Drive./

  /88E South Church Street./

  /209 Aspen Avenue./

  /3555 Franklin Court./

  /The playground at Magnuson park./

  <They will know that you are coming,> Alloran said, and I laughed at the flicker of hope in his thoughts---so pale, so weak, so easily extinguished.

  <For all the good it will do them,> I said. <If they run, we shall simply spread unchallenged. And if they stay--->

  My meal complete, I turned toward the sanitation unit, forcing the Andalite warrior prince to look upon his own body---upon my body.

  *<Well. At least it will be interesting.>*

*** <Well. We shall see how Elfangor's hand measures up against Alloran's tail.>

"/Esplin's/ tail" would be more in keeping with the previous sentence, but it doesn't have quite the same "student-vs-master" harmony as this version. I'd also like to call specific attention to the "We shall see" construction, because it's very gently evocative of the "we shall see what fate thinks of a human child's resolve" quote.

** Ahh, /finally/, I can stop pointing out to people that Cassie's death wasn't some cataclysmic blow to the Ellimist's plan, but was in fact part of it all along! Excellent!

For real though, Cassie being /shielded/ from the brutal forward march of the war is a really, really interesting angle. Hopefully her arrival is in time to pull Jake back from the pitch-dark brink he's standing on; preliminarily, things are looking hopeful on that front.

I wasn't prepared for how much that coldness from Jake was going to bite. Seeing it from Cassie's perspective, both because it was directed /at/ Cassie and because of the lens of her empathy, made it that much sharper. Then the breaking sense of relief from Helium's warmth was unexpected all over again.

CouteauBleu (not tagging you - I don't want to show up in your inbox with a picnic basket full of spoilers - but I know you're out there) neither one of us was /completely/ right about Marco's motivations for shooting Cassie, but I reserve the right to feel all full of myself 'cause I was a little closer. Uh... Is it cool if I say "nah-nah na-boo-boo?"

As for the Author's Note, funny that it mentions the end of Chapter 14. In that chapter, Esplin lists four street addresses plus "/The playground at Magnuson park/," which I had always taken to mean the Animorphs' home addresses and, like, the place where Tobias hangs out. But in this chapter, Chapter 46, Cassie lists her address as "/number 11, Apple Canyon Road/," which isn't among the addresses in Chapter 14. Another TKSU? Or am I wrong about what the addresses in 14 mean? Either way, I'll probably brainstorm a couple entries for the "contest" when I'm at my computer later.

That conversation in the barn with Marco that Cassie mentions - that's exactly the spot I keep getting distracted from as I annotate Chapter 4. Huh. (Might as well plug [[/r/Ranimorphs]] here - it's pretty empty right now, but it's where I've been posting annotated chapters as I make them, and it's open to all posts about the fic!)

Take your time on the back half, Author! Make a chapter you're proud of - in fact, let /all/ the remaining chapters be ones you're proud of. We've waited twelve years in Azkaban for this fic to wrap up; we can wait a few extra days for it to wrap up right. ;)

** I'm ready to make my guess as to the basic shape of the conclusion of the story. This is either wildly premature, or embarrassingly late to the party, depending, but why not, here goes.

The basic structure of what we have going on here is the Belgariad/Mallorean notion of choosing between good and evil, with the rat twist that the hard part of picking between good and evil is telling them apart. The Crayak/Elimist are ultimately betting on a single decision that the Animorphs will make in response to this absurd situation (Infinite babies are killing infinite babies and only the Devil can help you!).

Last time, I thought that would be about the Howler's likely having infected humanity with a lethal phage before their main attack. On further reflection, I don't think that's how it shakes out. The actual decision that the Gods care about is just the obvious one, give the cube to V3 or destroy it.

Their interventions are meant to prohibit V3 from simply stealing the cube, and also to eliminate humanity as an easy way to short circuit the decision. That is, to remove 'which is best for those like us' as a heuristic that dominates the choice they are supposed to be making.

In further updates, it will become blatantly obvious that humanity as they know it is already gone and not coming back. It has been purged by the Howlers or overwritten by V3, but either way the status quo antebellum is dead and gone.

It will also become obvious that V3's composure, the way it thinks it is playing with house money here, is wildly incorrect. It thinks it can make the virophage and annihilate the Howlers, or at the very least just put a few more minefields back to back. None of that will work without the cube. I dunno if its network has already been infected, or it is just wrong about the wider state of play, but V3 will be brought to the realization that its victory depends entirely on these kids and their choices.

V3 is recognizably a paperclipper/seeing-like-a-state/authoritarian analog. Choosing it is to choose Adult Supervision. It is, aside from a few fishtanks it is forced to maintain, to give all negentropy into the hands of a being which considers using those suns to light worlds to be wasteful. One universe, under Crayak, with liberty and justice for one, Aeat.

The Howlers are the other option, nature/market red in tooth and claw. They are a parody of the distributed nightmare of no control being remotely possible. They are anonymous shouting screeds, punching wildly in all directions while proclaiming that to fight back is to 'punch down'. Elimist as Bill Cipher, and the universe a howling void of anarchy and murder for all time. SSC's joke that the last post on the far future internet would be someone calling someone else a pedo made grimly literal.

At a further guess, since I'm so far out on this limb I can barely see the starting point, the Animorphs will ultimately choose V3. Their bargain with it will stand in for getting the Friendly AI's Utility Function correct, and the finale will be roughly the same as it was for the honest option in Three Worlds Collide. "They all lived happily ever after."

** She's back! For some reason I assumed that Cassie was intervening because she felt that trying to deal with Visser Three was inherently wrong. But her trying to save the Howlers makes more sense. Now I'm imagining a wholesome version of the Howlers who get their novelty by traveling the galaxy and playing different sports

I'm interested to see where this goes because I probably would take the deal with Visser. I simply don't see a way out, or a way to change the Howlers before humanity goes extinct

Edit: I loved this line too.

I love religious imagery and themes in works, and while they don't fit with this piece this line was perfect. Making a deal with this V3 really is like dealing with the devil, with consequences just as predictable. Even when they said they were going to take the deal they didn't think he would be true to his word, and that he would trick them somehow

Also interesting to see the implied back and forth with the gods and Cassie. One manipulated her into essentially committing suicide, the other intervened by preserving her in Z space and bringing her back, then the other potentially intervened by having Marco (who was in morph?) shoot her, only for Rachel who “wasn't supposed to be there” to stop him

  “It means that it's wrong to kill them,” I said softly. Softly, but not with any doubt. I wasn't sure why I was there, yet, but I was sure that I was there, and there was only one answer I could give to that question. “Not if there's any other way---any other way at all.”

Yes Cassie, but also no, it is wrong to kill them in an important sense but in another important sense they are doing a lot of killing and worse themselves and it is /less bad/ to kill them than not to.

--------------

The different approaches to godly manipulation are interesting.

- Helium's seems to be: you have no real control here, so "ride the wave". I guess that means roughly, try to survive, retain what resources you can, act sensibly in the short-term, but don't stay attached to your long-term plans. Taken to an extreme this might suggest never making long-term plans at all, but I don't feel like Helium would take it that far or suggest taking it that far.
- As Helium points out, Jake seems to be trying to fight for control, to keep moving forward with his plans.
- Cassie... seems to assume the Ellimist's plan is one she wants to go along with? I guess she's seen a lot less that would give her reason to think otherwise. Having assumed that, she works out what she's supposed to do based on what kind of person she is. Like, "what would I do here? I'd do X. Okay, let's do X". Which is...

In Greg Egan's /Diaspora/, there's an exchange where one character wants to convince another to do something. The other decides that the first is likely to convince ver, and goes along with the idea on that basis. Which sounds kind of weird, but also I've totally done that. ("I don't really feel like doing that." "What would it take to convince you?" "Good question. Hm. Not much, I guess. Okay, sure, let's do it.") Cassie's thought process here reminded me of that.

I feel like, if you're playing against someone who can predict your every move, the thing to do is /change what kind of pawn you are/. Your opponent isn't necessarily omnipotent - the Ellimist couldn't beat me at tic-tac-toe, and there's some number of stones handicap where he couldn't beat me at Go. (He could directly intervene to force a bad move from me, but that's fighting the metaphor and also not really beating /me/.) So you act in such a way that: given that your actions are completely predictable, in this situation and all hypotheticals; and given that your opponent is going to maximize their score; then your opponents best score is as good for you as possible.

(Oh, I guess this is basically (according to my limited understanding) functional decision theory?)

When you have no idea what the rules are or what most of the gameboard even looks like, Helium's approach feels like it's probably not optimal but a decent heuristic?

If I had to guess where the narrative is going, Cassie was brought back to keep them from exterminating the Howlers, because that will be the win condition (or will make the win condition inevitable). If they can stop the Howlers without killing them, the Ellimist wins. If the Howlers exterminate humanity, then Crayak wins. The quantum virus, on the other hand, doesn't further either of their goals.

The alternative is that Cassie's presence contributes to the Ellimist's victory, and the boy from the pool contributes to Crayak's (or vice versa).

I'm not so sure. We saw one player spending game resources to carefully maneuver Cassie into stasis before the war could change her. We saw with the field trip to the Hork-Bajir world that when They both want something, they can use basically unlimited game resources. Meanwhile the player they meet at the pool was carefully conserving [# of atoms x distance teleported] budget.

********* They don't exactly say that (what has been "ratified" are the initial conditions of the game). But by Occam's razor, you're probably right - otherwise, there'd be three categories of moves - unilaterally done, done by one and ratified by the other, and done jointly.

(It's also possible one of the E/C duo could've prevented the other from killing Cassie by making their own move in the game, and that might be what the Avatar means by the other "permitting" it. (Edit: But that doesn't sound really likely, even though who knows.))

** These chapters are getting increasingly weird.

Also, it feels like we're fast approaching the "Avengers Endgame" part of the story, where the only way it can possibly move forward is coming back in time and cancelling all the "extinction of everything the protagonists and audience care about" stuff.

I mean, on the one hand this fic has been pretty strong about sticking to consequences of events and stuff, but on the other hand we /do/ know time travel is on the table, sooooo...

*** Canon sprinkled the Ellimist weirdness throughout, and also acted as if it shouldn't be mind-shatteringly disorienting. I just kinda ... /smooshed/ it, all toward the end.

**** Oh yeah. Everworld kinda had that too, where every now and then the characters go "Wait, isn't it /weird/ that we're in a world where every human myth is true and also magic was real all along and science was a lie?", but they never /act/ on it (except that one time they accidentally an industrial revolution).

*** I honestly expected it to be like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14574775][Chapter P]] in Cordyceps (which also features PoV characters' names as chapter titles) back when this chapter was first announced.
