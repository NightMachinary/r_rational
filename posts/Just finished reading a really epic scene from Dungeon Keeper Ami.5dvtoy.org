I just finished reading "Divine Opposition Part 2". OMG it was so epic. I loved the part where [[#s][Spoiler]]

For those who haven't read Dungeon Keeper Ami, it's a crossover between Sailor Moon and Dungeon Keeper. Dungeon Keeper is a game where you play as an evil overlord boss character called a 'Keeper', build your dungeon and defend it from heroes and from other Keepers. In Dungeon Keeper Ami, Sailor Mercury gets transported to the world of Dungeon Keeper and accidentally becomes a Keeper. She then has to fight against other Keepers, protect her dungeons from the local good guys, try to find a way to get her soul back from the Dark Gods and get back home while causing as little collateral damage as possible. All of this without letting the forces of evil find out she's not on their side and futilely attempting to convince the forces of good that she is on /their/ side.

It features a genuinely intelligent Sailor Mercury (Mizuno Ami), who, aside from getting her intelligence upgraded from informed to genuine, is still entirely consistent with her characterization in the original Sailor Moon anime.

** Yeah, that was definitely one of my favorite parts, of an altogether too excellent series. the beginning is a bit rough, but it has genuinely intelligent characters, great worldbuilding, and (mostly) intelligent opponents like Mukrezar. There is also a rewrite/sanctioned fanfiction going on- it's IMO better written than the beginning of DKA, so I have high hopes, but it isn't at the level of recent chapters yet.

*** OMG there's more lol! Now that I think of it, why doesn't Keeper Mercury ever recover any memories of the silver millenium in the original Dungeon Keeper Ami? Is it because recovering her memories is only triggered by the moon princess being revealed or something?

**** Sorry about that. Now that I think about it, /of course/ it would be after your current chapter, since, you know.

As a consolation, now you probably won't be as pissed off at protag's OoC idiocy as I was after that scene.

*** were you reading it on Sufficient Velocity or addventure(Sp?)

Apparently the story was originally hosted on some sort of CYOA site where people could add their own branches. There's only the one branch done by the original author that was then ported to SV tho.

Unless you mean the bit in the early chapters where the POV swaps from Reaper to Ami a lot without much warning... in which case that settles out over time and gets much smoother.

***** Actually... I *think* you want the story only thread on SV? that way you only get the original author's linear story (albeit linear while following multiple POVs, which, again, smooths out after a few chapters.)
