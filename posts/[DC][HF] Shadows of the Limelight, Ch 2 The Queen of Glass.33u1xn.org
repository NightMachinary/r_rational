** This story continues to be amazing. Vidre is a fantastic / fantastically intimidating character, and that conversation about redemption arcs etc was fascinating. Very [[/r/rational]], as can be expected. I look forward to seeing more of Clarissa Fiscella, and more of this fic in general!

** Oh neat, rational storytelling for more power, with cost benefit calculations and planing. That's greatastic.

Just noticed use of Italian words for some terms, I assume for sake of exotic writing, but why really?

Also pretty ship is pretty, if a bit cramped for space, no magic for that?

*** There doesn't seem to be much "structural" magic. Everything we've seen so far has been more along the lines of command of a concept in the moment, rather than long-term alteration of that concept. Add the fact that you have to be famous to use magic, and the possibility of "backstage" magic is reduced to feats of illustrati with the time, inclination, domain, and reputation - magic Da Vinci, if you will. I'm not even sure what kind of domain would let you do structural magic - maybe simply a labour-saver such as metal or wood to make prototyping trivial.

*** I assume all fictional cities are Venice if I have any kind of reason to at all. So it's only natural that they speak Italian.

  “Corta?” asked Vidre. They'd spent the last nine days in Gennaro, and while Corta had memorized a flurry of names, that hadn't been one of the ones that stuck. “Who is that?”
#+end_quote

Should the second Corta not be Vidre?

There's a missing quote after agreed.

** This is a /great/ setting for a fantasy/superhero hybrid RPG, and "fame" could be an explicit in-world substitute for the out-world concept of XP. Looking forward to more!

*** Under consideration when he did what he did. She's implying that he attacked Zerstor to make his own legend.

I'm not sure what Vidre's deal is, but she clearly cares a /lot/ about safeguarding the legend aspect of the illustrati so that their powers are maintained or grow. Her couple of "supposed to" lines give me the impression that she's annoyed with Dominic for not playing into the narrative of "rube outsider who gets inducted into a New Magical World so she can give expository speeches," and given her conversations with the bards I suspect it's more because she's frustrated he doesn't get the importance of playing into narrative conventions for the illustrati than because she likes to give expository speeches.

*** u/Chronophilia:
#+begin_quote
  I am not sure I understand this sentence. Under consideration by who? Since becoming super powered is fame based why is there a group or person considering who to elevate?
#+end_quote

Under consideration by Dominic. And while powers are based on fame, Welexi and Vidre's group employ bards and writers to spread word of their exploits. "Elevation" means they're going to tell people about Dominic too, so he'll become an illustrati (and presumably bolster Welexi's story at the same time).

** Illustrati get their power on fame yeah? Could Dominic or some other shadow/light user make a small shadow puppet theater in his hand with a candle, cloth for shadows and magnifying lens point the whole thing to a wall, thus creating a bigger version of his trick and possibly making money by creating stories and or entertainment?

I expect to see a lot of non combat applications for magic play and lot of famous persons who use their powers for economic gain. Or something like Corta does with her voice.
