** There's a lot in here that strains my suspension of disbelief. NOBODY had thought to find out if memories would overwrite themselves? They had the technology for interstellar travel and life extension but not for packing more than 63 years of entertainment? Why didn't they have new entertainment constantly sent from home in updates?

*** I started to write my own post but realized I was mostly reiterating what you said.

Add to your points:

- They ran out of non-violent creativity in a measly ~40 years?" I'm pretty sure I have more than 40 years worth of stories to write even if I never read or learned another thing, and...
- ...they couldn't fill time learning? There's an infinite amount of math to be learned / invented. Dance, language, sports, martial arts, juggling, acting, music composition, painting, pottery, rock climbing, astronomy... Seriously, if you're bored in the modern era then it's your own darn fault.

*** On the one hand, I think someone would have decided "I would rather take a long nap than be bored for decades" /before/ reaching the "all is meaningless except nuances of pain and violence" stage.

On the other hand, these are Grays we're talking about, so who knows.

***** Sure, but

#+begin_quote
  Would've been nice if they'd been able to figure out how to do that at the beginning of the mission.
#+end_quote

is a pretty small lampshade to cover 158 years.

****** It's not exactly clear that one's latest memories should disappear (and in such a fashion) as opposed to the more logical erasure of the past. (Which means, instead of a crew that repeats a day/week/however long, over and over again, one could have a crew that doesn't know remember where they came from, but can make progress; an analog of a generation ship. (Except the youngest remember the furthest back.))

*** The best defenses I can think of:

TBestIG: No way to predict the memory issue so far ahead of time since it's a novel biology issue combined with new technology. We'd assume we would just forget old stuff too instead of not forming new memories. Maybe their planet solved the issue after they were already on their way and cut off.

They packed all the entertainment but consumed it at exponential speed. If you spent years straight consuming media I bet you would get faster at consuming it over time, and this compounded with them. Practice makes perfect, and they had decades to naturally develop insane speed reading. This wasn't predicted since no one could/would've had so much time to devote to purely media consumption.

Why no media from home? No idea lol.

Eaglejarl: 40 years at your current pace with your current motivation? You'd be trying to spend 24/7 writing once you got bored enough, which would increase your writing speed and decrease your motivation drastically over time.

Learning things they didn't enjoy? Maybe their interests didn't change over the years, they mastered what they enjoyed or just stopped having interest in any normal media over time. Imagine getting burnt out of everything you are even remotely interested in since there is literally nothing else to do.

-- Overall I agree though, the entertainment they brought was incredibly small given the journey and the story just expected us to accept that as reasonable. I'm pretty sure all the video uploaded to YouTube over a year would drown them with video hours for the entire journey, not to mention getting digital copies of all the books available and other media forms.

I prefer my explanation that they got bored of everything instead of having watched/read it all so quickly. Adding more emphasis to the rush to get them on the way to the planet could be another one, that the memory and media issue is a result of desperate rushing to colonize if their home is going to explode or something.

*** When I spent more than 8 month in an English speaking country without really using Danish(my mother tonuge) I start having serious blobbers and forget Danish words I knew rather well until someone reminds me. From my experience 7 years and forgotting a LOT of commonly used words seems completely plausible
