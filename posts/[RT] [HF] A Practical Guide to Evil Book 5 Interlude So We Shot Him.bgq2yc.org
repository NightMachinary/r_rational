** Reminder that Prince Arnaud acts as a loud mouthed buffoon but when the Pilgrim put on his choir glasses and looked at Prince Arnaud he saw naught but cold emptiness and when Catherine was using her Winter senses she noted the man as a perfect actor who's heartbeat remained steady while he was outwardly raving and ranting. (I would find citations but afaik there is no easy way to search the entire work of PGtE).

There's clearly more to the man than you would guess (it's been suggested that he is the Assassin though i'm not sure you could justify him remaining in the role of Prince Arnaud for so long) and this seems like a moment when such a reveal may occur.

Because it sure would be scary if the Dead King made a new kind of Undead that for all intents and purposes looked alive. Necromantically programmed to appear to breathe, its heart beat at a steady rate, etc. Because it would functionally look no different than this.

Unless you tried to use healing or anti-Undead magic on it, or it received a grievous wound and just kept going, you wouldn't really know until it was too late...

**** Invading a villains personal slice of a universe where he's ensconced in a presumably functioning superweapon without a heroic band of 5? That seems smart, especially when you've got three possibly 4 villains trying to stop you and no narrative weight to back you up. Pilgrim is smarter about these things, we already saw him talking about how the Dead King will require a band of 5 where he or saint dies to be put down back at the battle of the camps. He's not going to take a risk on Hierophant when a solution with narrative weight is presented to him. Plus that star took a hell of a lot out of Pilgrim.

** We've got three heroes facing off against the Tyrant, and that's two short of the customary five. You'd expect Pilgrim to be more prepared than that.

It's a shame that Cat is going to turn this whole encounter sideways, but I'd be interested in how a villain of the old type like Tyrant would deal with heroes on the level of Pilgrim and Saint (how strong is the Rogue Sorcerer?). Cat has been concocting literal plot armor in order to deal with these two, but that's not a route that's available to Tyrant.

Anyway, all the crowns have been gathered, seven Proceran Princes and the Queen of Callow, so the stage is set for the Prince's Graveyard. The question now is whether or not that "graveyard" part is meant literally, and which of the powers (Cat most likely) will collect them and for what purpose. Actually, all seven Proceran are currently being hanged (by their feet), so in a sense most of the work is already done.

*** Depends how you want to count it I think. Could be 3 heroes (Pilgrim, Saint and Sorcerer) against 3 villains (Tyrant, Cat and Hakram). Or could be 5 heroes (the heroes, Cat and Hakram) against the Tyrant. Or could be the expected 1 vs 2 vs 3.

I reckon who is against who will be a malleable thing that Cat uses to her advantage. And I look forwards to seeing that play out.

So the brimstone problem seems to be localized to an area randomly aligned with Creation. Is that logical? Who knows. But it is what's happened.
