Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** *Mistborn Munchkinry Mini-Series Part 2: Steel*

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

Ok, week two of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries. For part one and a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][here]]. If you weren't here last week and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting I'd recommend reading the intro to that comment first.

Up this week is steel. Just like last week, I'm interested in what a steel twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantic steel is a direct counterpart to allomantic iron, it allows an allomancer to push on pieces of metal. As soon as you start burning steel you will see thin, translucent, blue lines spring up between your chest and every source of metal in the surrounding area. You can then mentally push on one of these lines to push the piece of metal further away from you. Pushing always happens directly away from your center of mass.

Like ironpulling, steelpushing conserves momentum so pushing on something that is much lighter than you will fling it away form you while pushing on something much heavier than you results in you being flung away from it. A typical use for this is to drop a coin on the ground and push on it to launch yourself in the air. Doing this, allomancer can jump onto buildings and over city walls with ease. You cannot push on metal that is at least partially inside a person and you cannot push on aluminium or anything covered in aluminium.

The smallest thing we've seen people push on is a grain of powdered metal and the strongest steelpush we've seen was able to tear a building appart.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemic steel allows you to store physical speed. While charging a steel metalmind (jargon note: a metalmind is piece of metal with a feruchemic charge) the feruchemists feels sluggish and "like they are moving through molasses". Then when tapping that metalmind they can move many times faster than normal. Steel is noted to be one of the hardest attributes to store, with normal feruchemists only able to store a few percent of their speed at a time (though this is less relevant to us, given that we can compound).

As with almost all instance of super speed across fiction, feruchemic steel is not terribly well defined. It allows a feruchemists speed to be [[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/361/#e11357][higher than it should be when considering their kinetic energy or the force they impart upon impact]], so my guess is you can't use it to punch things harder. The power protects you from the g-forces generated by your own motion, but not from wind resistance/friction (which incidently also puts a soft cap on how fast you can move). We know you can move down a flight of stairs at super speed so somehow gravity is pulling at you normally from your perspective.

Like with all feruchemy you only affect your own body, not your clothes and not anything you are carrying (your clothes obviously move with you when you move at super speed, but your phone won't, for example, gain extra processing speed from it). Your perception and reaction speed are accelerated as well when you are tapping speed, though not to the same extend as the rest of your body.

The author never commented on exactly how fast a steel feruchemist can become, but it's somewhere between several times and many times faster, not hundreds of times faster.

*In universe uses*

A few ways in which these powers are used by the characters in the story (mild spoilers, obviously):

- Have the safety of a gun be inside the handle, so only you or someone with the same powers as you can fire the gun.
- Attach small metal rings to the ends of (stone) arrow heads and push them towards an enemy allomancer. When they try to push them away, they only push on the rings and the arrowheads keep going.
- Put railway spikes into the road at regular intervals so you push on them to move around more quickly.

*** A niche use for steelpushing might be detecting flaws in large amounts of metal. Depending on where the blue line from your chest leads to, it might show them up much more quickly than modern techniques, thus allowing more granular searches to be done less often. I presume that the line goes to the centre of mass of the metal, so if you can feel that the line is a few centimetres to the left (or alternatively, standing far enough away from the metal to see it go off at an angle) of where it should be, then you know that metal needs checking.

Actually, detecting steel could be useful in other area. For airport or border security, any device which contains any amount of steel can be detected by the same method, so if done in conjunction with other allomancers with different metals, the process could be sped up a lot (although on earth this isn't feasible due to being the only one, and I imagine Scadriel doesn't have quite that level of luxury).

If the Feruchemy power protects from /all/ g-forces caused by your own motion, then you can become a very effective astronaut or jet fighter in niche scenarios, as if I recall correctly, that is one of the main barriers to faster manned flights.

I love this series that you've made, and I'm definitely looking forward to the other metals!

**** Lurchers and Coinshots (Ironpullers can "lurch" around by pulling on metal for decent mobility, steelpushers use coins as bullets like, constantly, in the books) can both see and affect every metal except aluminum, so only a single allomancer would be needed as a metal detector. That said, many small pieces of metal all over you would make such detection methods impractical, as they'd just see a cloud of lines. That sounds like it should be suspicious on its own, but when you consider belt buckles, shoe grommits, buttons, tags, gold thread in fancy clothes, or even just steel shavings from a metal lathe, you could concievably hide this way.

***** I suppose that depends on whether they can detect individual homogeneous pieces of metal, or if close by, loose bits will meld together. In the former case, it may be possible to detect which bits of metal are not so healthy for everyone involved by detecting location (so that you don't pull on any pace makers) and then lightly tugging the remaining bits to determine mass. Of course, the question is then if this is any more convenient than normal metal detectors, but I imagine that it would be a mite more accurate assuming the allomancer is doing his or her job.

They don't meld together (you can distract an coinshot by throwing large amounts of metal dust in his direction) so that should work just fine.

You don't actually need to worry about pacemakers either, because anything inside a human body can't be pulled on.

The only problem for the airport security scenario is that aluminium is immune, so you'd still have to have everyone go through a normal metal detector as well. Still, might be helpful as a secondary, hidden, security check.

*** Canonically, steelpushers are referred to as Coinshots by just about everyone, because every steelpusher can turn an arbitrary number of coins into bullets very easily. They generally don't have aim or distance sufficient to become snipers, though, the effective range is about that of a musket. Notably, coinshots in 2nd era Scadrial will still carry guns, both for longer-distance accuracy and because they can make their bullets even faster by pushing on them.

Compounding steel basically gives you unlimited speed. Beyond fast travel benefits, a 10x cognitive acceleration factor would make for an excellent battlefield commander. Having so much more time to think than the opposition would make you absurdly difficult to beat. Furthermore, bullet-time isn't quite doable, but you might be able to see and dodge a bullet coming at you at a relative speed of 80mph.

Assuming steelpushing is also accelerated by speed, you can effectively output 10x more force through that power. In combination with enhanced perceptions, you may actually be able to stop a bullet in its tracks using this method.

I can't really think of a world-breaking use for this combination. "Tearing apart buildings" actually requires another power from the magic system to increase your physical toughness, otherwise you will just crush yourself with your own steelpushes. You get to be a fast, highly-mobile ersatz modern infantryman in 2nd era Scadrial, and in the real world being fast is pretty great, but it doesn't let you shape the future. You can't even do prospecting for most metals, as the coinshot power only lets you see actual metals, rather than minerals which contain them, and though the maximum range is poorly defined, it isn't so enormous that you could find deep gold veins from the surface. Modern techniques are just better.

I guess you could be really good at panning for gold, and you might even be able to extract flecks straight from seawater. Money shouldn't be a problem, but it might just be more profitable to be a superpowered mercenary or assassin.

This one probably doesn't work out. There's another metal - zinc - that explicitly stores mental speed. It's shown in the books that steel improves reflexes and lets you react more quickly. But [[https://old.reddit.com/r/brandonsanderson/comments/9r44v1/brandon_will_be_continuing_his_weekly_ama_here/e8eg8aa/][here]], Brando Sando says this is just a protective side effect akin to the strength boost from iron increasing density.

Unfortunately, the viewpoint characters have used barely any feruchemical steel or zinc, so it's not quite clear which mental functions are mapped to zinc and which are mapped to steel.

*** The best munchkinry comes from exploiting corner-cases, and steel feruchemy is so fuzzily defined that it's hard to find the corners.

What do the forces look like on carried objects? We know that running around at super speed doesn't crack the flooring beneath you, but a brick you're carrying still has to accelerate to keep up with you. If you let it go, does it fly off like a cannonball? Or does it slow down?

--------------

But as for the allomancy stuff, now that we've covered both iron and steel, I'd like to bring up a neat trick that is underused in the series.

If you have access to both iron and steel allomancy (let's say your iron misting grandpa donated part of his soul to you in the form of a hemalurgic spike)then you can push on one part of an object while pulling on another part and create a net force in any direction.

The only time we see this in the books is When Kelsier deflects arrows by making things spin in midair during his final battle.

*** I'd be tempted to cheat at roulette since it's a game about the moment of a steel ball.

And I'd like to see what happened if I built a turbine. You'd create "fins" that had steel on one side and aluminum on another. The allomancer could push and end up applying an assymetric force.

** I have a problem that's a little unusual for this thread.

It's not about munchkinning a power or situation, but I feel like this draws on similar skills. But if the mods think it doesn't fit, then I'll take down this comment.

The problem is simply put, come up with a real life example of unknown unknowns.

Here's two examples I've been able to come up with:

- There exists an argument for you, as the Gatekeeper, to let the AI out of the box within two hours of talking to the AI.
- There must exist a hobby that you enjoy more than your current most favorite life-long hobby to the point that you would give up your current hobby. For me it is reading, and I can't imagine anything better. But I used to really enjoy playing with legoes when very young. However, when I discovered books, I gave up legoes to the point where if I could, I would have sold them all for a measly book. I dimly suspect there exists something that could do the same thing for reading as reading did for legoes. Virtual reality or something like that?

*** The example I remember reading was about poisonous berries.

If you are in the woods looking for food, and know that some berries are poisonous, but don't know which ones, that's a known unknown. You can avoid berries, or maybe eat only one berry and see if it makes you feel ill before eating more the next day, etc.

But if you don't even know that plants /can/ be poisonous, then the poisonous berries are an unknown unknown. There's nothing you can do to avoid the risk.

Also relevant are non-constructive proofs like the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson%E2%80%93Seymour_theorem][Robertson-Seymour theorem]], using which there is an efficient algorithm that decides whether a graph can be drawn without crossing edges on, say, a torus, but we don't know the algorithm.

*** All memetic hazards would fall into this category. A hard hazard would be some sort of sequence of images or souns that hacks your brain and causes some sort of change such as unconsciousness or memory loss/edits. Nobody knows if such a thing exists in principle, and so we don't know what to look for.

A soft hazard would be any sort of thought or idea that causes preoccupation and stress and possible insanity just by knowing about it, Lovecraftian horrors are one example. Maybe there's some fundemental truth of the universe like we're all trapped in a simulation for a 3rd graders science report and everything we do is pointless, or maybe there are 3^^^3 sentient beings being tortured constantly somewhere and nobody can save them, or something other fact we've never thought of, the knowledge of which would only cause grief and despair and accomplish no positive purpose.

Or maybe there are no such things, and knowledge is always good. We don't know.

*** Well...

- You can create absolute zero temperatures in laboratory conditions, which scientists will be head over heels for.

- You can have custom built locks for you that don't need a key, only requiring a certain, very cold temperature threshold.

- No limit on organics was mentioned, so you can have a pretty deadly hostage situation where killing them at the speed of thought is viable.

- You can specifically cool air in the shape of a bar your opponents run into to trip them. You can do the same with a number of shapes to create temporary structures for any use.

- This, in turn, lets you fly, as you can freeze air you stand on dumping the excess heat in a chosen pocket or spread out, depending on what's more convenient. Then, freeze more steps, and so on.

- Disable any vehicle, electrical device, or analogue machine pretty much instantly.

- Make fiery explosions by compressing as much heat in an area as you can into one spot.

- Detect biological presences by the shifting heat map you presumably have in your head.

- Avoid a number of chemical and energy based projectiles or weaponry by doing the same.

- Give sudden bursts of movement to yourself or anyone else by carrying around a massive bag which you can lightly yet rapidly heat to make it expand, thus pushing you.

***** I was thinking that if you were to remove all the heat from an area, even a gaseous one, that it would flash freeze. Normally this would be untenable, but the whole speed of thought thing made me think it might be possible to do it quickly enough. After all, air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen -210 and -219 degrees centigrade respectively, which is a decent amount over absolute zero. Though my reasoning may be flawed in someway.

The cooling aspect seems to be the more reliable and useful aspect of the power, if only because it can be done no matter the environment, and instantly.

****** Ooh initially I thought the idea was pretty good but on second thought... I need to do some calculations but I think you can't reasonably flash-freeze the air. You'll get a really low-density state that will rapidly equilibrate with nearby air, so I guess you would then want to continue cooling the area, which is constantly drawing in more air from nearby because it's a vacuum, while you form actual solid/liquid; due to the extremely fast cooling you'll presumably get an amorphous solid (if it's solid at all) with presumably lousy mechanical properties (instability, probably riddled with holes or something, ......)
