  “If they could,” said the man, “they'd wipe our memories all over again. Rip away our freedom and control us from the shadows again while they try to forge the stars in their vain image. At best, they see us as witless dolts. At worst, they see us as beasts, fit only for the kennel.”

  While the man spewed his propaganda, I watched behind him.
#+end_quote

Ana, he's not just spewing propaganda. Isaac Brin literally said this to you the very first time you met him:

#+begin_quote
  “We should have wiped their memories, every last one of them. Like we did in the old days. No matter how many tens of thousands there were.”
#+end_quote

You can argue with Commonplace's methods all you like, and you can take issue with the company they keep, but you should know better than most projectors that their grievances are legitimate.

#+begin_quote
  He knocked on the door, and it swung open, revealing a rain-soaked Weston Ebbridge on the other side.

  “Hey Ana,” he said. “Let's talk about Tasia.”
#+end_quote

Oh fuck, please don't tell me that Wes is going to play the victim here. He's right to be mad at Tasia (although his real grievances should be with the institutions that allow practices like ousting to exist and with his family for going through with it) but if he yells at Ana for being her friend... I swear, Weston Ebbridge makes me wish I could slap a fictional character.

He's telling part of the truth to influence people to do evil things (kill innocents). That counts as propaganda.

I would write how it relates to our current situation, but I won't because politics is the mind killer and the discussion can't continue after that.

*** That's honestly my favorite part of the serial right now. I like how we're repeatedly shown the jarring disconnect between Ana's life and her views on society. For example, Ana's need for a new body is an all consuming drive right now, and the speaker at the Commonplace rally in this chapter says /this/:

#+begin_quote
  “The median projector in the Principality has a net worth of two hundred and fourteen times that of the median Humdrum. They own an average of four bodies apiece, while we get cancer at their factories and go into debt for our replacement bodies. If we're lucky enough to get a loan.”
#+end_quote

And what's Ana's response?

#+begin_quote
  /The rhetoric of victimhood and vengeance./ They listed legitimate problems, then used them to justify an incoherent wave of violence and resentment.

  We'd barely won the largest war in human history. We'd defeated the Shenti by the narrowest margin, and these people wanted to eviscerate the heroes who'd protected us. That wasn't the right way to do things.
#+end_quote

Like, holy fuck, that disconnect. "My poverty is literally killing me. What?! How dare you point out the severe inequality in our society! Every single one of our wealthy overlords is a war hero who deserves three spare bodies!" It's especially jarring considering how much she suffered at Clementine's hands.

Thankfully, she seems to be making some progress, if rather slowly. Her thoughts towards the end of the chapter about Clementine and the boy she killed are a small step in the right direction, for example.

**** She seems deep in her temporarily embarrassed +millionaire+ Guardian complex. She identifies more with the elite than with the people in similar circumstances to her, and is holding on to that in spite of all the evidence that everything she knew about Paragon is basically lies.

It's complicated a bit by the fact that she /is/ a projector, but I kinda doubt that, even if she continues along this path (and doesn't die in the process), the story is ever going to vindicate her idea of a special destiny. At least not in the way she wants. It does a good job of emphasizing how messed up her thinking is without ever spelling it out too deliberately.

#+end_quote

She also uses her legitimate problem (dying for a new body) to justify a bunch of rally horrible actions. She's not as evil as the terrorists, but she's willing to ruin other people's lives and support Lorde, a truly reprehensible person and probably the only person we've met who takes pleasure in others suffering.

Tasia straight up told her that she need to sit down and figure this out because she's not the person she thought she was, and if she doesn't draw a line somewhere she's probably going to end up killing someone on Lorde's orders.

** I really love this. Definitely had to check twice to make sure it wasn't by wildbow (on one of his better days). The dysphoria is believable without overwhelming the rest of the horror.

I did have a number of questions, which I guess might be answered later. The heart of my confusion is: How prevalent are vocations (that is, ability to use magic powers)? Like, back when the Guardians were secret, would Clementine have necessarily been accepted into Hogwarts, just to keep the secret? Or killed?

Is it genetic? If so, shouldn't it have evolved to fixation already? If not, how do we have Guardian families without having "squibs" (who, given how cutthroat Guardian society is, would have no reason to keep the secret)?

I'm also confused about how a secret was kept across nations given the usefulness of vocations in war.

But I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and mostly just enjoy the story.

** Anyone want to comment on the progress of the story so far? Wildbow is so inconsistent that I'd like the story to be quite substantial before going for it. I was disappointed by Pact for the usual reasons.
