** I wouldn't really describe Worm as a rationalist fic. It doesn't really espouse rationalist ideals.

Although rationalism is not a huge part of the storyl, no one really holds the idiot ball. There are still characters that act like idiots, but its portrayed believably and doesn't seem unrealistic.

Even if it is not necessary rationalist, its still an amazing story. I would encourage everyone to read it, it is so good.

To put it another way: idiocy isn't in conflict with rationality when it's justified by /characterization/, rather than by /plot./ The entertaining kind of idiocy is usually what English majors call a "tragic flaw": some aspect of the character's personality (their utility function, really) that you can tell in advance will have that character make the "wrong" decision at a crucial time.

**** The main distinction seems to be that every other superhero story seems to center around objectively amoral antagonists with a utility function of "be evil."

***** Right. I think an important thing for "idiocy justified by characterization" is that the "broken" utility-function a character ostensibly has, has to be one that readers can still /identify/ with; one they could imagine themselves having, or a friend having, without having long-ago been called out on their bullshit, or just having failed to thrive as a human being.

It's *easy* to imagine someone with a roughly human /set/ of values, but different weights on those values. A much heavier weight on, say, "enjoy rich food", might be a character's undoing, when they end up dying of a heart attack at a pivotal moment.

It's *hard*, meanwhile, to imagine a paperclip-optimizer.

/Smart/ paperclippers (ones who out-think every heroic act on their mission to produce paperclips) might be entertaining (and horrifying! I'd go so far as to say that the entire genre of horror exists to explore the interactions between humans and smart other-optimizers, with "murderous sociopath" being the default instantiation of the latter), but /stupid/ paperclippers are just grating. And comic-book villains are definitely stupid paperclippers.

*** Worm may not focus on rationality, but it does have an awful lot of decision making under while incredible stress with a flair for improvisation and decisive strikes to solve impossible situations.

I disagree with you, my earlier devil advocating against worm aside, on how we you are defining rationalist fiction.

The big 5 [[/u/seraphnb]] has listed are filled by Worm. You are disqualifying Worm because the [[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/evangelical][evangelical]] </definition 2/> author rants on rational principles aren't there; i.e. :

#+begin_quote
  The story teaches sound lessons about rationalist techniques, which can be applied to readers' lives.
#+end_quote

Those are useful for spreading rationalism, but do we need the author to hit us over the head with how we are supposed to think to enjoy a rational story, or to call it rational fiction? Discuss/comment?

*** Some stuff, like the believable characters, is just good writing. But things with a 96% chance of happening /actually happen/; there's no convenient coincidences; and characters make intelligent, yet epistemically realistic decisions. Bayes' theorem never gets mentioned, but it does get illustrated.

** Oookay. . . I'll ask a question I led up to in my criticism of Inviolate over in [[/r/HPMOR]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rhn6d/recommendation_inviolate_a_deconstructionist_dc/][here]]

Is Worm rational fic? Specifically does the rising level of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold][Godzilla threshold]] *Warning: TvTropes* detract from plausibility, such that the decision making examples are no longer useful? Does the semi-constant idiot ball holding by the protectorate add or detract from it as rational story?

/disclaimer/ I am a huge fan of worm.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate][linkity link link]]; about rationalish Lex Luthor, and somewhat related to amazing rationalist Superman comic [[http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Red-Son-Mark-Millar/dp/1401201911][/Red Son/]].

To answer your question, it meets the main criteria (no idiot balls, gray morality, intelligent application of resources), so it's fine.

*** The decisions in Worm are usually being made under extreme duress or time pressures, an are mostly about quick thinking, decisive action, making use of opprotunities and clever improvisation. Later on there was a bigger emphasis on information gathering too, so I think it counts.

The Godzilla threshold is inevitable in the Wormverse and quite welcome.

As for the Protectorate and PRT... We only ever see two directors for any significant length of time, and there is evidence of internal sabotage, etc. so maybe they deserve a pass.

**** Ironically the decisions that were made under extreme pressures were so much better than what Skitter did in her leisure time. That stuff infuriated me to no end. Because of that Worm did not seem a rational fic to me from the very start, and it kind of disappointed me (since it was advertised in [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]])

Still, well written, got me to S9 showdown. Maybe I'll finish it on vacation.

*** Currently on arc 15 of Worm, and I agree that the idiot ball holding by the protectorate and other villain groups during the Slaughterhouse 9 campaign is pretty grating.

Not sure what exactly qualifies something as a rational fic... Skitter is certainly /more/ rational than your average hero, but as far as I can tell, not explicitly invoking any discussion of logical fallacies, optimization, etc.

**** I think you confuse nonobvious incentives for the idiot ball! It's been a while since I read arc 15, could you provide some examples?

A character acting in a way that doesn't support their (or their organisation's) declared goals is not necessarily holding the idiot ball.
