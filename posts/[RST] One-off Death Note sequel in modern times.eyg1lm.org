*** Same. But without a message, it's little more than self insert "this is what /I/ would do with the death note!" fanfiction, like most bad rationalist fiction. The fact that the original author wrote it has no bearing on that fact.

And while the rule /did/ come out of nowhere and was worded specifically to screw the guy over, the rule was added by a Shinigami who actually /did/ just want to screw the guy over. So at least it makes sense, even if it's unsatisfying.

**** I think the message is in general that no matter how you go about it, the power of something like the Death Note is intrinsically evil and you can't really escape its consequences. The protagonist thought he was being clever by not killing anyone himself, but in practice, he knew he was /enabling/ someone else being killed, maybe even start wars. In the end the rules were made up because he made the mistake of treating Death Gods as only passive observers rather than beings with their own agendas and Death Notes of their own.

***** He was given the rules. How would he know they'd change?

****** He was given the rules by a sentient, vaguely demonic, immortal, invulnerable, utterly alien being who also is in possession of a Death Note and was in it purely for their own amusement. That's... not someone I would feel like trusting with being 100% open and not turning on me at any point in the future.

******* True, but he had precedent and he felt like the rules made sense with what was known with Kira's actions, so he could know the rules should be somewhat reliable.

He doesn't know they are immortal or even really sentient, technically. Could be someone controlling it.

******** Well, the manga cut on his conversation with Ryuk, but "a Shinigami can not be killed even by a bullet" is part of the rules, and in fact if Ryuk told him the full story of Light he can't have avoided explaining him that - as well as that Shinigami only die if they kill a human to extend the life of another, or if they run out of lifespan because they stop writing names.

At that point, whether they are sentient or not becomes a sophistry. He's talked with Ryuk and seen him pass the Turing test with flying colours, so to speak. It's either a being with an independent mind, or an avatar of a different being with an independent mind, and in either case there's supernatural shenanigans involved. In fact, if Ryuk was fake and a puppet of some other entity, the simple fact of having put up such a deception would make him /even less/ trustworthy.

********* If they can die in any way, they are not immortal. If they die by just idling, they just have a long lifespan and they basically eat human lifespan to live.

********** I meant immortal as in unkillable, but yeah, fair point. Thing is, basically, long as they /want/ to, a shinigami will always outlive a human and does not need to fear any repercussions from humans for any of their actions.

** Very interesting, but very disappointing ending.

I get that there should've been the moral statement, but this "deus ex machina" was really frustrating part. There obiously were more "normal" ways of making protagonist to pay for what he did - like being killed by random robber for his money, or world war being unleashed because US has the power of Kira, etc.
