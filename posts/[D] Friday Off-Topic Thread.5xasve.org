Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

--------------

So I don't have anything to show this week.  A combination of factors led to me getting practically nothing done until last night, where I at least got a chunk object able to spawn hexes in a rhombus shape.

In Unity, sadly.  I think due to my late start, I'm not going to be able to give Xenko a reasonable look, and so I'll leave that for later.  Word is they're releasing in April.

My truncated goals for the voxel prototype are as follows:

- voxels are saved and loaded

- voxels are organized into chunks of a variable size

- chunks are organized into a cylindrical shape, so that the map wraps both horizontally and vertically

And that's it.  Assuming I don't have another progress-less week ahead of me, this ought to be reasonably achievable.

--------------

We had a lot of debate in the #pokengineering channel about types.  

I'm starting to get pushback over having typing be mutually exclusive, i.e. all of your typing has to add up to 100%.  The issue being brought up is, if a 100% Fire type pokemon is the absolute pinnacle of Fire potential, then it's impossible to have full potential for more than one type.

That's a feature, not a bug, says I.

Still, I can see where it might be an issue in some cases, such as Moltres having a smaller and smaller Flying affinity the more Fire we give it.  One would think, at first glance, that giving Moltres 40% Flying and 60% Fire should be good enough, but then we have creatures like Slugma.  If Slugma is 80% Fire due to pretty much just being a lump of sapient lava, does this make sense?  I would indeed expect Slugma to be hurt by a Water move more than Moltres would be, but that would /also/ mean that Slugma's offensive prowess at fire moves is potentially much higher than Moltres' due to the way that one's typing affects STAB.

The system that was proposed to me involved removing the cap and permitting all types to go up to 100%, so Moltres might be 100% Fire 50% Flying, while Slugma would be 80% Fire.  However, I don't like the ramifications that this would have on things such as breeding or HM type manipulation: if you make yourself more Ice, you won't have to exchange some other typing for it.  I prefer the simple 100% total cap, which makes it so any advantage you gain in one area /automatically/ reduces advantage from some other area, without needing to police it constantly.

So if that's off the table, then there must be some other way to address this issue.  After arguing about it for a few days, it was brought up that having typing be both an offensive and a defensive system is perhaps doing too many things.  We haven't fully identified what effect this will have, but we'll probably end up dividing Type into something like Offensive Typing and Defensive Typing.  

Charizard, for instance, would defensively be something like 40% Dragon, 30% Flying, 20% Fire, 10% Normal, while offensively being 40% Fire, 30% Flying, 20% Dragon, 10% Normal.  After all, you'd have to hit it in the mouth or the tail to actually get reasonable mileage out of your Water damage, but it's also a /literal fire-breathing dragon/, so it's got a bit more punch than might be initially obvious.

We're still working through the ramifications of this, so if you have anything to say, please speak up!

*** I think the breeding ramifications are interesting here. It makes perfect sense for the defensive typing to sum to 1, since there's a corresponding physical effect. If a pokemon was 50% and 50% fire, it could be literally half fire and half ice.

It's the offensive typing where the problem comes in. If you breed a Charizard to have hotter fire, does it also fly worse?

If so, why? After all, if all mutations necessarily came with an equal reduction then organisms couldn't really evolve. There are obviously trade-offs in evolution, but it's not 1:1 and not always sacrificing like for like. Sometimes the downside is just increased energy costs for growing, using, and maintaining the feature.

To put it in reverse, if you surgically removed a Charizard's ability to produce flame, surely it wouldn't become a better dragon by magic.

**** This is actually a great point. Having the defenses capped and the offenses independent sounds much more reasonable than all or nothing.

Also, the concept you brought up of increased energy costs is intriguing to me (even if you didn't mean it as a mechanical proposal) ...something like, for every point in an offensive type past, say 30%, have a corresponding increase in endurance usage of moves of that type? There feels like there's /something/ there.

** Is anyone else questioning their belief in traditional democratic values like freedom of speech? I was always of the opinion that "sunlight is the best disinfectant" so that the surest way to stop bad ideas from spreading was for public discourse to prove them wrong. However, lately I have seen many ideas I consider evil gain massive support that rejects alternatives they're made aware of.

The result of this is when I see people critique Bill Maher for even allowing Yiannopoulos a platform to speak or Anti-Fascist groups that openly promote censorship of hate speech, I find I can't disagree with them the way I used to. I've seen hatred become normalized in spite, and sometimes because, of opposition to it so I worry allowing people to share these ideas at all will cause it to spread further no matter what.

At the same time, another part of me hates myself for being so utilitarian that I don't remain committed to the principles I've always held dear. I'm supposed to seek to optimize the values I cherish, not change those values in response to irrational opposition. I don't want to hate evil more than I love good, but the more I see evil win the less I care about being good.

It was so easy to have faith in goodness when I believed good was winning overall, but now that I feel like progress has been halted or reversed I'm considering means that I once considered evil in to reach an end that's even a little more good than today's world. What does that say about me? What does that say about the state of the world?

Re: Evil winning vs. good. Maybe I'm too optimistic, but I do still think that the world is generally getting better, and if anything we are just in a temporary downward spike. All this means is that we need to try harder using 'good' methods of optimizing the world.

**** Denying free speech just says that you have no rational argument to debate them on.

You're allowed to disagree, or even to ignore or scorn people with differing opinions. But a democracy does not function when one group can mandate that another is not allowed to speak. Especially because that will imply that the silenced party has something so powerful to say that the majority party has no rational argument against it.

#+end_quote

Is it? Imagine there was some harmful idea that was extremely persuasive because of quirks of human psychology, but not actually right. Teaching such an idea to vulnerable groups could lead to it being adopted despite the harm it causes.

Obviously if you train people to avoid those quirks, the problem is sufficiently reduced in magnitude that it may as well have disappeared. But the population we have isn't trained. They're eminently susceptible. Even rationalists are, though ideally we'd be able to notice and correct those negative beliefs in ourselves and others.

I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility that there might be things which should not be given a platform. Unfortunately, I can think of no way to prevent the expression of such ideas without enabling the suppression of whatever ideas the government (or whichever group) doesn't like.

Essentially, my preferences would be (in order):

1. Eliminate the issues with human psychology that lead to people holding irrational beliefs.
2. Prevent the spread of irrational beliefs without affecting the spread of arational or rational beliefs.
3. Allow all beliefs to compete freely.

1 and 2 are both, as far as I can see, infeasible. 1 is a massive, multi-generational undertaking in the best case, and 2 might just be impossible. That leaves 3, and theoretically 1 & 3 implies 2 (since these harmful memes only spread because people aren't sufficiently rational).

***** I hear what you're saying here, and I largely agree with it, I /want/ it to be true.

However, that being said, lets look at meme theory. There are clearly certain memes with negative social utility that are extremely good at self-replicating and propagating themselves in our culture. If these sorts of memes are allowed to take hold, then they act like a supervirus and spread rapidly through the population. Yes, this directly implies that the silenced party has something powerful to say, but that's the problem. We know from meme theory that power and ability to spread through a population are /orthogonal/ to the truth-value of a given meme. So you can have these incredibly infectious, powerful memes, that are societally-harmful but very difficult to eradicate, especially since many of these memes foster the creation of ingroups around themselves as defense mechanisms against competing ideas.

Now, trying to fix that quirk of human nature, on the whole, is a very difficult task, but given the existence of these memetic equivalents to biological warfare, maybe we should reconsider giving all memes an equally rich substrate to develop within.

The other problem I see with unrestricted free speech is this, quote is from Slatestarcodex, bolding mine:

#+begin_quote
  Liberalism is a new form of Hobbesian equilibrium where the government enforces not only a ban on killing and stealing from people you don't like, but also a ban on tyrannizing them out of existence. This is the famous “freedom of religion” and “freedom of speech” and so on, as well as the “freedom of what happens in the bedroom between consenting adults”. The Catholics don't try to ban Protestantism, the Protestants don't try to ban Catholicism, and everyone is happy. *Liberalism only works when it's clear to everyone on all sides that there's a certain neutral principle everyone has to stick to.* The neutral principle can't be the Bible, or Atlas Shrugged, or anything that makes it look like one philosophy is allowed to judge the others. Right now that principle is the Principle of Harm: you can do whatever you like unless it harms other people, in which case stop. We seem to have inelegantly tacked on an “also, we can collect taxes and use them for a social safety net and occasional attempts at social progress”, but it seems to be working pretty okay too.
#+end_quote

My fear is that a group will claim to adhere to the neutral principle, take power, and then use that power to ban Catholicism anyway. [[https://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5ntjh2/all_this_fake_news/dceozzo/][This post]] covers that playbook pretty well. If everyone involved isn't acting in good faith, it's easy to undermine the principles we hold dear. It's not particularly easy to identify when people aren't acting in good faith all the time, but if we don't make the attempt, then we leave the door open for people to use freedom of speech to destroy freedom of speech, who'll use democracy to destroy democracy, that's definitely a concern of mine.

*** I think I understand what it must feel like, seeing good ideas fail to prevail and wondering if free speech actually does lead to the success of good ideas, but even if free speech has failure states like this, I'd argue that the alternative is still much worse.

Free speech or no free speech, the marketplace of ideas is symmetric. There's no Idea God to tell us which ideas are actually superior to others, and every proponent of an idea will assert that theirs is the only one that's true among competing ideas. Even when you /know/ your methodologies were superior and yours is the only honest conclusion with the data available, the situations are rarely so straightforward that people can be reliably convinced that their methodology was wrong, even when they're being open-minded. /They/ probably also know their methodologies are the most sound and that theirs is the only honest conclusion, too.

As such, there is no way for advocate for obviously wrong ideas to be suppressed while also being safe from suppression yourself. Even if free speech doesn't get the right ideas propagating, it /keeps the ideas propagating/, which is so incredibly important I can't begin to describe it.

The true failure state here is not that bad ideas gain popularity, even though that is a failure state. The true failure state is when ideas die because others disliked them, because without an Idea God there is no person, group, or ideology fit to dictate whether those ideas for certain deserved to die or not, because after all, they could be your ideas.

tl;dr free speech may not be perfect, but it keeps good ideas alive even if bad ideas never die either. Since we are only human, we have to accept that there's no way to forcibly cull the bad ideas and keep the good ones.

*** I think two things:

a) Genocide is not an opinion (this draws a nice, if typically fuzzy line, regarding free speech)

b) Any given system will have a faulting situation. Do not restrict yourself to one; life doesn't.

Let's dive into /b/ a little more: Utility monsters, Pascal's Wager - these are good examples of fault situations for value systems and methodologies. They are rescued by comparing their output to other value systems, including "gut" feeling. Look at Ethereum and the debate about forking it after the "theft".

Think about your own brain and existence: You have a logical system for thinking, and an emotional one. Some people experience existential systems. Your brain uses may different systems (electrical, hormonal) which in turn are not restricted to the brain (the gut has a substantial effect).

All in all - Don't feel conflicted that you have multiple active value systems. When your value systems disagree, that's a sign you should examine the situation in more detail. Maybe one system is in a fault situation, and you can't rely on it; maybe they're legit disagreeing and you need a larger principle to decide between systems (which itself is a system... yay fractals!)

Does that make any kind of sense?

(PS - My "larger principle" is: act to make there be more of what you want in the world.)

****** I...don't know that any more.

I used to think you were right, that rhetoric and honest debate were the surest ways of ensuring that the truth rose to the top. But...well...look at the world now. We have a man spouting obvious, easily checked lies in the White House, and a group of honest-to-goodness fascists behind him. Their followers ignore all attempts to engage them honestly, all attempts to try to show them evidence. They abjectly refuse to change their minds on any issue, even when you wave evidence in their faces that they are wrong. You can't embarrass them in a debate because their base knows, at the bottom of their souls, that their champions are correct by virtue of being their champions. You can't remove them from power through argument because the system as it stands has been totally corrupted, and there are enough of them in enough places that they can win elections without even having the majority of the country on their side.

This isn't about honesty, or rational thought, any more. This is about the integrity of the concept of truth itself, a concept which an entire political party and all of its champions have totally abandoned. These people are dangerous, existential threats to the capacity of this planet to support human life, due to their abject denial of climate change. Until they start actually slaughtering innocents, it's not possible to get much worse or more terrifying than that.

So yes, GRRM is right. I do absolutely fear what these people have to say. But I fear it because it is all, 100%, demonstrably, provably, wrong and dangerous, and because it risks my future and the future of every single goddamn human on the planet. Germany has learned this lesson. They learned that there is some rhetoric that cannot be allowed, some words that cannot be said, and some tongues that cannot remain in mouths. Being a nazi, or espousing things which the Nazis espoused, is totally illegal in Germany. The nationalist, blind waving of the flag as an ideal is socially frowned upon, because they know where that leads.

In order to win against these monsters, it is imperative to make them look ridiculous and dangerous on the biggest stage possible, and to make it personally dangerous to follow in their footsteps. In that way, you might be able to get these fools to slink back into the darkness and die before it is too late.

The statistics seem to show a recent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes, but not a significant increase in other hate crimes. They also show a significant increase in Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe recently, which could easily explain this trend as the cause of the emboldening.

Given that Trump's rhetoric is negative towards Muslims and Illegal immigrants from Mexico, but makes little to no mention of race except occasionally to promote equality rather than oppose it, it would be more accurate to describe it as anti-Islamic, which is a religious category, not a racial one.

The fact that Indians and other people of certain ethnicity are being targeted without their religion being known detracts from this argument, but last time I checked bigots weren't particularly intelligent and probably don't care about the difference.

Being explicitly racist would be political suicide, but banning travelers from Muslim countries while giving exceptions for Christians, decrying only Muslim terrorist attacks while ignoring recent hate crimes, making up fake terrorist attacks to attribute to Muslims, etc. all accomplish the same thing as explicitly as a politician can get away with. And the point about mistaking Indian people for Muslims is important because it's not really just about religion and ideology or terrorism, it's also about race. Anyway, I didn't say Trump himself is a white supremacist, but he's certainly currying their support and legitimizing their views. These people like Bannon target anyone they don't consider white, including Hispanic, black, and Jewish people. Maybe it's because I've spent time on 4chan and altright subs but the trend here is pretty obvious.

I understand that Trump is socially progressive in some ways such as in supporting LGBT rights and in not being racist towards black people. But conveniently it stops where it comes to anyone who could be considered a foreigner. Conveniently while Trump talks about being socially progressive he removes protections for transgender students because his flip flops on these issues means even his reassurances aren't reassuring. Any Asian person in this country has a right to feel afraid. People like you who will never have to worry about this don't get to invalidate these concerns. We live here in America at the mercy of white people, and it would only take a few major terrorist attacks or a war to get sent to concentration camps like the Japanese did during World War II.

I don't know if there is a true consensus on who was responsible for the Reichstag Fire, but let's assume it was a pure false flag.

I'm not saying "don't protest" (though I'd suggest making sure the protests are productive; media coddling can only go so far).

If it does, then we should support tactics which Fight Evil. If the causal factor is something else, we need to work on that.

That's a very broad brush. What I mean is, you should point out (for example):\\
- Court decisions that are /very clearly/ based on common-sense interpretation of law and precedent rather than on a supposed judicial desire to accumulate authoritarian power and tear down the executive, legislative, and administrative powers beyond what the principle of checks and balances dictates (read the decisions yourself, then check analyses of them as well)\\
- Universities and news organizations that are /very clearly/ devoted to the acquisition and dissemination of true knowledge rather than to the masking of political opinions as truths and lies as facts (look up ethics scandals and incidents of agenda-pushing)\\
- (I can't think of anything to defend "the authority of 'intellectuals' to inform". Maybe try describing them as "knowledgeable people" or "dedicated analysts", and show that they've been correct in the past.)

*** On Truth:

Hate speech, self-righteous falsehood, and proud ignorance are frustrating but- in my opinion -better to suffer them all than to throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater.

Truths can hurt, every bit as much as fantasies can, but they're true. They may be denied, they may be devalued, they may be undermined, but they can never be destroyed.

When necessary, it must be spoken no matter how much it hurts. That may feel like hate to the person who hears it, it may feel like falsehood, it may feel like ignorance and, indeed, /it may truly be any one of those or all three/. Who's to know? But if it remains unsaid, then the speaker's truth remains unknown... or the speaker's untruth remains uncorrected.

On Evil:

There is so much good in the world that seeing it is as blinding as the sun. Every minute of every day billions of people are gentle, kind, trusting, and giving. Their decisions trend towards health, community, and hope. Were that not true in aggregate, every minute of every day, anything resembling society would have failed before it began.

Evil is so rare that every insignificant bit of it stands out in stark, obvious contrast. When we're crowded together, or when the internet and the media bring us together, evil can grow common and we can feel apathetic. If that starts to hurt too much, shade your squinting eyes with your hand and notice some of the good. It's not easy, but it's worth a look.

To paraphrase a pair of detectives under the stars:

"How do those tiny lights stand up against all that darkness?"

In my opinion, abstract notions like rights and individual freedom are completely meaningless if we only get to exercise them in the leftist context of post-nationalism, post-race, post-gender, post-sanity society. That context must be denied completely. The western concept of individual rights must be put in the proper moral context of a homogeneous, high-trust, low time preference society. I see no reason why it would apply outside that. Indeed, it seems to me that leftists don't so much try to apply the right-wing idea of individual rights, as use it as a tool to beat people into submission - ie, you're pathological if you don't accept the people's individual rights to ignore national borders, to parade the rectal insertion of foreign objects, to have their mental delusions validated by the law, etc.

The power of exclusion. The idea that we don't owe anyone inclusion in our institutions. When you deny a society the discriminative power of categories like race and gender, you're forcing it into including people in positions that society has previously never considered them to belong in. Even if you disagree about the long-term effects of such a change (and somehow believe it is beneficial on balance), it should still be resisted by the virtue of its forceful implementation alone. Leftism asserts itself against humane societies through the use of force, and I have no problem defending against it using the same.

Your language here is rubbish. You're treating the low-entropy/high-precision distribution of things you want as default, and then using "leftist" or "far-left" to refer to the high-entropy/low-precision distribution of /everything else/. You're basically just saying, "Everything I don't like is Stalinist".

Look, I know about the use of framing effects in propaganda too, but that's the issue: most people on this sub are going to recognize a framing effect /that obvious/. Maybe you /actually believe/ that whatever you espouse is the natural, passive state of the world before deliberate action fucks it all up, but you can't expect the rest of us to share that expectation.

** Theoretical question-asking...

An asker of questions always must consider the answers that he wants to glean in formulating his inquiries. For an example, let's take a simple question:

#+begin_quote
  What's your favorite color?
#+end_quote

This sentence offers up two very obvious ambiguities for our examination.

First, /what do I mean by =color=?/\\
- Is =white=, =black=, or =gray= an acceptable response, or must the answer have nonzero saturation?\\
- Speaking of saturation, in what format should the response be delivered--a simple word, an RGB value (decimal or hexadecimal?), a Pantone CMYK reference, or something else?\\
- Should the queried person respond with a /specific/ color, like =RGB 0 128 0=, or with a /range/ of color, like =green in general= or =bright, highly-saturated green=?

Second, /what do I mean by =favorite=?/\\
- Speaking of RGB vs. CMYK, /in what context/ is the queried person expected to be thinking of the color? Is this his favorite color in isolation on a computer screen, or on someone else's car that he sees on the road, or on his own car, or on his casual polo shirts?\\
- Must the receiver provide a /reason/ for his preference ("I like green because I like forests and tree frogs."), or can he merely say "I like green." and have done?

In this specific case, since all these clarifications change the meaning of the question only slightly, my opinion is that the most economical course of action is merely asking:

#+begin_quote
  What's your favorite color? Be detailed.
#+end_quote

However, not all questions can be wrapped up so nicely. I recently had the pleasure of [[http://np.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/5vpocy/neckbeard_doesnt_like_parties/de4f6np][receiving]] the /hilariously/-vague question:

#+begin_quote
  Who's your perfect girl?
#+end_quote

I chuckled when I saw it!\\
- Does =girl= mean =child= (offspring, or subject of babysitting?) or =romantic partner= (or is the asker implying with such a belittling word that the person would be my /vassal/ rather than my /ally/ in the relationship?)?\\
- By using =is= rather than =would be=, is the enquirer asking me to describe a current /real-life/ object of greed rather than a /hypothetical/ person?

In the past (IIRC), I've posed the inquiry "Describe your ideal long-term romantic partner.", which obviously is /far/ more specific.

#+begin_quote
  Telling people my opinion on why drinking and parties are stupid is also something I'd never do but would absolutely love to.
#+end_quote

I'll bite -- why do you think drinking and parties are stupid? I've encountered the "drinking is dumb" thing in this and adjacent communities a fair bit, but then in my day-to-day life it seems drinking is popular all through the upper reaches of accomplishment/intelligence/scientific aptitude/etc. (maybe not independently of wealth, though -- usually those people are into the expensive craft beer scene, or own a vineyard, or fancy sipping their many-decades-aged scotch in the evenings, or w/e). A love of social events/dinner parties goes pretty hand-in-hand here, too (though with obvious sampling bias, of the sort where you ask "why are so many of my friends more popular than me?").

A short while back I came up with a quick list of reasons why I'll personally consume alcohol, in no particular order:

1.  It's found in a variety of tasty beverages (and occasionally foods, e.g. in sauces). In beverage form it can enhance the taste of certain foods
2.  In mild-moderate doses it has pleasing psychoactive qualities, i.e. a pleasant buzz
3.  It can serve as a social lubricant through direct modification of your attitude and personality
4.  It can serve as a social lubricant by giving you a common ground with which to connect with someone, owing to its immense popularity -- e.g. you can talk about the production or history of wine-making, or what flavors you like and dislike, etc.
5.  It's historically and culturally important in many places and you can get a deeper appreciation of a place by sampling its drinks (e.g. by going on a tasting tour and exploring the history of wine-making in France or beer in Belgium or something, never mind local scenes)
6.  Mild consumption might be good for you, or it's at least associated with decreased mortality (a classic "j-shaped curve" is borne out in a lot of studies; e.g. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17159008]]). Probably confounded, but there are plenty of plausible mechanisms
7.  It's something to do while bored which will make you less bored (e.g. at a noisy house party it lowers your threshold for entertainment -- flailing around on the dance floor is more fun while tipsy; related to the pleasing psychoactive qualities mentioned above)
8.  Its consumption is traditionally a symbolic/ritualistic behavior in a lot of circumstances (e.g. celebrations), and there are a lot of benefits to consistent tradition and ritual
9.  A lot of people like it, and to some you'll stand out -- not necessarily in a good way -- if you don't. There's a social stigma against not drinking, and failing to conform may rob you of some ability to resist social pressure elsewhere
10. Many activities and games become more challenging while under the influence, so it's a good way to handicap yourself if something's become too easy -- e.g. in drinking games
11. It can be fun to prepare alcoholic drinks and experiment with different combinations of flavors in the same way that it's fun to cook or draw or make anything else -- it can serve as an outlet for artistic expression
12. More an absence of a - than a +, but you can easily lessen the unpleasant effects of alcohol consumption (e.g. hangovers) by drinking in moderation, staying well hydrated, not drinking on an empty stomach, getting a full night's sleep, and maybe taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement

As for parties, I've found it /really/ depends on the sort of party you're going to. I attended dozens of house parties in undergrad and soon realized that the sorts of 50+ person parties where you stand around trying to talk over extremely loud music while nursing a beer were not for me, but that I quite enjoyed parties where I could join a smaller group engaged in lengthy discussion, with some quiet sounds serving as a background, with the occasional pre-planned activity (e.g. board games, video games, movies, dinner -- usually potluck style, and so on) to break up the evening.

That's typically incidental to the main effect, though, which to me is more sort of a warm, friendly inner glow which can complement similar feelings from other sources (e.g. after a long day of intense hiking/biking, cuddling up with my partner and dog on the couch watching a movie with a cold beer in hand... the slight buzz only serves to enhance the experience).

I love knowing the history of a place or a thing, it definitely stimulates my enjoyment of it -- to use a nerdier e.g., I might like a sword because it looks cool and is sharp or w/e, but if you tell me the story of how some poor blacksmith discovered a new forging technique that enabled that sharpness, which revolutionized armed combat because now the sword could puncture previously impenetrable armor, etc. I'd certainly appreciate the sharpness more.

To make an implication a bit more explicit -- being social serves plenty of instrumental goals too, e.g. in closing business deals over drinks, connecting with your coworkers and boss after work (thereby facilitating promotion/career advancement), networking with strangers to open up opportunities down the line, even interviewing for new positions (e.g. in my experience in academia it's common to take applicants out for dinner/drinks after they give their job talk). It doesn't have to just be for the pleasure of others' company and can be thought of as a skill as any other.

The "doing it wrong" comes from attacking them over it. Humaning protip: If you find yourself attacking someone, you're doing it wrong.

Better to go "nope, not interested, have fun." and leave it at that. If pressed, sure, explain why YOU don't like it... but don't explain it as if they shouldn't like it either... although on the gripping hand, that thing there one voice of dissent lets other dissent is probably a good thing.

In terms of JUST exploring what "normal" people do... Most of the time it's dull AF. But the act of going out for a drink isn't what makes it boring, it's what the people who're doing it end up talking about. I have had amazingly deep and meaningful conversations in all kinds of "normal" and "crazy" situations.

Which part of the world are you in? I may be able to point you at some people.

A somewhat harder but way more liberating thing to do is to just start doing the thing that interests you, and DGAF when people run away because they're not interested. Want to talk about rationality? Just start talking about it. Want to make something? Start making something.
