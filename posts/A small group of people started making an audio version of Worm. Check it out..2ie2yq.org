** Seeing how popular [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com][www.hpmorpodcast.com]] is and how Worm is often mentioned here I thought this could get some traction. They also could use some feedback, because even they started in June and have ca. 4000 downloads I'm still the only one to comment.

**** There are actually two narrators who take turns from arc to arc. Each interlude seems to be done by volunteers other than those two. I can only say that the second narrator is better and that the only way for them to improve is feedback and the feeling that it would be appreciated. Also, remember that the first several chapters in hpmorpodcast.com also were worse than the latter ones but got re-recorded a good while after.

****** I know. What I was trying to say is: "Please continue. It gets better. And please give them some feedback so they can see their mistakes."

****** Hey this is Rein - the second narrator and the guy organizing the whole thing. What Bowbreaker said is absolutely correct. We're constantly improving both our hardware and our technique, but that can only go so far without feedback so we greatly appreciate all of it. Keep on listening, things do improve (just ignore 4.6-4.10 for a few days... I need to redo my failed experiment with Bakuda's voice this weekend). At the same time though, we're purely running on volunteers so the quality /will/ vary across the Arcs/Interludes. This is unfortunate, but we have so much content to get through that we need all the help we can get.

** Oh, thank you for sharing this here! I've been meaning to read Worm and wishing there was an audio version.
