- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?

*** Why not. I'm certainly not an expert on the topic, so feel free to disregard the following at your leisure, but in my opinion this foolish or desperate policy is trying to rock the boat. They can't really seriously hurt any advanced country, but they're damn well going to try, or pretend to try. Attempts to stop them, or get revenge after they destroy something, or the /precedent/ of getting revenge, are going to inflict much more damage than their actions on their own.

This county just happens to be both stupid enough or in a precarious enough position so that such actions make sense to them, and have the technology and social order such that they could build the necessary tools and give out the necessary orders. C'est la vie.

**** Why can't they seriously hurt any advanced country? They're capable of doing so even without missiles or nuclear weapons. Seoul is a city of 10 million, one of the most densely populated in the world, and it's about 35 miles away from the border. There are something like 10,000 artillery weapons on the border, and their range is /probably/ long enough to do serious damage to Seoul.

So about a fifth of the South Korean population is within range of artillery weapons which are, at this very moment, pointed directly at them. An all-out attack by North Korea would be devastating.

The question is whether the political will exists within North Korea, which no one but intelligence agencies really knows.

*** My opinion is that, despite appearances, Kim Jong-Un is a rational actor. He's been ruthless about removing threats to his power and his pursuit of nuclear weapons is rational. No one has the political will to take the measures necessary to stop him beforehand, and as soon as he develops a credible nuclear deterrent his regime will be untouchable by foreign powers. He has implemented reforms so that limited free markets are legal, and the North Korean economy has been growing. Once nuclear weapons are developed, he will be able to downsize the military to the amount necessary to maintain internal stability. Right now North Korea is forced to spend a large percentage of its GDP on its military, and without that, he will be able to grow the economy more, preventing the famines that could otherwise threaten his rule and ensuring that he's able to keep the elite pacified with access to luxury goods. It's hard to say for sure without good information from North Korea, but I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up following this path.

**** Very good point. The obvious goal for NK is to get at this point is to get at least several dozen lightweight high-yield nuclear warheads along with internationally-recognized precision intercontinental attack capability. Once they've got that, they're pretty close to immune to any external aggressors.

Of course, once they have that, they're not going to need 4% of their population in active military duty, and nearly 23% of their GDP going to military expenditures. They would also be able to stop the missile tests which would save money and likely ease their relations with the rest of the world.

It actually seems fairly likely that NK will try to take the same route that China took. Become a nuclear power first, then use cheap labor to attract foreign investors to develop and industrialize your country. After several decades, quality of life will improve, labor costs will go up, and companies will gradually transition to less developed countries.

** Why aren't terminally ill but not bedridden patients hired as suicidal assassins more? The extreme jump of the acceptable risk curve makes me think this should be more of a thing than it is. I would certainly consider doing something like that if I were in such a situation and an offer came along. Possibly even for free aside from the tools required for the kill (gun/bomb/poison) if I found the target's values to be aligned against mine to a sufficient degree.

Such an assassin would have no reason to cooperate with authorities if they were captured, and there exists no leverage to cause them to reveal whatever they might know about their employer (which should be nothing anyway) (i.e. sentence reduction is meaningless); they can employ otherwise insane tactics (e.g. poison themselves with slow acting but lethal contact poison and go shake hands with the target).

Is it just too cost inefficient to be viable considering the would assassin is just a regular person with no relevant skills who would likely just be taken down before they can succeed? Do people just stop caring about anything at that point? Are most people just moral enough to consider essentially risk-free benefit to their family/friends or general fulfillment of their values at the cost of their enemies/"bad people" to be reprehensible? Is it simply a logistical issue of finding a terminally ill person whose values misalign sufficiently with the target's?

To be more serious, all of what you've said. The probability of a terminally ill patient (1) coming across the idea, /and/ (2) being physically able to carry an assassination out, /and/ (3) having the skills to carry an assassination out, /and/ (4) being willing to carry an assassination out, /and/ (5) finding someone to pay them is just too small.

Even a sociopath is likely to be able to come up with a better way to spend their final months of life. You're essentially limited to somebody who's been searching for an excuse to do it.

It maybe makes sense for a hitman to take on a suicide mission for one last payout (though even that seems too Hollywood to happen, since hitmen probably have other goals beyond murder), but I can't imagine somebody with no existing history of violence making this decision.

Now if they were personally motivated for the murder, sure. Not beyond the pale for somebody to take an enemy out with them, even without money in the picture. Still not going to be a remotely common choice, but revenge is a powerful motivator.

*** There's a lot of reasons. Let's start with medical reasons:

For starters, it's exceedingly rare that someone has a guaranteed terminal illness while still being physically fit and functional. Survival rates with the most deadly kinds of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, are quite low, but even 5% odds of survival for five years means you still potentially have something to lose if you get arrested. Of course, current five year survival rate data is also at least five years out of date with current treatments, so the realistic odds of survival are typically better than would be expected from current research.

Other kinds of terminal illness (like severe heart failure) in a patient who is not a candidate for transplant or surgery are almost always so problematic already that the patient cannot even perform the basic daily tasks they would need to survive at home.

About the only thing I can think of that would qualify as certainly fatal while still leaving you at least modestly functional for some short period of time would be sudden exposure to 8-30 sieverts of ionizing radiation. Of course, in this case, you'd start to feel nauseous and begin vomiting in under 10 minutes after exposure, and begin to have heavy diarrhea in under an hour. You'd have a severe headache in 1-2 hours and a severe fever in under an hour. You'd only be lucid for 'several' hours before becoming too cognitively impaired to function. This could conceivably happen in some kind of nuclear accident, but it's doubtful that you'd be able to confirm the dose, get out of the situation, and still have time to accomplish anything meaningful before becoming too crippled to function anymore.

**** So, for the sake of storywriting, let's say there's some kind of illness that is guaranteed to kill you in a fixed period of time regardless of any attempts at treatment. It's still not going to be likely for several reasons.

*Logistical reasons:* Almost any government that has the resources to track such people down and recruit/equip them probably also has the resources to just use cruise missiles or drones. These have the advantage of being available at any time and are likely more reliable anyway. The situation might be more plausible in a historical setting where cruise missiles and drones aren't available.

For non-government organizations, like rebel, criminal or terrorist groups, there is significant difficulty in identifying functional people with terminal illnesses, and significant danger in trying to recruit them. You'd pretty much have to get doctors on your side who would refer such patients to you, and that seems exceedingly unlikely, not least because doctors are in the business of saving lives, not taking them.

Individuals who are diagnosed with such an illness seem to be the most likely ones to carry out such a plan, though the people who are most likely to get any kind of terminal illness in the first place are people who didn't have the resources and capability to prevent that from happening. As such, they're not likely to have the means to carry out a nefarious plan even if they wanted to.

For the sake of storywriting, let's assume we have a historical setting where cruise missiles aren't available and suicidal assassins are among the best options for taking out high-value targets. Even so, it's still unlikely because:

*Moral, ethical, and religious reasons:* Most people believe in some kind of afterlife and punishment for misdeeds. People who are faced with death are more likely than most to think carefully about what awaits them death. Even in the absence of religion, almost everyone can agree that murder is bad, as is asking people to commit murder, so it would not be easy to find people who would agree to be recruiters, and it would be even harder to find volunteers for such missions.

You are an evil criminal mastermind who wants to assassinate someone. Do you go to a hospital looking for terminally ill commoners? Or do you hire an actually skilled assassin?

The number of problems with choosing the former is endless: since they are commoners, they are horrible incompetent. They will fail the assassination and put the target on guard. They won't have proper subtlety, leaving trails of evidence everywhere. They won't have work ethics or a professional reputation to maintain, so there's nothing stopping them from telling others who their employers are for more cash. And just as they have nothing to fear from the authorities, they have nothing to fear from you. Nothing to stop them from stabbing you in the back if they want to.

Cold-blooded violence seems extremely rare. I suspect our brains are wired to not notice it as an option.

I encounter a lot of political debate. It's common to meet people who think [issue] is a matter of life-and-death. Often, they're right. To pick a minimally-distracting example, [[https://phys.org/news/2016-07-coal-year-eu.html][coal pollution kills about 23,000 people]] in the EU/year.

** So, [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/28/contra-askell-on-moral-offsets/][latest SSC post]] on moral offsets has me wondering what the real upper bound is for the cost of an "offset" for vegetarianism.

I actually signed up to make a comment because I thought Scott's figure ($500 per year) was way off. I think the order of magnitude for the upper bound is more like $6,000 per year; anyone interested in the thought experiment of "what is the most it would cost to offset a year's meat consumption"?

Relevant paragraph of his post:

#+begin_quote
  Or use offsets instead of becoming vegetarian. An typical person's meat consumption averages 0.3 cows and 40 chickens per year. Animal Charity Evaluators believes that donating to a top animal charity this many animals' lives for less than $5; others note this number is totally wrong and made up. But it's hard to believe charities could be less cost-effective than just literally buying the animals; this would fix a year's meat consumption offset price at around $500. Would I pay between $5 and $500 a year not to have to be a vegetarian? You bet.
#+end_quote

Below I argue that the true upper bound is likely an order of magnitude higher, and while if I could do better than being vegan for $5 a year it would be an attractive trade, I don't think "vegan for a year vs $5k USD" is nearly as attractive. I will boldly propose that for most people, if they were given that choice (go vegan or pay $5k per year), they would choose veganism.

--------------

I think the other thing is, in calculating an offset for meat consumption, we need to not only calculate the cost of buying the animals themselves but of keeping them. A cow lives 20 years, a chicken 10. You need to give them a place to sleep, veterinary care, etc. So you'll need to pay for a farm with a constant population of 6 cows and 400 chickens, and for someone to be taking good care of them. (This may be 400 chickens and 400 roosters depending on how/if egg production was counted, and never mind sheep, pigs, etc: but let's use Scott's figures). I am not a farmer, feel like keeping 6 cows and 400 chickens is going to cost more than $500 a year even assuming you don't give them medical treatment (in this “offset” situation I think it would be “right” to give them medical care if you an average family would give equivalent care to their pet dog -- so minor surgeries but maybe only palliative care for cancer rather than extensive chemo).

If you're trying to say that if a cow can be purchased for say, $300, then it must mean that keeping a cow for its entire life costs less than $300 or the farmer makes no profit, I think that's fallacious as the farmer selling the cow is probably keeping it in the factory-like conditions that make vegetarianism so desireable, and the farmer sells it at age 2 rather than age 20, which is how old you'd be keeping it.

So, suffice it to say, I think the $500 per year upper bound on the cost of a vegetarian offset is way off.

(I quickly googled the cost of boarding a horse, since that's a popular service and a horse probably has similar requirements to a cow, and that's $400-$500 a month; so I think the upper bound is more on the order of $6,000 per year, likely even higher than that!)

*** the offset should be going into vat grown meat research. This is a /solvable problem/. Once we have tasty, healthy, cost effective vat grown meat, domestic meat production goes into the crapper. Oh sure, it will still exist as a niche market, but as a mass produced product? not a chance.

It's just like the abortion issue, ignoring the moral complexity of yes or no on abortion entirely. Making an affordable artificial womb /so far shifts the debate it could swing some staunchly for it to the other side/. Why would those who feel strongly about this not donate and focus on this stuff if this is the 'evil they wish to change'?

**** Yeah, the good food institute is my favourite charity for vegan causes, though it's not tax deductible where I live >_>

I like that with vat meat we can go for e.g. tiger or panda meat, which would be great when the technology reaches something like $500/kg of tissue since until it reaches the crazy low prices I see for American chicken ($2/lb or something??????) nobody will be buying chicken with it.

More than that I think "artificial" meats like you can get from Quorn, Fry's, Gardein etc will come into play for a lot of applications. Joe Sixpack probably won't balk at buying Chicken ^{style} nuggets if they're 20% cheaper, and they will be when it gets to a high enough scale. Already subway is cutting their chicken with soy; they're not doing that because they want to protect us from cancer with those isoflavones, they're doing it because it's cheaper.

I don't think artificial wombs help the abortion debate at all; there's still a kid who needs to be raised and I'm sure artificial wombs aren't free. I ain't paying child support if I would otherwise have got an abortion (admittedly getting it adopted by a family in need would render the child support angle moot).

Plus a procedure for getting the zygote out of the womb sounds like a risky medical procedure moreso than abortion is. Better to take RU486 ASAP, suffer for a few hours/days, and then be done with it.

But if artificial wombs became cheap and safe moreso than birth control, you'd end up with a crazy oversupply of babies before too long (especially because couples in need could opt to have a baby that is their genetic progeny grown in an artificial womb in lieu of extremely expensive surrogacy).

Really the best solution is to advocate for all boys to be injected with something like vasalgel at a very young age, and find something similar (safe, non hormonal, permanent, reversible) that would work for girls (I don't think a copper IUD on a 10 year old girl is going to work!). This can then be deactivated when required. Would probably infringe on a lot of peoples' religious freedoms or something though.

The same would happen with abortion at the political level. Once you can say 'look, you can have the fetus removed and put in this device and then it has nothing to do with you' well, you will see some stances change /even though nothing has intrinsically changed/ about the moral/ethical conditions.

It's unfortunate, but true, that emotional responses will be a component in these kinds of discussions for people.

I agree though, a birth control drug like you described for both sexes provided free at an early age would do the trick pretty damn fast, it also would never work in most places in the world simply because of religious concerns. fuck that annoys me.

******** I know. It's pretty awful. But she adopted I think 5 or 6 children from one heroin addicted mother so I'm sure that took a toll on her, to adopt a baby and then keep on getting phone calls saying another sibling is available for adoption.

Not that excuses her in any way, shape, or form for calling them "litters" of babies! Ugh.

*** I'm reminded of the South Park episode where Cartman buys an amusement park for his personal use and he has to keep selling more and more tickets to pay for the guards and ticket sales and so on. You're right that there are a lot of hidden costs that are tricky to calculate. I suppose you wouldn't have to treat the animals completely ethically, just well enough that the marginal cost of doing good via other charities is cheaper. I wouldn't know where to begin computing that.

**** I wonder if you could disincentivize buying real meat products by increasing the maltreatment of animals even more, thereby causing a greater moral outrage and driving more people to boycott it. I'm guessing it probably wouldn't work though.

***** I doubt it. It'd have to be a massive scandal and even then they'd probably only boycott your meat.

*** It is kind of true trivially though, right? Like the present moment is different than the past because you perceive it as actually happening now. But there was a past you that experienced that past that now is a memory, and you remember what it was like but it was different when it was 'actually happening'. So the 'present you' is always changing, and there's an instance of you that lives in every instant.

So you don't really 'die', it's just that time keeps going forward, second to second. You just always have memories of previous points in time and because of causality they form a coherent existence.

So it all adds up to normality, as they say.

One really interesting (and pretty disturbing) thing is what happens when a person's present stream of consciousness still functions but is completely cut off from any memories of the past, as is the case for Clive Wearing ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c62C_yTUyVg]]).

Well /there's/ your big mistake.

#+begin_quote
  “I” is just a pattern that emerged from neurons firing off in my brain.
#+end_quote

Ehhh, it's closer to being the pattern that emerges from the feedback loops between your brain and body. But also the trajectory of that pattern through time.

But also ultimately a normative judgement on your part (which of course means how the pattern at any given point in time wants to move its embodiment towards encoding other patterns, insofar as it possesses a model of its own embodiment).

But it's /most/ proper to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81#M.C4.81dhyamaka][discard Platonism about the self]] and [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/of/dissolving_the_question/][dissolve the concept]].

#+begin_quote
  I know that it was always like that and it can't be changed, so my definitions are probably wrong and I'm looking at it from the wrong perspective.
#+end_quote

Yes indeed!

  Like, you know about people who count sleeping/temporary loss of consciousness as death? I'm like this, except turned to eleven. And even though I know it's stupid, I can't stop it.
#+end_quote

I mean, it's stupid because they're /wrong/. They're imagining something that's not there, and then mourning its loss, when actually it wasn't there to begin with.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, so that's it. I hope you'll help me someway with this.

Not sure we can talk you into different aliefs. How did this one really get there?

  I have the alief that present-me will die and be replaced by one-second-in-the-future-me, who in turn will also be replaced.
#+end_quote

I think you are jumping to conclusions here, but sure. It's possible. There's no possible way for anyone to disprove this hypothesis, anymore than it is possible to disprove the existence of god or an undetectable spaghetti monster.

The question then is... how are you not the most disgustingly happy person in the world? If you truly believed this, that would imply that your actions have no consequences for yourself whatsoever. You could do whatever the hell you feel like and any retribution from the people you hurt would only hurt future you, who you believe to be a different person and apparently don't really care about. You could go around murdering people you don't like and get away with it, since future you would be the one getting imprisoned/killed, not present you. Sure, other people would get hurt, but seeing as you don't even care about future you, why would you care about other people?

Thankfully for the rest of us, there's no way to prove your alief either. It is also entirely possible, that in the future, you will find out that you ARE future you. Or that present you will find yourself strapped to an electric chair in the future, without having been replaced by future you, after going on his happy murder spree. Or maybe you will be replaced for a while, but then suddenly find yourself back in place with a knife in your gut.

Are you truly willing to bet that you won't be these future yous?

(If yes, I beg you to provide all information about yourself to the police right now so that they can arrest future you more easily. You don't care if they arrest future you right? Since future you isn't you, according to your alief.)
