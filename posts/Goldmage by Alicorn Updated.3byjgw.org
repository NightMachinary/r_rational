** This story is great. I've just read the whole thing and highly recommend it. Read this even if you didn't enjoy Luminosity (I didn't).

What has the update schedule for this story been like, because I eagerly await the next chapter.

** I have a bookmark for that story located at the top of my browser and check it once every other day with all of my other bookmarks.

Pro Tip: If you want to be up to date on some online event, get a bookmark for it and put in a convenient spot on your browser bar. You will end up checking it when your e-mail's loading or when your computer is slightly slow to load a web page. This trick has helped me be the first one to submit to contests and scholarships for school.

**** A fantasy-ish world with an interesting approach to magic. All magic has a (fairly terrible) cost: white mages can heal, but they gather the sickness into themselves, not destory it; gold mages can pause time, or even go back in time, but each second paused costs them much more of their lifespan (don't remember off top of my head; think hours or days), and going back in time means having to kill yourself; red mages know someone most intimately with a single touch - but that knowledge replaces their personality and memories, not adds to them. Etc.

As of chapter 4 I find it a very interesting setting, and the MC seems likeable.

***** You forgot blue and green mages. There have been hints of other color magics, but they're all mythical or rumors. Green mages can affect the mind to make it so that you will like something when you didn't before and vice versa. But their price is that they lose their instincts such as pain reaction and how to breathe. Blue mages can learn about things through divination like where someone is or where the gold is in mining. But in return they forget /how/ to do things. It's not like losing memories or instincts like with red and green mages, but rather they only retain factual information and have trouble learning about new things.

It's really interesting to see how there are three different ways to lose mental abilities as a reflection on how complex the mind is and gives a very good reason implicitly why no animals are shown with the magical abilities.

****** It's not only that. They have pretty much unlimited divination in the past and present, limited only by light levels.

Personally, both blue and green mages are fucking terrifying. A bluemage can root through your past selectively, digging up skeletons, or just sensitive info like passwords. A greenmage can inflict you with crippling agoraphobia and claustrophobia at the same time, or force you to feel disgusted at the thought of loved ones.

***** Just a note: The reason goldmages have to kill themselves after going back in time is that coexisting with their time twin costs months of their life for every minute.

*** It has an RSS feed. RSS feeds and a feed reader are straight up better than clicking a bookmark obsessively. If you care about updates to the point of checking a bookmark obsessively, you should seriously look into a feed reader. You can subscribe to feeds, then get all updates for every site you care about delivered to you.

*** Or use Comic Rocket: [[https://www.comic-rocket.com/explore/goldmage/]]

Tells you when anything you're reading updates, doesn't require RSS, just requires crawlable pages (a consistent "next" button suffices).
