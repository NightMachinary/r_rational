** Nice.

It's a rational-ish adaptation of the MCU, which goes through the stations of canon HP:MoR style: fast, out of order, and with extreme prejudice.

Toni Stark is funny, witty, and true to canon. The universe is more or less consistent, and feels like the Marvel Movies, except with more details and a somewhat stronger continuity.

One thing that bugs me is the portrayal of the western militaries and weapon manufacturing in general, as the fic seems to imply that basically every bullet that ever goes out of a factory /will/ be put in an innocent cancerous orphan's head, or, failing that, in his adorable puppy. In real life, gun traffic is a really complicated issue with lots of ugly aspects, and collateral damage is only one of them. Stark Industries weapons probably kill more dissidents in banana republics than Afghan civilians.

The thing that bothered me most, though, was how liberal everyone was about joining a super-secret terrorist group without requiring any proof of its good intentions or even having an idea of what the group does. It sort of fits Toni to do this on a whim, but I'd expect Pepper to say something about how people who send a super soldier to murder people they don't like on a regular basis, have no oversight of any kind, perform regulatory capture, shoot witnesses and won't let you see any of their leaders... aren't exactly guys you should join two weeks after you decided you hated violence.

Non-spoilers: this story was clever, funny as hell in parts, and I think it might have pulled off the "superintelligent protagonist with major wisdom failures" trope even better with HPMoR did, if only by taking more opportunities to make ironic jokes about it.

I am also quite impressed with Ozy for, [[https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/sexism-as-artistic-flaw/][after spotting a glaring missed opportunity in the Iron Man stories]], proceeding to fix it rather than just ranting about it as I would have done.

**** Assuming that the html checks out, the chapter will have links in it, exactly where you'd expect them to be. I remember one story where every mention of a character turning on music or otherwise hearing some important noise was a hyperlink to an appropriate youtube video.

You can also embed images, change font colors (and make use of a couple of different types of font), and do some other minor formatting tricks. When you add tags, the ease with which anyone can respond to anyone else's comments on a chapter and others can follow the thread of each conversation, the myriad ways to search for stories, and the overall cleanness of the site, I cannot think of a single thing that FFnet does as well as Ao3, let alone better.

I agree with you that A03 is objectively better about tags, HTML, appearance, and a bunch of other things. Most importantly, it lets you reply to comments, which is an ENORMOUS problem I have with FFN. There's two things that FFN does better, though:

1. It has a larger audience.
2. It gives better statistics.\\

AO3 will tell me how many views the story got. FFN will tell me when they happened, what countries they came from, and a whole lot more. There's something really thrilling to me about knowing that people from very far away are reading my work, so every time I see the Isle of Man, Serbia, Korea, etc, I get a tiny shot of "I need to keep doing this!"

A Nigerian serial rapist, currently under arrest, would die of a heart attack after". He hasn't rewritten it yet but he's cleared the previous one with the other chapters in a attempt to start over.

Errr, Taylor from Worm wasn't very interested in sex as far as I could tell. Emotional support and bonding/defense against the rest of the world were the goals, and just once these led to sex as almost a footnote. How is this like a male in a female's body? Isn't the standard stereotype of males that they're always interested in sex?

  Mostly from the rationality point of view.
#+end_quote

I think that when a female character in a story being rational bothers you it may be time to reevaluate some of your beliefs.

Whatever TRP inspired ideas about mating, dating, and dominance you choose to subscribe to, history does not support the idea that women cannot be rational or intelligent. Books by female authors can be indistinguishable from ones by male authors, which is strong evidence for similarity of mind and intelligence.

And all that crap about wanting to be dominated and everything that may derive from that that TRP thrives on? I find it hard to believe that evolution was so tidy when building the brain that it managed to segregate that by sex. It's in everyone, of either sex, pushed to the fore or pulled back by social circumstances or perhaps hormones, but always there underneath waiting to come out, just like the corresponding drives to dominate, whether you are male of female.

Those articles The Red Pill likes so much about how women are always teenagers or less intelligent or need to be dominated are sickening, like Nazi tracts about Jews or white supremacist rants about blacks. The fact that there is a whole lot of very weird and partially sex related dominance stuff in the human brain does not make any of the rest of that crap at all true, any more than the fact that some people have dark skin makes the white supremacists right.

TRP model of women is like a shoddy Ptolemaic model of the heavens, sometimes capable of regurgitating accurate predictions but utterly wrong about how things work.

Hey now, the Ptolemaic model was fuckin' GENIUS! While perhaps not nearly accurate enough to land a probe on Titan, it was more than sufficient to predict how some fiddly planets would move during a lifetime (perhaps with some minor recalibration). There's a reason it lasted over a millenium! Don't be dissing Ptolemy by comparing him to TRP's ramblings -- if anything, geocentrism is relatively better than whatever ("wrong") bleeding edge models psychologists/human behavioral ecologists/neuroscientists use to predict human behavior, given our lack of knowledge and predictive ability there.
