** I like it when the author assumes that I'm smart. But sometimes that means that I don't quite follow. What does Sakura think that Kakashi knows (that someone searched her notes?) and why does she think he knows it (he admit he didn't make the mess?)? Somehow she seems to believe that Kakashi knows something about her missing hours?

*** I guess it's the disadvantage of writing for the binge reader, where everything is more fresh in memory.

Basically, Kakashi told her that he didn't make a large mess of her notes. However, her notes /were/ a large mess, which means something definitely happened, and that somebody else /has/ been in her notes.

Then he proceeded to say [[http://prntscr.com/4g2g0i][this]]. Maybe it's too subtle, I don't know - it seemed... moderately straightforward to me. But then again I might be biased, since I already know what's going on.

**** Gonna be a bit of a dissenting voice here and mention that I interpreted the conversation the way you seem to be explaining it. That was actually my favorite part of the chapter, as I'm a bit of a fan of sideways speech. I hope to see more of it from sneaky, ninja-like ninja.

**** Yeah. The details that could make me conclude that Kakashi must have seen the mess weren't in my mind when I read the new chapter (or even the existance of the mess, to be honest. After all, I just thought while reading the old chapter that Kakashi made and I forgot about it).

I'm still a bit confused to be honest. Especially because it's repeatedly stated that Kakashi knew something without stating /what/ he knew.

It probably doesn't read that well if you spell out everything all the time, but, when Ino says "You're sure Kakashi knew?" does she mean "You're sure Kakashi knew someone else went through your notes?"

Because while reading, I kept wondering if it was meant that Kakashi knew about the missing hours. Which might be a very plausible guess, but not a sure deduction.

*** Sakura thinks Kakashi knows about her memory loss at graduation evening (I have trouble keeping up too, too many fics, too many story lines), and she questioned Kakashi in a roundabout manner, basically fishing for info, his response is a bit too subtle for me, but I think that's what the author wanted to express.

*** I think she's being way too cagey here. I didn't see nearly enough evidence that Kakashi knew that she was memory wiped (and probably tortured for information). If it wasn't ANBU, then it's pretty important that Kakashi knows.

** This chapter ended up delayed by two weeks because RL got rather thoroughly in the way and prevented me from writing for a time. However, now I'm back home in a stable environment and have learnt my lesson, so the schedule shouldn't suffer any more setbacks.

I will perform better in the future!

I've noticed! I'm not complaining, but I don't want you to think that your updates won't be missed, either. I've a bit of a backlog (with fanfiction in general, not your story) but I'm happy that there is a new In Fire Forged chapter, anyway.

** After reading this chapter, the specific inclusion of Ino makes me increase my belief that "a Yamanaka did it" (regarding the missing hours) to about 70%.

Really good to have you back, looking forward to seeing where this is going.

** I am having trouble keeping track of all the storylines of fics i am reading, and i can tell there is something major going on in this fic specifically, and some of it going over my head.

Besides the actual work and effort Sakura and co. are puting in their training, is there anything distinctly rational or munchkinry going on?

specific examples would be best.

*** The best answer I can give you is... not yet. I once expressed doubt about applying the [RT] tag - this kind of thing, munchkinry and so on, will eventually grow into the story. However, it is not the immediate focus. I was told that the tag probably fit fine enough, so I went with that.

A lot of rational stories tend to start out with a magically rational protagonist, who has tons of knowledge about decision theory and biases and all sorts of other things, who then proceeds to try and munchkin the universe. I'm not doing that - I'm going the long way around. It could be interesting to do, but we've already got /Lighting up the Dark/ kind of going that route, and I've got different plans.

First of all, I'm trying to portray a universe where nobody holds the Idiot Ball. If I succeed, we're going to have clever characters doing clever things, often foreshadowed as well as I can manage it. I suppose, so far it is "rationality" from a more normal, regular perspective, rather than the superhero version often portrayed around here.

I would not call Sakura a typical rational protagonist. A clever one, yes, perhaps - like Taylor in Worm - but not a HP:MoR style protagonist, or a more regular rationality junkie like Bella in Luminosity. Still, there's plenty of time for portraying character development in a realistic fashion!

I don't think anybody would be able to complain about the various munchkinry/rational themed things that will take place much later in the story, and I think my explanation for chakra and how it works and why, and so on, is moderately clever and at least fairly interesting. However, for now, the [RT] tag is tentative - though the story hopefully fits square into the main criteria given in the right sidebar:

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
- Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
- The characters solve problems through intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
- The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

**** Neat, thanks for the reply. The RT tag is just fine, worlds are allowed to be rational too. Just feel free to up the competence porn.

*** Though, in the realm of more traditionally rational/munchkin stories, I /do/ have this short story planned (no more than 2-3 chapters, at the very most), about what would happen if a munchkin Naruto actually got access to canon Shadow Clones.

Needless to say, Clone techniques work very differently in IFF.
