*** Yes, I wrote them.

  I wasn't as fond of part 5 since I couldn't really sympathize with either of the characters and I think you need to be able to sympathize with the main character in order to appreciate his bicultural attitudes... I thought at first that he punched him for a personal insult at his moms, which I would have been more sympathetic to.

You won't be getting any opposition from me. "Fighting for the Future" easily vies with "Apprehending the Future" for the title of "Author's least favorite story in the collection."

The protagonist of FftF definitely needs to learn to let some things go. There was some history that I wasn't able to adequately cover in the story, but even so he was overreacting.

** This is crazy good! Thanks for writing it, and please keep it coming! The Yeerks are such a good example of a starfish alien race, I love seeing some of the positive (or at least a more nuanced) implications of their existence explored! As with the Reckoning, I also just like spending more time in the Animorphs world.
