I enjoyed his comics for a number of years, generally able to ignore the times when his conservative Christian beliefs overrode good narrative, and willing to go with the flow when he banned me from his comics' forum. (IIRC, it was because I stated that I was helping to share the Wikileaks torrent.) Then he made the villain of one of his comics a straw-man scientist who claimed to want to prove biogenesis was possible by using a probability-manipulating device to repeat the phenomenon, without worrying about the collateral damage involved; and after spending a few moments thinking on it, I decided that his comics were no longer giving me the pleasure they once had, so deleted my RSS feeds. At the moment, I'm only subscribed to a few of his My Little Pony stories, and when those finish, that'll probably be it.

It's a bit of a shame - nobody who can get their comics on Atomic Rockets can be all bad, and he has some very interesting thoughts on death-killing in some of his MLP work - and things might change in the future, but for now, there's way too much good stuff to read, and figuring out how to filter it all is a never-ending project.

**** My opinion exactly. I'll add that he's a very good writer with absolutely no ability to manage his Internet fandom/hatedom, much like [[https://www.fimfiction.net/user/Chatoyance][another well-known MLP fanwriter with a transhumanist streak]]. I still occasionally check in on the QQ comics, but if his politics don't dull my interest soon then the lack of updates will.

Hadn't finished the story at the time I wrote the above comment. Valerie's art was the one that reminded me of RHJ, the lighting and layout especially. I'll stop talking about him now.

Damn good story. You really front-loaded the weirdness; the blue rat body and the rule against bodymodding set my expectations high, but after a while Dan started to strike me as more weird than the people around him. By the end, the world stopped being Weirdtopia and started being a new normal. Just another story set in the Liberal-Democrat Techno Furry Quasi-Utopia (flaw: privacyless). Well okay, maybe there aren't any other stories in that exact setting, but most subsets of those five traits have been on this reddit.

Point is, you got across really well Dan's initial disorientation and his eventual adaptation to the new world.

Incidentally, if you haven't read /Accelerando/ by Charles Stross, you'll love it.

And you've just nailed down pretty much the exact reason why I stopped writing where I did. Coming up with a proper weirdtopia is /hard/, and I seemed to be having troubles adding more weirdness than had been in the literal dream that inspired the whole thing.

At the moment, I'm seeing if I can get some properly decent levels of weirdness, with a cross of ideas between a Dyson swarm of bubbles, accidentally-sapient squirrels, informational immunology, anglerfish mating practices and Voltron. Not sure I've got the chops to turn it into a proper story, but it's fun trying. :)

Interesting, but don't forget the small-scale weirdness too. "Privacy/cryo nut in a robot body" is one thing, "privacy/cryo nut in a robot body /which is a blue rat skeleton/" is another. You got a lot of weirdness mileage out of Dan dealing with his small size and the various opportunities/limitations it presents.

***** I'm not sure that those three categories carve reality at the joints very well, in this case. For one example, after looking for any potentially relevant images of ostrich-taurs (there's a rule-34 corollary involved), and finding more than one by ECMajor that were of higher quality than any original images I'd likely be able to commission, I politely asked for permission to place a picture on the page (with proper credit and a link), and was kindly granted it. For another, I asked a furry writer's group which furry artists are good at shiny stuff, and Trunchbull was the first response; a lot of people who draw furry art are in financially precarious situations (ie, out of 50-100 journal posts whose titles I skim daily, I can usually count on seeing an average of one or two "emergency commission requests" asking for immediate help with funds in exchange for art), and it would be more than impolite to ask an artist to create original content without compensating them for their limited time, so that one involved a cash transaction.

If you subscribed to them on fimfiction, it's probably worth noting that (after a bit of a disagreement with the mods) he decided he was going to take all his stories and leave the site. He did leave a blog post that points at the [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/RHJunior/works][new location of his stories]], and some of them have updated since then, so you might have some new stuff ready to read...

** Is this supposed to be a one-shot (about the first week) or the first chapter of a new series?

Is the main character another author self-insert like SI was?

I just read through this and...I'm going to wait until tonight before giving feedback, to reread it and think about what I've just read. Because while this story is very dialogue heavy, it's fairly fast-paced with a lot going on (and a lot of topics such as law are unfamiliar for me to read) and at 7 in the morning with me reading this while eating breakfast, I'm pretty sure I'm not quite getting all I want to understand.

Still I loved the blue metal rat-skeleton picture. Looks very pretty and exotic.

I'm calling it a one-shot, while retaining the right to write more in the setting if I'm able to think of further ideas that do it justice.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Indeed. In fact, the whole thing is based on a dream I had a month or so ago, which I wrote out in the form of the first section; and then I kept having a few new thoughts on further details to add.

That seems to be how I prefer to write in general. But if Homestuck could get away with almost all of its text in the form of chatlogs, then this seems more of a personal quirk than an outright lapse in my writing abilities. (I've got more than my share of those to try to improve, as it is.)

I could throw in a good-sized rambling set of musings here, on the interplay between word and picture, heavily influenced by Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics" (with minor digressions into typography and converting file formats). But it's probably best that I limit myself to saying that there are at least a few advantages to standing at the intersection of [[/r/transhuman]] and [[/r/furry]] . :)

***** In other stories in the past, readers have dinged me about too much rapid-fire dialogue with insufficient other detail, so they were confused about who was saying what. Trying to help the reader keep track was a main reason why, in the second court scene, a (mostly) Canadian used 'Your Honour' while a (mostly) American used 'Your Honor'.
