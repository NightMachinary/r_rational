** Can you put a TOC somewhere on the site, or at least a link to the start of the story? I don't want to scroll through a dozen pages of "previous" in order to find it, or have to poke through a lot of calendar links.

*** If you click on the title image on any chapter, it will take you to the TOC for the story. There you can find a link to every chapter, as well as the glossary and background (summation of /HPMOR/).

***** If I find time, maybe I'll add a home button at the bottom of each chapter. Web design is not my forte.

** What's up with the people who have been rejuvenated? I don't remember that happening in HPMOR, so I'm guessing the process is "Transfigure them younger, then lock it with the Stone", right? Why do they seem to come back different, or is that just propaganda?
