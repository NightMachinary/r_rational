Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** PSA: Free weekly bites on cognitive tools.

If you recall that awesome [[http://mcntyr.com/52-concepts-cognitive-toolkit/][52 tools to add to your cognitive toolkit]] list a while back, you may be excited to hear that Peter McInyre and Jesse Avshaomov have a new thing called [[https://conceptually.org/][Conceptually]].

Conceptually sends you a new concept every week, from countersignaling to efficient markets. It looks fun!

**** Yes, I would be very happy if we got more overlap between rationalist and pedagogical spaces.

I know there are probably useful models of learning that a pragmatically-minded person could probably exploit, which would probably also be helpful in integrating these types of tools into our lives.

But for right now, it doesn't look like there are too many people in both (that I am aware of).

I'll hopefully be looking into some learning / habit things this year, so maybe some basic write-ups later on can prove useful to the general crowd.

** I try to avoid having a tribal-centered mindset and avoiding the kind of reasoning that arises from it. When I notice that applause lights are switching on purely because of the labels that are involved, I try to stamp down on it.

I'm starting to think that it might be contributing to a sense of being adrift, or of loneliness in a general way, though, and I'm not sure how to go about dealing with that.

My spiritual affiliations are...odd, at the moment. Let's just say that I can't honestly claim to use certain labels in an orthodox manner and so any other uses come off as being shallow and disingenuous. I don't feel that identifying as an American really does anything to fill that "need for tribal belonging" or whatever it ought to be called, because national identities seem pretty shallow. I'm strongly opposed to

I /did/ get a sort of "This is my place; these are my people" feeling when I was able to attend a Slate Star Codex meetup last Spring, but it's going to be a long while before I can do something like that again (best case, most of a year; worst case, years and years), and I don't know if that's actually filling that need or if it's just filling a /similar/ need that I can't recognize as separate because neither has been fulfilled more than temporarily, and I'm also kind of nervous about trying to fill that hole at all.

Some of this has to do with rituals, I think. There are spiritual rituals which don't do anything for me because I don't perceive useful meaning behind them. I mean, there's definitely meaning, but I'd have to twist it out of the original context in order to give it a meaning that conformed to reality as I understand it, and that doesn't seem to me to be the same ritual anymore, but another ritual with surface similarities.

How do I fix this? Do I just deal with it, or do I find things to be super-ultra-tribal about that just don't matter, like fandoms or something like that, or what?

*** There is nothing wrong in feeling tribal affiliation to the culture you were raised in, even if you don't believe in the dogma behind those labels. For example, I consider [[/r/rational]] as a sort of intellectual family, but I still occasionally surround myself with people from my home culture specifically to minimize the sense of isolation you mention. The best of both worlds sort of. Sorry if I am projecting my own interpretation on your issues. Hope you find contentment.

*** Hmm, is this a similar thing as finding a group of people whose ideas / beliefs you share?

It sounds like the rationalist-space/adjacent spheres have similar people who you'd click with (you mentioned SSC above).

Is it more of an in-person sort of thing? It also looks like you'd like to have more meaningful rituals that you can relate to?

Also, it sounds like you might have some tribe-related reservations?

Apologies for not offering good answers to your query, but it looks like there are a lot of things going on, and I wouldn't want to offer suggestions without enough information.

I'm not totally sure. I mean, I'm not Jewish, but my girlfriend is, and I noticed yesterday that I was starting to develop some tribalish tendencies in that direction despite, as I just said, not actually being Jewish (though I've been very fond of lots of aspects of Judaism and Jewish culture since before I met my girlfriend).

It might be an in-person thing. I haven't had much of an opportunity for in-person interactions with the aspiring!rationalist community. Hopefully I'll be able to experiment with that sooner rather than later, but that depends on whether and where I get accepted to grad school over the next few months.

Yes. I used to have some, but their meaningfulness seems tied to accepting certain ideas that I no longer subscribe to. I feel like I'd be able to do without rituals if I'd never had any to begin with, but the question is moot because I did have some and that feeling of lack is present.

***** As one small little suggestion, something like a journal or gratitude diary (if you don't already have one) could be a ritual that isn't super tied down to a belief system.

I've been writing down thoughts daily for years (so it's a ritual for me in that sense), and I've found it very helpful for getting my mind in order.

It's not much, but it might be useful? Other things in that vain ("religiously" exercising, eating certain foods on certain days, etc.) sound like ways to ritualize helpful habits.

(But that doesn't sound like exactly what you need, alas.)

*** Well brother G that's a good set of questions. I don't have any answer's but I can give you my 2cp on the topic (and you didn't even pay two bent pennies so consider the price):

Tribe: (Finding your own) This is one of those journey not destination things. It's 50/50/90(1) I'd consider you a member of my own tribe from your comments, but as you said it is easy to fall into tribal labels, and in my own opinion, fall victim to Challenger-esque levels of group-think. Look for people and venues where you can find people you enjoy, if you haven't found your calling/profession/ect. think about what fields are most likely to attract people you'd want to work with. I'm currently mostly tribe-less aside from family hours away, work, and a few friends, but I have deep tribal roots to fall back on as a military veteran, so I think I empathize, but to a lesser extent, and yes fandom IMHO are a great place to send spurious tribal drives if you keep them non-obnoxious and limit there exposure to those who do not sympathize with them. In short give your loyalty, perhaps sparingly, when you do, give it well and be willing to speak up about things that are wrong.

Rituals: find the ones that work for you. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/][Make them pay rent]] in that they are good for you.

Spirituality: Not much to add here. We are all made of starstuff; a few of Heinlein's better quotes about the value, and stupidity, of humanity come to mind but that's about it.

/end my 2 cents

(1) Navy nuclear power saying may also be common in engineering circles to the effect: if you guess against 50/50 odds you will be wrong 90% of the time. /Not rigorously accurate but emphasizing opportunities costs for guesses when more data can be acquired through interaction or, in the original setting getting deeper into the documentation/

**** Thank you for your two cents. They are gratefully received.

Regarding rituals, I think that part of the issue may be that I have a need for something that extends into the past. I'm not /entirely/ sure on this, mostly because I'm just extrapolating from "this is what other people say about the usefulness of rituals, at least sometimes" and "any ritual that I came up with on my own would feel shallow."

Though the community aspect rather than the time-bound aspect might be what's most important, since I just considered the possibility of "new ritual created by myself or a close friend and shared with that person" and, at least as I consider it now, it doesn't /seem/ to have the same quality of shallowness.

I guess that's another reason to make it to Solstice.

***** Rituals, you don't have to make them, finding the traditions that are positive for you, and not say, wearing at hat everywhere that isn't inside except when carrying a firearm or sword (aside: a military tradition where such hats are called "covers" possibly having utility keeping the sun out of a marksman's eyes but likely of older derivation) probably won't be useful for you, but to go paraphrase Heinlein and old fairy tails Never give offense unintentionally.

I'm dating myself a bit, the space shuttle.

This last week was my first week of school for Winter, and also new year's. What a show Fall was. I took way too many credits and was super demotivated/depressed now, my Best Friend lives next door and I'm on some antidepressants, which have helped a lot with some issues I've had. Due to last semester, I've dropped down to 12 credits from 17 last semester. I've got a job with one of my professors from last semester as a grader.

On the Discord server, I had a thought around something similar to the story "Everyone is Bob" from the front page a while back. Imagine that you have a Despot in modern 2017 of a reasonably-sized country that has a notable Homeless problem. The only unique thing about the country is that you have complete power over the whole country. Other than that, it's your standard faire Socialistic country of sorts. As a benevolent autocratic leader, let's say you become a full-fledged Utilitarian, and therefore make your goal to increase the overall Utility Point Output of each one of your "homeless" citizens - /no major changes to society or social structure/

You begin with your standard stuff of implementing various social programs to enlist each panhandler, mentally ill individual, and any other individual who is sleeping on the streets in a routine fashion. Perhaps you build shelters and force the homeless to move there. You can then evaluate them for their problems - normal except heavy drug use, schizophrenia, disability which makes them unable to work, etc. You begin to track these individuals. While you can't nail down each individual's UPO, you are quite certain that many of these people are decreasing the UPO of the local populace where these homeless people are residing, and so the program continues.

You try to rehabilitate as many as you believe is Utiltiy-Point Efficient, but soon you realize that no matter what you do, certain people will never be Utility-Point Neutral, let alone Utility-Point Positive, and so, for those individuals, you start to kill them off because in theory, it is impossible to bring them up to UP neutrality.

You, as the imaginary Despot, however, realize that your Utility-Point function is woefully incomplete, and figure even if the program is a failure in the long run, it was high time someone tried an honest Utility-Maximization program.

I've realized that my !Pokemon story needs to have conflicts inside of and outside of the story itself, if it's to be what I want it to be- My worldbuilding is going to encompass multiple regions, and to varying degrees of detail, long before the story takes place, and long after it takes place as well. Otherwise, I fear I'll end up into a trap of defining rules-as-I-go, and I want to nail down as many rules before the story gets going. Therefore, having a story longer than the actually published one will probably help with that quite a bit. I will world build for a multi-book series, and probably only write a short novel (45k words).
