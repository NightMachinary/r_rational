Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** time travel in stories always falls into the trap of people being stupid. what rules would encourage rational time travel?

offhand, the biggest problem tends to be one person having time travel and keeping it secret. instead, a corporate lab with a time travel device that consumes a large amount of power makes more sense. a mass (the traveller, their gear, and the time-pod) is sent through time. with enough infastructure, you could build a relay of power supplies through time to extend your range.

so, if the Time Corp has a base in a secluded part of north america, and can send things backwards or forwards for a good span of time (10 or 50 years), then they need infrastructure on the site that will still be there. so as they extend backwards, they change history... unless they move to a new base each time.

if you travel back in time, you had to set up the infastructure somewhere, and keep it running long enough to matter. if you jump in 50 year intervals, and find that the 50-years-ago base closed after 5 years, you start to look for a threat in 5 years time. 50 years forward, and you can check the records of what will have happened.

so, you can easily get a xanatos pileup of operations planning and infastructure. what rational ideas can you add to this line of thought? nuclear war in the future is not that interesting, but a yellowstone eruption would be interesting, and point to a change in base location.

*** Time machines are not something that the-powers-that-be would be fine with just existing. With something that powerful, the company should expect to become the center of a massive political conflict - one that there's no guarantee they'll win. And if they don't win, then time travel is useless for them, as whoever gets the machine in the future will have plenty of opportunities to return and ensure their own victory.

Depending on the mechanics of time travel and the motivations of the users, it could be entirely rational to keep everything hidden. Sorry, I can't explore this any further atm, I'm feeling a bit tired. I am certainly interested in any ideas this thought process leads to.

*** I always keep one time travel rule in the back of my mind:

in non-paradoxical situations that allow causality-violating closed time loops, e.g., future you arriving to insert the password to defuse the bomb that would otherwise kill present you, you have to keep in mind that your own self-awareness is the most likely element to make such a situation too probabilistically unlikely to happen instead of, you know, future you /not/ coming to save you because the bomb explodes and kills you.

In particular, imagine you are looking at the bomb-defusing terminal. If you /see/ your future self arrive, introduce the password, and defuse the bomb, then by the time it's your turn to disable it for your past self, you'll probably keep in the back of your mind all the little details about how your future self did things, like posture, timing, blinks, etc., and you'll be too likely to (even subconsciously) not to it the exact same way, and so the most likely thing to happen is that future you doesn't come to save you from the bomb.

The take-away is: if you have a time machine but currently unavaliable and are in a situation where future you could save you, position yourself in such a way that you don't notice the particulars of future you's actions (i.e. look away from where you think he'll come from and be), so that your own memories don't jeopardize the chances of him actually coming to save you. Schr√∂dinger's time-travel paradox: the best way to avoid paradoxes is to make sure they aren't obvserved.

*** With the type of time travel you're proposing, the moment the machine is turned on the Earth /at the very least/ will explode. This is because you will have created an infinite stream of events occuring in finite time, and someone is going to use the time machine to produce infinite processing power and create a misaligned AI. We know it will be misaligned because a well-aligned AI stands no chance once a misaligned one is created anywhere in the timeline or universe. It will have to dedicate resources to protecting humans which the misaligned AI will not and lose on sheer brute force every time. The only way for the time travel loops to end is to either destroy all time machines and people who could concievably create one, or to somehow precommit to using it exactly once and then destroying the machine and everyone who created it. In fact, the time traveller should do everything in their power to prevent their organization from ever having existed, while doing whatever it was they went back for.

Furthermore, everyone who creates such a machine will know that turning it on kills everyone in Earth's light cone. Including themselves. Just using the thing at all is an act of insanity, so attempting to rationalize it is impossible.

***** If you posit a time travel device which can go back in its own timeline and then go the slow way back to the future it left, the destruction of everything and everyone who could create such a thing is the only way for time to stabilize. Since everything is happening at once, for all intents and purposes, it will appear to happen everywhere and everywhen instantly. Unless the time travel has a DO NOT MESS WITH TIME clause preventing infinite processing power, it will happen by AI. Even if it doesn't, you've created mass and energy, stealing it from a future which no longer exists. Assuming people keep doing this, the mass of the universe will continue to increase until gravity pulls it all back into a black hole. This might not happen instantly, depending on how quickly mass can be created by this method, but it will happen. You might even get an AI which wants to make it happen everywhen at once, stealing mass from the end of the universe to dump it at every past point.

If you want this to not instantly destroy the universe, you have a couple of options. The easiest is to make each jump actually dump you in a parallel universe exactly like your original up to the point of your arrival. Since no time travellers will ever arrive in the same universe, none of them will Big Crunch. You could make it function as a way of viewing, but not changing, the past. You could make it work only a finite number of times per universe. You could make it work like Time Turners, with inbuilt don't-destroy-the-world protections. In fact, if time travel is possible, that's the most likely kind from the pure Bayesian observation that the universe hasn't been destroyed yet.

The reason good time travel stories are rare is because time travel is the most dangerous activity to be treated blithely in fiction.

****** Let me posit a simple time travel device which avoids these mass/energy generation issues.

I create a machine which, as part of its operation, draws in a small amount of energy and uses this to create a completely random bitstream. This is the receiver. I run it at a predetermined and well-recorded time (e.g. midnight on the first of January 2020).

I then create a second machine which uses time travel to change the bitstream generated by the first machine. I use this to manipulate the bitstream into being a sentence of recognisable English text (ASCII encoded).

In this manner, I am able to transfer information to the past /without/ transferring either mass or energy into the past.

********* With infinite processing power, someone will try to produce an AI. They will inevitably fail to keep it in the box, because they deliberately made a time traveling AI for some unknowable reason. In the near-certain chance the AI is misaligned, the Earth and possibly everything in Earth's light cone are destroyed. In this case, the destruction cannot proceed back before the first beacon was turned on, but it will occur immediately after that as the AI bootstraps itself into its past and the researchers' present.

One way to prevent this is to make sure there is only ever one active time travel device anywhere in Earth's light cone. The universe could still be destroyed if someone makes an AI on one of them, but the destruction wouldn't proceed back to the first device if it didn't have devices bridging all the intervening time. However, how can the researchers be sure they are the only ones with this tech? Not just on Earth, even, but anywhere in a backwards light cone large enough to encompass the origin of that AI and Earth? They can't.

The existence of this technology means the universe is inevitably doomed. Turning it on means, to some unknowable degree of certainty, that you are doomed. In fact, turning it on is an interesting Fermi Paradox test, as any time travelling AI will seek to find and infect your system before you do it, and if that fails to happen it means you are the only time travel team in a long distance.

********** There's another simple way to ensure that badly aligned AI doesn't corrupt your time machine. It's straightforward - keep your message size finite, and don't actually /run/ the bitstream as an executable (rather, display it as an ASCII text message of predetermined length).

************ Returning to the original question, then; assume that you have access to such a Receiver. You do not have access to a Transmitter (yet). However, on several occasions when turning on your Receiver you will receive messages from someone claiming to be a yourself from a decade or more in the future. (You sometimes also receive messages claiming to be from beings or intelligences further in the future. At least one of these further-future messages consists entirely of a link to what turns out, after careful precautions are observed, to be a youtube video of Rick Astley singing 'never gonna give you up').

Every use of the Receiver potentially changes the timeline - that is to say, every message that you receive may come from a possible future wherein your Receiver gave you something other than the message you just received. (This implies that every time you receive a message from the Future You, you can never again receive a message from the same Future You).

How could you usefully use this time machine to further your goals?

************** A very self-consistent answer. Does the answer change if the design for the Receiver is already available on the Internet, and you are therefore certain that there are multiple other Receivers in existence which malevolent future AI could use to persuade /other/ people? In this case, the existence of your Receiver provides zero additional risk over-and-above the already existing risk.

*************** If the world is that doomed-seeming and not already destroyed, it might be safe to use.

Might. I could still assume the blueprints were placed by some grandmaster plot by the AI to increase its complexity before intelligence explosion. That assumption requires a complexity penalty though. At that point I might read the messages, as any AI which can manipulate me through just reading could also probably manipulate the future just with the bitstream itself.

If the message contains code, I would ask a programmer I trust before running it on an airgapped VC miles from WiFi. If it contains instructions to do anything, I would think for at least an hour about how it could go wrong. My primary goal with my future knowledge is to acquire enough wealth to somehow destroy all the beacons, though I don't know how that would happen.

***** plus the timeline is moving forward on both ends at the same time rate. 50 years back means, if i want to send two capsules, i need energy and materials for two of them. initially i will have infastructure for one. pods returning to base will have a password and encryption (basic IT security at least), and use the best encryption availible (possibly one-time pads, provided on departure). there is no explosion, because at no time do we have infinite power to send infinite mass. instead we get information paradoxes, and consider who knew what when.

any pods in the future should know when the arrival points will be availible in the past. if an obstruction prevents transit, then either nothing happens or we suffer a failure state (energy has to go somewhere). if a failure state happens, that is a barrier to entry for new time machines from other sources.

so lets make an assumption: in the future, Dr. Science will build a time machine and travel back 50 years successfully. he then uses his knowledge to build the time company, and his successor runs the company in the future, using the next stage of time travel AFTER the original inventor moves backwards in time. to this point, the company has made most its money from knowledge from the future. the original time traveller is now either retired, or in the past, and either has terrible memory or refuses to tell some secrets.

now, we are back to 50 years in the future, and have a new reuseable time-pod. the next goal is to expand the reach of time travel, and the pod from 50 years in the future travels back to now. this is a new pod created in the future. it has a one-time pad encryption handshake using the system in place, and information from the future. now we have two pods, and one of them will move forward once it recharges (with the confrimation of its arrival). this could involve a paradox test, such as shuffling cards or rolling dice, to check for the butterfly effect.

next, a pod is sent back in time, where it is greeted by the inventor in the past. the data packet helps set up the company, with 100 years of knowledge to bootstrap with. after recharging, the pod returns with confrimation of the job completed. does this impact the timeline it returns to? or was this always part of the original timeline? everyone at the three points in time sit down and study the data for a couple of weeks.

we do get an interesting dilema- if we get no pod from the future, we instead send a pod into the future to investigate. if we find a problem, we will take action to change any bad future to one that will be able to send us data. ergo the future should send us a pod with data unless there is an unavoidable problem. in this time, new pods should arrive.
