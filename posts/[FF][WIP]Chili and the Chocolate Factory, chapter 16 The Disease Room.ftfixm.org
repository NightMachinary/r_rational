  Lim picked up Mr. Bucket with one claw and held another seven to his neck. "Her face! What did you do with her face? My scanners aren't detecting-"

  Keerthi took off her Commedia Dell'arte mask. Lim dropped Mr. Bucket and giggled.

This object permanence gag is possibly the best thing in this story so far.

I /cackled/ all throughout this chapter. I think I'm missing dimensions of the Commedia Dell'arte bit that are too highbrow for me to catch, but I'm delighted it's here all the same.

God. How was there so MUCH in just one chapter? BUCKET WENT FULL PENNYWISE FOR A SECOND THERE.

And.

OUT ON A LIM. OH MY GOD.

  "It would require a long speech, I am sure none of you want to hear it."

  "Sure," said Tide. "We can move onto the next room."

  "Fine!" yelled Mr. Bucket. "I will tell you, I will tell you! Only because you are all so insistent! Today Wonkaland makes many products! We make bombs and jeans and pollution! If we make it, with only two exceptions, we make it the best! Better than everyone else!"

  "I vape," said Mahuika.

  "Yes," he admitted. "Vapes and..."
#+end_quote

In addition to being hilarious now we know there's one other thing Wonkaland is not the best at making. Speaking of mystery plot threads, WHO WAS THE THIRD PERSON WITH WONKA AND BUCKET. And, /brined?!/ Wonka's death is being set up for an incredible +revelation+ gag, I can smell it.

If this chapter's occurrence is the full payoff of the Chopin gag, I'm fully satisfied with the course it ran.

And. And. Bucket YEETED A BABY

#+begin_quote
  "I vape," said Mahuika.

  Mr. Bucket looked at Keerthi and struck himself on the chest.

  "Yes, you do! But do it out of love, not fear. It is what Lim would have wanted."

See, this is what I'm talking about. This trope is [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint][older than God]] and it's played perfectly. It's the rhythm. Every beat lands with the maximum pop. And if anyone thinks I'm attempting to imply in any degree for a nanosecond that this work is derivative or unoriginal, I defy anyone to point to anything remotely like this story. The execution on these gags is /flawless/ and in service to something alien and beautiful and familiar and horrifying and thick and sweet and bitter and airy and crunchy and creamy and a /searing/ deconstruction and monomolecularly sharp. Razors are butterknives compared to the edge on this thing.

Ok, enough fangirling. I need to go proselytize so I can annoy my friends with how EVERY BEAT IN THIS STORY IS FUCKING PERFECT

Keerthi is doing pretty good for being on the hard mode Wonka tour. I mean if she was doing her best she would leave the factory but outside of that things could certainly be worse.

It's somehow worse that Charlie has almost completely abandoned even fake bullshit fairness than that he's trying to murder a child. If you can't stick to your awful ideology and tempt her the old fashioned way, just shoot her and be done with it.

*** It just shows how insane just-world reasoning is. Charlie doesn't see any need to adjust his behavior, because how he affects people and the deeds he performs don't matter in any moral/ethical sense.

The world is /fair/. Whatever people do, everyone will get punished and rewarded. So Keerti will get punished sooner or later, or she'll get pass every trial. He doesn't have to think about if he should kill her or not. If she's good, then he won't succeed and it doesn't matter how many times he tries.

By that same logic, it doesn't matter if he's doing anything wrong or not. As long as he's not being punished, then he must be good and every action of his is just.

Therefore, the only way that Charlie will ever realize that he's doing something wrong is if he's punished. [[/u/Nic_Cage_DM][u/Nic_Cage_DM]] Your theory that Chetan is getting warped when the "use his insecurities against him" line comes up is incorrect. Chetan recognizes punishment is the only 'good' thing that people can do for Charlie at this point and the only punishment the children can reasonably carry out is psychological warfare.

** I theorize that the location Wonka never could get to is the White House because Ronald Dahl never wrote the third book /Charlie and the White House/.

The less than five people in the world who knows about the place could be a reference to how there was only a few characters from /Charlie and the Glass Elevator/ who came from the White House. The [[https://roalddahl.fandom.com/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Great_Glass_Elevator][wiki]] mentions President Lancelot R. Gilligrass, Vice President Elvira Tibbs, and the president's best friend as being from the White House who met Charlie.

Or it's just an attempt to go faster than light with pickle-based fuel to get to the Knid's home planet.

Another theory is that all of the pickles reference is to do with the Knids somehow.

  He pointed with his cane to a statue in the middle of the room. It was black and mostly featureless as far as Keerthi saw from a glance, aside from the face, which resembled an old man's.

  [...]

  "You said there was not a person in there," said Lim.

  "There is not! There were people in there."

  "People?" asked Keerthi. She ran around to the other side of the statue and looked closely at the sections where the wires fed into it. There were frozen faces burnt into the torso and back of the body, five in total. Two men, three women.
#+end_quote

The way I read this, Grandpa Joe is the main statue's face, the other two male faces are Mr. Bucket and Grandpa George, and the female faces are Mrs. Bucket, Grandma Josephine, and Grandma Georgina.

My reading is that Mr. Bucket's fatal flaw was enabling Grandpa Joe's laziness and expensive tobacco habit at Charlie's expense (after all, /somebody/ was *actively* buying all that tobacco instead of the occasional chocolate bar or chicken dinner, and it certainly wasn't a grandparent.)

** So. Any thoughts on the remaining kids' fatal flaws?

- Juror's was his laces.
- Chili's was his, ah, gluttony.
- Lim's was his love for Chopin music.

Now, Bucket has been trying to murder Keerthi a few times (in a way very similar to how Chili behaved, I might add), but it never seemed linked to a "flaw"; it's just him saying "murder everyone in this room whose name starts with K".

Although he mentions wanting her to befriend the things he sends to kill her, so maybe he thinks friendship is her fatal flaw?

Mahuika already went through the vape room and nothing happened, so I don't really see what could be in store for her. Some kind of test where you need vocabulary to win? A password that doesn't include the word "vape"?

*** I think the fatal flaws are based off of what gave the kids their golden tickets in the first place, the thing they love the most.

- Juror was incompleteness, so Charlie got him with his shoe laces. (But if I remember right he never tied them because his parents were never there to teach him)

- Chilli's was food, and I think his was more blatant because Charlie had just failed to kill Mahuika. (We know the real reason he "loves" food is his horrible childhood.)

- Lim loved Chopin. (He was also still a baby, who had never had to give up anything important to him, let alone the music he's likely been listening to non-stop since he discovered it.)

- Keerthi's is, of course, that she's a perfectly well-adjusted person, which Charlie can't seem to get a handle on.

Given the pattern,

- Tide's is the ocean and its creatures, which may be where we're headed now. I can't quite recall her family issues, but I think she was abandoned by her parents and raised by the sea?

Mahuika does have another, bigger weakness: No vaping. Where she either gets eliminated, gets saved, or (best outcome) she stops vaping and blows everyone's minds with her advanced grasp of delayed gratification.

As the Oompa Loompas say in the original, it's all the parents fault.

Does anyone else feel the "fuel" might be child sacrifices? Charlie says they'll be patched up, but so far he's killed them all first. Although he's also said the whole point of this was for a "gag". Acronym? Play on words? Just doing this for kicks?
