Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Suppose quantum immortality is true. Does this make buying lottery tickets a good form of alternative-self care, in your opinion¿

*** Short answer: no.

Every action you take is to maximise the probabilistic benefit to all of your future selves, and winning a lottery will only benefit a vanishingly small proportion of your future selves, while costing all of the others. The net effect is still negative. In general, considerations based on quantum immortality should produce the same results as classical probability theory. The only difference is if you pre-commit to killing yourself in unfavorable situations, with the confidence that other versions of yourself will succeed.

** Sorry, does anyone remember that short story about a guy who could send himself data from the future? IIRC he received a file of the perfect movie by searching the whole possibility space at once and became a star director, and (even bigger spoiler) the story ended with him fucking over past!Himself because he'd explored a path that induced paranoia.

** I saw Sam Harris at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you're doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don't even think that's a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

*** ...ouch...

I am so sorry you had to deal with a sterling example of the ways people can be assholes and I feel even worse for the poor checkout girl.

Just keep in mind that no matter who comes up with new ideas or research, their personality in no way should matter in regards to the information shared with the world. So I hope this horrid experience doesn't affect your perception of Harris' work.

/empathic hug! :)/

****** Whelp! Looks like I fell for something pretty amusing.

Don't worry, I'm not upset at all! I'm used to being pranked. I work at a job with coworkers who love to be extremely sarcastic and play some goofy pranks. 9_9

It's kinda funny rereading my reaction. I was diving in headfirst to reassure the basic faith in humanity's goodness. Ah well, I don't regret anything I said.

***** You think I just posted a copy of something written elsewhere?

Can you please provide a link to where anything similar to what I wrote exists? Because I came up with what I wrote on the spot and being accused of plagiarism is mildly insulting.

EDIT: Whelp! Looks like I've been pranked! Sorry about getting a little snippy with you. I thought you were referring to what I wrote instead of the top-level comment. I'm a little sensitive to being accused of plagiarism due to some unfair incidents when I was younger. So I jumped to conclusions prematurely.

At least it was an funny joke instead of people being assholes.

****** I am so glad I was a jerk who put copypasta on this thread because your reaction is so innocent and pure, like you think it's more likely that someone would accuse your kind response of being copypasta than it is that maybe Sam Harris didn't worry about "electrical infetterence"

I know right? I really should have noticed something silly going on with that phrase. It should have been a blindingly obvious clue.

***** I've only read one book by him a while ago, [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G1SRB6Q/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i3][Lying]], which was moderately enlightening about the psychology of lying and just how much of a difference it makes to just tell the truth. I'm a lot more truthful after reading than before it. I would tell little white lies, but now if I'm tempted to lie, I either just don't say anything or force myself to verbally admit a painful truth or two to others. Usually things work out better than I would expect when I'm actually truthful about some bad mistakes of mine.

Of course, I'm utterly disappointed in hearing that Harris tried to steal a freaking candy bar which is completely at odds with my perception of an author who wrote something like Lying.

EDIT: Turns out it was a joke and the incident with Harris never happened. I really need to work on my rationality-fu some more to better suss out pranksters.
