** Oh yay, I'm glad I found this subreddit. Seems like the perfect place for something I wanted to bring up. I don't know if anyone else noticed it, but here I go...

Over the couple of re-reads I did during the wait for a new chapter, there was one off-hand comment that really interested me. In chapter 17, as the matriarch explained what being "Open" meant to Zorian, she mentioned that one of the characteristics was having "an occasional prophetic dream".

On the next re-read, I noticed there /was/ one instance where Zorian's dreams had been mentioned: in chapter 5, just after Zorian restarts for the first time, where though he speculates that he was just dreaming, he reasons that his dreams were usually bizarre and fleeting and that the memories he got from his previous live-through of the month had "no talking birds, floating pyramids, three-eyed wolves and other surreal scenes his dreams usually contained".

Hmm...

Chapter 28: when Silverlake starts a conversation with him, "the source of the speech was the raven perched on a nearby branch".

Chapter 38: during another of Xvim's sessions, one of the shapes that Zorian was ordered to make out of the mass of marbles he had to levitate was a pyramid.

I think we can assume that there'll be a three-eyed wolf sometime in the future? Possibly the Silver One/the sapient alpha wolf guarding Iasku Mansion?

*** There is a light novel series called [[http://myanimelist.net/manga/55215/Utsuro_no_Hako_to_Zero_no_Maria][Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria (The Empty Box and the Zeroth Maria)]] which may interest you. The first volume deals with a time loop, and it's a mystery. The time loop is excessively long, and in an interesting twist the main character has what I guess would be the equivalent of Alzheimer's and the amount he remembers from the loops varies, sometimes just faint feelings of Déjà vu.

#+begin_quote
  Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria, tells the sinister story of Kazuki Hoshino, who is almost madly attached to his everyday life, and his antagonist Aya Otonashi, who suddenly transfers into his class---for the 13,118th time. She majestically announces to "break" him, without paying heed to anyone else around them.

  This is but the start of a dark roller coaster ride that turns the two against themselves, the people around them and the one who may be god. Read on as their relationship slowly changes and they go against their most basic values in their struggle against the world itself.

** So, it seems we will get time loop explanation relatively soon.

My favourite theory is a primordial prison failsafe.

The loop probably started at summer festival, because we now know that dormitories (with original Zorian inside) are not destroyed without RR interference. The loop probably goes for a short time in the host world with great time dilation for the guest world.

Zach might be the original sacrifice, and prison is configured to select it, because sacrifice restrictions filter out unsuitable heroes. His marker probably has higher privileges as well.

The endstory bossfight might get quite big.

*** I kind of like this theory. But i think that Zorian's marker was more of an accident by the result of the failsafe. Xvim also seems linked to this. Maybe the reason he's asking all these unreasonable manipulation tasks is to weed out the time traveler and assist him/her on his quest. Surely he doesn't know who has the marker in the first place, so this is the method he uses.

#+begin_quote
  "Tell me," he asked. "What do you know about shifters?"

  "That they're people who have the ability to turn into animals?" Zorian tried.

  "Shifters are people with two souls," Vani said. "Long in the past, the ancestors of the shifters enacted rituals that fused their souls with the souls of their chosen animals, allowing them to take the forms of the animal in question and even access some of the abilities of said animals in their human form. It is a very old form of magic that predates the Ikosian invasion of Altazia, and I'm sad to say that most shifter tribes have lost the knowledge of the original rituals they used to create their kind. These days, they grow in numbers purely through mundane reproduction, with children of shifters inheriting their parent's dual soul. There exist, however, tribes that retain the knowledge of ritual magic and soul mechanics necessary to perform the ritual in the modern age. While the purpose of such expertise is to turn regular humans into new members of the tribe, it may very well be general enough to help you with you issue."

1. If Zach hung around in that loop he could go use mind magic to extract the information, because Zach learned it was Zorian at the end of the soul kill loop.
2. If he did an investigation he could have found out who was missing in that loop.

If Daimen was RR and found out he was fighting with his brother, do you think he'd leave the city alone?

***** For the first point, it would depend on the actions of Zach. When RR encountered Zorian at the beginning of the loop, he was surprised since he believed the loopers were the aranea. Even if he thought he got everything from Zach, he'd still try to interrogate him again. And don't forget, thought and memory reading is imperfect and slow, especially for deep memories. He only got the surface thoughts on the night of the soul kill.

So it would depend on whether Zach went looking for Zorian at school in that loop, or immediately went into hiding.

** Remembering how good this series is I decided to re-read it, and I was struck by the fragments of the message left behind by the matriarch in Chapter 26:

[Missing] ...mean things went awry. I know you think I had it coming by rushing into this but... [Missing] ...simple: the time loop is degrading. I can't tell how long it will be before... [Missing] ...can leave at any time. Thus, stopping him was... [Missing] ...can only ever be one winner in this game. I am truly... [Missing] ...hope it won't be necessary, but just in case I put in a map to... [Missing] ...whole other continent. I didn't think it was possible, even with the help of... [Missing]

A few key points that don't seem to be fully addressed: The matriarch clearly tells Zorian that the time loop is degrading, and his time is limited, yet it still seems like there is all the time in the world. It just seems like things could go on, without end... Additionally the one winner part seems rather important, as do other bits, yet Zorian seems to dismiss it all far too casually. (This is all just my opinion, of course.)

  "The Sovereign Gate is an artifact supposedly dating back from his time," Alanic said. "Like many great rulers, Shutur-Tarana has a great many fanciful stories and grandiose claims associated with him, and this particular one claims he either made or found a doorway into another world. Having found he did not age at all while on the other side, he spent '11 lifetimes' there, learning their secrets and honing his skills. Eventually, he grew homesick and decided to go back home. Once he was back in his own world, however, he found the doors forever barred to him. He stored the Sovereign Gate in his royal vault, there to wait for a worthy successor who would repeat his feat and usher the empire in a new age with the wisdom gained from the other side. Or, well, resurrect it... since it is thoroughly dead at this point."
#+end_quote

Yeah, but even if it's degrading, if it originally lasted 11 lifetimes like in the Sovereign's Gate story, it's probably still got a good bit of energy left, even considering that it's probably doing triple duty now. (Which is just one theory about the origin of the time loop, but an interesting one.)

The part I found most interesting was the "can leave at any time. Thus, stopping him was". I'm assuming "him" is Red Robe, and that he can leave the time loop at any time, but the Matriarch might have just been referring to him leaving the city and cutting his losses if he knew he'd get interference there.

The strangest part to me is the last line, which mentions a "whole other continent" we've had almost no mention or interaction with another continent besides Zorian's parents vacationing to where his oldest brother is.
