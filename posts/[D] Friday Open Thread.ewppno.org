Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** So, The Good Place, the NBC series known as a philosophical Parks & Rec, is finally over.

It's not rare when I feel disappointed with the finale to a long running network show, but it is when they fuck it up so hard that I can call it immoral. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD.

The deathism in the previous episode, but jacked up to eleven. Characters choosing to kill themselves and both the narrative and other characters praising them for it. Fucking contemplative music as you watch a very dumb character who's known for making bad decisions through no moral fault of his own willingly obliterating himself, with no one allowed to disagree with him. People being called /selfish/ for trying to stop the process. The Bad Place somehow still existing, but only for "really bad people", which really shouldn't work by the rules of the show unless there is something like evil genes or evil brains, in which case is it even fair to punish them??? Objections to the Death Gate being conveniently ignored even when they were brought up in previous episodes. Pointless mysticism about "becoming one with the world" even though they're in a completely different metaphysical realm, or "not knowing what happens" even though they're the ones who designed the gate

I am angry. Angry about finales. Most of this came from the previous episode, but they just really, really went all in with it, huh.

It would have been really hard to write a satisfying finale with the constraints they have, but people have come up with some ideas I would have found better, like a choose-your-own-finale style final season, with a few possible solutions to the problem based on different philosophies, and the viewers choosing the heaven they agree with the most.

I guess that's too experimental for network television, though. In retrospect, it was probably a mistake to rely on solving a nigh unsolvable real life problem as the main draw of your show's final season.

What do you guys think?

*** I also haven't watched these last few episodes, so I won't read or respond to your post, but will share my main annoyance about the first season -- not a one of the human characters, upon being confronted by the existence of a bottomless pit of suffering right next door full of all manner hellacious tortures and infinite agonies and whatever tries to question the overall rectitude of the system. At least not until later on when they realize that their own heaven's a sham and "undeserving" people (like themselves) actually end up in hell, and there but for the grace of Michael's experiment they'd have gone too. It just puts me in mind of all those quotes about how "[[https://www.trivia-library.com/c/history-of-afterlife-in-different-religions-islam.htm][true believers, lying on couches in Paradise, will see the damned suffer and laugh at them scornfully]]" or how "[[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5tt2NOwR7kC&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=The+elect+will+behold+the+torture+of+the+impious+and+as+they+see+them+they+will+not+grieve.+Their+minds+will+be+sated+with+joy+as+they+gaze+on+the+unspeakable+anguish+of+the+impious,+returning+thanks+for+their+own+freedom.&source=bl&ots=OiNncLaT6_&sig=ACfU3U1PsrRt7hmC81hiPo8NkD9NinG49Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS_Z_Pu67nAhVzCTQIHU__A68Q6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20elect%20will%20behold%20the%20torture%20of%20the%20impious%20and%20as%20they%20see%20them%20they%20will%20not%20grieve.%20Their%20minds%20will%20be%20sated%20with%20joy%20as%20they%20gaze%20on%20the%20unspeakable%20anguish%20of%20the%20impious%2C%20returning%20thanks%20for%20their%20own%20freedom.&f=false][the elect will behold the torture of the impious and as they see them they will not grieve.

We will see the terror on their faces. We will hear their screams and cries of agony. Yet, we will not shed a tear. Indeed, we will give our vote that you be condemned. And when you are cast into hell, we will shout "Amen! Alleluia!]]"

Like, it just seems like such a disgustingly callous and evil position to take. I can maybe see most of the humans just DGAFing their way through, and maybe Chidi holds some ethics that think infinite torture a commensurate response to whatever earthly crimes, but why doesn't he ever question why no moralists who ascribe undesirability to suffering don't call Janet up and have her teleport some sort of anti-hell omnibomb into its deepest reaches? Or at least clarify more thoroughly how the system works? I recall them playing lots of tortures for laughs in the "those rascally demons!" vein and I guess it just made it harder for me to sympathize with characters so full of apathetic self-centeredness.

It just takes its sweet time doing so, all four seasons, probably to ease the viewers into it, even the ones who might be too much in the habit of thinking it a right punishment. It's pretty sneaky, in its own way. But at the end they basically abolish Hell altogether.

*** As a long-time fan of the show, the finale left me feeling really deflated, in part because there were so many arguments and statements that seemed so flat to me. In particular, Elanor bemoaning that all her friends have left or gone to do their own thing, as though she's gone for several eternities and never made any new friends, having been sustained only by friendships that she made at the relative beginning of her eternal existence. Similarly, I get why, as a finale, you wouldn't want to introduce many new characters, but everyone is so stuck in their Earth ways, and a lot of the exploration and advancement is left unspoken, making it seem like Earth was basically all there was.

Where are you getting this from? The new system is that people get placed in a morally challenging neighbourhood where they are tested, assessed and lead towards becoming more moral people. At the end if they have earned enough points they go to the good place. If they haven't then they get a lecture on what they did wrong, their conscious knowledge is reset (though the subconscious effects of the lessons learner are retained) and they go through the system again and again untill they are good enough for the Good place.

My only real issue with it is that using mind control to change their personality would be more efficient and have the same effect. Also why you need to make sure everybody in the good afterlife are nice when there is Janet magic and nobody has to interact with anyone they wouldn't want to interact with.

What multiple solutions are you looking at? I think there is really only 2.

1. Allowing people to (eventually) end their story
2. Putting them into a infinite loop by altering them so they enjoy going through the motions

No 2 regardless of the method used (changing to inhuman psychology, memory resets, drugs and so on) is effectively wireheading.

I also don't think people taking many kalpa (or however long a beremy Jeremy is) to exhaust all the meaningful fun in a Janet heaven environment they can possibly have is very deathist. (Aside from an all inclusive paradise afterlife actually being real is a reason to commit suicide).

The reason they don't know what happens is that they deliberately removed that information and related memories from their minds after the thing was built.

This seems like it would have a high risk of "[[https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Project_T.A.H.I.T.I.][Tahiti]] is a magical place" from Agents of SHIELD.

For anyone unfamiliar with the reference but not wanting in-depth spoilers, in the first Avengers movie, a character is seemingly killed off, but that character is alive again for the later SHIELD TV show. When asked about the place where he recovered from his injury (Tahiti), he compulsively replies, "It's a magical place." Of course, the compulsion eventually makes him suspicious and he tracks down the truth of how he survived his injury.

And that's what I'd be worried about with a personality overwrite. If the "good" personality doesn't match the person's memories, it could lead to some serious dysphoria.

On the other hand, if you change the memories /and/ the personality... isn't that just plain murder, by replacing a person with a different person created out of whole cloth to meet the necessary specifications? Inspired, perhaps, by the original, but not really a continuation of that person?

While guided progression towards a certain minimal moral standard certainly has its drawbacks in terms of how time-consuming and repetitive it would necessarily be, I really can't think of a better option that would result in a sane person who is meaningfully the same person you started with.

I'm not sure that'd necessarily be any better than personality reprogramming, in terms of feeling like your personality matches your memories of yourself. I mean, if your "cycle" starts in early childhood, then sure (even though that's getting back into "murder" territory), but if it's a reset from a point in adulthood, I think you'd at least want to leave a faint, deja-vu-esque or dreamlike memory of the events which led you to your adopting an "improved" personality. Otherwise, if my behavior and personality suddenly changed for no good reason and I noticed it, I'd be concerned about mental illness, if not outright dementia.

******* They do have some sort of subconscious effect, or they wouldn't improve over cycles. And I think they might recover all the memories at the end, when they pass the test; the mind wipe is just to make sure they don't simply learn how to "cheat" past it, but sincerely understand its point.

To clarify, these tests are basically you being put in situations that would make your flaws most apparent, and learning to control them. For example if prone to ire you might have to face someone annoying taunting you and act maturely, etc.

**** I don't have the episode available right now, but I'm fairly certain they say that if someone never gets better, they go to the Bad Place, which is one of the reasons Shawn agrees to the plan in the first place, because he's still getting SOME people.

The deathist part is not just about them dying, but the fact they glorify it by saying life has no meaning without it. Come on, you can disagree with me on the details but it was pretty clear.

I did miss what your final paragraph says, but that is even worse. Why did a show about philosophy rely on erasing knowledge?

**** Thanks - I really enjoyed the finale for the reasons you stated and also wanted to add a few other things:

- It was very true to the characters and honoured them, which I really enjoy in finales of long-running shows.

- People are complaining that all the characters go through the door but Tahani becomes an achitect and we never see her Die For Realsies.. I think that shows that For someone like Tahani, who is accomplished and has ambition/etc, Erasure might never actually be on the table.

I like that. I think not everyone is "like us", not everyone wants to have the most optimal life, and we need to be more sympathetic and do less sneering at the "lesser people". I think so many of us grew up as nerds who were ostracised so we start "looking down" on the jocks when we reach adulthood, but we should really all try and get along like the grown ups we are.

*** I don't think the Bad Place still exists, everyone goes through the testing process, even Hitler, it just might take forever for them to clear it. I too think that the celebration of ending oneself is actually kind of myopic - mostly because it relies on such human, material concerns like "getting bored" - why would an eternal disembodied soul get bored? What it'll get, addicted to the dopamine /it doesn't freaking have/? But on the other hand, even eternal bliss would be just a very gilded cage without an option to just /quit/. So I think it was right to provide that. Still the most reasonable approach would have been to also reintroduce small levels of strife in the Good Place and turn down the "happy all the time" dial a few notches.

Meena is good at small talk, since there's lots of small talk to train on. So if you're letting her lead the conversation, she'll ask lots of easy questions and give decent follow-up. She's much worse at conversations about niche things, particularly situations invented during the conversation, and she'll forget things like names in fairly short order.

** I'm looking for a (short) story I only vaguely remember. It's basic premise was our reality was a simulation and one day the admins thanked us for our contributions, said they'd naturally keep the simulation running for humane reasons, but shut down / pause various subsystems to conserve calculating power. One of these subsystem was weather, which continued at whichever setting it was currently locally (sunny, stormy, cloudy, ...), another was erosion, which simply stopped. The main characters then started to explore, I think? And the story ended on them discovering a shortcut between two places, like clipping through reality.

An image that stuck in my head with this story was how the shortcut tunnel the MCs walked through had trees growing at all kinds of odd angles, as if someone had disabled collision detection and gravity while placing them.

Also, since I listened to the whole Escape Pod archive at some point (and still listen to it semi-regularly) it might be on there, but I can't find it.

** Still working on [[http://noisyowl.com/spacetrains/spacetrains.html][Space Trains]]. I've started in on endgame material; you can solve the AI Value Alignment Problem now, though most people choose a substantially sillier victory option.

I could use feedback on how well-balanced the tech tree choices are, especially if you attempt to play without bonuses from special planets.

Brief tutorial: Click a planet to choose a project. It provides one of the thing to the right of the arrow to each planet within range. It needs a group of things to the left of the arrow, each comma-separated group increases the range by one. Range is measured in hops (that n-shaped arrow) - how many planets away the resource travels. That symbol universities use is whatever resource the planet gets the most of.

Edit: Is anyone here a train nerd? I'm putting real train graphics in, need to pick a template for the locomotive, probably some sort of steam engine. Is there some sort of iconic design I should use? I'm terrified of getting [[https://twitter.com/BisTheFairy/status/1192557730709622790][mocked by some sort of train nerd]].

*** Alien artichokes seems questionable. It's a lousy robotic farm, and later techs are better for food supply anyway. I guess you could argue that it reduces the need for massed humans? Except that getting a pair of organics without "hunt" (which reintroduces the mass human problem) requires "breed"--kinda rare, only on swamps I think?

Tier 2... Primitive tech is a neat trick, but the others have significantly more flexibility. More planet types to use on, and more options for those planets. On the other hand, the other two are practically obsoleted if you get terraforming later. I'd still favor buffing PT I think? I haven't played enough games with each to get a a hands on feel though.

Tier 3... So, for second tier /products/, I think the minimum chain goes meds->insight->energy->silicon->spaceships (terran->swamp->mineral->factory->spaaaaaace). Since spaceships are a big deal (can't use cloud/gas/ice planets without them), I favor energy. Space stoicism theoretically lets you put up tier 2 without industry. In practice, maxing human planets requires consumer goods, which means you build an entire industry setup anyway. Was awfully useful for insight/science chakras once. Now that you need tier 3 for chakras (and so have to max your tier 2s), I think I prefer gas mining, if I'm not strapped for minerals. I can certainly see situations where I'd want it though. Alien meds feel like more of a last resort, even with the extra planet type. I can frequently use more insight or energy for producing stuff. Extra meds? Total junk.

Tier 4... Distance stuff. Um, I think this depends heavily on your setup at this point. I'm usually moving lots of industry, soooo. Interstellograms stuff feels less impressive, extra range or not, but I'll see how it works for tier 2/3 before judging.

Tier 5... Again, I go industry most of the time, and I have tons of factories, so planetary supercomputer really doesn't do it for me. Shiny silicon has been my go-to choice. It leaves more mineral planets for energy anyway, making the less energy use look bad, but I haven't tried that one much, so I dunno. Without shiny silicon I tend to have problems getting enough gems.

Tier 6... Terraforming is amazing, no question about it. One type of field to a factory is crud in comparison... Except that if you didn't get wormholes/asteroid farming, asteroid fields are literally useless, and not having a gap is a large boon. I've had it be the better choice more than once, but I think I'd still try to buff space factories a bit somehow.

Fewer opinions about tier 7. I tend to go with fusors so I'm not blowing a second tier good on bootstrapping my third tier. Factories have enough outputs that they tend to not have a ton of spare capacity even with the number I build. Superconducting supermetals is problematic in that mineral planets don't HAVE a different tier three good to produce. IIRC planets that produce the same type twice don't fill two bars? Could be misremembering. Doesn't matter because you don't need that much unobtanium anyway. The remaining one might be okay, especially for chakras. I haven't tried it.

Spaceyards is good for getting that last damn resource wherever it needs to be. Particularly for the AI project, where you'll put together an entire planet cluster for that last good, if you must. Also, if you still don't have use for asteroid fields. Either of those would make it the ideal pick in some games, so it's fine. Extra range on spaceship built goods: It's not bad? Unlike the others, you don't have to build anything to take advantage of it. I dearly love the last one. Whether or not it's a good mechanical choice, the extra long paths are just cool.

Endgame... Totally depends on gas giant placement (and if you remembered to save the well connected gas giant in the middle of your setup for later use). Either can be easier, depending.

I haven't been examining planet type tech pick interactions (particularly volcano/ice/coral) much. I know it's possible to be unable to use some into endgame, with the wrong picks. The interactions probably matter a fair bit, and I'm ignoring them, so.... I will note that the simple heavy industry path synergizes well with itself. It's my favorite path.

Take all my opinions with much salt. I've spent far too much time on this game (love it, btw), but not actually enough to be confident in how my balance assessments work in practice. Would take several games with any given tech. >_<

**** Wheee, long feedback! Thanks for spending the effort testing so much and typing everything up. Changes will show up next upload, which is delayed behind a different exciting change.

Alien Artichokes - I think you're right. Not sure how I'll buff it yet. Ideas are having it also provide organics (may be way too strong), expanding the planet list (steps on Hardy Humans's toes a bit), or using humans (also steps on Hardy Humans).

Primitive Tech - Added Terran and Dark planets, made the level 3 requirement tech instead of bots.

Tier 3 - I find myself picking gas > stoicism > meds too. I'm nerfing gas to require laser drills at level 3 (making it the only bootstrap to require a tier 2 resource). Going to try spaceships instead of meds.

Tier 4 - I think Interstellargrams is the weakest, but bumping that range number up makes a huge difference, so I just did some more of that.

Tier 5 - Nerfing Shiny Silicon by adding a third gas requirement.

Tier 6 - Interestingly, I almost always pick space factories. So it sounds like this one is fine. I also need to get around to making the third tech for this tier. The plan is to turn a gas giant into a star that provides a wildcard resource.

Tier 7 - Moved superconducting supermetals to asteroid/volcanic.

Undo would require saving the entire game state, which would in turn require me not to do certain gross javascripty things like patching the constants file with research. These are the same cleanups I need to do for saving, replays, and seeds, so they'll happen. But I don't consider these things to be on the critical path to launch.

My monetization plan is to sell it. It'll be $10 on Itch in a couple weeks, then various other platforms as I jump through their hoops.

****** Actions aren't reversible! For example, take two jungle planets with "Hunt" four hops apart, with range three, missing the last unit of organics. Add a new planet with organics, upgrading their ranges to four. Now naively undo that last planet - the two original planets are able to keep eachother upgraded, even though they weren't before. (This is also why I don't have any tier 2 or 3 planet transformations, btw.)

My options for implementing undo, then:

- Compile a patch of changes made each turn. This is far fiddlier than it sounds, unless you're able to snapshot the entire gamestate, then you can automatically compute the patch.

- Construct a replay with the initial random seed and the list of clicks, then replay from the start to the previous turn. I expect this would be really slow unless I can snapshot every several turns - the initial generation process is fairly slow, and the individual turn calculations are enough that multiplying them by a few hundred would hurt.

- Save a snapshot each turn in a big old array.

As you can see, all of these need the ability to save the game state, even if I'm not storing them in a big ol' array.

The only symbols that aren't interchangeable are hops, which represent range (in planets), wildcard (circled ?) that represents any consistent resource, and research, which is a normal resource but is also globally counted. Otherwise there's only one reference in the game to what the symbols are "supposed to" be, and I'm considering finding a way to remove it. Largely because I enjoy hearing what people decide to name them.

A quickplay guide would be good, but I consider that sort of thing to be the last thing that should be added to a game. It's more important to improve the visual treatment to explain as much as possible on its own, and a text guide dulls the need for it.

** So I'm TAing a lab right now and it's one I'm quite familiar with (having TA'd it 3X and taught the class 3X more). Since very little prepwork is required on my part, I've decided to have some fun by polling students for attendance. So I'll spin a short, 30s story of how they've been accepted to the [PUN] Academy of Spellcraft and Sorcery and need to choose a major via [[https://i.imgur.com/dcC3vdQ.jpg][sorting beret]], or how they've been pressganged into an international dog-fighting ring and have been offered a choice of fire, water, or grass "starter" dogs, etc. (there are generally funny photoshopped pictures of the instructors / TA's, which I'll avoid reposting here for privacy reasons).

1. Are my stone tool powers balanced? They're all supposed to be college coursework themed.

2. What other quick, classic, pop-culture-y choices would be accessible to today's typical American college student? Some ones I've thought of so far (these in addition to more academic questions):

She does become very powerful (in fact, "meh I can take her", people underestimating her and losing, became a running joke in the fandom), but the threats also escalate a lot, so she continues to "barely come out alive".

*** Plot twist, it /was/!

Double plot twist, it wasn't actually the full ending, there's probably an epilogue coming later down the line.

Considered posting this to the subreddit proper but it's really rational non-fiction, rather than fiction. This is a very interesting look into the fake martial arts - both those who claim to have mystical martial arts powers and more borderline claims concerning comparisons between MMA and traditional Chinese martial arts.

Also, the video narrator is Irish and has a voice like velvet poetry, so there's that too.
