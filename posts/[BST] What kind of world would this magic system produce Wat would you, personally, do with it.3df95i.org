[EDIT: argh, /what/ would you do with it?]

Medieval-eque tech level, but with widespread crystal-based magic items.

- Self-contained fireball spells, a bit worse than modern-era guns and bombs in terms of aim, firepower etc.
- Magical blades capable of cutting through most materials on a solid hit.
- Teleport spells capable of zapping a vehicle moving above a certain speed (relative to the Earth, lower speeds are harder to pull off) to an empty area roughly near a specified location anywhere in the world.
- Magical Uploads, which can be copied and "reset" fairly easily by anyone in physical contact with them. Uploads can control other magic items they are in contact with, and project basic illusions (not sophisticated enough to fool human eyes, but enough to communicate.)
- "Golem" limbs and body-parts, based on a human or animal model.

Magic items will run essentially forever, although they're not self-repairing (unless you build in an upload who knows how to repair them.) They don't require any kind of power, thermodynamics be damned.

There is another kind of magic; bloodline magic, which is hereditary and fairly broken (mind control, telekenesis, mind-reading, precognition, self-focused biokenesis, and increased aptitude with crystal magic.) But it severely increases susceptibility to mental illness, to the point where it's extremely rare beyond a level so low that it could be mistaken for luck/skill. Bloodline magic is not passed on to any uploads you create, and there is no known way to induce it beyond selective breeding.

In addition, there is a well-known and widespread (albeit mildly expensive) plant poultice capable of curing most injuries and diseases, although it cannot regrow amputated or sufficiently damaged body parts.

The creation of magical perpetual motion machines is energetically favored, and there is a half-life-per-cubic-centimeter rate at which space spontaneously becomes transformed into magical suns. Once created, they release energy into the regions around them which, while subject to the inverse square law, still provide energy to use to accelerate the process in the surrounding space since it has a higher energy density to use to spontaneously cause the transformation.

Your universe catches on magical fire and burns down immediately because you made hard vacuum flammable and the kindling point absolute zero. In the next one, don't damn thermodynamics.

** How is anyone still alive to teach or learn this stuff? Even if you assume people doing any magic at all aren't immediately killed by a political or religious inquisition, magic based on items does not result in a happy world full of daring adventurers. It means control is possible, and /will happen/. Brutally, totally, crushing all opposition. It won't even be interesting if, like demonstrated here, the effects aren't much better than throwing a bunch of people at any problem. Powerful people already have a bunch of people to order around, and they won't let commoners get that sort of power. They'll kill them and ban magic first.

Crystals (not just magic ones) are made illegal a day after crystal magic is first demonstrated to be able to kill someone politically important. Crystal Hunters roam the land with crossbows, killing anyone at range who even has a rock collection.

All previously constructed magic items and other advanced technologies are under control of the people able to command the most crossbow soldiers. The magic items are stored in vaults, guarded by even more crossbows. Private research is very illegal, and this limits where items so produced can be used. Only state actors do this research, and it is blamed on other countries to justify first strikes.

--------------

Why did you have to mention mind magic? Powerful people /hate/ mind magic they can't directly control. Bloodline mind magic means anyone with mental disabilities in public who looks even vaguely dangerous is killed by someone with a badge and a crossbow...sorta like right now, really. </politics>

Anyone stronger, smarter, or just weirder than normal is killed, along with their children and extended families. Political opponents are accused of controlling or reading minds, and fake trials convict based on political influence and bribes. Anyone not of a powerful political family who sticks their head up or is too successful is killed by someone with a crossbow, with or without a badge.

--------------

Use of controlled medical poultice substances is punished by summary crossbowing, usually during no-knock raids on dispensaries. Commoners trying to use it to heal loved ones are jailed, and the dungeons of many a castle are full of wanna-be Robin Hood medical suppliers.

The powerful, of course, still use them. A lot. Anyone merely middling-powerful has to kowtow to the powerful to be allowed to continue illegally using the medical poultices of life. Basically, if you are powerful and rich enough, you are allowed to continue living forever. Old age is an injury to cells, after all.

Uploading is illegal because crystals are illegal. Except for the politically powerful, of course.

--------------

No one can ever rise up to challenge this immortal group of plutocrats.

- If they are of the upper class, they are disconnected from any possible popular revolt. No single "noble" would have enough personal military power to win against the whole. They are silently assassinated, or just exiled and denied medical poultice until they die of old age.

- If they are of middling power, politicians directly working with the commoners for example, and try to involve themselves in common revolts, they are arrested and killed. Publicly and brutally.

- If they are commoners somehow in possession of widespread political influence or magical item stockpiles, they are hunted down by overwhelming quantities of soldiers with crossbows. They are all called terrorists, regardless of their personal actions, and are killed without trial.

--------------

If you want a happy fantasy world, you need to give the politically powerful something that a thousand peasants doesn't. If weapons are possible, they need personal or paid defenses. If mind magic is possible, they need absolute defenses. Otherwise, they'll throw wave after wave of people into the worst witch hunts in human history.

--------------

As for me, personally? I move somewhere in the far hinterlands and study crystals in a cave, planting poultice ingredients and training tiny little golems to scout the area for anyone with a crossbow.

**** I purposefully used crossbows in my examples. Crossbows at the time are only good for one thing: shooting people. Bows (short and long) at the time were much cheaper and easier to make and hunt with, even though crossbows were better at taking down large game.

(Side note: crossbow hunting would have mostly been /poaching/, also illegal and annoying to the nobility. There were virtually no free woods to hunt; someone owned them and the large game animals inside. So why let them have such weapons? You don't need a crossbow to kill a squirrel, after all.)

Historically in many places (IRL), crossbows were illegal for commoners to own, because they could kill a knight in full armor on horseback from a distance, and relatively safely and cheaply. Same with crystals, no matter how "fun" it would be to make magi-tech perpetual motion machine walkers or whatever. The people in such a world wouldn't see it like that.

What do these crystals do that would convince a ruling polity that it is worth risking their own elite military forces just to allow worthless peasants, or even the merchant class, access to such powerful, mostly-offensive magical items? Like crossbows, allowing widespread use of them, or even private ownership, would be worse than pointing a crossbow at their own heads. What advantage would they /personally/ gain from allowing such magic item tech to flourish?

As for magical healing items, why wouldn't they hoard them, making a greater profit off the rich upper class? We do nowadays, with poorer nations having to risk international sanctions just to get cheap-to-make versions of brand-name drugs to stave off horrible diseases. Why would it be important to have a more healthy populace, especially if such healing items would allow them to fight longer and harder in a revolt? It wasn't until just before the Enlightenment that lower-class people being healthy and able to work harder was actually an important factor for the upper classes. The growing middle class also meant more people demanding previously upper-class advantages. That's not going to be the case in a standard medieval tech world.

You don't get Enlightenment values by default in your world setting, just because the story is being written by a modern, moral human being. If you want such, fine. Explain why Prince Blueblood thinks it is immoral to allow Joe the Dirt Farmer to die of syphilis. Or why Princess Inbred thinks advancement for advancement's sake makes any sense. But that doesn't come by default.

The default reaction from ruling people /at that tech level/ should be first, why? And second, how do I defend against it? Since it doesn't show obvious advantages over current military tech, they won't use it in war. A single hawk defector on that won't win the day. Even an army using gun-tech magic items will be defeated by the numbers with the masses of crossbows and horses equivalent manpower and money would buy. It isn't actually a force multiplier, just in base form.

--------------

I think you are extrapolating a jump to interesting society-wide modern approaches to using the tech that powerful medieval-society people facing this for the first time simply won't make. They'll hate change, fear the field-leveling advantages in /personal/ offensive power, and still work behind the scenes with the more interesting mechanical and mind-copy uses. But there won't be sky-boats or mecha-catgirls. Nothing interesting like that.

*Unless* you put in some sociological strange attractor, like say...an example from a physically distant and more advanced foreign power /already using/ the interesting approaches that makes contact with the medieval society. Maybe a crashed sky-boat, or a transporter accident. They bring crystal magic items of their own that are torn down and analyzed, jump-starting the field while providing a real and present threat to existing orders. Then it is a tech race, even if the tech they are figuring out at first isn't /really/ better than current designs.

Think moonshot-level research crunches for Princess Inbred to have her /very own/ local-made catboy mechanical, and for Prince Blueblood to have his own shiny new crystal-gun elite guard. Now you're cooking with socio-economic factors.

For real-world examples, think either (theoretical) crashed alien ships, or more realistically the British and Americans opening up Japan to trade using guns and steamships.

Pretty soon, only a couple of generations in fact, they would be the ones using guns and steamships against their neighbors. That's the sort of thing you should be looking at, I think.

--------------

You could also go back to first principles, and just design a fantasy medieval-ish world that has always had magic crystals, and whose entire social and economic order is based on them. It won't have knights on horseback or nobles, though. Power will be defuse and small city-states with magi-technocratic rulers with high turnover seem likely. You'd also have to work hard to define the effort required to make certain items, or else everyone will just end up in walking suits of iron, stomping through a Mad-Max hellscape again. It would be a lot of work to avoid illogical tropes creeping in, but it might be fun to make such a world. Very hard, but fun.

***** I would assume that members of the ruling class that used crystal weapons /themselves/ would be sufficiently effective at killing their own enemies that it would become universal among the ruling class. Am I overestimating the offensive capabilities here?

The industrial applications are such that at least one member of the ruling class would use it for such, or allow a member of the merchant class access; and from there it would become universal among the merchant class. I ... honestly think this is true even if they were illegal at first, but maybe I have a more tech-driven view of history than you.

The peasant class would probably remain fairly unchanged, yeah, unless society was completely revolutionized. (Since slaves are cheaper than crystal golems.) But we tend to consider the upper classes' tech level and society when discussing a culture anyway, right?

If they are no more expensive to make and use (and as they don't run on anything, that last part should work out) then yes. The powerful would slowly equip their forces with the better weapons. But I was assuming these crystal weapons weren't much better than swords and civil-war firearms, and were vastly harder and more expensive to make. In any case, making them military-only seems logical.

Tech is almost always driven from a single exceptional individual coming up with something, then having it spread out. Individual ideas like this can fail to take off, be lost because of a failed business venture (see, subs several times until the early 1900s), or be lost entirely to time when a civilization collapses. The very act of copying a Bible with a quill and ink has been banned in human history, as has the printing press, brewing, distilling, and gun manufacture. All are an order of magnitude less intrusive in daily live and (including guns) less dangerous than crystal magic.

Once the tech takes off, sure. No one would think nowadays, /in the relatively-free Western societies/, of banning a laser printer, but try to set up a nuclear pile in your shed and see how long that lasts. That's what I'm saying these primitive screw heads will think of crystal magic. That it is like playing with radiation and firearms and the worst propaganda of Thomas Paine.

The elite will play little games with the banned tech, but they won't set up factories with it, /because no one knows what the assembly line process even is./ It would take /another/ genius to figure that stuff out once crystal magic is around and common, and that won't happen in a medieval social order. I think you're still working from the end and trying to justify a crystal-punk ideal that isn't supported by historic function.

#+begin_quote

That the medicine could bring everlasting life only means it'll be illegal to sell to lower class people, those without the moral ideals required to live forever. Access will be controlled because it is the ultimate luxury. De Beers will have nothing on the herb cartels. Allowing cheaper access for the lower classes would break that monopoly, and so it wouldn't happen.

Your objection /again/ assumes modern free-market economic realities that literally haven't been invented in a medieval society. They're all about oppression for social control and insular mercantilism to ensure the elite get their fruits, wines, and spices. And if you're a good enough merchant class worker, you'll get to sample some of the life-giving cure-all.

Please try to consider the social realities of a world that doesn't have humanism, Walmart, or even Adam Smith. Saying something would be like a post-Enlightenment situation simply doesn't make sense for a medieval world.

** Seems like a pretty deadly place, heavily biased towards offence rather than defence. A teleport spell, but no tele-blocker to keep your house safe from invading teleporters. Fireballs, and unstoppable blades, but no magic shields or anti-fire potions. Seems like the thing to do is to gain a decent stockpile of fireball amulets, build up a force of magical uploads then build a castle. The uploads are weak at close range, so make sure they never get close. Keep them behind defences and arrow slits. If you can just graft on golem limbs, why stop at just 2 arms for a warrior? Especially if 2 can hold normal weapons while the others all hold crystals. It seems more and more that a properly outfitted person would have an extreme advantage.

As for the bloodline mages, they'd pretty much be walking natural disasters. I mean really, mind control and precognition alone is enough to make the Simurgh fearsome. Telekinesis of swarms of magical razors would cut down just about anything. Biokinesis to harden skin into armour and re-route injuries. The only thing for it would be to hope they're too mentally compromised to plan properly or else they're going to be in charge of the place, or at least some local places. It would make a good Warring Gods age which destroyed all that came before, Shinsekai Yori style. From there you can imply various things about how this all came to be if you like. Sufficiently advanced arseholes or whatever.

The magic crystals don't run out of charge, so it seems fighting would be limited basically by population total number of crystals. A large part of war would be capturing enemy crystals seeing as i'm assuming that more don't get built often (if at all). If you have them, and your enemy does not then you've basically won. Consequently a decisive battle would be doubly so, because their force is suddenly much stronger for all the extra uploads and fireballs that they've looted that you no longer have.

Looks like wars would come pretty often, no real limit on it on the arms side, teleporting carts would sure make dealing with a supply chain easier. Works for messages and orders too.

Darn it, I should have mentioned that all these things need roughly the same amount of crystal, so the prices of all magic items are going to be roughly the same. (More for things with built-in AI and so on.) That was the whole point of using vaguely-defined "magic crystals" in the first place.

Golems cost more than children, but copying a master is probably cheaper than finding and training a child to the same level of skill. If only because you can always copy the most skilled craftsman you can find. So ... yup, excellent point.

Do bear in mind that crystals are a limited resource, though, so you'd probably hit diminishing returns on your Non Neumann process. I think?

The magical uploads would give you post-scarcity economy. Find some people who like working and upload some copies of them. Since they won't have to worry about much themselves, they'll work for you. And since you can copy the people who work more, you can find people who are really willing to work.

Strictly speaking, /speed/ is conserved, not momentum or velocity; direction is always at the same angle to the Earth's centre of gravity, but otherwise tends to drift randomly the further the target location is from the starting point.
