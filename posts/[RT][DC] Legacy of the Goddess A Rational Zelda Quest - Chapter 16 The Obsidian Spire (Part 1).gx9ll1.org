--------------

This is part 1 of 3 for the Obsidian Spire dungeon crawl. These chapters are based on results from the real-time DM session. Parts 2 and 3 to come soon(tm).

Voting will be reopened after the final chapter has been posted. See comments for links (posting there so automod doesn't have a conniption fit).

--------------

Extra thanks to co-QMs MMKII and Kurkistan for assistance in running the live session.
