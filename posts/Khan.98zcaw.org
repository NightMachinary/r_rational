** The opening needs work. The very first sentence sets the mood and tone for the rest of the novel, and I found that "Seth rang the doorbell, and Justin opened the door, a baby on his shoulder" set a very bland tone, which carried through the entire part of the conversation where Mary was present.

I really enjoyed it once it became clear that this wasn't actually a mundane story of a brother trying to connect with his father's illegitimate children. The discussion about ethical use of power was great, and the ending was something I didn't see coming, but in retrospect, something I felt I /should/ have, which is the very best sort of ending.

But, yeah, the opening /really/ drags, and I honestly only kept reading because I felt certain that no one would write a story that was that bland all the way through.

*** As a counterpoint, I love how Alicorn's stories often feature "mundane" situations, which provide a background for exploring complicated moral questions or developing clever ideas. Also, it's always interesting/fun trying to notice the discrepancies between our world and the fictional setting of the given story, that gradually appear, to try to understand the setting. Reading from the perspective of (initially/temporarily) normal inhabitants, who view their often (from our point of view) weird world as normal, underlines the strangeness of the world, as "exciting" people always have unusual lives. Plus, I find it endearing that not every story has to be about somebody trying to conquer or optimise the world (not that Alicorn's work is lacking in that...).

In the case of this particular story, the exposition of the setting is valuable IMO. Additionally, if you re-read the story, many of Seth's seemingly innocent or even inane comments and thoughts, are now rather ominous.

**** It's not the "mundane" that I mind; it's the "bland." This story, how it started out, could have been about a hereditary genetic defect (it kinda was), and I would have had exactly the same criticism.

I just don't get the sense, reading the first section, that the main character /wants/ anything out of this. He's meeting with this newfound relative... because. Just "because." Of course, it later becomes apparent that he /does/ have a reason for visiting, something he wants from his half-brother, but that doesn't show through at all.

Now, given the format of the story , /exactly/ what he wants isn't going to be revealed to the reader right away. But the fact that the MC wants his brother to do him a favor, to make a sacrifice, to help him with a project, or the fact that there is a family secret or genetic condition that the brother needs to be informed of... Any of that would give a hook to pull the reader along, to say, "Keep reading, something interesting is coming!"

Eventually, interesting things happen, but, if you don't set the hook early enough, a reader might not get to that part of the story. I almost didn't.

** At first I thought the title was a reference to Khan Noonien Singh.

Then I saw the links to Genghis Kahn.

Then at the end, I realized how it could be either. Well done, Alicorn.

** I'm not sure I understand Seth's plan based on the information toward the end. Or are we not supposed to understand the full extent of what his aims really are?

**** I read it as wanting to make a dynasty. Rather than spreading the gene far and wide (to no real effect) he can keep the count as small as possible and have a small group of "kahns" for many generations.
