** I wonder what Scribe is doing while all this is going down. The woman who runs the best spy operation in Calernia would probably be the best placed to find the Rogue Sorcerer. Not to mention it would be the antithesis of her her character to not try and rescue Black.

***** Augur works for, or is somehow compromised by, the Bard.

​

Remember that Black's goal and Catherine's goal is a world that doesn't run on stories.

For Bard, this is apocalyptic and she will do everything to stop them from succeeding (also why she hates +Heirophant.)+ Edit: Heirarch

​

She'd rather see Procer fall than for it make an amicable peace with a villain.

Why do you think this? I haven't been able to get a solid read on what Bards goals are. Sometimes it seems like shes working against the Choirs and what some like the Pilgrim want.

  “Make your peace with it,” Princess Rozala said
#+end_quote

So she wants Cat to throw a fight on purpose, lose however many men, all the while hoping she *won't* get backstabbed by a guy who has repeatedly tried to kill her *and* has happily broken promises that were inconvenient to him in the past... after *just* having the other hero try and murder her during parley... and when called out on this, her response is basically 'Get over it'?

What a pathetic pile of meat. I begin to see why the Drow call everyone else 'cattle'.

I guess it'd be too much to hope that /her/ crown will be one of the Seven and One? Because at this point, my sympathy meter for her just pegged zero.

** I personally think Cat would have gotten a lot more mileage out of the "every body made here is one less on the line against the Dead King and potentially one more on his side" tack, especially from Malanza, who was on that front until very recently. IIRC she did bring up a similar line to the princess earlier, but pushing here, especially after Andronike hit that pain point, might have worked in planning the "loss and retreat" farce a little more in Cat's favor. Probably she's right and Pilgrim wouldn't have stood for it, though, and would sic the Levantine more than half of the army on her during a retreat in good order, especially if it was a stalemate instead of an outright loss.

I don't think she would have gotten anywhere with it. Malanza has to fight or, according to the Augor, Procer pretty much collapses from the inside. They can't fight against the Dead King if they can't function as a coherent organising body.
