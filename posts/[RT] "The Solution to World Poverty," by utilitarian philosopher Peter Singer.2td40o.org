*** Singer says $200. Scott says $800. Today's child-life costs $3000 according to Givewell's AMF listing. A sign of progress over time, or a sign of wildly fluctuating estimates?

I think it matters how much it is exactly, you know? I'd donate more if I could buy one life for only 200.

** I'm going to say some things here that are probably going to get me lots of negative karma, but I'm going to say it anyway.

We're primates. Like it or not, we all have that inner primate within us that drives us to measure ourselves against others. That vestige of our ancestry insidiously worms its way into our interactions with others, on almost every level.

A very large part of why charity works is that it creates or preserves real or perceived power. If you give X to Y, then Y is indebted to you. That indebtedness is a power of sorts. Even if it's not a real power, it massages that inner primate. You just gave something to someone that was in need of something you could afford to discard. Giving is a prerogative of dominance. Ook. Good.

A lot of people might be thinking, "Oh, I never feel that way." Really? Let's explore the possibility that this is true. Even of one were to completely write off the perception of hand-me-down power, there's still the matter of personal confidence and the perception of self-worth. Even if no power calculations come into play at all. No tax deductions, no favors owed, no residual good will, why might one give? To feel good about oneself and feed one's perception of self-worth and confidence. Doing good for others means that one must be a good person, right? Self-confidence and self-worth are critical to us. They are extremely potent drivers for our survival and prosperity. Ook. Good.

That's not all though! Someone with no needs unfulfilled might choose to give things away simply because they have more than they need. Perhaps they are even irritated by their own excess. This introspection, this giving, is performed because the giver has been successful or lucky. In the Western world, it is expected of the powerful to give away some of their power. It marks them as being 'normal' and part of the community of those with power. Once you get to a certain income or level of measured worth, society pressures one to give to charity. If one does not give like others in the same fiscal standing, there is a perceived lack. That perception may be internal, what one thinks about oneself, or perhaps external, what others think and say about the skinflint. In the Western world, living amongst many others with the ability to give, being charitable is expected. Peer pressure! Ook. Good.

I will not say that there aren't people who transcend the rest of us, who give, and get no real or perceived benefit of any type from the behavior of giving and charity, but those people are rare. If you feel 'good' because you give to charity, then you are not one of those people. The very fact that you feel 'good' means that some vestige of inner primate inside you is proudly waving a banana and cheering you on. Ook. Good.

Let me be clear. Without any reservations, I support charity as a temporary way to help others, especially for basic needs like food or medicine. I have absolutely zero confidence that any sort of charity-based economy can be good. Everyone's inner primate craves self-worth, and accepting charity is poisonous to self-worth. Self-worth is the most important human infrastructure of all - we need to stop killing it. Ook.

*** Why is accepting charity poisonous to self worth? Let's put it in other terms. If someone donates some time to help you learn something or fix a problem you're having, do you necessarily have to feel lower self-worth because of it? Seems quite strange to me.

Also, we're killing self worth? What?

Ok, it could be true for certain people that they feel shitty when someone does something nice for them, but this specific comment is deriving some kind of grand sociological/biological conclusion from a few kludgy mental heuristics. I'm inclined to take the whole thing with a grain of salt.

**** If a person accepts charity as assistance to get over a problem or two in life, that's usually OK. Most people can accept that, and deal with it, even if they aren't downright thrilled and happy to get short term help. It's the long term effect of charity that is poisonous.

When you start simply giving people what they need to survive for years, you harm them. People need a purpose. People need goals. People need pride and self-worth.

Its your prerogative to be skeptical about what I say. In fact, skepticism is a good thing. When you are skeptical about what I say, it means that you have a sense of self-worth. You feel like your opinion, your knowledge, your ability to reason things out has as much validity as my own. You're competing with me for social standing on some level. The inner monkey waves a banana in your direction. Ook. Good.

How do you know that they are harmed? That's a big claim about long term effects of charity.

A lot of us want to optimize for everyone's living standards to be improved. Contributing to charities is one of the most widely available tools to reach this goal. You just research good charities (Effective Altruism has a bunch of resources to figure this out) and give what you can, and you start effecting real change. Every life you unshackle from disease and hunger can grow communities, create business value, produce art, live.

Let's worry about self sufficiency and worth after people stop dying of hunger and treatable illnesses? And the myriad other bullshit things that cut down life.

Why do you think charity does long term harm to people?

Who's even proposing this straw man perpetual charity argument?

Do you think charity giving can never learn from past success? Do you think non profits don't measure their own effectiveness? Do you think there isn't a market that values more effective charities a lot more? Then why the need to invoke some artificial harms involving self worth etc?

There's an element to making charities effective. How can charities be more effective?

******** I don't see how the harmfulness of long term charity isn't perfectly clear. Humans have needs and desires. Gaining these needs and desires gives us pleasure. The more pleasure, the more strongly related to survival the pleasurable activity is. That's why sex feels so damn good, and why children are so damn adorable. It's also why we laugh at practical jokes that reduce the potential social standing of others. On topic, it's why charity feels good, because charity is perceived as establishing dominance, social standing, or self-worth.

If you feel pleasure from something, it's your inner primate cheering you on. If what you are doing isn't something useful that improves your position in life, you've fooled the inner primate into thinking it is. Please forgive the inner primate for that. The most complex tool he understands is a stick to eat termites with.

As an example of fooling the inner primate. You might say that basement-dwellers in developed countries violate this. I say no, because in developed countries, basement dwellers frequently try to become expert video game players and skilled forum trolls. They frequently seek out meaningless ways to improve themselves. The inner primate doesn't understand computer, but it does understand winning.

All this talk about pleasure and charity. Let's look at the other side. The person who receives the charity. They have an inner primate too, and that inner primate will equate receiving gifts as being dependent. To some degree this is acceptable. Not every ape can be a silverback, after all.

You might say, "I feel pleasure when I receive a gift!" Indeed. By being given a gift, you have been given a token that you matter. Another primate, frequently related to you, has noticed you and accepted you as a responsibility of theirs. If the giver is the more powerful, the givee understands they are offered some degree of safety and acceptance. If the giver is the weaker, the givee understands the gifting to be homage or thanks.

There are very few of us that ever lose appreciation for gifts from family. However, if some random individual on the street walks up to you and offers you a gift, what's the first response? For adults, it's "Who are you. What is this? Why are you giving me this?" Suspicion, distrust, maybe even fear. If someone you do not like offers you a gift, what's your reaction?

As the inner primate receives more and more gifts from strange people, more charity, dependence is hammered in. In some, the person becomes apathetic and depressed. In others, the inner primate seeks ways to create some sort of way to reduce its dependence and establish dominance for itself. Think about gang activity rates and the prevalence of rape and other violent crime in poverty stricken places, even in first world countries! Think about drug use. Think about oppressive depression. Think about terrorist recruitment. Think about unrest and riots.

People need purpose. If all you give them is charity, they will either lose purpose, or they will create their own purposes that are almost certain to be closer to primate behavior than civilized human behavior.

So, what can charity do to improve? Design their activities to lead to a solution as opposed to treating symptoms.

It's not that easy though. In almost every place in the world where there are destitute humans, there are already persons in power over them. The ones in power are typically quite happy with their own position and are not interested in allowing the lives of the people under them to be dramatically improved, because if the people under them get improved circumstances, well, the current top primate might be challenged.

As painful as it might be to say it, I suspect that as technology improves and populations get larger, the permanent solution to the harm created by charity is going to allow people to pursue meaningless activities that stimulate the inner primate.

Yes, I said it. The permanent solution to a lot of apathy and crime issues caused by long term charity might end up being a basement-dweller society. Internet trolls have the potential to derail apathy and save the world from charity.

********** There are a great many people out there in the world that will not freely accept any sort of gifts from strangers. I'm one of them. I do not like receiving gifts from people I do not know. I can prove that to some degree by providing links to three serial fiction webpages that generate 1000+ hits per day between them. I have never implemented a donation option on any of those three pages. I'm not a special snowflake in this regard.

Even amongst those who would accept gifts from strangers, there are very few people in the world that wouldn't ask a lot of questions before accepting a gift from a stranger.

The concept of pure altruism exists, but very few people practice it, and even fewer will believe they are experiencing it without at least asking several pointed questions.

** once upon a time, there was a remote village deep in the forest. this village was filthy rich. it was the vacation home of every self-respecting rich person in their society. it had little to no agriculture, producing far less food than it consumed. as a result, everything was imported. the farmers who traveled to the village did so because they knew the inhabitants were rich, and could charge far more for their goods there than anyone else. so, all the people who weren't rich who lived there had to raise their prices too, or else not be able to afford the farmer's prices. the cost of living was high, the production of critical goods low, and the production of luxury goods high.

now imagine Singer is a wizard, and he found himself sickened by this village's decadence. "we could feed an entire village for a month with the money they spend on luxury items in a week!" he exclaims. so, good-intentioned, he lays a geas on the village to donate 90% of what they would have spent on luxuries to charity instead, and he goes on his merry way.

everything works fine for a while, but soon the village starts noticing a decrease in the money it makes. for you see- most of the people in the village sell luxuries for a living. by cutting all luxury expenditures, singer hamstrung their income. soon, they can't afford the farmer's prices, the farmers don't find it worth the trip and the residents are forced to move or starve.

the point is- that village, much like us, was living in an economic bubble that absolutely depended on everyone buying things they don't need. all its riches were illusory- none of the goods were actually worth what they cost, but the inflated price made it seem like they were. make no mistake, all bubbles pop eventually, but let's wait to deliberately pop this one until we're better prepared.

...you know, unless you like global recessions.

The idea of spending 'just pennies a day' or whatever to save a starving African child is emotionally appealing, but as a widespread policy, it seems to result in corruption and stagnation. Accordingly, I'm rather skeptical of the utilitarian argument presented in your link. Vast sums of money continue to be funnelled to these nations on behalf of various charities. Some are, admittedly, better than others, and will have better results than others in terms of lives saved (or whatever other metric you want to use), but the end result seems to be ongoing poverty and dependence, and a permanent need for ever-increasing amounts of foreign aid money.

In the class I'm taking, the OP piece was presented alongside [[http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_lifeboat_ethics_case_against_helping_poor.html][this one]], which is almost excessively pessimistic and goes far beyond "charities tend to corrupt" to imply "famine is good because it lessens overpopulation". I disagree with that thinking -- especially since it was written 3 billion people ago, and we still have food -- but respect the article more just because it has a somewhat logical argument. Now I think of it, it's curious that my professor has presented these side-by-side ... I wonder why.

*** let me try my hand at a better solution:

most sources of poverty stems from high-level problems, that is, problems that require large amounts of coordination to solve (like the prisoner's dilemma- the best solution is the mob boss coordinating his men. if you are caught in one, and you know your partner is likely to defect, there's not much you personally can do) I propose a non-profit organization dedicated to gaining the influence required to achieve that level of coordination and using it for the best interests of the people as advised by relevant experts.

I would propose their tactics to be that of local prohibition-era mob boss Tom Pendergast- that is, to give the short version, bribe the people for votes. this gives the charity an efficient, two-pronged attack- each dollar spent not only improves the life of the person it's given to, but also grows the charity's influence, allowing it to tackle bigger problems.

one of the largest problems I have with singer's plan is sustainability- to use his example of the man having to choose between his beloved car or a child's life, the man would be faced with the same choice every year. I would therefore suggest, rather than asking us to give infinite amounts of money on the grounds that it would save significant numbers of lives, ask for a specific amount to gain a specific goal. that is, estimate the cost of gaining significant influence in a problem area, divide by estimated number of donators, and ask each donator for roughly that much. this way your "share" is well-defined.

once influence is gained, I would suggest it hires professional consultants qualified to solve the problems necessary for improvement.

*** I do not think it stands up to scrutiny. Because it ignores the opportunity cost: that money wasn't just buried in the ground before it was given to charity. It was invested. If everyone were to sell of their investments, as he implies is a moral imperative, stock markets would plummet. Companies would go out of business. People would lose jobs. Their ability to give anything at all would disappear and they would start needing money themselves.

Imagining invested money isn't doing anything and can be just redirected toward ending poverty at not cost is a fallacy. Now, you could definitely make an argument that you should very carefully invest in companies that are doing good in the world in different ways... but I think the world needs advanced engineering perhaps as much as it needs food for the poor, as hard as a choice as that is to make.

That's not all there is to say, and yes there are a lot of creature comforts we should give up to live perfectly moral lives.
