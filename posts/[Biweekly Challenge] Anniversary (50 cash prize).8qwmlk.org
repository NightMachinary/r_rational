[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8ndzk3/biweekly_challenge_shipping/][Last time]], the prompt was "Shipping". Our winner is [[/u/9adam4]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8ndzk3/biweekly_challenge_shipping/dzwx0zw/]["In Their Eyes"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/9adam4]]!

This time, the challenge will be "Anniversary", as the first challenge was posted on 6/17/15, meaning that the challenges have been running for three years now. What direction you want to take this prompt is up to you; anniversaries are normally about commemorating, honoring, or remembering something. [[https://futureoflife.org/2015/10/11/happy-petrov-day/][Petrov Day]] would be a good example, though I think stories with a theme of remembrance, reflection, etc. could all fit well within the theme. *Also, as a special one-time thing, this challenge will have a cash prize of $50.* (If you win, I'll message you.)

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, June 27th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time

Next time, the challenge will be *Cult*. In many ways, cults represent the height of human cognitive biases and rationality blindspots. "Cult" is a deliberately vague term here, so you can take the prompt in whatever direction you choose. If you'd like, you can take it in the direction of "cult classic", the less nefarious and more genial counterpart of a small group of people venerating something obscure.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 6/27*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8qwn3s/challenge_companion_anniversary/][is available here]].

*** I like the idea of a dark take on Anniversary, and the brevity of the story, but you could have expanded upon the..." Contents " section to increase... the end. And maybe, you could change up the beginning of your sentences.

** I don't have a title for this: [[https://pastebin.com/bxrrrQMc]]

It came out different from what I'd intended. I suppose it usually does.
