Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I enjoyed the University of Michigan's free [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking][Model Thinking]] course so much. The idea of modelling things is so important that I wish everyone could be exposed to it.

I guess I'm also pretty stoked because it made a lot of things that I taught myself finally click, and I ended the course feeling like I gained a minor superpower when it comes to problem solving.

** In the last Monthly recommendation thread, there was a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7hq84n/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/dqti48i/][recommendation]] for a podcast named "Harry Potter and the Sacred Text". The theme of the podcast is a little weird. It is a re-reading of Harry Potter, but they read it as if it were a sacred text (like the bible), and find deeper meaning in it.

The [[https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/][podcast]] is actually very well done (it is very good technically, and there is a great chemistry between the hosts).

I'm usually quite cynical when it comes to spirituality. Obviously, J.K Rolling didn't intend all these layers of meaning when writing Harry Potter. However, listening to people discuss several spiritual themes (like Curiosity, Fear and Commitment) through the lens of this famous story is somehow very interesting for me, even a bit moving.

This leads me to a greater question: Is there such a thing as rational spirituality?

I sometimes feel like the secular life are missing some very important parts of human experience. Specifically, I feel that it is very hard to maintain a sense of optimism in a world void of meaning. (I remember reading somewhere that religious people are less likely to develop depression, and are generally more contend in their lives. Could anyone find a source on that?).

In addition, I think that the communities and family structures in the western secular culture are crumbling. These social structures seem important for our happiness, and it doesn't seem that we have built anything to replace them.

I also think that some religious practices, like meditation (and maybe prayer?) are legitimately helping people live a happier life, and generally feel better about themselves.

On the other hand - I find it very hard to identify with traditional religions. I feel like they force people to suppress their common sense, and ignore inconsistencies and falsehoods.

Is it possible to find meaning in a meaningless world, while still maintaining our rational thought processes?

I'm starting to wonder if I'm a some sort of philosophy mutant because I see people making points like that and never understanding it.

EDIT: Okay, since I've had like ten millions "me too"s in the last 3 days, I'm going to guess this is just an uncommon position and not a weird brain mutation.

The basic idea of nihilism is "There's no deeper / higher meaning to be found". Every time I see someone mentioning nihilism (as in "this guy is a nihilist" or "I'm nihilist"), it's mentioned as a sad thing; like the idea that there's no higher order is an inherently bad thing.

And I almost never see someone just... be okay with it? I mean, personally speaking, I'm a bit unhappy with the whole "death" thing, but as far as philosophical / existential meaning go... I don't see any, and I don't feel the need to see any? I dunno. This whole subject weirds me out a bit.

I don't know about religious style meditation, but there is a specific kind of meditation that has been studied and shown to produce very positive results in practitioners. It's simple:

1. Sit comfortably, with your eyes either closed or mostly closed (whichever you prefer)\\
2. Focus your attention on your breath\\
3. When you catch your mind wandering, gently bring your attention back to your breath\\

This does two things: trains your ability to focus, and trains your ability to observe your own thoughts without getting reeled in by them.

For example, if you think about dinner it might automatically set off a huge chain of thoughts related to what you're going to make, what ingredients you'll buy, what you're going to eat tomorrow, and whether or not you should start meal prepping because you heard it saves money, etc. Once you've had enough practice via meditation, it's like you have the ability to choose whether or not you engage with that line of thought. It's like a gives you a small buffer against random thoughts, and also random emotions. You can simply observe that you're angry, hungry, in pain, etc and the sting is lessened somewhat. This is especially good if you're depressed or anxious, because it can stop you from ruminating endlessly about painful subjects.

If you are already better at the skills that meditation teaches than the average person, then the heights reached by the average student will not impress you, since they are your baseline state. That's OK, since they are not the skills that you would say you gained, if you practiced. (Though you'll likely find that those things you can already do become less effortful.)

I'm pretty sure I fall into the "naturally good at meditation" camp myself, and can report that there is interesting and useful stuff beyond the "can notice that they're thinking" stage. (Useful: when I'm in practice, I'm better at paying attention to really small aspects of my experience - for the lulz, for design, or for changing how I feel about them.)

I never really saw the point of looking for a point to my existence. I just enjoy that I exist in the first place. The one thing that I never really understood from other people is that they think the idea that our complex lives emerge from very simple interactions at a much lower level somehow takes away meaning and beauty while I find order emerging like that to be a very beautiful thing.

According to this the human mind develops in stages. Not every one reaches all of them. And between stage 4 and 5 people develop nihilism when they get stuck there.

***** I really, really like that article and the model it develops, but I think it's too simplistic to give accurate predictions of reality (the most visible argument is that it treats the different stages as strongly correlated, which doesn't have to be the case). I'll probably revisit it when I have time to do serious philosophy; I'll hit you up then.

There's definitely a "n-1 => n => n+1" pattern of

- "All is X"

- "There doesn't have to be X"

- "There is /some/ X"

to be found in a lot of philosophy.

(that's actually a really neat way to put it, now that I think about it)

****** You seem to describe Hegels thesis - antithesis - synthesis. Interesting theory to describe things after the fact, but can be misleading when trying to predict things. I am not the biggest fan of Hegel.

But now that I think about it I often have imagined the stages as some sort of pendulum swinging back and forth with decreasing distance. Maybe I should rethink that.

Oh and Kegan is a developmental psychologist not a philosopher but I don't really know very well how psychology research works. Maybe the difference is not that big.

******* Ugh, I'm having French class flashbacks. That's not a pleasant thing.

Seriously though, I can't quite say "Yes, I was describing this" or "No I wasn't", because I get the feeling two people reading this wikipedia article could get wildly different understandings of what thesis-antithesis-synthesis is.

What the vividness.live article you linked says, which blew my mind the first time I read it, is that for a lot of philosophical concepts, people go through the following stages:

- Not knowing about / believing in the concept

- Thinking the concept is everywhere

- "Transcending" the concept, seeing where it is and where it isn't.

Ex: Morality is absolute -> There's no reason believe in a higher morality, every position could be valid -> Okay, morality isn't absolute; but in most situations it may as well be; however, thinking of it as relative can be more productive in other situations.

The interesting points here are:

- Each stage is utterly incompatible with the previous stages. You can't be both a moral absolutist and a moral existentialist.

- If your "current stage" is n, you can easily confuse n-1 and n+1.

- Each stage is more complex than the previous one; in fact, each stage "contains" the previous one; a n can understand a n-1, but a n-1 can't understand a n.

This is the most important part. In that framework, your beliefs aren't a pendulum that swings on a linear axis towards an ideal value (so the only possible directions are "more X" or "less X"); they're more like a blurry image that gets a better resolution over time. Stage n-1 is "everything is white", stage n is "there's some black!", stage n+1 is "it's mostly white".

The article then naturally tries to apply this pattern everywhere, which is where it starts to lose me.

******** As already written I don't think the pendulum metaphor is perfect. But it does abstract better over your second point. That n can confuse n-1 with n+1. Because in a pendulum both n-1 and n+1 would be on the same side. That (independent from the pendulum metaphor) could explain why most people think of rationalists as "cold" or "selfish" (asuming most rationalists are on 4 and most other people are on 3).

Your blurry image metaphor is also interesting. It better abstracts over the stages getting more complex. But it is linear.

I don't know a better metaphor which abstracts over all these points unfortunately.

But Kegan himself thinks his theory has some flaws:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kegan#Criticism]]

The book "Psychotherapy as a Developmental Process" which Kegan calls: "the closest thing we have to a 'unified field theory' for psychotherapy" sounds interesting. I probably should give it higher priority on my reading list.

I also find the whole idea of meaning weird because it's not even clear how life having "meaning" would even work. Like even were there a god I don't think that would actually solve anything. In that respect I think meaning is like objective morality, there's no possible world in which it would be a sensible concept and people seem to miss that the actual details of your world such as whether a god exist, are actually irrelevant here.

Then it seems sort of unusual that you can't imagine the existence of "meaning" being something of particular importance. Like it really seems like something religion would indoctrinate into you if at all possible, thus lending some credence to the idea that you're a mutant.

Though given I think the weird idea of meaning is something humans are predisposed to, but don't get unless they're indoctrinated. It could be that your particular religious upbringing wasn't very thorough in following standard indoctrination procedure or something like that.

Nobody came to me and said "You will go to hell if you become a consequentialist!!!"

Also I remember that one time where we had to imagine which 3 items we would to take with us if we ended up on a deserted planet.

Sure nobody may have said that directly, but I'm pretty sure that would still implicitly be true given the church canon, since it would qualify as heresy. I mean they don't don't have to be too explicit with fear-mongering about hell in order for that fear to be there implicitly given the implications of the teachings.

The point though was that religion imbuing ideas of god granting life meaning (and thus meaning being a very significant thing) seem like they would almost certainly be part of standard religious indoctrination. After all I do hear an awful lot of ex-christians talking about that, and bringing up having to grapple with a lack of meaning after deconversion.

**** This is a common theme I've heard from the authors in this community. The audience will sometimes fail to spot what they consider obvious hints (because the author has access to privileged information), but more importantly will also find 1,000 completely off-base links to justify any conceivable interpretation.

The correct answer will often rise to the top (e.g. because it fits more evidence, resonates thematically, or provokes retcons when the author sees what people are confused about), but until that selection process is finished you're looking at a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel][Library of Babel]] situation.

In the case of a holy text, this selection process never finishes. The people interpreting it, and the world they live in, are too diverse and dynamic to ever settle on a single, majority answer. And it's looking unlikely that we'll get authorial clarification at this point, since their human authors are generally dead and their spiritual authors are some combination of non-interventionist and non-existent.

It sounds like this podcast is a good study in the ways that people ascribe meaning to random patterns. I'll have to give it a listen sometime.

If I had heard that a month ago I would've thought he'd hit the nail on the head yet again, but now I believe that is naive. I think ideological purity is incredibly important because that ideology is about empathizing with and helping victims of abuse and discrimination, whereas the opposition are tribalists who want to allow oppression to continue.

I feel so strongly about this that I'm worried I've become too radical and will end up worsening the divide in my society, but I can't imagine a way to repair that divide without persuading or subjugating people who enable oppression.

This strikes me as wayyyyyy oversimplified and naive. The vast majority of people on both sides are ordinary people trying to do the right thing, but disagree on either the best methods of solving certain issues, or on how reality is. Let me put forth the following groups of people and their beliefs that I believe portray certain types of people:

Type A) Radical leftist:

A1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

A2) White people are currently oppressing black people and causing them to remain poor

A3) White people are inherently evil as a result of their race

A4) White people should give money to black people, or should be segregated in society and given lesser rights to atone for their sin of being born white

Type B) Semi-radical leftist

B1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

B2) Some racist white people are discriminating against black people, combined with past injustices which is causing black people to remain poor

B3) White people are responsible for their actions that have caused black people to be poor, and should make up for it by checking their privilege in debates, never ever do anything culturally insensitive like making racist jokes or saying the N word, and should give precedence to black people via welfare and affirmative action

Type C) Moderate Leftist:

C1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

C2) The cycle of poverty has caused this to continue until the present time, where black people remain poor

C3) Everyone should be treated the same regardless of their race

C3) However, policies should target black people with welfare and affirmative action because this will help them break out of the poverty cycle

Type D) Moderate Rightist

D1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

D2) The cycle of poverty, combined with gang culture and the destruction of the black family unit, has caused black people remain poor.

D3) Everyone should be treated the same, regardless of their race

D4) Therefore, people bear no guilt or association with the actions of other people, living or dead, who share nothing in common other than race.

D5) Therefore, we should not give extra welfare or affirmative action to black people, but instead should make policies that target poor people regardless of race, as this will accomplish the same good in a more fair and equal manner.

Type E) Semi-radical rightist

E1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

E2) This, combined with geneticly smaller intelligence and looser morals, has caused black people to be poor.

E3) Everyone is responsible for their own choices, and the consequences of those choices. Therefore black people should be left to their own devices and if they want to not be poor they can simply work harder to fix it

Type F) Radical rightist:

F1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was good.

F2) Black people are inherently inferior to white people

F3) Black people are poor as a result of their own inferiority

F4) Black people should be sent back to Africa, or re-enslaved, or exterminated, so that they stop ruining our society.

Obviously the above are somewhat oversimplified, many people will have more nuanced versions of these beliefs, or have some but not others from various different tiers. But my first main point is that the distribution of people believing these in real life seems to be close to a bell curve. Most people are close to the middle, and a huge part of the issue is that people on one side tend to view things in terms of "right of me" and "left of me". People on the right have difficulty distinguishing between A/B/C, while people on the left have difficulty distinguishing between D/E/F. However by looking at these it is obvious that we have a sort of horseshoe theory happening, where A and F are obvious and dangerous racists, B and E are moderately racist or misguided but have some hope, while C and D both believe in equality but differ slightly in what that means for policy.

The second main point is that many of the beliefs are possible to hold without being a terrible person. We have "moral" beliefs, about whether or not certain things are good or bad, and "territory" beliefs, which describe how someone thinks reality is. Someone who believes "black people are genetically less intelligent than white people" has a territory belief. There is a hypothetical world in which this is a true statement (which might be our own, I don't know enough about genetic influences on intelligence to know either way). This does not necessarily imply that this person thinks they should be treated differently (a moral belief). So even if you do think this belief is incorrect and makes them a racist, they're on an entirely different level than someone who hates black people, and you shouldn't group them together.

I find it incredibly naive to call one group "tribalists" and "radical" but not the other which is performing idealogical purity tests that is scaring away its own members.

Hopefully, at the very least, you can see the concern for radicalization of the left, as well as for the right. Both are dangerous. Even if the two sides are not perfectly symmetric, they're awfully close. All labelling everyone D and right as "nazis" does is dillute the word and makes it harder to recognize the real nazis.

Both groups have an identified villain who they blame for all of societies problems, they hold radical beliefs and believe that it is acceptable to silence any opposition to those beliefs, by violence if necessary. And they actually commit violence against their opponents and random people who have wrong opinions.

I don't believe for a second that many members of antifa, especially ones high in the totem pole, would refrain from gassing republicans, or rich white people, [[https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/antifa-hate1.jpg][or cops]] if given the opportunity. The only reason they haven't yet is because they're not in power.

Bullshit. Antifa's existance has done far more to radicalize the right than anything the moderates have done. There have always been a minority of isolated racists throughout society, who are for the most part ostracized and discouraged by moderates without the need for idealogical purity tests. But once you given them a common enemy, one who tells them that white people are evil and must be exterminated, they group together and lash out. The left likes to blame Trump for the rise of white nationalism, but if you pay attention to the timelines you'll find that antifa arose first, and then the right rose in response to them, which is why the first several violent protests had antifa protestors alone committing violence, and then later ones had both sides fighting against each other.

We live in a society where the vast majority of people believe that everyone should be treated the same regardless of race, and a minority of people is screaming that race does matter and race A is better than race B or is responsible for race C, as if people are somehow responsible for the actions of other people who have the same skin color and aren't individuals.

I firmly believe that the best solution is for everyone to stop grouping people by race. Treat people as individuals, based on the content of their character, not the color of their skin. Because when you start telling people that their race did this, or did that, that they need to act differently or be treated differently because of their race, that the deeds of ancient people of the same race as them are now their deeds, the worst thing that can happen is they'll believe you. We have never lived in a society where racism was completely extinct, but we sure were a lot closer in the 90s where people tended to just ignored it and treated each other equally than we are today when we have to be all worried about whether people of this "other" group will get offended if we say certain words and aren't respectful enough of their "culture" that we aren't allowed to "appropriate." That just breeds resentment and alienation.

******* Fox news and Breitbart aren't committing violence, and as far as I can see, are not encouraging segregation, racism, or violence against other races, are not shutting down speeches by sem-radical leftists. I am vastly less concerned about them than a media which is doing these things to the right, gives interviews to and takes antifa seriously, of universities which support things like a "white-free" day, of vast swathes of protestors who shut down semi-radical, nonviolent rightists.

I don't know what reality you live in, where there is so much racism everywhere that a color-blind, individualist approach to life is more damaging than a collectivist, all-controlling idealogy that wants to label everybody according to their skin color. I don't see the people around me oppressing each other by their race. I don't see 50% of the population around me openly admitting that racism is good (and if there were actually that many racists, they would not need to keep it a secret). I don't see 50% of the people around me thinking that Hitler had the right idea. I don't see ANYONE doing these things, so if these things are still a problem at all, which they probably are, they're pretty rare, and occur as individual decisions, not as cultural occurences.

Most issues are not racial issues. Most problems faced by minorities are not racial problems, and are not caused by racism. That's illegal, it's been illegal for decades. It's not that they don't have problems, it's that these are class problems, and the only genuine solution to them must be class-based policies.

I don't know that we can actually come to any agreements if we can't agree on what's real. I definitely think that the problem is that you're not giving enough weight to your own observations because you consider them to be "anecdotes". In theory, statistics would be more reliable, but they're so easy to manipulate that both sides have loads of unreliable statistics that can't be trusted. I'm guessing that the vast majority of your evidence of this rampant racism in society is from the media and internet, not from real life. Go out and look, re-examining your memories and experiences. How many racists have you met or encountered? How many acts of racism, bullying, or discrimination have you encountered, and how many have been against each race (including whites)? Now if you're white, then to some degree it's difficult to distinguish between the theory that "discrimination doesn't occur often" or "discrimination only occurs to minorities when I can't see it", but at the very least the absence of evidence is strong evidence in favor of absence. Or rarity. I'm not claiming that racism doesn't exist, but if it's so rare that I cannot remember witnessing a single instance in my life, then it's either rare period, or they are incredibly good at hiding it from the general public. Treat every source as questionable, look at reality, and then figure out whose theory best fits your observations.

********* I wouldn't bet on it based on anectodat data alone, but what we have are multiple interpretations of causes given the same statistical date, or multiple statistical studies that don't quite agree on all of the details. So we might hear group 1 is saying "here are statistics that show black people are poorer on average than white people. The obvious interpretation is that this is caused by widespread discrimination" group 2 says "here are statistics that show black people are poorer on average than white people. The obvious interpretation is that this is caused by black people being less intelligent than whites" and group 3 says "here are statistics that show black people are poorer on average than white people. The obvious interpretation is that this is caused by the breakdown of the black family unit and lack of good father figures for youth"

Then I can use my anecdotal experiences as evidence that allows me to weigh how trustworthy these interpretations are of the exact same data. I don't see widespread discrimination, I see social censure of people who act racist openly, I am aware of explicit laws against it in pretty much any institutional form. It's possible for it to exist AND be hidden, but the more ands you have to add to a theory the more conspiracy-like it becomes and the less likely it is to be true. So I find group A to be less credible than I would if I did encounter racism.

The black people I interact with tend to be about the same intelligence as the white people I interact with, although that's much more likely to have sampling biases since most of the individuals I interact with are college students. But nevertheless, I find group B to be less credible than I would if I encountered a noticeable difference between black and white people.

I very rarely encounter people who have grown up without a father figure AND tell me this, so I have pretty much no anecdotal evidence for or against group C. However I have encountered studies in the past that show the influence of good role models and father figures especially for young boys and how it influences crime rate, and nobody seemed to be disputing them at the time when they weren't being used in a political issue, so I find it consistent with previous data and so find group C to be slightly more credible than I would apriori.

I'm not using my experiences to create new theories, I'm using them to guide my common sense in trusting other peoples' theories. They have a lot more data points, but they can't all be true because they're contradicting each other, and they have a lot more hidden motivations which makes the data less trustworthy to me than my own experiences, so each one of my data points is more valuable than several of theirs.

No. Just because you didn't see discrimination doesn't mean it wasn't there. The point of many identity politics movement is to say "You don't get to pretend our suffering doesn't exist". By your metrics, things were better in the 90s when we didn't have so many controversies about gay marriage.

******* No, the point of most identity politics movements is to promote their own identity politics movement as a memetic institution. Every problem that is classified as a race problem gives their movement more power and influence over how much control they have in society, and so they are heavily incentivized to classify every problem as a race problem even when it's not, or has a small racial component but a much larger class or social component. In a world where these movements suceeded and racism went completely extinct, every black studies major would suddenly be unemployed, every political analyst who specializes in race would lose their career. That is, if it went extinct AND everyone knew that it had. This would give them a huge incentive to convince people that it wasn't extinct, that everything was still racist, and they would still be fighting for more power and special privileges.

If you did live in this world, would you notice? How do you know you aren't in it now? I don't think we are, but there's a continuum, and I think we're a lot closer than you think. The existence of these groups provides pretty much no evidence in either direction because it would exist in both worlds, and the majority of the issues faced by minorities are not caused by racism, and will not be solved by racial policies.

Try thinking about the opposite side. Is it possible for an otherwise reasonable and good person to view racism as not evil?

The libertarian in me is okay with racism. That is to say I think people have every right to be racist. It can even be useful to an extent, inasmuch as "racism" is a heuristic shortcut for thinking about groups of people; it's lazy thought, and it has many pitfalls, but not intrinsically evil.

Maybe I should say it this way: racism is unacceptable, but not intolerable. From a pragmatic point of view, in order to achieve long-term goals, it's necessary to tolerate many things that are otherwise unacceptable. A quick and easy example: As a conservative, I find it unacceptable for Alabama to send a Democrat to the senate, but it is intolerable for them to send Roy Moore. Ideological purity be damned, I will not be associated with a child molester.

Of course I kind of understand why you would feel angry and start considering more extreme ideas , but in that case the kind of solutions your brain will suggest more easily are the kind of solutions that would work in the ancestral environment , but not now.Most people in the opposition aren't neo-nazis , in fact , a really low amount of people are neo nazis .You cant get the opposition to agree whith you by force , or by being angry at them , again that is the kind of thing that could work in the ancestral environment(by convincing who can be convinced and getting everyone else out of the tribe) , but in big countries it just leads to people being increasingly more divided , radical and eventually violent.

Are you sure that being more radical and equating everyone in the other side of the political spectrum whith the neo-nazis will lead to less racism? .Or are you actually thinking that because you are angry whith them so you want to punish them and then rationalize reasons why doing it is going to help ? .Because I don't see how that will help convince the other side , in fact I see a lot of ways it can lead to things getting worse . You cant subjugate half a country , you can subjugate the evil people whith the help of everyone else , but if you start saying that everyone on the other side is evil , you aren't going to get their help, and they will believe you less when you tell that racism is important ,or that someone is racist or a nazi because they will be angry whith you ,,witch will make you angrier because you think in doing so they are tolerating evil , which will make them more angry , creating a feedback loop of people getting angry at other people and dismissing the other side's opinions. It's really unlikely that in the big mostly arbitrary conglomerations of ideas that is the political spectrum happen to perfectly divide good and bad ideas, or true and false beliefs (which doesn't necessarily mean that both happen to be equally right or wrong but its bad anyway, and everyone things their group is the best ) .

Its not a question of which side is righter , its just that being polite and trying to convince people ,even being manipulative about it is the only option, not only moraly , but practically , if its isn't working for you can only try harder or in a different way . And if you think it's naive to believe that the situation can can be solved that way , then at least things wont go worse by respecting the rights of people ,and you can get more info about their actual views to figure out other ways of solving the issue. Really consider if whatever other idea you have was actually generated by your problem solving ability trying to find how to get people to be less racist or something else.

I say all this because I'm getting the impression that the main change between you a month ago , and you right now , is that you fell more strongly about the issue ,and you tried talking to some people on the other side , but it didn't work and those are reasons for why you are angrier now and therefore more inclined towards being more radical , not reasons why now you are better at deciding which plans will lead to less racism .

And remember , there are a lot of other people suffering in the world for thousands of reasons, and right now you aren't deciding everyone else is evil for not trying to help.

**** This is my favorite response. What I've learned from this discussion is that my self righteousness is tied into my self loathing since it is my realizations about how I had enabled evil just by thinking in ways I considered normal that led to me taking a more hardline stance.

That is unlikely to change, I still believe that I am intrinsically privileged in ways I am incapable of understanding due to being a white middle class male and implicit bias is something I must be ever vigilant against, but you managed to remind me that I can't allow that to consume me.

Upon realizing I had impulsively placed less value on people who happened to be outside my social group and not taken notice of their suffering, which vastly exceeded my social group, I committed myself to feeling as much empathy as possible for people I never did. Now I find myself in constant anguish now that I can't ignore their suffering anymore.

I want to prevent as much suffering as I can among people who are powerless to protect themselves, but I don't have the ability to do anything that I wasn't already so I just try and correct people when I think they're thinking in ways that I was before. Since communication is difficult, especially for me, this hasn't gone well.

Having been through many depressive episodes over the past few years, I now believe that the anxiety, self hatred, and mind consuming nihilism I felt then is what people who aren't privileged feel /all the time/ due to the behavior of the privileged. That is something I cannot tolerate and don't know how to deal with the fact that so few other privileged people believe the same.

I'm not going through a depressive episode right now, I've been doing very well over the last year, I just have no idea how to confront suffering that I now see everywhere. I feel the crushing pain of despair eating at me every day and I can't stand seeing other people suffer even that much, but I know they suffer far more due through no fault of their own.

**** I didn't that the opposition are the only tribalists, I'm saying that they are literally willing to vote for a man accused of pedophilia than a democrat. There are democratic politicians who committed sexual assault too, but at least liberals don't want that to keep happening.

***** Twenty years ago, there were liberal feminists arguing that it was fine to overlook sexual assault, even rape accusations, for the sake of protecting liberal political interests. The real test of those principles, in this modern panic, will be when a Democratic senator is accused in a state with a Republican governor. Do you really believe that there wouldn't be plenty of Democrats arguing that The Big Picture necessitates overlooking some small, personal evil? Do you really believe that, of the people who gave us "No bad tactics, only bad targets?" There have been a number of instances of social justice progressives rallying to the defense of proven pedophiles (and not 14 year olds, but prepubescent) in the last few years, including a magazine (iirc, Slate) scrubbing their archives of anti-pedo articles and publishing a sympathetic look at the phenomenon.

Betting against "Politics is the mind-killer" is virtually always a losing proposition.

****** Yeah, I believe that happened. I think it's terrible that it happened and would hate to see it happen again. It doesn't make both sides morally equivalent when one wants to enact policies that will hurt more people than the other party.

******* Not being morally equivalent doesn't mean one side is made of only evil people , or that one side is right about everything, or that dismissing the views of the other side will help convince them. Reversed stupidity is not intelligence .

******** I agree, but I still think one side is causing and will cause more suffering than the other so choosing the option that causes less suffering is the only virtuous option. Every person who doesn't choose the same means that more suffering is more likely and that is an outcome I should prevent if I can.

*** I underwent the same transformation earlier this year. I no longer think fascists deserve free speech and vastly prefer the way Germany handles them to the way we do in the US. The risks of allowing that ideology even an inch of breathing room are simply too great. In addition, I've come to the conclusion that the only word which adequately describes the Republican Party as an organization is Evil, and given the magnitude of what they have done to the world at large I'm not sure if even that is enough.

That said, those are just facts about me. The best way forward right now is not righteous face-punching, but bringing enough people on board our causes to step us back from the point where violent revolution will become necessary. Fixing everything at once isn't in the cards, we just need to halt the progression.

Despite the obvious corruption of our government at every level, I do still have some hope on that front. Mueller's investigation is advancing at a frankly shocking pace by comparison to the Watergate investigation, and given the number of people very close to the President he already has in his sights publically, I wouldn't be surprised if he presented damning evidence in time to affect the 2018 elections. That will do nothing to change the minds of the 35% of this country who are unabashedly evil, but it will affect everyone else. Remember, Trump did not get a majority of votes last time, and this time we have the entire country enraged.

Even if you believe the Democratic party is also somewhat corrupt, they have every political reason to impeach the President if they manage to retake Congress. Even if they don't, making him a lame duck will stem the bleeding, and two more years of random flailing will do nothing to help the Republicans' chances.

These monsters were elected in large part because they made promises they could not keep to the people of the American Midwest, and that is something they cannot cover with propaganda. Jobs simply are not returning to the coal towns which voted them in, they have utterly failed to do anything with healthcare, and their tax bill is easy to campaign against with the line "Your tax break ends in ten years. His doesn't." Hell, their laughable attempts at a "Muslim Ban" have even shown they can't get appeasing the KKK right. These are people we can get into the fold with the right kind of populism.

We can still fix this.

This is functionally an admission that their arguments are stronger than yours. But more pertinently, repression of Nazi speech, alongside street violence against them, was actually an integral part of their rise to power. It gave them an oppressed/victim narrative that grew the movement considerably. As was mentioned elsewhere in this thread, this sort of thing is just going to push them further; it's the exact same logic progressives tout regarding the radicalization of Islam. You're even doing the exact same thing progressives used to decry when Republicans would condemn all Islam. If you're declaring that /all/ Republicans are evil, then you're functionally normalizing their actual extremist element.

***** I don't think it's an admission their arguments are strong at all. Their arguments are 100% based on lies! However, the ideas of fascists have proven to be pernicious and self-sustaining, and given the damage they do to society just by existing that is not acceptable. Censoring them just enough that their choices are go to prison or look utterly ridiculous (as has been done in Germany, where they are forced to wave Confederate flags because all of their other possible symbols are banned), limits the amount of damage they can do by making them look far less appealing to the kinds of people it is easiest for them to recruit.

**** I would say that no government whether left or right can be trusted with the ability to censor their opponents without eventually turning to tyranny. I would be right but incitement to hatred laws are surprisingly bipartisan and haven't lead too far down the slippery slope as far as I can tell though they are inching towards further censorship.
