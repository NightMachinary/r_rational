** The problem is that it the results gained a lot of popularity during the years and only few people know about the methodical issues but I think it is getting better.

My personal favorite results misunderstanding is that fact that in communication only 7% of the information is conveyed by words. :-) That is so obviously not true generally it is almost funny. But the people will argue vehemently even though- and correct me if I am wrong - Mehrabian himself demented the paper (even though for the short sentences such as Hi or Thanks it might actually hold).

Iiiiiii dunno.

Compare speaking to me in person with reading these words. In person, there's a lot you can tell about me - my approximate age, my taste in clothing, my general health, how closely I am paying attention to whatever you're saying in return, certain information about my ancestors encoded in the colour of my skin, shape of my nose, etc., etc. None of this comes over in a pure text-based medium. Even little things like the lengths of the pauses in my speech, whether or not I'm looking you in the eyes, and how often I blink contain information.

Now, overall, that's a lot of information. To say that it's about fourteen times as much information as is contained within my spoken words - well, that stretches credulity, I will admit. But, at the same time, I know that a lot of this information passes me by; yet the fact that I do not recognise it, largely by virtue of not being Sherlock Holmes, does not mean that the information is not sent to me.

And the information on (say) gender, or state of health, despite not (usually) changing over the course of a conversation, is nonetheless being continually transmitted.

--------------

Of course, in the general case, the percentage of /intentionally/ conveyed information sent by words is probably more like 70-90% (with most of the remainder consisting of various gestures). And most of the unintentionally conveyed information is irrelevant to the topic under discussion, whatsoever that topic may be.

**** There's a lot of nonverbal information we get during conversation, but there's only a finite amount of information people will glean from your body language. If you converted it all into words, it would likely be a few thousand words, max. So it looks like for short conversations your best information-transfer speed is to talk in person, but there's some point where the speed increase from reading makes it much faster to write down everything and send it in an email.

**** Although I agree with your point, I'll that this is dependant of your ability to extract these informations. I am for example quite oblivious to many facial and tone cues that might be dead giveaway to someone else (example : I might detect sarcasm based on context but rarely with tone alone) . Also I am on purpose trying to not consider differently sex, age, race etc. This might be wishful thinking but I think this doesn't come to my attention unless directly relevant to the point of the discussion. On the other end, as a developer I tend to more carefully ponder choices of words, sentence complexity and structure, proper use of grammar etc. To me there is no way words convey less than 80% of meaning.

***** Oh, yeah. I, too, will fail to extract most of the non-verbal meaning in a face-to-face discussion; and most of said non-text information is, in any case, (a) irrelevant to whichever discussion is at hand and (b) not what the person doing the communicating intended to communicate at that point in time in any case.

But just because I fail to extract it, or it's not immediately relevant, doesn't mean that the information isn't /there/.

If you're looking for the percentage of /intentionally conveyed and understood/ meaning, then I'd put text information at somewhere between 70% and 90% (with most of the rest taken up by things like gesture, tone of voice, and so on).

**** Well you could go deep and define information through entropy seeing two people as two systems and the communication as a protocol that helps to synchronize states between these two systems (reducing entropy or uncertainty). Then you could "measure" how much of the different channels of communication help to synchronize the state, e.g. words, tone, gestures...

But no need to go as deep here. Another analogy - people servers, communication - data transfer would work as well. Then the question is how much data gets transfered through different channels.

The easiest intuitive rebuttal of words = 7% of info (let's say on average) would be to imagine that the people communicate only with bla bla bla noises (hence tonality, gestures are there, words are gone). That is according to the theory 93% of information gets through... Well... :-)

One of the things that attracts me to LessWrongian rationality is the adherence to calling a spade a spade. You shouldn't fudge the truth to make the point.

Not every German at the time was a Nazi, and there were certainly no-scarequotes-needed Good Germans of the time, just as the people running the gas chambers were most certainly bad. If your issue is that statistically too many people think they are in the former category, advocate for good epistemology and calibration; it is possible to be gooder than average, even if it can take work.

But if you get better results out of occasionally misleading or manipulating /others/ than always /telling/ the truth no matter the context, doing the latter thing is not rational, it's just... well it's not even nice because often saying what you believe without a filter is rude.

I believe that part of being a good person is having safeguards against being pressured into doing evil, or defaulting to evil. But you don't get people to implement those safeguards by telling them “you're not a good person, here's how you become one.”

****** As long as a person is actively and accurately making the distinction between "true" and "useful", I think they're already in a better position than most of the population. I, like most other self-identifying rationalists, value knowing a truth that will make me unhappy over believing a falsity that will make me happy, but I'm not above using inexact heuristics and useful conceits to accomplish my goals. It's just a matter of not deluding yourself with them and always supervising the situation to make sure they don't get out of control. In this way, conceits can be useful in a context other than "misleading others". (And don't forget that all heuristics are, by definition, conceits. They lead to biases, but they're undeniably useful.)

For example, there's the difference between utilitarianism and, for example, virtue ethics. Utilitarianism is objectively the correct way to make individual decisions most of the time, but virtue ethics is more useful from a collaborative and trust standpoint even if it would lead you to making "wrong" decisions in certain instances.

Many literary villains are cold-hearted utilitarians who feel justified causing misery to the few for the benefit of the many. Many Heroes, who most readers sympathize with, can't abide any intentionally-caused misery happening within their awareness, even if it was a byproduct of a greater good, so they pronounce the cause "Evil". Utilitarianism will often not make you many friends.

So, how do you decide if the cost of making wrong decisions sometimes by acting under virtue ethics or deontology is worth the resulting reputation effect and ability to "get things done" that it leads to by making you a "good person"? Utilitarian calculations, obviously. If they work out one way, act that way. If they work out the other, act the other. So, you could say that utilitarianism is "correct", but virtue ethics is an "often useful" conceit for accomplishing your utilitarian goals if they extend beyond a single instance of a dilemma.

"Good person" is far too loaded a term and, luckily, philosophy has progressed past the point where people constantly tried to define what it means to be one. Remember that words and labels are loose sets drawn around roughly adjacent things in thing-space. There are no necessary or sufficient conditions. That said, the words "good person" and "bad person", while often loaded, are still sometimes useful. It's just that whatever conclusion you draw will never be 100% true, so it's important to keep that in mind and never treat your "useful conceits" as "absolute truth".

This might be pedantic but from what I read in Man's Search for Meaning, the nazis actually made other jewish people take care of the gas chambers and such. So more like bad people coercing the bad morally inclined or easily manipulated people into doing evil than anything else.

​

IIRC there was this sort of class system where the 'evil' slave jewish guards were treated better, and the good people suffering on the hands of both the guards and the nazi administration.

***** "Calling a spade a spade" only works when the concept of a spade is well-defined. The question if whether or not something is a spade is largely a question of fact - is it a stick with a flat end used for digging? While there's some definitional overlap with, say, shovels, there's no question of which one is the spade when comparing with a tree or a house.

"Bad person" versus "Good person" is not a question of fact, or if is, nobody can agree on which facts precisely are required. In the vast majority of cases, it's instead a question of /definition/, where we disagree on which categories we should sort things into. Definitions do not (in principle) imply facts about the world, and thus cannot be wrong, per se, only more or less useful. "Is Pluto a planet" doesn't have a truth value beyond what various astronomical conferences have decided, and neither before nor after it lost that status was anyone saying anything false when they (before) said that it was, or when (after) they said it wasn't.

As for this particular question, I would say it's defensible to include "people who under under the right circumstances may become Nazis" in the category "good people", if only because the "good people" category is already distorted in a lot of people to begin with, and absent the ability to solve that, we might as well warp adjacent categories to compensate.

(And if it weren't obvious, this is just a hack-job summary of /How an Algorithm Feels/ and /The Categories were Made for Man/, which make similar points a lot better)

It may be that 'intelligence' is ultimately a flexible definition, but fundamentally there is an object-level thing that it's talking about and that thing is not equally distributed.

Hm. If I had to raise an objection to that analogy, it's that "everyone is equally likely to" is a precise, falsifiable claim. Compare "You don't have to be very intelligent to succeed academically". It's much closer to the original statement, I think, in that it implies two categories of people - "good" versus "bad" people in one case and "very intelligent" versus "less than very intelligent" people in the other - without specifying at all where the line is drawn.

This is abstract, of course, and doesn't necessarily have bearing on the merit of the particular comment we're dissecting. I'm mostly here to make general claims about definitions and falsehoods, so I'll cede any object-level points in that regard.
