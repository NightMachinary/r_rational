** What did Flagg show to Haley in the vision? Flagg making his narrator (King?) write his own torture?

I love me a metafictional twist. Taking bets on whether the text stays violet in the next chapter.

Also... did she just put Shawn in a narrative icebox until the world is safe for him again?

** Huh, that twist at the end is clever.

I totally want them to munchkin the fuck out of this though. Switch narrator whenever it is convenient based on what the plot demands.
