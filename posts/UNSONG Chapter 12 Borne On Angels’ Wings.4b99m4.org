****** Yeah, except it's easy to just heap on tasteless gruesomeness.

What Worm does so well is that the Grim and Dark are emergent properties of the setting. I'm certain UNSONG does that too.

** So...Erica didn't notice the front wall of the house collapsing. She only noticed the gunshots and the darkness, which happened /after/ Aaron collapsed the wall.

Also, that was an amazing escape scene. Erica is truly a fish in water.

(Omgggg. /Live-in angel's assistant!/ That is /absolutely/ a job in this universe, assuming no metaphysical or legal stuff that we haven't found out about yet. Imagine staying with an angel in order to take care of all of the complicated and/or depressing stuff that fallen angels can't handle.)

  Still other texts say the Messiah will come in a generation that is both the most righteous and the most wicked. I don't even know what to think of that one.

Joint over and underdiagnosis! Kinda. Ish. It's definitely this one, though.

Ish. Ishmael. Call me Ishmael. Maelstrom. Hunter of the white whale. Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind. Reap the maelstrom, the mal-storm, revenge, justice, punishment for violating God's command that you proselytize to Niveneh. Imprecision as natural consequence of brokenness: hold the edges loosely lest they cut against your skin. When you cleave reality at the joints, it cleaves back. This is fun.
