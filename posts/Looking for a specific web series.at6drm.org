Pretty sure I found it linked before on this subreddit.

Takes place in modern times\\
Girl is raised by her father (mother ran off), she's a student journalist, somehow ends up getting sent off to a magical school.\\
The school is on an island.\\
It turns out her mother didn't run off, but was captured by the big bad and is being held as a slave.

*** Rational? Sorta. There are people who have the power to kill monsters and take a bit of their powers. They use this by giving them good weapons, training them, and killing weak monsters that are deemed safe by scarier people. There are a lot of weird physics and it frequently feels like things are being invented as it goes. There are a lot of plans, pressures, factions and secrets. To the point that almost nothing is not indicitive of a larger thing. The main character is very "Chosen one"

It is fairly good. I quit reading when I caught up as I have a hard time reading things as released, but want to go back and re-read it. Lots of magic school and monster of the week early on.

Decently long, still in progress.

Still in progress.

All in all, I enjoy it and would recommend. It seems like the set up for a tabletop game that I would love to play. Not amazing, but definitely above average.

*** It's not over yet lol... it's in the last arc or two, I think.

I thought it was good, read it twice. Quite a lot going on.

I'd say it's definitely at least not irrational? Probably doesn't stand up to the standard of some of the folks around here, but I thought The Gods are Bastards was pretty rational too, and that's a contentious one, so my opinion is questionable.

Maybe wait a month or two for it to wrap up? I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a serial... Easy to forget who's who with all the characters and plot running around.

***** Not op but I can tell you a bit about Gods are bastards:

All in all it was an entertaining read, although i did stop on the middle of reading it and then picked it up again. It seemed to have gone on hiatus somewhere along last summer though, so I dont know what its current status is.

Things I liked:

- good worldbuilding and magic system
- interesting plot

Things I didn't like:

- characterisation and telling instead of showing: characters are often described one way and then shown as the complete opposite

- a lot of in your face Social justice undertones - which can bother you if you don't agree with them (like in my case)

- lack of a positive male lead i could empathise with and use to immerse myself further into the story (totally subjective)

Now it may seem like the story has more cons than pros, but that's just because these are the glaring flaws that stood out to me. The story was still a very enjoyable read and I would recommend it if you like fantasy novels.

It wasn't really a hiatus; the author ended the 14th book in August 2018 and began posting the 15th in December 2018. But during that time he kept publishing side chapters regularly, as part of the rewards promised for his Kickstarter funders. If you take a look at the bonus chapters at the bottom of the table of contents, 28 - 59 were all published during that time.

Book 15 is still having chapters posted regularly these days.

I'm curious, how far did you get in the series?

******* Ah right, my bad. I wasnt really interested in those bonus chapters so I must have interpreted that as him going on hiatus.\\
I finished book 14, and then I stopped reading because he was posting mostly bonus chapters instead of advancing the story.

It didn't feel that social justice to me. But I don't think it handles politics that well. It's trying very very hard to say politics is very complicated and nuanced, but it only demonstrates a surface level understanding of political issues; and as time goes on the theives guild become more of a political mary sue.

******* I dont know, Its been a while since I've read it but I distinctly remember myself getting annoyed whenever Trissiny would go on one of her feminist rants - that's the most "in your face" SJW stuff i can point out off the top of my head.

It has a bit of a SJWy feel in general though, with no true positive (straight) masculine character - Toby is gay pacifist, Gabriel is kindof a dork although he grows throughout the book - Darling is the closest to a positive masculine archetype, but he's morally gray and kinda sociopathic so not a good example.

Most of the main characters are (strong and independent) women, while a (villain) character who exhibits masculine traits and traditionalist views is so grossly caricaturised that there is nothing redeeming about him (Shook).

These things bother me, because as a male reader I like having a character to insert myself into, which was sorely lacking in Tgab.

***** Personally, The Gods Are Bastards is among my top fiction online, ranking up there with A Practical guide to Evil, HPMOR, and Worm.

Well thought out plots, great writing, serious challenges faced, real-world issues discussed (though I do think it's slightly preachy, but really toned down - comes up more in comments), and an amazing backstory and twist halfway through.

*** I read up to... book 21 or so, I think? I enjoyed it, though I'd say it's more rational-adjacent than purely rational, though it's been long enough since I went through it that I don't recall exactly why that is. It also feels very "fast." There's little downtime between big plot twists or action sequences. There is also some REALLY unsettling violence in it. Like, I'm not one to get squeamish about writing generally, but there were a few scenes that really stuck with me in how horrifying they were. All that being said, I really enjoyed the plot and the worldbuilding. I should go back and reread it sometime, but I'll probably wait until it's finished.
