Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You live in a world where 10% have the power to use telekinesis.

But they can only effect there own +magic particles+ ectoplasm. They can also transmute the ectoplasm into fake material. It reverts slowly back.\\
And there are some ways to block the telekinesis. (Like with distance, a thick layer of someone elses ectoplasm, and probably other stuff)Speed (and acceleration) of telekinesis is limited to a human punch (~30km/h or~20mph) (but you could transmute a bow and shoot an ectoplasm arrow faster)\\
And the temperature is always that of the surrounding (but you could build a freezer).\\
The energy you give the environment comes out of your body (produced by your mitochondria). So no free energy.\\
Also, that is still true: " When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body. "

​

Also to prevent chemistry shenanigans, no (solid) particles smaller than

- They have only a limited amount of ectoplasm. Like weak magic user have 1kg, the strongest have 1000kg of that stuff.
- Ectoplasm can temporally simulate solid, liquid or gaseous matter. Like a (steel) sword, water or helium. Some can hold that state for 1min other for 1000min (16,6h). It is harder to control liquid and gases. By a factor of 10 (liquid) and 100 (gases)
- Some have a telekinetic range from 1m other 1000m (1km). (They can't effect ectoplasm outside of there range.) You have a vague sense where your ectoplasm is, but you want to see it, if you want to control it with any skill.
- Some can produce a force of 10 Newton other the force of 10000Newton [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(force][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(force)]]) (without the mass of there own ectoplasm or it's speed included) So one could have a coin of ectoplasm and another a bolder and both could have the same carry capacity.
- Some can move one solid object, liquid blob or cloud, others can move up to 100.

Normally that all depends on talent and training, but for your min/maxing you can use 1000 points. You also start with 1 point in every category (so you have 1005 points). That means you can have 1kg ectoplasm, you can transmute for 1 min, in a distance of 1m, 10 Newtons and 0,1 objects. (0.1 objects means you can use one object with 10% of the ectoplasm you have. 1.3 Objects means you can control 2 objects, but one can only have 30% of your ectoplasm reservoir. And it becomes irrelevant at 9.1 objects.)

The object rules/points may change. Keep in mind, a crossbow is made of different parts, which would be counted as different objects.

So, what would you do, if you got transported (without any objects or devices) or reincarnated in a fantasy world with a tech level of the renaissance (~15.-16. century), where 10% have ectoplasm and monsters like goblins and dragons exist. You have all the knowledge you can google now.^^

Or what cool stuff should people there be able to do?

How would you fight/built your powers in a death tournament against single opponents?

And how if you had to fight against armies without ectoplasm?

EDIT: formating

Edit2: I forgot to mention how ectoplasm works untransmuted: It acts like ghosts, can't touch, nearly no interaction, can't see someone elses (just a vague sense that it is there and maybe where, if you have the sixth sense) can go through walls It still has mass for the purpose of acceleration (with telekinesis) , but you can't weight something down. You can store and hide all your ectoplasm inside your body (even if it should have a higher volume than your body) And if you transmute it in a place where already matter is (like air or water or maybe loose sand, the ectoplasm pushes the material there away with a really small force. Even loose sand is nearly too much to push away.

​

As in, infinite thermoconductivity? Does this apply to pure ectoplasm as well as transmuted, fake materials? So if you place a rod of it between two rooms with a difference in temperature, they'll equalize much faster than normal?

​

For offensive applications, my first thought was to gather a lot of gaseous ectoplasm in the air, then collapse it to a solid in an enemy's throat. What defenses are there against this?

​

And speaking of the application of Newton's third law, if you make an ectoplasm fist and punch a wall, does it feel like you punched said wall with your actual hands, or does your fake hand just recoil and possibly take damage/break as though it received it?

​

Well, if the enemy has his own ectoplasm, he can keep a thick layer of it around himself to prevent you from inserting your ectoplasm into his body. Or just stay out of your attack range, seeing as you needed to invest a lot of points into making your ectoplasmic gas last longer than 0.01min instead of range.

At the point of creation it has the temperature of its surrounding. If you make a rod inside a hole in a wall, it would be like if you put a rod into it with a temperature between the temperature of those rooms.

You can't transmute from one state into another. (Well you could cool it under the freezing point with normal physics) llYou would need to go back into ectoplasm. BUT you wouldn't need the gaseous state. You could just transmute ectoplasm inside the throat into some solid (since you are in range anyway). But that would be hard to aim if you cannot see inside the throat. Easier to just throw an ectoplasm knife into him.

Still you risk losing your ectoplasm, since your opponent could bubble yours with his.

A technique to counter this would be to always walk in a bubble of ectoplasm, if you can.

Still gas is a good way to kill non-mages (aka canon foddet). If you have the range, mass and time needed to suffocate someone (or poison if you can make it). Some ways around the limits I can think off.

Counter strategy: Have mages catch the gas inside bubbles until opponent is out of ectoplasm.

I forgot to mention how ectoplasm works untransmuted: It acts like ghosts, can't touch, nearly no interaction, can't see someone elses (just a vague sense that it is there and maybe where, if you have the sixth sense) can go through walls It still has mass for the purpose of acceleration (with telekinesis) , but you can't weight something down.

I will add it above.

#+end_quote

You don't really "punch". It would be like throwing a baseball. The thrower only has the opposing force of the throw. The ball get's the force/damage. Since you have a maximum of force you can apply with your telekinesis, that is the maximum of force that will hit your body. So it shouldn't matter if you accelerate a fist (to the max speed of 30kmh) or hit/push with that fist a wall. I think the force hits your whole body (or parts of every living cell of your body). It doesn't just hit your brain or liver or your (not existing) mana chacras.

I think you would have some kind of feedback. But it wouldn't feel like pain or be very accurate.

How long does it take to recharge though? Can I just create a gas for 0.01min repeatedly, over and over?

​

​

Say I invest enough points to move 5 solid objects. Can I still create 100 solid objects at the same time, and move 5 of them around to hit the others and get them all moving? For example, can I create 5 bows and have each fire 19 arrows at the same time?

​

> And the temperature is always that of the surrounding (but you could build a freezer).

​

I'm not sure I understand what this means. Suppose I go to an active volcano and create a hollow solid sphere of ectoplasm within the lava. Is this sphere as hot as the lava? Now let's say I lift up his sphere full of lava into the air. Does the ectoplasmic shell instantly become air temperature? Does it stay hot because of the lava inside? Or does it just lose heat as any ordinary object would? In other words, is there any way for me to carry a ball of hot lava around with me wherever I go?

​

> Or what cool stuff should people there be able to do?

​

Can you create explosions? First, create an empty airtight solid container out of ectoplasm. Then endlessly insert ectoplasm into the container and make it become a gas. Eventually the air pressure will become too much and the container will explode. (To avoid hurting yourself, make the side of the container facing you much much thicker, so the explosion bursts out the other side.) If you can do this fast enough, you basically have an endless supply of grenades. For added lethality, add tiny hard balls or spikes to your container to make a frag grenade.

Hmm... I edited my first post after you posted. The ectoplasm transmuting into gas would push the air away with a force (no number given cause i don't want to calculate). It would be like if you open a valve of a container that is under constant pressure (not much pressure) and you close it after your ectoplasm limit is reached . There are formulars to calculate how much volume goes out per second.

Back to your question, you could but the work you do by pushing away air comes from your body. And the Volume/mass you create is limited by that. You don't create your whole reservoir instantly

But just write what you would do if it recharges fast. (Lava ball?)

#+end_quote

You probably couldn't push the lava away. But in the air above the lava creating a sphere with a hole (as hot as the air in a volcano) . Now you move it in the lava with telekinesis and fill it up and close it. The sphere acts from the moment you create it like a ordinary object (you can move with telekinesis). You would need to use material that doesn't melt (like some ceramics) and it still would lose heat over time.

But let's say you can have a ball of lava with you (with some handicaps). The limiting factor for size would probably be the force. And how long you can maintain the sphere would depend on your concentration (if you constantly recreate it)

#+begin_quote
  Can you create explosions?
#+end_quote

Yes, but... Energy comes from your body, you would need at least two objects (sphere + gas) and each metal shrapnel would be an object (of course doesn't count to your object limit if you don't telemove it) but you can't generate more than your object stat at the same time. Also still limited by maximum volume/second.So it wouldn't be that fast.

#+begin_quote
  Eventually the air pressure will become too much and the container will explode.
#+end_quote

Also the pressure inside can't be bigger than the your creation pressure (everyone has the same)

You could put the sphere in a cold place and make a liquid that is liquid at that temperature and a gas at room temperature. Just less controll

Or just make a chemical explosive. Just keep in mind, that your body produces that used energy. (So you could starve by throwing granates) And chemical explosives waste so much heat... i think... but I also heard sugar has more calories than some explosives.

​

If it recharges fast enough you basically have infinite duration (possibly by creating the objects in shifts). So you could build more or less permanent ectoplasmic structures (within a certain range of yourself). So with enough points in range and strength, you could build a literal fortress around yourself, and move it around slowly as you iteratively destroy and recreate parts further forward.

​

> Also the pressure inside can't be bigger than the your creation pressure (everyone has the same)

​

What exactly does this mean? If I slowly increase the pressure until it exceeds the creation pressure, what exactly happens? Does the container explode since it can't withstand the pressure? This is what I would expect and works great for making grenades. Or does the whole thing just disappear with no explosion?

​

If creating too much pressure doesn't work, how about creating anti-grenades? Start by creating a large object, then create another object that is an airtight shell around the first object. Disintegrate the first object, leaving behind a vacuum that causes the second object to implode. (If creation pressure is a problem, use an actual solid rather than ectoplasm for the second object. E.g. Pour molten iron over your first object until it solidifies as a shell. It would mean that you need to prepare your anti-grenades beforehand though.)

​

> You would need to use material that doesn't melt (like some ceramics) and it still would lose heat over time.

​

Heat loss could be slowed by using two layers of ectoplasm with a vacuum in between, like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_flask][vacuum flask]]. As for material, just use tungsten.

​

Wait, hold on. You can CHOOSE the material? Can you create radioactive materials, like a huge chunk of uranium that would instantly go nuclear? Or worse, a chunk of neutrons like that of a neutron star, which would explode out far more violently. I mean, it would kill you the moment you created it, but a kill everyone button has its uses.

Yeah, you can, but recreating it costs some energy. If your time is too short and you don't remember to recreate your fortress (cause you are fighting), you lose your defense. Your fortress can also be only max 1000kg at any point. (If you put all your points in ectoplasm mass)

You could also just create a fortress around you and move it with telekinesis. Probably slow moving, depending on its mass and your max force. Would be interesting how you spend your points and what would make a bigger fortress/tank.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

If outside pressure exceeds creation pressure, you can't create/transmute stuff there. So you can create stuff in water but (probably) not on the bottom of the ocean. Or you can't create a object inside ones body. Or destroy solid stone and bricks by creating something inside.

Since creation pressure is for everyone really low, you couldn't blow a warm water boiler. But a ballon would be no problem^{^}

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Sure you could do that. Vaccum wouldn't be perfect, since the material you use would give away atoms (Too lazy to translate/look up Dampfdruck on wikipedia) . I think vaccum bombs wouldn't be too OP to ban them (it would need to be in your range and is limited by how much mass you have), with some destroying pressure. Cause I was thinking of ectoplasm being somehow in an extradimensial space and you push out the material (with a fixed pressure) and destroying the material would mean you can push the material back into the extradimensional space. (Which would happen naturally) And if there is a vaccum on this side you would need to fight the sucking force.

#+begin_quote
  Wait, hold on. You can CHOOSE the material?
#+end_quote

Yeah, isn't that what transmute means? Changing one material (here only your ectoplasm) into anything? (Like lead into gold) I would say creating complex polymere chains (like plastic or wood) or big molecules is harder (more prone to errors and disintecration) than creating I'm thinking of people having specializations/talent. So some can create/control more easily ice/water other rocks. But I have no clue what the numbers would be for that and you are the OP protagonist so you obviously would have a trick to have the specialization of everything. (And if not, you could choose what you want)

#+begin_quote

Well, maybe... Your energy output depends on what your bodycells (mitochondria) can generate. You shouldn't be able to use up your whole body energy instantly. But if you could at max you can create Energy equal to 0.56 tons of TNT (assuming you have 80kg, it is all fat and 1 kg body fat has 7.000kcal=7.000.000cal) [[http://www.kylesconverter.com/energy,-work,-and-heat/tons-of-tnt-to-calories]]

*** A big bottleneck in uplift fiction is that a lot of modern tech takes precision equipment to manufacture.

Ectoplasm solves this really nicely. Create an ectoplasm copy of an object. Wrap it in an ectoplasm mold. Dismiss object 1. Fill mold with metal.

Then, I'd use that to make radios. Once I have radios, I can use fast communication to arbitrage the hell out of whatever commodity markets I can find.

I wouldn't let it be known that radio exists. Instead, I'd use my new wealth to set up wired communication lines,and imply that they were my trick to pass messages so quickly. (See: Barbed Wire Telephone)

Then, I'd use my advantage at machining stuff to make rifles.

Then, you have goblin bands up against rifle infantry units, where the rifle infantry gets instant communications.

***** Drop me in ye olden times, without magic, and I could eventually get a machine shop running. It would be a beast and a half to do.

The practical problem is that modern techniques need precision tooling. And it takes precision tooling to make precision tooling.

1KG of ectoplasm, plus the ability to make any 2 objects, (and apply precise forces at 10N!) lets me skip the iteration of slightly increasing precision and just make whatever component is the current bottleneck.

So the real power is ability to do modern machining. Fighting with this is like bludgeoning someone with a drill press. You could, but why?

For instance, I want a magnet. So I buy some iron nails and a rope. Then I make 500g of ectoplasmic gold wire, and a 500g ectoplasmic rare earth magnet.

Use magic to wrap the wire around a nail. Use magic to create some inductance coils. Twist the rare earth magnet in the rope until it's under a ton of tension. Release. Spinning magnet near induction coils produces DC current. DC current in a wire around a nail will magnetize the nail.

It would take me a couple tries to get the technique down (which coil is supposed to have more loops?) but inside an afternoon I'd expect to have a supply of permenant magnets. Do something similar for the rest of the half dozen bits you need to make a shitty AM radio.

Or, for a ready supply of money, buy a shallow box. Magic up some mercury. Pour molten glass onto mercury. Cool. Polish with summoned high grit abrasive and a rag. Used summoned glass scoring wheel to cut into panes.

The result is "float glass", and is better for windows than anything people had prior to 1950.

****** Well, you would need points in objects.

I still don't get why you need precision tooling for a radio.

But let's assume you can make all the stuff you need. Keep in mind you still are limited by the points you have and can't change them later. And other people there have probably less points and basically put them into random categories.

Two (unmentioned?) rules that are important for you: if you heat your transmuted ectoplasm up and time runs out/you dismiss it at higher temperature, the heat goes into your body. (Cause I want conservation of energy)

Secondly, you are assuming you can create stuff precisely. I first wanted to make a category control, but decided against it (hard to put numbers on it, describe it) and instead make the category time and gave everyone the same control. So you can only have solid objects bigger than 1mikrometer (i think that is the limit what you can still feel an edge with your fingers). And creating stuff is limited how good you see it. (So if you can't see 1mm difference in thickness you can't create it that precise... microscopes are no help^{^{)}}

Well the second rule for control is more like: You create/transmute material by pushing it out of an extradimensional space. So creating precise is like you add material with a 3d printer that you control with your hands, not a computer

But let's just say you found a way around that. And can do what you want. So you would get rich with trade and advance technology fast to our level. (Don't forget agriculture, people still need food.)

Keep in mind people there can use also ectoplasm. So they have a slightly different technology and needs than we did in the renaissance. For example they would have better mechanical devices (like catapults) since they can create steel in any shape fast with ectoplasm. Chemistry shouldn't be more advanced. Maybe even less so, since they would think everything is made out of ectoplasm...

*** How much focus does it need to maintain and move it about?

​

Does this mean I can have flight from the start at 30km/h for as long as my build allows? With just a thread / leather band around my torso, and enough force to make myself float?

​

Or I could just fly like mistborn mages 'fly' make a coin and push it into the ground, with enough force it should push me away from it, controlling angles and starting momentum you could fly faster this way. You could land with simple a simple controlled belt around your waist. You can just pull the coin back from the air, because of it's low mass it wouldn't slow you down.

​

You could easily throw things by tying them with a magic rubber band and flinging that around, including people. This means you could remote control things that already exist by just gluing it to your ectoplasm.

​

30km/h is actually enough force to punch holes through people with sharp objects. So I guess flying small spikes that you can control remotely, even with a range of just 20m you could basically defeat most humans with that.

​

Force shields for defense.

​

You could manually make the poisonous gas, put it inside a telekinesis canister with high pressure, remote gas bombs. There's some really silly things you could do to pressurize things with this power, just make a balloon fill it with any gas you want, than contract it with your power..

​

I guess you could breath underwater with oxygen bubbles (you don't need to make the oxygen just the container) and swim at 30km/h with a telekinetic belt or faster with a bit more thinking.

​

You could make strings and control people like puppets.

​

Transmute your power inside a fire... Including things like flammables and explosives.

​

Other than that I guess the obvious, manually build / pay people to build: Steam engines, factories, electric power plants, full plate armor, rifles, cars, artillery, tanks, gas masks, antibiotics, planes, bombs, machineguns... If you had some better understanding of electronics you could have pretty much anything modern manufactured for you, I don't though.

Hard to say. Depending on what you do. It is like if you want to do the same stuff with your hands (if you could do it with your hands). So if you move a needle around with your telekinesis and write something. It would be like you tried to move a needle with one hand and write with the other at the same time.

If you have high objects, you would be able to focus better, 9.1 objects means you can move 10 objects with your telekinisis as precise as someone can move 2 objects on individual paths.

So if you want to rub your belly, pet your head, most can do it. But they get problems if they jump at the same time.

Yeah, depending on your stats that should be possible. Keep in mind, you don't want to leave the ectoplasm coins behind (or you run out of ectoplasm). And the speed limit for your telekinesis doesn't care if you move or your ectoplasm relativ to you. So you probably only able to "fly" 15km/h (or max 30km/h by leaving coins behind) which would still be faster and more energy efficient than if you run.

Yeah, you can snipe people. But they can catch your ectoplasm by bubbling it. Battle mages probably have always sphere around them with captured ectoplasm. (Some would fake bigger spheres to pretend to be strong, others smaller to pretend to be weak.) You lose telekinesis control if someone elses ectoplasm bubbles yours. (If you are outside the bubble).

What would you do with it? Get rich and powerful so you could become Overlord of the planet? Make an university and make everyone's live better? (You would want food, meaning fertilizer, and pesticides for that. Tractors can be replaced by mages. And fight diseases with hygiene and antibioticums )

Personally I would make a trade empire and undermine monarchies by empowering peasants. Also making it like the Habsburgers and making alliances with marriages. While also trying to make a more ethical world. Meaning human rights, feminism (hard to combine with political marriages), gay rights, freedom of religion and animal liberation. Hard goals. Maybe starting a university for philosophy with babies so I can brainwash them with my moral values

Keep in mind, there are monsters like slimes, goblins and dragons...

How would you make force shields with that power? You would need ectoplasm matter there, and that would be not really different than holding up shields with telekinesis. Depending on what material you used as shields, someone can break them or shoot arrows through them.

By that I meant your bubble thing, full plate could stop any other telekinetic attack anyway. Maybe I'd need a gas mask and to be able to transmute water or some fire retardant in case somebody tried attacking me, but that'd be it.

To fight against other telepathic guys I'd just go full plate, and cut them down with a sword. Use my powers for defense mostly. I could just have a unit of 5-10 men with crossbows and shoot the enemy down if needed, or just charge them while protecting my men.

Damage is easy to deal, the part you should focus on is not dying.

PS. thinking about it now, I think you could move faster in flight than we though just because if the power can take you of the ground and you continue using it to push yourself in the air you'd accelerate and go faster as a result, kind of like a skate. Then after reaching what you discovered was your max speed you'd just time your pushes in order to maintain it.

Well, a bubble of ectoplasm would only stop them controlling their ectoplasm inside it. They could still throw something at you (like an arrow) or create poison outside your bubble. I doubt you could react fast enough to transmute the bubble into steel if someone shoots an arrow at you. And depending who you ask, an arrow could go through plate armor.

But yeah, full plate and sword is a valid strategy. (Also you can transmute a sword or armor parts, which you can control with telekinesis after.)

Not sure about the flight speed. The speed rule means, you can't focus your telekinesis on your ectoplasm, if it moves 30km/h relative to you. Let's say you put ~200 points in every category. So you have 200kg ectoplasm, a range of 200m, 200min, 20 objects and 2000N of force (that should be more than enough to keep you hovering, I think... F=m/a --> 2000= m/9,81 ~ m=200kg yeah, should work)

Now you create a coin/plate under you and push yourself up. Than one behind you (on the ground) and push yourself forward. Keep making coins/plates under you, so you don't drop. The coins don't move relative to the ground, but you do. If you move faster than 30km/h you can't target coins on the ground and you lose your ectoplasm. If you move at the speed limit for ectoplasm telekinesis, you can still move your ectoplasm in front of you, since the speedlimit is relative to you. (So you can move your ectoplasm at 60 km/h relative to the ground.) I think that was my mistake, I thought ectoplasm could only move 30 km/h relative to the ground. You need to still be wary of the range limit (here 400m) and keep in mind you have to accelerate your ectoplasm from 0 to 60km/h. (which comes out of the Force budget)

But yeah, "flying" would be like skating or how they fly in mistborn.

And no arrows don't go through steel plate and even if they make a hole on it which is Very unlikely, people used gambesons under it so the most an arrow could do is give you a bruise.

And please because I know somebody will do it, Agincourt is the battle you're thinking of, and no the arrows weren't going through plate. It's just that their armor gave them 100% damage reduction 95% of the time but there were so many arrows that the 5% of the time it didn't they were getting enough small wounds to force them to change strategy..

People weren't stupid, knights had been consistently charging archers while under fire for decades by then, it wasn't a stupid new idea some guy invented on the spot, they did it because it worked, until that time when it didn't, for several other reasons other than the armor itself, and they learned from it.

Same with pretty much swords and anything. Steel plate can only be defeated with guns, and it needed to be a musket, early guns couldn't go through it consistently either. Of course a few people can take you down, but on any sort of remotely fair fight plate armor was very hard to beat.

#+begin_quote

You are still ignoring acceleration. You'd go even faster, you accelerate more and more up to a maximum you could reach based on the speed of the power (Acceleration and speed are different things). So much more than that. Once you are on the air moving fast with your momentum you can just use your power as a belt and float, you wouldn't be moving relative to it at all.

And I guess then once there you can make some other sort of propulsion with your power, like wings or propellers of any sort to accelerate more. Again if you already have the momentum and your power is attached to you, it can give you more acceleration which as a result overtime will give you higher speed.

You could technically go as fast as air resistance wound allow you if you wanted.

And on air you can just wear any sort of wing suit (google it), and gain altitude by moving yourself. Flight is pretty much a given and the speed limit would be quite high.

It'd be better than mistborn flight because you can make things out of nothing and move them 30km/h faster than you, or if that's not possible you just attach the things you make to you and they take your momentum and can generate even more momentum to yourself by moving them. i.e wing flaps and propellers..

You can bet that even before we came over some people would have made wings and flown that way with speeds higher than 60km/h.

Not even sure what the misunderstanding is.

So I just say you totally could buy full plate or make it with ectoplasm. And it is a valid strategy in my mind at least.

The arrow and full plate would depend on bow and arrow and the armor. (I don't know how it was back then) Just keep in mind they could use ectoplasm to make better bows (or crossbows) or drop a 200kg from 200m on you... so you are not invincible.

Well you can create/transmute your ectoplasm into stone or something and push it away from you (making you faster with the opposing force). Until it reaches 30km/h difference and you can't target it (and you lose the ectoplasm) If you stop at 29km/h difference and make it follow you, but you would slow down again.

If you create wings and push them faster, you would get pushed in the opposite direction. Since you are connected you wouldn't move.

*** For direct combat applications, I'd default to nitrogen asphyxiation.

The reason that airlines say, "put on your own air mask, before assisting others" is that our lungs burn when we have too much CO2, not when we have too little O2. So, go into a low oxygen environment and you'll feel fine right until you back out. You need to put on your own mask first, otherwise you'll collapse half way into helping the other person.

A cubic meter of air is right around 1.5KG, so it's easy to get the mass. And it takes around 40 seconds to make someone pass out, so putting 200 points into duration gets me there.

Put some points into mass and force, and I should be able to rotate out cubic meters or nitrogen every time one is going to expire.

The reason to do this, instead of overt poison, is that it would be an out of context problem for people outside the modern era.

The audience would see two opponents square off. One feints. The other is confused by the feint and stumbles. Match ends. With no sign of poisoning and no concept of 'inert gas asphyxiation' there's no reason for the opponents to guard against poison.

Just keep in mind most people can hold their breath for a minute in rest. (Athletes longer). So one counter strategy would be to kill you fast, breath later. Another one would be to bubble your transmuted ectoplasm (or you) and let the gas vanish. Or staying out of your range and snipe you.

I think most battle mages would have a bubble of ectoplasm around themselves, to prevent people creating/transmuting a knife behind their back. And also making it harder to bubble them and cutting their control of their ectoplasm farther away.

*** It's pretty telling that no one thought of mages working together. 6000 weak mages could accelerate a small object to a decent fraction of the speed of light. Basically at those speeds, you're dealing with modern bombs in medieval times. An even larger army takes that into the scale of nuclear arms. The Battle of Lepanto had something like 140,000 people there (50,00 troops, the rest sailors and slaves). This plus the ability to make poison gas means that non-mage armies are relatively pointless.

Or imagine a team of mages that focuses on compressing matter. It probably wouldn't take that many working on an small point to get very high temperatures. They might even be able to make diamonds or diamond tools.

Castles would also be largely pointless without mages. Cannonballs and trebuchets become tug of war / homing missiles.

A bunch of mages could a powerful one up high, who could materialize a very heavy boulder, and just let it fall.

​

Basically, what it means is that medieval society doesn't make sense anymore. Instead you get a Spartan style tiered oligarchy with non-special people as slaves if the ability is genetic. If it's not, then a republic becomes more fashionable, because most people would remember their origins. Monsters aren't a threat unless they have the same abilities. Otherwise a dragon could just be /punched out of the air./ Though why Dragon's wouldn't use humans as slave labor is beyond me and structure their own societies.

​

If Goblins have the same power and breed faster, they would be on top unless they weren't good farmers. If they didn't, they would be wiped out, like the other species of humans that existed with us.

No, they couldn't. You seem to missed this part of the rules:

#+begin_quote
  Speed (and acceleration) of telekinesis is limited to a human punch (~30km/h or~20mph) (but you could transmute a bow and shoot an ectoplasm arrow faster)
#+end_quote

In some commands I explained it more. You can't target your own ectoplasm telekinetically, if it is moving faster than 30 km/h.

Please explain how 6000 people have enough calories to accelerate something to "a decent fraction of the speed of light" Assumption: Calories of 6000 people = 338 *10^{7} kcal (= 6000 x 7000kcal (for 1kg human fat) x 80kg (average bodymass) ) Calories to accelerate 1kg mass to 2997924 m / s (1% of c) = 1073319517265.7 calorie = 107 *10^{7} kcal [[https://www.ajdesigner.com/phpenergykenetic/kenetic_energy_equation.php#ajscroll]]

So they would need to burn 1/3 of their body mass in the time it takes the accelerating object to leave their range. (Which isn't possible, since they produce the energy via their mitochondria.) Which would kill them.

And in that assumption, the 6000 people are made completely of fat (highest energy density).

Put yeah, a mage could drop a bolder. They wouldn't need other mages, since they could make an ectoplasm glider and power a propeller (or start at the top of a mountain). Still they risk their ectoplasm gets bubbled and a bolder is a lot ectoplasm.

Let's assume standard fantasy flying dragon: a few tons, strong enough to fly with too small wings, fire breath. And basically extinct. If the dragon flies 200m up, most mages can only throw stuff (including ectoplasm) on them. Maybe dragon fire burns (destroys forever) untransmuted ectoplasm. Maybe dragonskin untransmute transmuted ectoplasm. Maybe dragons have an aura that suppress transmuting ectoplasm. Not sure what ability I give them, but 6000 soldiers prepared to fight a dragon should have a winning chance, maybe not a much higher one than 1000 people, but still a winning chance. (Also I plan to have smaller dragons and some non flying ones, and some with no fire... )

Other monsters: goblins use swarm tactics, kill one human for every 3 goblins is a good result for them doppelgänger/mimics surprise attacks and hide again (tiny) insect monsters poison sting/bite attacks (still a slap can kill them) harpies/flying monsters hit and run tactics, cause nobody looks up... ghosts no walls will protect you zombies, you morn your friend/wonder why he walks funny, until he bites you. And he doesn't stop from a crippling wound. fae and vampire's hypnosis attack would flatten you.

I think monsters are still a threat to everyone who isn't prepared to fight them. Of course an army against 1-10 monsters should always win. (Still, maybe the monsters escape unharmed or they kill more soldiers than the army wants/can tolerate.) Except against doppelgängers. More people means just doppelgängers need more time to kill them all.

  Basically, what it means is that medieval society doesn't make sense anymore. "in a fantasy world with a tech level of the renaissance" well, they don't need to live in a medieval society (i know fantasy world is often synonym with medieval time/society, didn't mean it that way), but at some point they should have the tech level of the renaissance. (even if they don't follow our tech tree) Still, I think king and lords are still plausible with genetic mages or random mages. Castles are less likely to matter though. (cause dropping bolders, flying mages...) We don't have powers and still have many different forms of governments. I think as long as you don't have quasi gods, you will find the whole political spectrum with enough time. Unless there is only one very powerful person (that can kill armies alone). As long as the (magic) power is somewhat spread over the population, society will not be vastly different.
#+end_quote

Also you get 1000 points, since you would be a summoned hero/reincarnated soul/the MC most other mages would get less points. The average mage would have 250 points, "randomly" spread in the categorie (talent, training, maybe genes). (Still there are some with more points than you.)

In the real world, without specialised machinery you can't propel a projectile with all that much force if it is too light, as (in assuming) air resistance quickly overcomes it.

However, in specific directions they can be very strong. While a carbon nanotube needle works likely be easily snapped, from what I understand force applied to the tip or tail of it wouldn't do much at all.

Also you need to somehow know where your needle is for aiming.

I think one knife or more would be better.

Or a crossbow/gun you control/reload with attached ectoplasm. You would still need to aim somehow.

But leaving needles on the ground and using them when you get an opportunity could save your live.

It seems very artificially restrictive. Easy to accidentally kill yourself too.

Basically, I don't like not being able to harness energy in a logical fashion because of an arbitrary limitation. It just seems a bit hacky. Surely if I create a windmill that gets spun by the wind, the only cost I need to pay is the cost required to maintain the windmill? But apparently not?

Swap bodies with president or king... at important meetings. Maybe discredit politicians with opposing political goals. Like go with the body of an anti-gay rights politician into a gay location 2 days before a bill about gay marriage or something. Or make a (gay) sex video with that body.

Small scale goal:\\
Get money by swapping with a rich guy and buy expensive (untraceable) stuff like jewellery or gold and hide it in some park. And then come back with my own body. Or sign a (prepared) contract to give away all the money to my body. Use that money for small scale goal.\\
Personal goals (like being popular, destroy bullies, get your crush...) Use other people's body to make yourself look good and your enemies bad. Or swap with the boy/girl friend of your crush and break up with him/her/it.

Good stuff you could do:\\
Basically everything above just with ethical rules and altruistic goals (use money for charity...)\\
Fight crime, by switching bodies with criminal. Wearing a wire with the body of some criminal or there associates. Confessing in the body of some criminal or doing a crime so the person gets arrested, would be too unethical for me.

*** One day isn't really enough to accomplish a huge amount^{*}. Even if you body swap with one of the most powerful people in the world, your goals wouldn't even be in the planning stages by the time you swapped back and they could cancel it.

So most of the best plans involve getting power to my actual self in a plausible way that's hard to reverse.

1.  Post a manifesto about how to solve all the world's problems given enough funding, get some friends to repost it various places so it's at least faux-viral. It doesn't actually need to be a working, or even particularly good, plan, though I'd do my best.

2.  Set up a video queue of documentaries on world wealth inequality, climate change, that sort of thing. (I don't expect this to help much but it's free so whatever.) Place the monitor in a dark room with no distinguishing features.

3.  Tie myself up in the dark room, watching the monitor. Have a friend around who's agreed to untie me after a day.

4.  Body swap with someone rich and evil who speaks a language I know, like Rupert Murdoch or a Koch brother.

5.  Notice my manifesto on the internet. Be moved to tears by it.

6.  Start asking my advisers to figure out how much money I can get into the hands of the manifesto-writer immediately.

7.  Chat online with myself for a while then arrange a bank transfer to myself.

8.  Spend whatever remaining time I have talking about how much better the world will be now that we're following the plan to whoever will listen. (That is, raise the social cost of going back as much as possible.)

9.  Write a note to myself explaining what I did with my day, then lock my bedroom door and go to bed alone even if whoever I am doesn't normally. (I'm rich and powerful and spent a whole day acting weird so I don't expect this to be hard to convince anyone of.)

10. Post swapping back, start visibly but anonymously following the plan.

This is all assuming it's a one-time thing. If it's repeatable you can do most of the tricks that have been proposed for munhkinning Death Note with a little bit of finesse.

^{*} Unless your goal is just raw destruction, which unfortunately our world is much more ready to begin at the drop of a hat.

**** He might be able to get the police to search your house afterwards for evidence of someone having been tied up for a day. I don't know whether the court has to assume magic doesn't exist if your mundane cover story can be invalidated.

Assuming you can direct who it goes to:

1. Self-assassination through drinking slow acting poisons near the end of the day.
2. Transferring wealth or shorting stocks.
3. Terrorism.
4. Social gaffes or obvious lawbreaking to discredit enemies.
5. Handshake deals that would cost another person credibility to back out of.
6. Award show speeches to raise awareness of minute issues.
7. Large public donations or pledges that are hard to back out of.
8. Assembling blackmail material.

It would be really, really easy to do.
