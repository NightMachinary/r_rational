So, you found yourself dumped in the company of advanced humans(1960s to nBSG humans) complete with different language and customs.

You can't get back, and no one is around to help you.

How do you establish communication? What is the first priority?

Scenarios:

1) Discovered on a spaceship you owned.

2) Dumped in the middle of a city

3) Dumped in the wilderness

Options

1) Without anything. You're stark naked with lacking anything.

2) With your everyday attires, but you're allowed to bring anything useful under five kilograms.


** Well, you can prove you are intelligent with mathematical formulas and equations. At that point, the others will probably be interested in trying to establish contact. Learning a new language with no background is hard, but doable, and they'll probably have their best linguists trying to help. It's basically the same as your average alien contact scenario, except that since you're both human, you'll have similar neurology and frame of reference.

As for what I'd bring with me, a computer and discs packed with as much information about humanity as I can. We can always figure out how to adapt the power once we establish contact.

WRT scenarios 2 and 3, if a naked human showed up in my hometown, speaking a foreign language, and trying to get people to pay attention to the weird symbols they scratches in the dirt, no one's just going to take them to their leader, even /if/ they recognized that lame math stuff.

I'd prioritize being /interesting/. Instead of being crazy and homeless and easily ignored, be crazy and homeless and singing a song in an unheard genre. Cause a scene, draw a crowd, /then/ see if you can engage someone who appears to actually be paying attention, honestly trying to figure out where you come from.

Honestly still a crapshoot, but it's the best I've got this time of night.

** Dumped in the middle of a city can cover a lot of different potential locations. As two examples with different language and customs from my own:

A: I am parachuted naked over Civil War Syria.

B: I am parachuted naked onto a Chinese Buddhist Monastery known for charity.

So I suppose my first priority is determining "Does it seem like I risk death just by being seen?"

** My first priority would be 1) observing to check whether the inhabitants of the place I've been dumped in are dangerous; then 2) showing them i'm not dangerous in whatever way possible (gestures/body language? dropping a stick in an exaggerated way? no idea); 3) attempting to establish contact with someone unthreatening and proving to them that I'm not just mentally ill, probably by showing them any artifacts of my culture (or just pictures on my phone, screenshots of websites, i don't know). singing a song could work, but that'd depend on their culture. 4) if anyone shows nonhostile interest in me, probably trying to explain how i got there and who i am using simple pictures

i guess that's a bad plan but it's the best i could come up with

** In any scenario, I'd smile, exaggeratedly frown, and gesticulate as much as possible, using tones if not speech to assist in conveying intent and emotion. Drawing pictures will help when I finally get a conversation partner.

Discovered naked in the middle of a city:

- Assuming no buildings that appear religious, and no people whose job is to maintain order, I'd try to go in every building I could in order to try and find one that either offered alms or might have a person willing to offer help.

- Assuming I'm transported right after a workout, when I'm dirty, smelly, and grungy, I'd find a place to bathe then do the same, though with a focus on academies; without fresh and clean hair, getting alms becomes more difficult. I might instead rummage through garbage for cloth, then run around a bit, and try to engage someone in conversation through gesticulation or, if merely hailing someone doesn't work, becoming a public spectacle by means of feats of the body or Pun's method of singing. Once I have decent clothes, I can bathe, and go out searching for more alms, which would subsist me until I could find an academic type.

- Assuming a dystopian society, mime being unable to speak and the need to write something to whomever first gives you attention, then draw pictures.

In the wilderness, naked:

- Find a house and pretend to faint if I think it likely they noticed me, to increase the chances they'll come out and help rather than view me as a threat.
