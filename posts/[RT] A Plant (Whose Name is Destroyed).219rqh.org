** Good read.

The main character is not very rational though. "No causal connection?" There is something that behaves differently in presence than in absence. How much more silver-platter do you want your causality? It sounds like they got confused by a determinist interpretation of the universe into putting down their tools.

(Step 1 is obviously "Clearly it was written that you must now go and win the Randi challenge.")

(Step 2 is "clearly something outside or beyond the universe pays attention to your desires. (I shall exclude the case where the fundamental laws of the universe just happen to pay attention to a particular arrangement of atoms in somebody's head on grounds of ridicule.) If you honestly want love, then clearly some desires are excluded. From the pattern of what desires are permitted and what are excluded, we can draw conclusions to the nature of that outside selector.") Oh and, as a trend - minds pay attention to minds.

(Step 3 is "write an FAI and execute an AI-box attack on the outside selector")

** Actually, no, hold on, separate comment for a separate train of thought.

Let's /really thoroughly consider/ Hayden's hypothesis: /it is written/. Whoever's running the universe simply selects or programs events in such a way as to account for Hayden's desires (for some construal of desires).

Naveen actually hit straight upon the problem with all this: it means Naveen and most everyone else Hayden will ever meet are all pre-arranged, pre-programmed, and pre-destined in a way that will get Hayden what he wants. /The universe revolves around Hayden/, and probably around whichever other Akkadian gods like him are also roaming the world.

Now, either his desires really do affect the world in the normal chronological fashion, present writes future, in which case, we should continue with the plan to capture him and use him to become gods, save the world, blah blah blah. /Or/, his desires are "sent back in time" to whomever (I say "whom" because any entity capable of reasoning using the intentional stance can plainly be reasoned /about/ using the intentional stance) is "writing" the universe (oy gevalt, metafiction), who uses them to "write" destiny. /Or/, whoever's doing the "writing" pre-wrote Hayden's desires themselves, and arranged for those to be granted as prewritten.

The first and last hypotheses make the most causal sense. The problem is, the last hypothesis is a /severe problem/, because Whoever that is, they're engaging in some pretty damned evil mind-control. Ethical Free Will for Very Powerful People: /thou shalt not optimize the contents of other minds/.

/This person is evil/, and the Right Thing is to giga-drill a fucking hole in them.

If the first hypothesis, that Hayden has /powers/ is correct, then it's just a matter of figuring out why the universe itself takes the intentional stance towards this one guy, but there's still a really major ethical problem with other minds being optimized for what Hayden wants.

Isn't this always the case with Hayden's "ability", regardless of how it's implemented? Power is a relative state between two entities. Hayden's desires constrain the state space of other people's minds, whether causally or acausally.

**** Actually, yes, this is a major problem. For one option, it might be a good experimental test of whether his powers are causal or acausal if someone hired a trained sniper to kill him without his knowledge (or for a lighter option, just slip a knockout drug into his food without his knowledge). I mean, if it actually worked, I'd feel bad for Hayden, but not as much as I'd feel good for an /entire world/ that would thus be liberated from magically-enforced slavery to one moderately ok guy.

** I'm not sure if it's Hard Rationalist fic, but the protagonist is presented with an extremely unusual/paranormal phenomenon, and does try to investigate it rationally. And it's short.

** Not a bad read. A bit hard to follow with all the 3rd person narrative and non linear sentences, rational behavior as expected of in story facts.
