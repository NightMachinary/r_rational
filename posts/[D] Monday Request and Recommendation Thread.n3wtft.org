Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I've been reading [[https://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover%29][Maybe I'm a Lion]], a Kara no Kyoukai/Prototype crossover, per a recommendation on one of the previous weekly threads. I can safely say that this is an excellent fusion between the insanely anime-spiritual-powers lore of the Nasuverse with the insanely western-military-chic elements of Prototype.

I've enjoyed it much as I've enjoyed most of other batshit crazy crossovers such as [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ShinjiAndWarhammer40K][Shinji and Warhammer 40k]] (Evangelion + 40k, I don't even know how this is possible) or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements][Postnuptial Disagreements]] (Sekirei and Fate, which share much more in the way of aesthetic but still have wildly incompatible premises and characters). It's not that I don't enjoy more reasonable crossovers, but the absurdity of some of these combinations leads to some sort of emergent plotting that's so compelling.

Anyone have more obviously impossible crossovers that are better than they have any right to be?

In the spirit of weird 40k Crossovers, there's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/40-000-years-of-exalted-glory-40k-exalted-fusion.930787/][40,000 Years of Exalted Glory]] (40k/Exalted) which is just starting out but seems to fit in this category.

Two more bizzarre premises I've also enjoyed reading are [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-countess-complete-worm-the-count-of-monte-cristo-fusion-1815-au.813386/][The Countess]] (Worm/The Count of Monte Cristo) and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hp-hamefura-katarina-claes-and-the-goblin-on-fire.914040/][Katarina Claes and the Goblin on Fire]] (HameFura + HP).

There are some other weird crossovers that nonetheless work out well, but most of them are dead, short, or a step down in weirdness so I'm not listing them with these, but if you enjoy them I can link more.

Fair warning, from someone who devoured this a few years ago - at least at the time, it was unfinished and seemed to have been dropped. It's a great ride but the abrupt end in the middle of a good arc ruined it for me.

** I broke my personal rule against reading Worm fics to pick up "Just a Phase", and it was worth it. It's very wish-fulfilment-y, in that it has adults actually caring about the well-being of the children they're responsible for, but it's very (IMO) realistic in the extent to which the traumatized AU!Taylor is, well, shaped by her traumas.

I'd also rec the fic, as it's pretty well written. Hard to determine how rational it is given how Taylor's trauma has twisted her worldview. I guess she's rationally misanthropic?

I had some disagreements with the themes of the work and how the author chose which roles to assign which characters, but given that I read this in one continuous four hour marathon, concede that it's well written and extremely engaging, which gets it my recommendation.

*** Thanks for the rec. I loved the story a lot---the beginning and middle didn't feel very well-written, but they /really/ ticked by boxes. It's hard to describe, but it was following /all/ my expectations, even unreasonable ones that were detrimental to the story. It felt amazing, like, I dunno, prompting GPT-3 with something and getting /exactly/ what you asked for, except that went for ⅔rds of the book.

And then Anna and Leviathan didn't get together. It's perfectly reasonable, it's a realistic, rational resolution to the plot, it's in-character, but I was so used to this particular story bending to my whims even when it made it worse, such a twist felt like a punch in a gut. I'm incredibly mad. I literally had a meltdown over that, and I'm not even autistic. I normally wouldn't have reacted so strongly, but I've been starving for monster/human romance with intelligent characters, I even made a request in this thread a few weeks ago, and here /everything/ was leading to it. There was an in-universe discussion, FFS! I understand that it's a sequel hook, but I have a suspicion that the sequel might blueball me as well, and there's no sequel atm anyway, so I'm in my bed seething for the third hour straight.

Still, great story, thank you for the rec. Not sarcasm.

**** Objectively speaking, I sort of agree with [[/u/nakor28]] that the ending/denouement was kind of underwhelming. A sequel might fix this, though, and I know one is under way.

Subjectively speaking, I had the oddest sense that the author was uncritically inverting the traditional gender stereotypes of SF works. Essentially all of the characters with agency are women, the main characters objectify men, and the male leads are the emotional, irrational ones while the female leads are the cool, collected ones.

I'm not saying the main character is a mary sue-- she has believable flaws and failures. It made it seem like it had been written forty years past, critically regarded (and for good reason) but clearly a product of its time (but in an alternate universe where many of our gender stereotypes were flipped).

Note that this complaint doesn't dominate the majority of the work; gender is hardly the focus of the novel. I just, personally, found it inescapable, but YMMV.

*** I also read this in the past week or two and enjoyed it. The basic premise is that "henches" are generally treated as low-level employees - at the beginning, the protagonist and a friend go to the local hench temp agency to apply for postings in their respective specialties.

The latter part of the book felt rushed and the denouement was not particularly satisfying, but it was worthwhile. I'll say 3.5/5, but I am a fairly harsh grader.

Not sure how that would progress, especially if you have him still valuing all the other residents of Nazarick quite highly, but could be interesting.

** Looking for crack deconstructionist fics on pieces of media.

Short funny stories that noticed one or two jokes about a movie or TV show or game and play with that joke for a few chapters.

More like omakes than stories.

Doesn't have to be super rational or serious, just like some Screen Rants or CinemaSins with a silly thing/plothole and take it to the extreme.

An example would maybe be Harry Potter and the Natural 20, or some of the other Harry Potter crack fics where someone just uses obliviate to resolve everything. I enjoy it when they skip to the major plot beats or moments of the media even if it makes no sense that everything would be the same.

** I'm looking for a story were the MC is overly critical of situations beforehand, sort of like the character L from death note or even harry potter. I find that a lot of stories lately the MC is rational on an as needed basis or employs cleverness only when in a tough situation. Like for an example, how a MC who is transported to a fantasy world and barely knows the world, would decide to go on a dungeon quest without knowing anything about dungeons and then run into some tough enemy. I figure someone like L would do a series of experiments beforehand and collect as much knowledge to make deductions about the situations and not just charge in because he's in love with some heroine only to run into some obstacle where in he would resort to a clever plan.

On the other hand, I wouldn't recommend reading the originals in the absence of significant nostalgia. They're not too dated, but they were always written en masse for teenagers, so I don't think they are that great on their own.

Worth The Candle drops the protagonist into a fantasy world, and the first thing he does is ignore an obvious call to adventure because he knows nothing and it looks too dangerous. Later on, he increasingly has time to talk through situations before diving in, though he also frequently gets shoved into situations he isn't prepared for. Also it's very good; fantastic prose, worldbuilding, and characterization, and actually has thematic layers that are explored.

(Worth noting: to preserve dramatic tension, WTC isn't structured as "[Detailed plan.] [Run through of actual event that's repetitive except where it diverges from the plan.]" but rather "We came up with a plan. [Action begins.] [Describe relevant part of plan.] [It works or doesn't.] [Continue.]")

Warning: Second Person Perspective.

The main reason why I recommend it is because I wrote the story out of a quest I'd run some years back. Overall, the format tended to be for the players to have the cards and knowing them before they made their choices, so I think it fits with what you asked.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42560/conquest-of-avalon][Conquest of Avalon]] is on Royal Road now. Something I recced a few weeks back, and I'll copy a good review I saw on there to shill it:

#+begin_quote
  How does one deal with the conquest of their homeland?

  The protagonists Fernan, Florette and Camille have to deal with this very question. Whether it be a fitting within the system and finding pockets of happiness; seeking the best of freedom away from a people who have seemingly accepted their existence; or attempts at reclaiming what was lost. Each of them have their own ways of looking forward and finding their way, and can we really say which one is the ultimate right?

  Conquest of Avalon is a story that does an amazing task of feeling both personal and broad. It has a revolving set of characters who are distinct from each other, yet each of them has a way of getting to your heart because you quickly understand who they are and why the do what they do; and a world that you can feel has a long history, given out in chunks that leave you wanting more instead of being too heavy. It brings with it a fleshed out magical world and system, while not forgetting that even a world of magic, people are still people and they have a way of interacting through politics.

  One of the best parts of the story is how the characters interact with said politics and how they interact with them in turn, reflecting their birth and thier outlooks on life.

  Conquest of Avalon is well worth the read.

It's about the entire population of a Pony town accidentally being teleported to a farm in rural Kansas, and the initial chapters are about the locals dealing with the situation.

It seems the author went to some lengths to do his research, too. From the author's note on the second chapter:

#+begin_quote
  By the way, if you really want to see somebody looking confused, go to your local emergency management agency and ask just what their process would be for a few hundred aliens dropped into a field just outside of town. Make sure you tell them you're an author, though. They'll still think you're crazy, but won't lock you up. (You know, there has been a police car parked outside for the last few weeks. Naaa, probably a coincidence.)

****** For a fic where very little happens over a lot of chapters (it's mostly just ponies interacting with humans while waiting to go home), it has some weird background things creep in. Young female ponies being sexually attracted to human men upon first sight and no one on either side thinks it's at all strange. A preponderance of guns and tanks being cool and ponies of all ages and backgrounds being interested in them and not at all scared/worried about unfamiliar weapons. A general sense that lower level "military" people/ponies are great, salt of the earth people that handle events like unexpected aliens with aplomb, while higher-ranked people, especially anyone who is close to government, are dumb, self-interested, and untrustworthy. Also, somehow every other person was once in the marines, and never as an officer.

Like, the author did do a lot of research on details like what the emergency management plans for the area are and what real-life people might have been in Kansas in 2015, but the level of military wankery takes over the fic instead of something more interesting like actual cultural differences.

**** As a second set of eyes on this, I've gone back and forth on Ar'Kendrithyst several times. My most recent stance is that I recommend it, but it can definitely seem to drag. It spends dozens of chapters going through a cycle of "Erick goes to a new place, someone approaches Erick with a problem, Erick discovers a new magic and gets a power up, the group moves on and the new magic is (usually) not mentioned again and the new characters (usually) step back into the background to only be mentioned in passing thereafter." In between these cycles, it's very slice of life with a fantasy world bent. I actually like the slice of life breathers because it gives the characters a chance to interact again - as the previous comment mentions, the author dedicates an absurd amount of time to the magics involved, so it's a nice breather when the slice of life takes over.

To be fair, after 100+ chapters, a lot of these little sidequests start to come back into play again - but it takes a looooong time for that payoff.

The story does a good job going through it's litRPG setting and analysis of its magic system. There are some really cool moments, and a lot of civilization uplifting across a wide spectrum of subjects. But the relationships between the characters stagnate compared to these aspects, and as said, there's a lot of repetition in tropes/cycles. Erick himself can be interesting, but far too often feels like a plot device to move onto whatever subject catches the attention of the author. He. just. can't. say. NO. to anyone who requests his help, and I really felt like the manner of help being asked was a chance for the author to show off whatever new idea of world-building he wanted to showcase.

Again, it /does/ come together a bit eventually, but it can feel like a bit of a slog to get there. I give it a thumbs up, but a hesitant one. I like learning about the gears running a fantasy world behind the scenes, but this one was a bit too much for me at times.

Edit: A criticism I've seen a few times is that the dialogue between Erick and Jane is "cringey." I personally never felt that way. I don't like Jane's personality much, but I felt like the dialogue came off as genuine, if a bit uncomfortably intrusive. I like that Jane is a flawed character, even if her flaws make me not /like/ her character. Erick is much more of a Gary Stu, and while I like his ideas, his personality is just kinda generic do-gooder (though backed up backstory to explain it). Jane at least feels like a person. Kiri and Teresa are more interesting than either of them, but don't get enough focus, IMO.

***** As a previous detractor of the story, I know better than anyone that it is not for everyone. The stupid name, the gimped, illogical, and shallow(frontend, anyway) litrpg magic system, Erick's personality and plot armor, and the CIA thing at the beginning^{^{1}} all kept me from getting into it for a long time. Even after reading 1.5 million words I have trouble articulating just why I like it.

I think a big point in its favor for me is that it is original in unexpected ways, which as a person who reads a lot I value highly. That Erick's arc has been interesting and well done and there's more to come is another one. Above all I like the story because the author actually appears to have something to say about the world and the human condition, and isn't just trying to transcribe a skinner box into a narrative like most litrpgs/webserials.

--------------

^{^{1}} Tangential rant: Erick has been depicted as a politically engaged bleeding heart liberal with the empathy and self-abnegation of a saint or bodhisattva. The idea that someone like that--who also presumably grew up in the 80's and 90's and would be intimately familiar with the effects of the (state sponsored) crack epidemic on the inner city poor--would be OK with his only child joining what is objectively speaking the evilest organization in the world by scope and scale(since the SS and the NKVD got shut down, anyway) put me off the story for a long time just by itself. It is still a surprise to me that this heuristic ultimately failed and the author isn't a complete dumbass.

PS. That Jane-the-CIA-inductee is later depicted as being literally a psychopath with good coping mechanisms is hilarious, I'll admit. Maybe she's the reason they got booted out of their original reality, to prevent another holocaust or something.

PPS. Also hilarious: the very first comment the story received (on RR of all places!) is a complaint about lionizing the CIA. Warms my heart.

** I might have recommended this before, but if I did, it was ages and ages ago. Also, I advise caution when googling the story, a cursory check I just did already revealed a major spoiler for the first volume. The story is Robert J. Sawyer's */Quintaglio Ascension/* trilogy. The first novel, /Far-Seer/, basically tells the story of the copernican revolution for a theropod-like alien species. Beyond that already interesting premise the author spent some time in coming up with means by which an obligate carnivore and starkly (and at times violently) territorial species could still develop civilisation and society to such a degree that they actually managed to reach the point of a copernican revolution. The following books deal with the fallout and societal developments that the worldview shift kicked off.

The second volume contains a point of view with which I have some trouble, in my opinion it undermines some of the worldbuilding, and I suspect Sawyer got criticised for including these chapters, since the third volume contains no such parts. I advise ignoring these chapters, or delegating them to a dream sequence.

However, it's also realistic because of the way the Worm universe is set up behind the scenes -- there is a complex "secret history" which explains their comic book-like behavior. Much of the serial is about slowly peeling off layers of deception and putting together scattered pieces of the puzzle.

I didn't find it 100% convincing, but it was a valiant effort to create a universe in which the inherently unrealistic "comic book logic", which was originally aimed at children, made sense.
