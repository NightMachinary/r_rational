Back to posting this after a rough month! In this setup-heavy chapter, something is explained, though only kind of. It will be /explained/ explained next time.

For those who haven't seen it before, this is a psychological mystery story about a group of mages in a sorta-science-fantasy-sorta-just-weird setting holding a conclave about their research into defeating death, with the focus being on a class of students invited to visit. Bad things are already happening, though you might've missed it unless you have been paying close attention.


** Finally caught up to the latest chapter again. Ran steals the show as usual despite barely showing up in this one. Definitely my favourite character.

The stakes seem to have subtly increased. Wondering if this is going to end either with a noble failure or with Su embracing the despair. Kam seems to be making her best effort for group cohesion but consistency is hard, and sometimes trying too much backfires. Perhaps that's why Ophelia's keeling over was a little painful to read- the story's prodded me into feeling more sensitive to their suffering.

Still, definitely a setup chapter. Good if it pays off, but the pacing did feel a little odd given the previous (pre-intermission) chapters which had established a nice flow.

*** Yeah, the result feels a bit off to me, too. Probably the biggest issue I've had with this story is just managing the sheer /volume/ of exposition that needs to happen for plot elements to not feel like they come completely from nowhere. I mentioned this elsewhere, but both mystery and fantasy are genres that tend to require lots of setting establishment, and in this case it does compound on itself a bit.
