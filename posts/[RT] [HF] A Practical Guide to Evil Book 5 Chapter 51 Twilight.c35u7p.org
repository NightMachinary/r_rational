** There are moments in this serial where the degree of opaqueness and ambiguity as to how Story's function and magic works leave me unsatisfied when either are used to resolve an important conflict. I thought this chapter was a great example of the /opposite/ of that.

The groundwork laid for this resolution was: Sve Noc's well established links with death and overcoming it, the foreshadowing of Cat cheating death in Liesse three times in previous chapters, Cats well established ability to temporarily ‘steal' aspects and Pilgrims well established intimate ties with Mercy from the extra chapter POV's of his. I think this groundwork played a big role in the resurrection feeling so satisfying and justified.

*** It also helps that the resurrection, in this case, isn't so much as a “get out of jail” card as it is a “you don't get to rest yet” card. Tariq will only have more pain and suffering to face once he's back.

**** It was interesting to note that Mercy, a choir for Above, was mourning Pilgrim, which seems to suggest that said rest would have been oblivion and that Above does not have heaven, or at least a heaven in the form we're familiar with.

***** Correct me if Im wrong, but in Guideverse, I don't think Ive ever seen any character talk or think anything to do with a "heaven" concept, and as far as I know, hells are strictly different /planes/ and most certainly not where "/souls/ go".

Now all of this could absolutely wrong (absence of evidence is not evidence of absence and all that), but I really do think that it is reasonable to assume that most characters of the guide think that oblivion awaits their final death.

****** They have what Pilgrim says is "his stay Above." and more specifically " No one could be ripped from the embrace of the Gods without finding Creation and faded and brutish place for the rest of their days, even if the memory of the Heavens was withheld." How much of that is religious imagery and how much is an accurate description of their potential afterlife is ambiguous. interlude-kaleidoscope-ii

At the same time we have either upfront lich-esque soul jar equivalents in both what we've seen from the Dead King and from Ubua's holding of her own soul outside of her own body. But pulling a person back from oblivion is very different from some sort of afterlife.

There's some amount of implication that devils at least return to their constituent hell and are remade anew from what we hear from Tikloshe, Masego's father, speaking to Warlock, Masego's father, they say

Don't waste it,” he implored. “After you're dispersed...”

“What comes back will not be me,” Tikoloshe softly agreed. “A blank slate. Tabula rasa.” interlude-inheritance

​

There's also both the soul constructs of the Watch and the numerous undead that we've seen that had their own personalities as far as we know that is, it's not like we've seen Cat raise say Ratface or someone that we knew as they were in their own body even if it was rotting.

​

So in total we know souls exist, they can be caught, which kind of has implications that something happens if they aren't caught, Heroes and it's not super clear that non-heroes/named can have their deaths Forgiven, but that any old person can apparently have their soul trapped into their own body as shown by the previous King's of Callow. But again we haven't seen non-named be resurrected it's a little ambiguous that Archer is explicitly a villain but at this point we kind of assume she is so that's worth something i guess?

****** They certainly believe that Triumphant continues in some form, such that there is a risk of her and her legions returning, despite being quite dead. It's just a folk belief, but the Praesi are as well positioned as anyone to know what goes on in the hells, and we never hear anyone call that belief out as bring silly on the grounds that souls don't wind up in the hells.

On the other hand, the hells are visitable, and we never really hear about missions to go track down dead people, so who knows.

***** For a series that produces 6000 or more words every week, I'm happy to ignore minor errors. The man manages to make me check the dictionary because he's got such eloquently put titles. And that's just the titles. The main content prose? He's up there with Stephen Erikson in my mind in apt use of words. A less pretentious type of style and tone than Rothfuss. As schematic and meticulous as Sanderson.

There are caveats, I'm sure, but I'm downright ignoring them.

** I wonder what might happen now to Pilgrim and his holy powers since his resurrection has been done by a Villain. Especially since she's labelled as the Arch Heretic of the East. The Pilgrim clearly didn't ask for this.

Will he be considered tainted? Will he no longer be a Hero? Will there be an angelic Civil War between the Choir of Mercy and others choirs that might contest the Pilgrim owing his new life to Catherine? How will this affect the Pilgrim's protectiveness of the Bard, and what will happen to this Twilight realm now that the Star is gone?

*** While it was pulled off by Cat, the resurrection was powered completely by Above's Light, via Tariq's *Forgive*, so (outside of the unlikely possibility of him getting a different Name out of this) there really should be no change for him outside of no longer having that Aspect.

Also even though mortal geopolitics treat her as one, I think by this point it's pretty clear that /Cat isn't a Villain/. Her recent struggle vs Indrani highlighted once again that for all Night can bestow upon her she isn't Named. And for all that Sve Noc clearly stands closer to evil than good, the forging of those goddesses was done in rebellion /against the Gods Below/. Cat is a maybe a villain perhaps (even if her slate was clean, her work at the Princes' Graveyard would have had her treated as such) but not a Villain.

I doubt Tariq's opinion on the Intercessor will suddenly flip on a dime but Cat has gained something almost as valuable on that front. She now has actual time to convince him, rather than arguing while running from fight to fight.

Can you elaborate on this a little more please? I always got the feeling that Sve Noc got "tricked" by below into to getting their explicit desire ... which makes their nature one that naturally defeats itself.

Which is where their dynamic with Cat comes into play. Cat is the one who is trying to get them to think and act better than their natures. Its why Sve Noc wanted to take twilight's crown and Cat had to talk them down then give the Drow version of the sermon on the mount.

I agree Cat isn't a villain and she is trying to get the other big Villains to reject their natures too.

*** The fact that, in a sense, Tariq became the King of Twilight might mean the birth of a third force between Good and Evil, one of balance and neutrality. It's not unheard of. Isn't Yan Tei ruled by both a Good and an Evil co-monarchs? This would be like that, but even more so on a metaphysical level.
