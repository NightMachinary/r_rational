** Alright, I'll bite, been well over a decade since I read any Lackey. Help my memory a moment to figure out where in the timeline I was reading from.

I recall a herald/fire mage, who ended up in a war, and at the end of the book there was some passage about pine-cones opening after a fire.

I also recall one of the weapon-masters being introduced into the Heralds, and training a young assassin/thief/dagger specialist.

I suppose another story I recall I don't remember much about the protagonist, but I do remember they lived in some village in the boonies and had the village mage/medic/weather watcher (seemingly suffering from PTSD or brain damage) caring for the protagonist then burning themselves out on a bridge while enemy forces invaded.

Where exactly, did those occur in the Valdemar timeline?

*** Been a while for me as well, but I'll take a guess. See: [[http://www.mercedeslackey.com/biblio_series.html]]

1) Last Herald Mage (?)

2) By the Sword (Definitely)

3) ???

**** I think (1) is probably from Brightly Burning, referring to Lavan Firestorm, and (3) sounds like it's from the Owlmage series, one of the more recent ones.

***** Think you got them on the head. (3) was Owlflight. Thanks a bundle. Look like (2) was Take a Thief, and paired with it Exile's Honor. Lord, was Alberich a sour noodle.

Now that I've had a gander over the list, damn did I read a bunch of Lackey. Good times with the public library catalog.

This FF should be a nice stroll down nostalgia lane. Time to dig in.

Though seriously, where in the Valdemar timeline did those book take place? At least in relation to the Last Herald Mage series, I don't want to be misplacing, perceived events.

****** The Last Herald-Mage takes place before almost all of the other books (about 500 years before the "modern-day Valdemar" books). The only books set chronologically earlier are the Mage Wars ones.

*** I personally liked Lackey a lot when I was a teenager. I've since grown out of her writing, and more recent attempts to reread works of hers that I've previously enjoyed were not nearly so enjoyable nowadays. If you happen to be at the right age / stage for them, you can probably enjoy some of her works (though her early writings' politics / messages are mostly super dated nowadays). If you try reading them and find them to be fundamentally juvenile and uninteresting, you've probably outgrown her already. A lot of her works are more clearly targetted at female sf/f readers; I'm male, but still enjoyed many of them when I was younger anyways. Many of her works are basically romances.

Valdemar books - A really huge number of trilogies, and fewer books not in trilogies. Centers around a magical world and mostly the kingdom of Valdemar where magic telepathic horses permanently bond with worthy people and this magic telepathic horse bonding is the main basis of their system of government. A lot of people are first tormented by hidebound reactionaries / other abusers and then get rescued by the telepathic horses who love them unconditionally. If this sounds to you like McCaffrey's Pern but with magic horses instead of magic dragons - well, you get a cookie, some borrowing of core concept is clearly happening here. These books were progressive at the time they were originally written, including canonically gay main characters who were portrayed as not evil / wrong etc and full of homosexual romance and heteresexual romance side by side, which was actually pretty progressive for the late 80's / early 90s. However, Lackey draws on a lot of really annoying stereotypes of gays and gay romances as always tragic etc. in a way that would be called out as problematic if written nowadays. More on [[http://limyaael.livejournal.com/214314.html?page=2][that here]] - her portrayal of gay characters almost always draws heavily upon a lot of stereotypes that nowadays feel cringe-inducing. Actual execution of the various books is mostly not terribly interesting - these books are just fundamentally not doing much that is interesting or unique in the fantasy genre.

Bedlam's Bard - with Guon and Edghill. These books are mostly traditional-ish urban fantasy centered around Irish/Celtic elves and human musicians/bards. This is not terribly exceptional - probably the best strength is an interesting portrayal of a character growing up and maturing as an adult, but overall it's very schlocky urban fantasy. Progressive points for a polyamory relationship portrayal at one point. Silly, but inoffensive mostly.

Serrated Edge series - tied to the above books, these are mostly about Elves in a Masqurade from the world who are inexplicably into racing cars and also rescuing abused children. Has really fucked up depictions of child abuse pretty much every book, and various children are constantly rescued by good elves / imperiled by bad elves or fantasy monsters in addition to more normal child abusers. The premise and story background is, I cannot emphasize enough, totally batshit insane, but the actual execution isn't nearly as interesting as the batshit premise would make you hope.

Elemental Masters - A series of historic-set stories with elements of structure and plot borrowed from classic fairy tales but mostly set in the early 20th / 19th / 18th centuries, and a 'summon elemental servitors' magic system. E.g. The Fire Rose is Beauty and The Beast. Honestly, some of these were interesting. A lot of them feature a woman protagonist defying gender roles as sort of a parable of feminism ideals. Very strong romance elements in many of these.

The Halfblood Chronicles - Total fantasy. Dragon shapeshifters adopt a half-elf, half-elf makes war upon elven oppressors. Honestly, not terribly great.

Some of Lackey's work ended up in the Baen CD-ROM of free to redestribute books initiative - particularly in "This Sceptered Isle" IIRC? anyways you can grab the free-to-redistribute CD-ROM images [[http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/][here]] with some of Lackeys works scattered about.

**** I would agree with this characterization of Lackey's work. It really is well suited to hit you at a certain age. I also grew out of it in nearly the same way.

But when you are young, the concept of Companions (telepathic horse friends finding someone paired with them by fate) really hits teenagers in just the right way to create a sympathetic audience. Lackey always had a way with emotional characterization that rings particularly true with people just beginning to explore those feelings in life.

Also, if you sometimes use FF's as introductions to certain books and authors, I would say this one in particular imitates the tragic hero and emotional characterizations well (if you like feeling-oriented writing, you will enjoy this fic, it is done well in that extent.). However, this fic author focuses much on deconstructing those feelings and making them understood to the reader, but as a result of that you might miss the other elements of Valdemar that make Lackey's work enjoyable; sense of wonder and discovery, the enjoyable magic system, and how Lackey generally puts together an interesting setting. If you have a Valdemar background, you will dive into this fic easier. If you don't, you will be missing out on how the protagonists are discovering the elements of the Valdemar setting with you. That particular element is taken as assumed for this fic.

***** Do you have any thoughts on how I could work in more worldbuilding and intro to the magical system earlier on? This does get explored more in depth later in the fic (I also think the Valdemar setting and magic system are really neat!) but it's likely the case that at the beginning, I've put in the exact amount of explanation of the setting that someone who hasn't read Lackey needs to not be confused, and no more than that.

(I guess "sense of wonder and discovery" is not the thing I'm going for; my model is that to most of the characters, this is just the way things are, and it seems pretty mundane to them -- and they too have death and taxes and roads to be repaired and national budgets that need to be submitted on time.)

****** Typical Lackey style was to establish a tragic protagonist -> Introduce friction -> introduction Companion -> discover world through the eyes of that changed relationship -> reintroduce friction ->Acts 2 and 3.

Usually in the non-companion stories, the sense of discovery happens because the introduction of the pair element leads to the first easing of friction and allows the characters to stop looking at the world from the microcosm of their own suffering and start contemplating existence and the world beyond their own.

It is with new eyes that they look and experience the world around them, and this is usually where the setting gets discovered and the sense of wonder happens. It is the natural break from the protagonists struggle, where they get a moment to take a breath, rest, de-escalate tension, before we dive back into the struggle. We also see a bit of character development as the hero grows a bit into their future self.

So far, Van has been in agony for about 8 chapters, and just felt a minor release from his icy mountain. Usually the first release happens earlier so the author can allow the reader's mind to rest from emotional conflict. The pairing of the first release and looking at the world with a new outlook allows world-building to happen.

Look the colors are brighter now, what I looked upon from afar is so different up close. I have a place/gift/friend and while my core conflict isn't resolved, I finally have hope and can feel again! The world is so different from this perspective! And this is when Lackey hits you with world-building. Sure it was described so many chapters ago as common knowledge, but now I can finally see it for what it is. Companions are not just magical telepathic horses, they are your fated friend, they are a piece of you that was missing and this is what it feels like to finally be whole. This is where life becomes beautiful. This is what the protagonist fights for.

Usually world-building happens during the first introduction of the schools, the first easing of friction happens before this so you can explore the world through hero's new perspective. You did a bit of that with the cousin's last words at the holding. Van started growing a little, but we never saw him achieve much release from that. It was our first chance to take a break from "woe is me" and start to like Van beyond contemplative wet blanket. Van thus far has been Sad (holding)->neutral (journey)->sad(meet Sav)->neutral/curious (meets moody eyes)->sad/neutral(school)->Very sad (drunk/nightmares)->bunch more of that then he gets down and is happy for two paragraphs then we go back to sad again. Van is still "woe is me" (which I have absolutely enjoyed your writing of. Your emotional characterization is on point as I said earlier), despite having his first release. All we know of his hidden depths are that he is very contemplative and good at music. He hasn't actually enjoyed playing music that much because he keeps bemoaning his arm. He has no outlets to experience happiness up to the first kiss. He has had no positive emotional highs up until chapter 8. We have no reason to really like him unless we love depression. Van is more than a two-note character played on the organ. Show us his range of feeling. and use that to build the world around him.
