Ch. 41 - Myriad Clashing Motives

  /She picked a snow globe in the end. Admittedly, it was a very nice snow globe -- the little house and the trees inside it were incredibly detailed and well done, almost as if someone had literally shrunk a house and its immediate environs and placed them in a glass sphere. Clearly some fairly sophisticated magic had been used to produce the thing, even if the end product was completely non-magical to his senses, and the globe was priced accordingly... but it was better than Zorian had feared so he bought it without complaint. Idly, he wondered if his alteration skills were good enough to produce a globe like that.../

  /Then, with a deafening boom, all of the stone cubes shattered and fell to the ground. The glass globe was still fine, however -- the stabilizers had sacrificed themselves to give that final push for the whole process and firmly attach the newly-made 'pocket mansion' to its portable anchor./

  /If one looked closely, they would be able to see a miniature, lifelike house suspended in the center of the globe. It even appeared intact, which was great. There was a nontrivial chance for everything inside the globe to end up getting wrecked by the stresses of the creation process, if they were not channeled properly./

I wonder if it was foreshadowing or just a coincidence. With this story you never know.


** Also, arguably the whole story takes place in a magically created "snow globe".

Makes me think of the bad movie /Cemetery Man./
