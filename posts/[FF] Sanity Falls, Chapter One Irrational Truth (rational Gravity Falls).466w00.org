  “A googolplex is ten to the ten to the hundred, right?” said Mabel.

  “Right,” said Dipper, though he found it exasperating that even his own sister didn't know that simple fact.

But she did know it. Score one against Dipper.

  “Five googolplex, thirty, i,” said Dipper.

  “That's not a real number, silly,” said Mabel. “No.”

kek.

Wiki says heritability of IQ in childhood is "0.45", but I don't know what that would imply numerically. I'm just hoping Mabel is smarter than Dipper. We already know she's smarter than Dipper gives her credit for.

  “But I was trying to trick you,” said Mabel. “And I got you pretty good.” Dipper crossed his arms. Mabel didn't even care about teaching people to think.

  The brilliant mind he'd expected to find in his great uncle was simply gone; at best Stan was merely cynical.

#+begin_quote
  Dipper loved books, or at least the concept of books, and this book looked very special indeed.

The /concept of books?/

At least he has good taste in fantasy codices.

EDIT: Seconding that this Dipper is incredibly unlikable. I kind of hope that he gets eaten by gnomes. Also, Soos actually (somehow) seems less intelligent than he is in canon? Dipper's condescension really isn't helping though. Also kind of weird that there's such a vast gulf in IQ between Dipper and Mabel.

Did you miss the part there where Soos owned Dipper's smug, showing-off antics butt without even trying? Or where, in the show, he turns out to be smart and capable for pretty much of the time?

Or where Dipper in this story is being annoying now to represent a /certain type/ of shallowly competent, inexperienced, and fantastically un-self-aware rationalist stereotype, all to provide a strong character arc when he gets hit by a magical realism/sci-fi clue bat?

I'm now questioning everything. Like, whether you and some others ever watched the show /or/ read this fanfic chapter.

Oh, sure, I totally get what's intended here. The problem is that I have to be in the head of a character who, for the time being, I'd prefer to see eaten by gnomes.

It doesn't matter how good your viewpoint character is /going to be/, if in the meantime it's a chore to be in that character's head.

Does the exact same thing and enjoys the story by smirking in revenge by seeing Dipper's minor comeuppance and crosses fingers for Dipper to develop into a more likable character (albeit not without him getting some mild punishment for being so rude to people).

***** Mabel is no different than canon, where Dipper is... I don't know what his IQ is supposed to be, but apparently he's a twelve-year-old discussing obscure physics, teaching himself from the age of eight, and really giving us no reason to doubt his assertion that he is one of the greatest minds on Earth. He might be seriously lacking in people skills, but that's not what IQ is about.

** Let's see how we do on the anti-GaryStu scale:

- Unreliably arrogant narrator...
- ...who everyone but his sister will want to punch in the teeth
- ...who mistakes knowledge and breadth of experience for intelligence
- ...with an actual kid's voice in an intelligent rationalist story character
- ...who makes subtle mistakes, simply because he isn't unrealistically-perfectly self-aware and experienced

Lots of overturned tropes. Very well done fanfic so far.

Bonus points for AnnoyingInnerMonologue!Dipper getting owned by Soos and not realizing it. That now classic rational-fic "The Game" scene getting subverted was precious.

** So, glad you made this, one of the shows I've put serious thought into writing a ratfic of.

My notes:

Dipper is very obnoxious and hpmor-like, almost to the point of parody. Will wait and see how that pans out. (Some deconstruction maybe?)

Mabel feels much closer to how I'd expect an exceptionally intelligent version of her to act.

Wendy being into the same stuff as Dipper kind of breaks my suspension of disbelief, but I can see it's necessary if you want this Dipper to look up to her as in canon.

The implication that The Northern Caves happened makes me very hopeful about your version of Bill.

I noticed there's no sign of cryptograms/puzzles, and no mention of gibberish or strange characters when Dipper's examining the Journal. Will that aspect of the show be making an appearance, either in the medium as actual puzzles, or as part of the plot?

I am excited to see where you take this!

**** The Northern Caves by nostalgebraist; Chesscourt is the "in story" series that The Northern Caves is focused on.

It isn't the easiest thing to read, and was posted here a while back to mixed reception.

I quite enjoyed it though, for what it was.

Beyond that, I hesitate to claim I know why it was referenced. I realize now there's a strong chance it was just a shout out.

Edit: Not sure if temporarily stopping reading 'broke the spell' or if the conclusion is just a little bit disappointing, but one way or the other it didn't quite maintain the compelling tension through the final chapters for me. Still well worth the time spent.
