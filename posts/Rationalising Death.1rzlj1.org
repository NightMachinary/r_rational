** This is my stab at a Death Note rationalist fanfiction, where the characters are actually more realistically smart, though by no means perfect.

***** I caught up this morning. As someone who's never read (watched? whatever) /Death Note/, I am totally enthralled and have no idea why on earth we're following that girl from time to time... Unless she's the hacker? Hmm...

****** Canon she was a psuedo love interest that the main character used repeatedly to explain weird behavior, or as a tool in current plot hook EDIT: current being most of them. Not the one that the fix is on

** I do have a few questions, the first being "why doesn't light have his people commit suicide, instead of the same cause of death over and over?

*** A few reasons. Firstly, he wants everyone to know that /someone/ is behind all this. Heart attacks are sudden, flashy, and uniform. If the cause of death varied from person to person, it would take a lot longer for anyone to work out what was happening. People will adjust their behaviour to fit his utility function more quickly and more efficiently if they believe there to be agency behind the deaths rather than, say, an unexplained anomaly in the actuarial table for "evil people". This is also why he has them all die on the hour every hour, rather than at random intervals. It sends a particular message.

Secondly, it would tip his hand early that he can control the cause of death of his victims. At the moment, all the police know about his capabilities is that he can control his victims actions prior to their death and that he needs a face and a name to kill. In both cases, that's information that Light would rather not have had anyone find out - while he wants people to know that someone's doing the killing, it's a good idea in general to keep his exact capabilities hidden.

**** I figured there was a good reason, I forgot his end goal was to be noticed. Great story! I have to catch up on the last two chapters after work.

*** While this is very good, reddit doesn't really make for old threads receiving attention after they first go away. Your fic is good enough (and popular enough here, I think) that you can probably post a new topic every update or two without being complained at.
