Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I haven't read much manga the last few years, but I need a change of pace. If anyone has any suggestions for manga that started or became popular after 2010 or so, let me know!

Rational works not required (though always appreciated, of course). I'm posting here 'cause most of y'all seem to appreciate good story telling. Any genre's fine, previous favorites, if it helps, include: HxH, One Piece, Yatsubato!, Bakuman, Oishii Kankei, Holyland, Katsu!, Black Cat, Aishita no Ousama, etc.

*** Here's a personal top-tier list, things I would absolutely recommend to anyone (can elaborate if needed):

/Maoyuu Maou Yuusha - Kono Watashi no Mono Tonare, Yuusha yo Kotowaru!/

- Realistic exploration of what kind of realistic sociopolitical landscape would arise from a typical "humanity versus demons" JRPG plot, and what both the Hero and Villain try to do to resolve it.

/Witch Hat Atelier/

- Renaissance-era Swords n Sorcery semi-apocalyptic world where witches are a secretive tribe, the only known wielders of magic. Follows a young girl who gets mixed up in a plot far beyond her abilities, but very fluffy on the whole.

/Mahoutsukai no Yome/

- Urban fantasy involving a young girl with a ~mysterious power~ who gets bought in the underworld slave trade by a demon who isn't all he appears to be. Lots of variety in the mythos inspiring the world.

/Dungeon Meshi/

- D&D-inspired world with a bunch of races, magic, and dungeons! When things go terribly wrong for an adventuring party, they must delve deeper than they ever have, and understand the truth behind what dungeons are to rescue their friend.

/Made in Abyss/

- In a world not dissimilar from our own, there remains one wonder of the world untouched by man: The Abyss. There, things lurk beyond man's wildest imagination, and the treasures pulled at great cost from it are peerless in value. And for one young girl, the Abyss is where her mother lies, waiting for her. /(Warning: lots of loli/shotabait.)/

/Helck/

- The comedic story of a human hero who journeys to the demon world to... destroy all the humans? Experiences extreme genre shift into thriller-tragedy, and worth a read up to that point if the first part isn't so interesting..

*** Disclaimer: I just started to read manga this year and use it to learn languages. I haven't read the ones you've listed. I was stuck in bed at the beginning of the year and was forced-read (that should be a word!) by my girlfriend. I now know what isekai or otaku means. A part of me died for this ;)

Rationalist manga recommended on the sub many times:

- [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/100128/Yakusoku_no_Neverland][The Promised Neverland]]

- [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/102690/Deatte_5-byou_de_Battle][Battle in 5 seconds after meeting]]

Manga I haven't seen recommended here with rationalist elements (all rather slow paced):

- [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/107562/Kusuriya_no_Hitorigoto][Drugstore Soliloquy]] - a young woman with knowledge of pharmacy is sold as a servant to the imperial court. She applies her expertise to much more than curing diseases. It's more interesting than I make it sound.

- [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/97579/Koushaku_Reijou_no_Tashinami][Accomplishments of the Duke's Daughter]] - an otome game devotee is reincarnated (overused trope alert) in a game as the antagonist. Yet, the manga doesn't become a trope avoidance type. Instead, the main heroin introduces concepts from her world to improve the lives of the citizens.

- [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/1067/Cesare__Hakai_no_Souzousha][Cesare: Hakai no Souzousha]] - best described as: if Mario Puzo wrote manga. It's worth checking out for the art itself. Sometimes I just stare at the [[https://i.imgur.com/cbW5F0l.jpg][Renaissance scenery]] and marvel. It follows a naive student who befriends Cesare Borgia and learns how the world really works.

*** Low hanging fruit: [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/121/Fullmetal_Alchemist][Full Metal Alchemist]]?

I haven't read much manga after 2010 so I don't know the popularity timeline, but I've recently thought about finishing some manga that I enjoyed a lot:

[[https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=209][Dorohedoro]] - Very flavorful and memorable dungeon-punk worldbuilding and characters, though not rational. I need to actually finish it, but it was a quirky blend of grimdark comedy and lighthearted gore.

Pretty much anything by [[https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=115][Naoki Urasawa]]. Mostly thinking of [[https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=226][Pluto]], but Monster and 20th Century Boys were pretty great as well. Based off of Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy universe, Pluto's a murder mystery from the perspective of robot detective Gesicht. Humanizing AI.

One of the better CYOAs I have seen in some time. I just loved it.. From the worldbuilding behind the dragons, to each hand painted scene. Playing as a genuinely nonhuman character.. The mystery of human tribes emerging from the departed advanced civilization and their tech.. And well, being a /dragon/. I wish the death mechanics were less punishing and hunting can get tedious in the beginning.. But other than that I'm in my first playthrough and there is still much to explore. I went the compassion route, and in the next one I'm going full wisdom and focus on the mystery of the tech of the others.

** So I've seen [[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Heretical Edge]] recommended here a few times, and a few arcs in it doesn't look at all rational to me. I'd envision the Heretics to have more interaction with the normal one even if the muggles can't remember it, maybe disguising those teleportation mirrors as powerful technology or something. I had good feelings about this story when the students were all given magic cockroaches and told to kill them for power, but this is never taken to its logical extent. Why aren't there super powerful hunters going out and caging powerful Strangers so that you can have the students whack a bunch of them assembly-line style? The story explicitly shows that you only need to get the final hit. Also there's no shown limit on how often the Heretical Edge can be used, why aren't they getting as many people shoved in there as possible? More generally, the main character often just ... stands there while her team mates are getting wailed on. She's supposed to be this experienced reporter who bluffs a drug lord into opening his safe. That opening was cool, and it promised good things; a hero-type who's motivated to do the right thing and is unflappable in the face of danger. Except no, she then spends her time frozen while analyzing how her friends fight the Strangers for her, and then getting the totally-unearned final blow on a complete technicality. And no one takes issue with this. I mean, I'm glad the author didn't go into teen drama territory, but someone questioning if that was actually fair and organizing the final blows so everyone gets roughly equal slices of power never happens. And the constant yelping gets annoying.

Sorry, that was a whole lot of nitpicking. I dropped the story, but it's not bad, especially if you can put aside the implications of the premise and just go along with the story.

why is it so many stories are about teenagers in life-or-death fights that are mandated by the school? "oh, you have powers? great, your conscripted to a military academy fight club!" and then of course they make the adults idiots who no kid is going to talk to. there is an entire genere of this.

#+end_quote

The Watsonian reason is that, if you have a bunch of teenagers developing lethal powers, you absolutely are going to put them in a situation where they have to learn how to use them properly or die trying. It protects everyone else.

The Doylist reason is because adolescence is the conceptual "hero's journey," and life-or-death struggles make a blatant framework for that. Ritualizing combat is a common metaphor for how kids feel as they're being shoved into a competitive social landscape.

*** I agree with basically all of your criticism. The premise and setup for the world was really promising but it falls short on most rationality criteria. I agree that the lack of providing students carefully chosen monster powers on a regular basis is outright offensive, but the lack of kids from rich/powerful family who were fed choice powers from childhood makes me want to pull my hair out.

I also remain unconvinced about the motivation to hide the mother research/Fossor/Ammon from the relevant authorities, as well as the weird denial of human/stranger children and their ability to go underneath the radar.

Preferably though the story would go into full HPMOR territory, where either the school /wants/ to uplift the regular world but can't for some reason, or the school is a relic of the past that doesn't even exist anymore because the Strangers won and the main character stumbles across the ruins and accidentally uses the Heretical Edge, becoming an instant target from every Stranger out there.

​

Why do I want to read it? I started the story, and in the very first chapter, I see this gem:

/The world isn't big enough for everyone to be young and immortal forever. Even after exhausting every esoteric and obscure form of magic known to Wizardry, there's simply not enough food and not enough space/

​

This is utterly retarded and no intelligent character could conclude this. Young != Reproductively Fertile. /Obviously/ if there was a mechanism to reverse aging and to make everyone presently alive their optimal biological self, anyone who wasn't an utter moron would put some limiters to at least /reduce/ fertility temporarily until a longer term system is figured out. Or, at least, if this was the objection and the alternative was to keep letting millions of people turn into corpses every single year.

​

Sure, the rest of Harry's reasons make sense, but this one is so utterly stupid that I kind of haven't finished the first chapter. Why should I keep reading?

*** I haven't read the story, but real-world fertility limitation would be difficult to implement. China had a hell of a time just restricting it to one child, and one child in a population of virtual immortals would increase the population by almost fifty percent every generation (depending on assumptions concerning pair bonding, heterosexuality, murder and accident rates, etc.). People have kids for a number of reasons. Poor people who can't find a way to improve their status, and who you'd think would be strongly motivated to live within their means, don't. It's not, from what I understand, a matter of not knowing about birth control, or lacking access to it; it's just that if you're stuck doing miserable unfulfilling work, living in a dump, and being regarded as a loser, having a kid can seem like your one shot at happiness.

​

Even if you eliminate that as a consideration thanks to magical post-scarcity and perfect social engineering, the desire to have and raise a family is very deep-rooted, by both tradition and biology. A population that doesn't suffer natural death would have to have very close to no kids whatever. As conceiving children is extremely easy for most people, and perpetually young people would have perpetually young libidos, you'd need, I guess, drastic alterations of human nature, or something like a police state. Actually, just the second one, because you'd need a police state to enforce extreme mods of human physiology and behavior. Or so I think.

Second, we just need a birth rate of less than 1 per person to never go above a finite maximum. If this is confusing look at geometric series. The birth rate in Europe is just short of 0.8 per person. Assuming that everyone lives forever and every new generation keeps the same birth rate, we will never become more than 5 times the number of people currently in Europe, not counting migration.

That results in 0.8*0.8=0.64 born children for a total of 1+0.8+0.64=2.44. The following generation then is 0.64*0.8=0,5 for a total of 1+0.8+0.64+0.5=3ish.

If you're basically twenty-one, physically, but have years of experience raising kids, you're in great shape to have another.

​

I say this as someone who has never been to Europe and knows little of its contemporary culture, but does have a new baby around and thus has a perfect opportunity to watch its melting effect on the female brain. People have strong biological impulses to have kids, and today's culture is weird, still fresh from the shakeup of modern birth control and the attendant sexual revolution. I'm skeptical of the idea that it's going to last, but admittedly that's because in our world it's long-term dysfunctional and will have to change one way or another. 1.8 TFR is usually touted as the replacement figure, but your figure is per person, not per woman.

Yes yes, I know that TFR is given per woman. In 2015 the TFR in Europe was 1.58 which is approximately 0.8 child per person. I personally like per person better because it's easier for the lay person to understand. 1 child per person and 2 child per woman is roughly equivalent, and we just need a rate of children less than any of these numbers.

The thing is that the current TFR does account for the strong biological urge to have children. The only compelling argument (assuming the absence of a total society restructuring) I see for why the TFR might rise is that the children of people who reproduce more probably also have a tendency to reproduce more, however this assumes that parents have a stronger influence on personal fertility rate than societal incentives which I am not convinced is true.

*********** My intended point was not that you would continually want more children, but that you would have obvious opportunities to do so. Many, many people find it fulfilling to raise children, and while the elimination of the biological clock reduces the pressure, it also removes the limit. I would argue that a good part of the reduction in fertility is tied to women's lib and the increasing presence of women in the workplace; women are effectively forced to choose between building careers and building families, much of the time. By the time they've built up the professional life they want, they're past peak fertility and may not have a partner they want to settle down with, or the energy reserves to contemplate eighteen years of parenting. This is leaving out issues like declining male fertility and innate fertility problems in many women, which would presumably be fixable with advancing tech.

If women can be in childbearing condition forever, that door is never locked shut permanently. They don't have to worry about mutational load from age, or declining fertility, or dealing with teenagers during menopause. All of that's gone. A sixty-eight-year-old woman would presumably be just as potentially fertile as a teenager, and look forward to being vigorous, spry and alert for many, many years.

Now, all this would entail such a profound restructuring of society that it's hard to imagine clearly what the finished situation would look like. Probably society would be much more atomized, at the least, which is generally bad. People are social animals, and the effective death of family life might manifest some truly weird coping mechanisms. But I don't think it's safe to assume that current patterns would hold, no.

Wait, what? Sigh.

Ok, so do you even have a vague idea of how human biology works? Because if you did, you wouldn't post such nonsense.

In order for a male or a female human to conceive a child, it's an extremely complex process. Thousands of things have to go right. If any one thing at a critical step goes wrong, it will never, ever work.

Sooo....this is a society where the technology exists, whether it be through a magic spell, nanomachines, or lots of careful genetic edits using a tool like CRISPR. Anyways, it would be extremely straightforward for the doctors(s) and AIs or magicians or whatever who are processing each patient, restoring their youth and rebuilding their bodies, to break just one tiny thing, making them infertile.

There are countless things that could get broken. One tiny gene in specific cells in the testes would make a man completely infertile. Tiny changes to monthly cycles in a woman to just reduce fertility, not eliminate. One tiny gene in every egg in a woman would make her completely infertile.

Sure, this tweak can get undone. You know, by wizards or someone with a license to control nanomachines or with very specialized equipment and knowledge. But it's not going to come undone by accident, and people can have as much sex as they want, this will never fail on it's own.

At which point, a society trying to keep population levels down to what their available resources can handle merely needs to license/restrict the equipment and people doing the rebuilds.

This is nothing like China's one child policy, where they had a corrupt government and the resources of a third world country to police it.
