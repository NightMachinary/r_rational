Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Can anyone recommend me some original English language Xianxia (rational optional). I've read the Cradle Series and the SV quest Forge of Destiny. Both were enjoyable. I've tried to read some translated Xianxia web novels but even the one's I've been told have good translation come across as just about unreadable to me.

*** [[https://lsdell.com/chapter-001-first-floor/][Taint]] is an Xianxia that I quite enjoyed, in fact I am just about to start re reading it.

The bad:

- The first few chapters are kinda dull. It took a while (chapter 13-ish) to get the point where I was actively enjoying it and not just reading it for answers to the mysterys.

- The main character is not a good person. She has a goal to which everything else is secondary. Not only that but she spends years traped in a tower alone with nothing but demons and as a result is quite feral. Like she flat out murders innocent people because she couldn't understand a simple social cue.

The good:

- There are some fucking amazing fight scenes. They really manage to capture the enormous power of the characters involved and it only gets better as the story gose on.

- The magic system is well thought out and, dare I say it, quite rational. Every so often a new rule will be introduced and there will be an ah ha! moment as every thing up to that point slides into place.

- I for one found a few side characters quite like able and I found my really feeling for the main character. I wanted her to do well and succeed on an emotional level.

&nbsp

&nbsp

If you hate the translation then you could try a pictographic medium which relies less on language.

Try [[https://ta1.taadd.com/files/img/logo/201506/201506051350475547.jpg][Zui Wu Dao]] or Tail of demons and God's.

*** I only know of a few OEL Xianxia to recommend:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/][White Collar Cultivator]] was pretty good with an everyman character isekaied into a generic wuxia world and with him digging into the mental differences between mortals and cultivators. He's basically using common-sense and his mastery over bureaucracy to stay alive. Unfortunately, WCC is dead so you might not like the abrupt ending.

You've probably already read [[https://www.amazon.com/Sufficiently-Advanced-Magic-Arcane-Ascension-ebook/dp/B06XBFD7CB][Sufficiently Advanced Magic]], but the power levels of Xianxia is very evident in the books and I think it's adjacent to the genre even if it's missing the Asian cultural influences.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][The Dao of Magic]] is a fantastic story about a man from Earth who seeks out to scientifically investigate Qi and wants to completely rebuild cultivation society into one where everyone isn't back-stabbing each other all the time.

**** Thanks. I might give The Dao of Magic of much a try.

I'm honestly not sure why there aren't more OEL Xianxia. I mean, there's something of a fad for Xianxia at the moment, driven by the translated web novels. Books like the Cradle Series are selling really well. Quests like Forge of Destiny are really popular.

Why aren't there a thousand follow-the-leader stories out there, just like the thousand isekai clones and the thousand LitRPG clones?

***** Not much. There's some influence in the characters' names which sound Asian for the most part. There's also the trappings of the Xianxia genre itself, but that's not very Asian since a lot of it is similar to the leveling up and skills of LitRPG, minus any stats.

I suggest reading the free sample of the first [[https://www.amazon.com/Unsouled-Cradle-1-Will-Wight/dp/0989671763/ref=asc_df_0989671763/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312195849562&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1165998674239578925&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9007926&hvtargid=pla-495222356045&psc=1][book]] on Amazon. It gives an accurate idea of the tone for the series. If you don't like it after reading the free sample, then don't bother.

  Baatar sighed. Taduk had told him the boy was smart. Did he lie? “The purpose in the demonstration of the Forms is two-fold. First, to build up the body to withstand the infusion of Heavenly Energy. The stronger the body, the more Heavenly Energy it can absorb. The more Heavenly Energy absorbed by the body, the more powerful the warrior. Understand?” The boy nodded after a moment.

  “Is it [cumulative]?” The boy asked.

  Baatar frowned. The boy spoke a word he didn't understand. “Explain.”

  “I do the Forms and strengthen my body, to absorb more Heavenly Energy, which strengthens my body. Does the strengthening of my body using Heavenly Energy, allow my body to absorb more Heavenly Energy?”

  It took the boy drawing the process out in the dirt for Baatar to understand. A simple circle diagram. Seems Taduk wasn't lying, the boy is smart. “Ah. You are asking if the process is cumulative. No. There is a limit, based on the level of your natural body.”

It's not too hard to make a hard magic system with very specific and limited abilities like in the Mistborn novels, but I'm looking for examples where magic as a whole can do a lot of things, but somehow still manages to be explained well enough that problems can be solved with it without it seeming like a deus ex machina.

**** It's not a series, it's a collaborative piece of fiction on Sufficient Velocity. The background of the setting is basically Infinite Stratos, if you're familiar with that.

If not, the Earth is undergoing alien invasion, and everybody is trying to fight off the aliens together. That's the "Battle Action". The Highschool part is that, using a standard anime trope, the high schoolers can use the fancy war machines to fight said aliens.

Harem + Side Character: The collaborative part controls a side character, not the main harem protagonist, as a trope subversion.

** Are there any other stories where the main character is the member of a harem rather than being the protagonist-like individual that a typical harem tends to focus around? The following two stories are great examples where the first one has the protagonist be an haremette and the second one is the male friend of an harem protagonist. Even though Leo ends up having a three way relationship later, the story still has novel takes on the typical harem shenanigans.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)]] [Original Fiction] - Rokusabe Koujirou is a Valkyrie, a human compatible with a device known as a Valkyrie Core and able to materialize a suit of Powered Armour known as a Valkyrie Frame. Training as a member of the United Nations Air Force to combat the growing Antagonist forces, Koujirou is one of less than 100 males out of the 20,000 Valkyries in service. Surrounded by women, can Koujirou find a way to fight the Antagonists, save the world and maybe even find love? It doesn't really matter, cause that's not who this quest is about.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum][The Simulacrum]] [Original Fiction] - An amnesiac guy from our world is sent into a harem romance comedy show, except instead of being the protagonist, which is the typical thing for how these stories tend to go, he is the idiot friend of the protagonist. The world closely follows narrative tropes from the genre and he uses his genre savviness to avoid awkward situations that normally arise out of these stories, and figure out what's going on and why he is here.

Another type of work I'm looking for is where a relatively normal person is thrown into a world that operates on porno logic. Erogamer is the only example I can think of and I'm hoping for more that similarly plays around with the conventions of erotica.

*** [[https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/][Need to Become Stronger]] is pretty good. It's a naruto fanfic and the magic system has been revampted in a way that allows for losts of inteligent exploitation. Considering how simler MoL is to naruto (chakra control = shaping skill, Shaping exercises = tree/water walking exercises, indidual spells/jutsu takeing lots of practice the master, etc) the rational naruto magic system starts to look quite simler to MoL.

When I read it the chapter quality went like so: 1-2 (bad), 3-12 (ok), 14-20 (very fucking good), 20-28 (good), 28 - 43 (very good).

*** Here's a list of "power fantasy" books, that might fit your request.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] by cthuluraejepsen - An amazing webnovel that imo blows every other litrpg out of the water. A story of a teenager that finds himself in a world that seems to be a mix of all the worlds that he created as a DM for his DnD group. If the description doesn't appeal to you, try it anyway. It's that good. Almost 1 million words of quality writing in 2.5 years, and *it's free*.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192821-cradle][Cradle Series]] by Will Wight - Everyone is born with an one of 5 aptitudes in the sacred arts, which shape their paths for the rest of their lives. Lindon is an unsouled, born without.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/45765-night-angel][The Night Angel series]] by Brent Weeks - about an orphan who becomes an apprentice to the best assassin in the world. Pure action, very tightly paced and executed, just like Cradle. Some extreme themes and violence though, be warned. Also, it's the author's first books, so a bit amateurish.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/49673-lightbringer][The Lightbringer series]] also by Brent Weeks - a fat loser teenager discovers that he's a mage when his village is attacked. Great action, great magic system, great worldbuilding. A vast improvement from his first series, which was already pretty good.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13569581-blood-song][Blood Song by Anthony Ryan]] - A young boy is abandoned by his father at an order of warrior monks and learns to become a deadly weapon for his (atheistic) religion. It's pretty cool and original, but the sequels are not as good.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime]] series by M.C. Planck - Middle-aged Guy enters a world where humans are surrounded by monsters and at the risk of annihilation and tries to start an industrial revolution.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files][The Dresden Files]] Series by Jim Butcher - A story of a small time wizard in Chicago who doesn't care who he pisses off if it gets in the way of doing the right thing. First few books are kind of rough, but they're short and by the 3rd or 4th book it really comes together. If you don't like it by then, give up. It's also a bit too episodic at times, but increasingly connected in later books.

*** What a coincidence! I binged the entire season yesterday. LDR doesn't have as much to say as it thinks it does, and a few of the episodes were kind of contrived, but it's definitely a worthwhile watch for the quality of the animations alone, to say nothing, of the interesting worlds it builds.

Personally, I think ZIMA BLUE was the best episode from a "thinky" standpoint, while "LUCKY 13" was the best from an "I-liked-it" standpoint.

**** I liked it, but it was never anything special. The dialogue especially could be extremely trite and cliched at times. The animation/cgi was pretty great though.

Overall I found it kind of depressing, actually. Imagine using those resources on a worm adaptation, or something similar. Then again I was never a fan of anthologies, so maybe it's just me.

** I was thinking about it recently, and I realized that the [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZQMLMS6][Dream trilogy]] is pretty rational, in a gritty sense - the characters have limited intelligence (in both meanings of the term), but they examine their options and do as best they can despite imperfect information and limited time to think.

It also has an interestingly complex story; the antagonists actually take the time to mislead the characters, and the characters have to figure out what's wrong with the narrative the antagonist is spinning in order to figure out what they really need to do to get home.

I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you're into the "pulled into a world with a video game-like system" genre.

*** I read the prologue and I really don't understand why do so many authors name their protagonist with bland, generic, Caucasian names. Fred and Jeff are two of the main protagonists of the novel you mentioned and I don't know if its just me but, I feel very disinterested when I see a Caucasian name like "Joe" as one of the main characters. This is very prevalent in royalroadl as well. Are the authors trying to target a demographic to attract more readers? I for one can't picture a guy named "Bob" as the legendary isekai hero that saved the world.

I don't think I am being prejudiced because I am fine reading novels with Caucasian names. Such as if a character is named "Michael." Prevalent Caucasian name but it has a lore to it as Michael is one of the archangels. Or a character named Harry as in Harry Dresden. Jim butcher the author of the dresden files explained in the beginning that his name is a keepsake for the late magician Harry Houdini.

But for all of the Bobs, Joes, Freds, Bills, and Jeffs in the world, I have no love for you.

**** I do a small amount of amateur writing in my spare time and I find coming up with interesting names is hard. Very hard. You have to think deeply about the symbolism of the name and how it relates to the character. A name is something the reader will hear most often about the character so if you get it wrong you've just made your entire story worse with a single decision.

So sometimes I just say 'fuck it' and write something with a "Jeff" or "Dave" or "bob." They are nice and simple only using a single syllable and I can just start writing something without having to think about it.

Baced on what you said though I don't think the problem is with Caucasian names but with single syllable shortend names. Like Michael, Jeffrey and Fredrick aren't terrible names but when they get shortend they become Mike, Jeff and Fred which are kinda dull.

** I just stumbled on [[https://gamesoftranscendi.wordpress.com/][Simulacrum: A Post-Singularity Story]] and finished reading it today. How do I best put this.....it's a story that follows an insane logic, but in a way such that you can learn to understand the insanity.

It's set in a world (although there is no guarantee that the world isn't real or a virtual reality) and modifying any intelligence to be beyond human is impossible. The only way to become a post-human is by creating a clone (via brain uploading) that is fundamentally smarter than you, and then delete the less intelligent version of you to make way for the new and improved version. Self-improvement is a continuous cycle of iterative death and in-story called 'necromancy' for this very reason. There is a deliberate invoking of the trope, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance][Values Dissonance]], to convey the counter-intuitiveness of this idea of self-improvement through death and to show the majesty of the Singularity.

I don't consider it a rational story because the setting doesn't feel like it is completely thought out, but the protagonist(s) can be considered rational due to how strongly they commit to their logic of self-improvement.

The webpage I linked to is a little confusing because the author has a log of his life in the same place as the table of contents, so just scroll down for the links to the chapters. Here's the TV Tropes [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Simulacrum][page]] of the story for anyone interested. I'd be interested in discussing this story with anyone.
