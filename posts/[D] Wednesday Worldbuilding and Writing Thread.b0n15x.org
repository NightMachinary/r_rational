Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I'm writing a short CYOA. Would anyone mind looking at it and giving feedback? It's a Meta CYOA where you choose one of many conflicts, and then go through another CYOA as normal, but with a minor boost to your abilities. The impetus behind it is that you have a ton of "here's a bunch of magic powers, have fun," CYOAs that tend to blend into each other. This CYOA intends to give them a raison d'etre. I'll PM google drive links to anyone who wants to see it.

** I'm in the early stages of starting to plan out my next story. Anyone interested in helping with the worldbuilding and related low-level prep work?

(If so, reply here or send me a PM, and I'll PM you a link to the GDoc.)

*** I'm wondering what it is exactly that you'll need others to do?

When I help other people with their writing, it's mostly reading for feedback or editing as a beta. But it sounds like you want someone to help with planning the story which sounds a little different from other assistance I've provided in the past. Do you mind clarifying a little?

**** I don't mind at all.

I have the seed of a worldbuilding idea, but I need to extrapolate all the details from that seed that are relevant to the story. I'm hoping to imply verisimilitude on the scale of present-day massive interconnectedness, where a random individual's YouTube video might suddenly get tens of millions of views, or a previously-unstocked fruit puzzles shoppers one week and is gone the next.

Basically, I'm hoping for some help making sure I don't forget some of the more obvious implications of "If X, then ...?".

***** Okay, that sounds interesting and I'll be willing to help out. I'm a little busy now, so don't expect feedback until late tonight or early tomorrow. I'm on Eastern Time or UTC-4.

I would be down either way.

** What skills and assets could an American sailor from 1902(returning home from China after the Boxer Rebellion) bring with him if he suddenly found himself in a feudal society with a technological level of around the year 1200? said society also exists in a fantasy world completely cut off from his own, there is also no magic in this world.

*** Quite a lot, actually. A sailor at the turn of the century could have some knowledge of newer [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipbuilding#Early_modern][shipbuilding]] techniques. Depending on his background, he might even have some idea of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel#Modern_steelmaking][modern steelmaking]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine][steam engine]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacture_during_the_British_Industrial_Revolution][Textile manufacturing]]. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution][Industrial Revolution]] was well before then, and he would have seen early examples of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production][mass production]], and although this was before Ford Motor Company popularized the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line][Assembly line]], they did use the concept in some contexts such as slaughterhouses, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production#Factory_electrification][factory electrification]] was growing quickly. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseless_carriage][Horseless carriage]] was still a curiosity at that point, but it had been around for a while. Note that in 1200, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system][Double-entry bookkeeping]] wasn't a thing yet, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy#Early_modern_era][Scurvy]] was still a problem. And while gunpowder existed, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_gunpowder#Historiography_of_gunpowder_and_gun_transmission][guns]] weren't really a thing yet. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press][Printing press]] with movable type and metal letters wasn't discovered until 1439.

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprengel_pump][Sprengle pump]] gives you a reasonably cheap and easy high vacuum, which can be used for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb][Incandescent lights]], once he has a source of electricity (such as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_cell][Galvanic cell]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo][dynamo]]). Unfortunately, they still used carbon filaments in 1902, so he wouldn't know about tungsten filament.

If your sailor is the literary type, it might help to get a feel for some of the literature of 1902, and try to imagine it as though it were recently published. The most obvious cultural touchstone would be Mark Twain's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court][A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]], which was published in 1889. Wikipedia has a good list of popular works of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_years_in_literature#1900s][literature by year]]. Anything by Jules Verne would be old enough, as would be Dracula, Frankenstein, Treasure Island, Sherlock Holmes, Wizard of Oz, Flatland, and so on.

*** You might find the book "How to Invent Everything: A Survival Guide for the Stranded Time Traveler", by Ryan North, to be worth flipping through.

*** "Sailor" is a great choice, because ships are expensive, and knowing how to build and pilot ships better could make the MC quite valuable. Assuming the MC is a well-educated sailor, maybe hoping to run a shipping operation of their own one day, and that they have experience in sailing ships and not just steamships, then they'll know nifty navigation and astronomy tools (compass! sextant! telescope! pendulum clocks and mainspring watches!), ways to build faster and safer ships that take fewer crew (the Dutch were great at this in our timeline), and also double-entry bookkeeping and algebra (great for running a business), not to mention finance concepts like insurance and joint-stock corporations (great for long-distance trading companies, especially).

​

Basically, if your MC can get themselves to a major seaport, they can help people go more places and make more money with noticeably less risk.

​

Gunpowder is a long-term game-changer, but it takes a decent-size industrial base to move it from "fireworks" to "knocks down walls quickly", so it depends on how much clout the MC has. The same is true for steam engines (railroads, etc.) and telegraphs.

​

The MC may know enough to make a big difference in clothing and in farming. By 1902, we had things like spinning wheels and flying shuttles that could make weaving fabric out of fibers a lot faster. Clothing is big business in medieval times, so that's potentially worth something. Farming - the MC may understand fertilization and crop rotation a lot better than the locals, which in the long term could give everyone a lot more to eat. But both of these are "ordinary peasant" occupations, unlike ships which are a big glamorous investment, so they'd be very valuable to a ruler in the long term but not necessarily super impressive in the short term.

​

Vaccination will save an enormous number of lives, if biology works the same way there as here. Unfortunately your MC is too early to know about penicillin or other antibiotics. Your MC may know the value of handwashing, which will save lives if it gets adopted.
