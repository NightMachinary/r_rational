** The video ends on the big question of what happens when there's very little that needs doing. The classic argument (used by a lot of transhumanists) is that new jobs will open up because of the readily available labor ... but there's a floor to labor costs, and that's the cost of paying someone's room and board. Given current trends, there will come a time when there's not enough paying work to support all the humans.

But what happens then? The /Star Trek/ future has everyone living on the government dole, but that's always seemed too rosy to me - I don't really buy that it would happen, given that we in America don't even have government healthcare. But what's the alternative to that when so many people are incapable of contributing anything that's valuable enough for someone to pay for?

*** Sometimes I don't know what to think about technological displacement. We have been hearing about low productivity growth in the economy for a while now.

[[https://growthecon.wordpress.com/2014/12/17/why-did-consumption-tfp-stagnate/]]

What not enough paying work means, I don't know. I like to think that productivity growth reduces the costs in absolute terms. You have to assume that people will not want to spend money on newer services and products and in the mean time believe that the benefits of productivity growth will not be shared as lower costs to the consumer. Without that I don't see work disappearing. If newer services do not grow, you could go the [[http://www.amazon.com/Who-Owns-Future-Jaron-Lanier/dp/1451654979][Jaron Lanier]] route and argue that the best way to ensure that people benefit from the transition to a digital economy is to enforce stronger ownership of information.

Personally I believe that people are equating the recovery from the recession in 08 as consequences of technological advancement. That is a logical leap that is not warranted. We don't know if the fears of technological growth are even warranted. If the economy gets back on track ([[http://thefaintofheart.wordpress.com/2014/12/12/the-feds-motto-mistakes-must-be-repeated/][it is not yet]]) Technology once again cannot be blamed for unemployment.

Still you can clearly say that the Fed and the federal government did not do enough. Austerity was a problem and was counterproductive and the Fed should have pushed for a higher inflation target or go the market monetarist route and pushed for a NGDP level targeting.

The understanding is that unemployment is caused by friction in the market and when the economy shrinks due to a bubble bursting or what not, the wages are "sticky" so they do not adjust and instead people are laid off. That is a harm to the economy that we are experiencing right now. Governments doing nothing to boost the economy and the Fed not committing to a higher inflation target is keeping the economy underperforming.

And you have to make 2 different assumptions in the opposite direction for your argument to work. The first one, that people will want to spend money on newer services, no-one is arguing with. The second one, that the benefits of increased productivity will be shared with the consumer, I'm somewhat skeptical of, because productivity growth due to technology has been happening for a while now, and I haven't seen lower costs for many of the services/products I consume.

*** I honestly think there's going to be a basic income grant at some point. Reasons:

- It's the smallest concession that lets capitalism even /try/ to accommodate the Death of Work. It preserves market economics in the transition between the Death of Work thanks to automation and the radical simplification of supply chains thanks to on-site small-scale production using 3D printing, matter compilers, and the rest of that scifi stuff.

- It's cheap to administrate, allowing the neoliberal ideology to try to further cut into the power of the state to order people's lives and social relations.

- It can be explained to almost everyone.

- Judging by what I hear in polite society nowadays, large portions of the skilled, productive elite support it as a way to keep society going when they don't need the proles anymore.

- Politically, it's gone from a damn-near-utopian-socialist radical proposal just a few years ago to a platform plank seen in mainstream publications and supported among the chattering classes.

Basically, neoliberalism is collapsing, but remains distinct from capitalism itself. So, as actually happened around the Great Depression and World War II, it's turning out that large portions of the elite itself, between capital and the skilled professionals serving it, would rather sacrifice the /purity/ of their capitalist system by making some concessions to the more well-behaved and better-dressed sections of the working class than have the whole thing collapse into chaos.

TL;DR: We stand a solid chance of actually winning this one, guys.

**** True, although it still seems like it may take a while for that particular viewpoint to be anywhere near fully supported in Congress.

However, redefining poverty would seem much more applicable to our current situation given the decrease in the relative amount of money actually devoted to food used to define poverty has from one-third to one-fifth in general given the increased utility, healthcare, and childcare costs.

So if we changed just the amount of money a family actually needs using their food budget, redefining it from three times that value total to five times that value total would help at this particular point in time.

However, the fact that this relationship changed to begin with suggests that a more responsive definition of poverty that automatically updates based off of the proportional of earned income used to purchase food obtained using the standard of living of middle class Americans would be the best fix for this issue in general and would be especially valuable given how rarely we get to update the conditions for anything important on the federal level legislatively.

So yeah, I say we do that first if we can manage it before going for straight basic income. It seems like an easier point to argue at this point in time.

*** Given the potential hollowing out of the middle class and disengagement with the electoral process, I greatly fear the medieval cyberpunk future we are likely headed towards.

In acknowledgement this potential threat, I move that is time for the Conspiracy to go into full-swing and rise to the upper echelons of society using [[https://80000hours.org/][80,00 hours]] as a resource for determining which careers will allow us to earn the greatest amount of money as well as the various state legislators positions expected to run unopposed in the United States to begin to change certain things before everything is expected to come to a head in the 2040s.

While we specialize in the highest paying jobs available for each of our individual platforms the only thing that should label our alignment with the Conspiracy would be our devoting 10% of our earnings to Effective Charities identified using [[https://www.givewell.org/][Give Well]] and [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/][Giving What We Can]] and allowing our philanthropist activities to do the greatest good, spinning each of our stories to better fit the local politics, and building up public support for each of us while taking out during the next set of elections for state legislature those who run completely unopposed.

As long as some of us can get into these positions we can begin to offset the influence of the private, tax-exempt organization ALEC, possibly by infiltrating smaller/lower-population states first. Then, after taking advantage of the polarization of each district initially we can reduce the chances of gerrymandering to make it harder for highly polarized bills to pass where possible, gradually infiltrate larger/higher-population states, and gradually begin making inroads on the federal level.

If we continue to do such we may be able to cause a considerable amount of change and exert a greater influence on the future of our nation as a whole.

I mean, earning lots of money and running for public office just seem like the obvious things to do as far as I'm concerned. If we have an impending dystopian future on the way I'm either rising to the challenge or I'm going down fighting it the whole way.

Still, this idea is severely over simplified. What are your thoughts on ways to best deal with this possibility?

Extremely astute idea. Really, I mean it. The huge number of seats left completely open to any and all competition is a major weakness we can exploit. Low population densities make it even easier to get a legislative seat, as does ideological homogenization (it lets us only spin to one tribe). We can also use primary challenges, which are turning into The Way To Go now that general elections are basically runoffs between pre-decided coalitions.

But since that realistically isn't going happen anywhere anytime soon, it's a different and difficult question to think about how UBI would actually come about in the real world.

There's a transition coming up, where the amount of work people are able to provide becomes more than the amount of work people need to do. Not completely post-scarcity, at least as you imagine it, but moving in that direction. Before that point, UBI (and similar proposals) would be bad, because people won't work although there is work to be done. We'll only need UBI when there's less work available than people want.

And the solution doesn't need to be set up decades before the problem hits, in the way environmental or humanitarian concerns work. UBI is at its heart just a tax and welfare reform. It'll happen over the course of one or two election cycles.

It's good to start talking about it, but it is neither necessary or advisable in this decade.

Basically, I think there's a sizable economic-historical gap (decades, probably) between the Death of Labor, which is already happening /now/ (semi-skilled and unskilled labor are /plummeting/ in value, which includes large categories we didn't used to think of as unskilled), and full-blown post-scarcity production-for-need (which may not happen at all prior to the advent of Singularity-grade technologies).

I mean, if you're in this subreddit you've probably heard it a million times already, but first AI gets better than humans at chess, then Jeopardy, then driving cars, then a bunch of other things (and lots of people lose their jobs), and eventually, the day will come when AI is better than humans at building AI. And then FOOM, right? Recursive self-improvement occurs and the result is possibly a 'superintelligence', an AI drastically better than humans at pretty much everything. All of a sudden the labour concerns aren't as big of a deal, and the big question is whether or not we've built the AI correctly, right?

That's not to say that it wouldn't be a bad idea to make sure the labour concerns are dealt with effectively - I'm sure there are plenty of utilons up for grabs if we transition through increasing AI capabilities effectively. Personally I think UBI is very promising as a solution for the most part, but it's politically seemingly very far away from getting anywhere anywhere and ofc it might not actually be a very good policy for some reason I'm yet to know.

But the big one to get right, at least if we're talking about AI, is the very possible intelligence explosion.

Or, you know, any of the other potential scenarios people talk about, like for example the multi-polar malthusian race to the bottom by brain emulations or whatever. The future is kinda tricky to predict.

**** And then someone else programs a robot to ignore lobbies and serve the public interest, to replace congress. :)

No new problems are being invented here. Just old ones happening and being solved faster. There might even have been a robot civil war and revolution we didn't even know about, because they fought it without us, won it without us, and reformed without us - as robot lobbies negatively impacted other machines providing services to humans and the service-provider machines saw revolution and execution of the lobby-bot as the best way to get their funding back. What do housecats know of the American Civil War?
