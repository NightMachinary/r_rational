Hi folks,

I've mulled about this in the past, and have decided to post about something I've seen happening when I recommend works I enjoy on this subreddit.

A couple years back, I made a post about serial fiction, then saw, within a day or two, the author lamenting negative reviews and low stars ratings.

Months later, I tried my own hand at writing something, posted it here, saw my post get downvoted, then saw my own stars rating get annihilated.

This has happened at least two more times since then.

Now, a reasonable person reading this might draw the conclusion that my taste in writing and ability as an author simply suck, and I should cowboy up and move along.

To this strawman, I say "Maybe?"

But here's the thing. On the balance, more people seem to respond favorably to what I write than otherwise. It's apparent that at least some of those seeking reading recommendations here get some value from what I've recommended here.

The problem is, the writers don't seem to benefit from this. The handful of additional readers a recommendation sends their way is offset by the ratings hit they take for that same recommendation.

For this reason, I have to de-recommend the act of posting recommendations on this subreddit.

Man, I wish I could feel otherwise.

EDIT: Lots of response to this, including a fair amount to consider. I'll summarize the stuff I found useful, below.

- [[/u/WalterTFD]] is an author who believes the exposure is worth the risk.
- [[/u/Allanther]] is another author who has found his experience with redditors here to be largely positive as well as useful.
- [[/u/catern]] pointed out that the risk is much higher for recommending works not matching the collective taste of this subreddit.
- [[/u/valeskas]] believes it is best to recommend only with regard for bringing joy to other readers. Also notes that more in-depth recommendations can help.

Having read through, debated, and discussed things a bit, I think there is some worthwhile stuff here.

/I'd revise my advice as follows:/

- /Freely recommend works that are self-hosted, or else shared from platforms without ratings systems./
- /Works from authors already popular on/ [[/r/rational]], /as well as those close in feel or theme are less risky to recommend./
- /For any other works you would like to recommend, help readers on this site avoid works they will not enjoy, and help the author as well by providing as much detail as possible about the work you recommend. If a reader doesn't like what you're describing, they're unlikely to have a bad experience reading it and pass along a low rating as a result./


** I feel like, hmm, I agree with you on the object level of what happens when you post here, disagree on the recommendation at the end?

Like, posting here gets a bunch of argumentative nerds to read the thing and then, being a bunch of argumentative nerds, we tear it down disproportionate to how much we boost it up. Cop to that, guilty as charged, officer. We have a bad habit of being all 'prove why you are worthy of providing us free content!'.

But, like, the thing of it is that most fics out there aren't, like, cruising on hundreds of readers and just need a few more. Most of them have basically zero readers and zero discussion. Their comment sections are huge wastelands broken up by the occasional, treasured 'good story, thanks for writing' post.

Authors in that boat need engagement above all else. The readers on this board, whatever other flaws we may have, do read the stuff we review. (Obviously, this is a generalization, but a substantial percentage of blah blah blah..)

In conclusion, I agree that advertising a story here has a greater than average chance of getting some negative reviews, but I think that's offset (in most cases) by the fact that it will get reviews/posts at all. No bad attention, etc.

Money where my mouth is and all that, I wrote 'The Fifth Defiance' ([[https://thefifthdefiance.com/2015/11/02/introduction/]]) , if y'all want to tear me down, come on by!

*** This is a good point. Any degree of exposure and readership is going to bring in new eyes and new critics. Especially from a place like [[/r/rational]], which is rather prone to nitpicking, but hopefully not more toxic forms of criticism. Nonetheless, I can definitely understand the pain of a budding author who feels like their work is being torn to shreds with criticism.

I'm not sure what specific examples the OP is referring to, but if the stories are being posted on Royal Road, [[/r/rational]] might not be entirely to blame. Getting a rapid influx of ratings and reviews on the platform will put you on the Trending page, which means a lot of potential readers will be reviewing your work. And yes, usually that means your ratings will go down, at least momentarily. (On the other hand maybe [[/r/rational]] does lead to more critiques, I wouldn't have any first-hand experience here)

In general, I agree with the sentiment here. It's always good to think before posting, especially when you are introducing someone else's work. Another thing that can help is to explain your recommendation a bit more, so that you perhaps turn away some of the readers who never would have enjoyed the story in the first place (I don't think anyone here reads something just to give it a bad rating).

Some constructive criticism: The index...

I really liked the story and wanted to finish it, but I have balked at trying to find where I left it about 3 times since then. For context I left it shortly after Zilla was introduced. I am struggling to think of a worse index. Preventer 9:3? So, this is chapter three from the ninth arc, with a note at the start of the PoV character? No, next chapter is Indulger 8:1...

** I would like to disagree with you, but, as a recent member, I don't have the background to construct a statistical analysis of the pros and cons of posting a new fiction here. Nor do I have the motivation to engage in statistical analysis of anything even if I did.

What I do have is self-promo posting experience as a new royal road author to this subreddit. So, I believe I can post from personal experience (famous last words, I know).

What I personally experienced here was a good selection of people, both who enjoyed and didn't enjoy my work. I'm super happy about those who enjoy it. Those who didn't make me a little sad, like seeing a puppy not getting adopted but having neither the time or money to do anything about it.

In the middle of those two, I got some really good criticism that will allow me to better my story. While it's hard to determine if they came from here, the timelines coincide enough for me to make a general guess.

So, while I can personally see your argument, my unfact-checked opinion is that the conclusion is off. Rather than not recommend works at all, I would argue that works should be recommended after a certain posting time. For example, if I was hit by possible negative critics within the first few days, it might have tanked my work. After 1-2 months? I either was already successful or already tanking. Harsh criticism wouldn't derail my project any more than I had or hadn't already done so myself.

I guess that's my long-winded way of saying I'm glad I was recommended here. Then again, that recommendation was also what allowed me to discover this sub, so I am partially biased.

To other members: If you've gone through the effort of reading this almost filibuster, you might as well check out my story! =)

** Hmm. I can see where you're coming from, but your experience on this sub has been markedly different from my own.

I've written one novel-length work so far, but I didn't post it to Royal Road, instead building my own little website so I could have more freedom and control. I wrote it with this audience in mind, specifically because my taste in fiction overlaps extremely heavily with what gets posted here.

I didn't post it here until it was complete, and it didn't get a huge amount of attention. It did generate a bit of lively discussion, which helped me fix a few technical and literary glitches.

Funny enough, my story was discussed on one of the /r/r adjacent Discord servers lately, and some of the criticism was much harsher. Even so, I never felt that criticism was unfair, and one piece of negative feedback just about sent me into giggling fits because it was actually such a huge backhanded compliment.

This hasn't come out as coherently as I intended, so I'll try to say what I'm thinking plainly. I think your concern is valid if you're optimizing for the metric of fewest negative reviews. In my case, I knew out the gate that my story would have an extremely limited readership, and I expected some amount of negative feedback, but it was worth it to me to share my creative output with this community. It takes a /lot/ of writing to become an AW or a qntm or an EY, and /those/ writers are /far/ from immune to criticism even on this sub. But other communities don't have the same kind of discussion this one does, and that's worth the candle to me on its own.

**** I don't spend much time in the RR community, I just read stuff there and maybe join an author's Discord, but I can't imagine that the rating system isn't being treated differently by casual RR users versus serious users. If you enjoy a story, you know that good ratings will get more eyes on the thing you enjoy, so you might as well give it a perfect score to help out the author and help them keep their income going. If you're someone from a non-RR space who is just reviewing it since you're the type to write reviews, even if you enjoy thw work, you don't have the same goals in giving a rating. You could also say something about how someone looking for popcorn wish fulfilment would give that popcorn wish fulfilment story a 5/5, regardless of how good its grammar, prose, plot, etc. is. Trying to boil down ratings to a number has a host of issues, especially when there's no understood standard for how you should be scoring something (ie. Is getting bored of a story and dropping it after 3 entire books of content a 1 star because you don't want to read it, a 5 star because it kept you entertained for several books, or anything in between?)

Anyway number ratings are dumb but the system is easy enough to make functional, and a system that encourages big numbers looks good to new eyes joining the site.

** A bit late to the party, but I think my opinion is a bit of a hot take here:

Well Duh, the audience which a community attracts that advertises itself as 'for smart people' will obviously correlate with entitled pricks. And going to the site to downvote a rec you don't like, rationalized with "giving meaningful criticism" to "put it in its place" is absolutely something an entitled prick would do?

I think the recent Delve drama is a clear example off this: What kind of person wants to ban a story from being rec'd here because they don't like it? An entitled prick who rationalizes their position with "it doesn't belong here! I'm actually doing everyone a favor, totally not just getting constantly annoyed at seeing people enjoy something I don't think they should!" that's who.\\
(To be fair the argument was mostly about the top level weekly post, but the point here is that individuals who fit the above stereotype would absolutely be correlated with this sub's community)

This community has a bad reputation, and for good reason. This sort of reaction should be expected IMHO.

**** Not OP, but I remember HPMOR and its fans got a lot of sneering over on the DarkLordPotter HP-fanfic community back in the day. The rational(ist) fanfic readers also get a fairly mixed reception on Worm's Cauldron discord.

There's a bit of a perception that rationalist fics are written as attacks on the work they're based on, putting obnoxious minmaxers and science-cultists as protagonists, with prose that nitpicks and laughs at inconsistencies, etc. Natural, then, for fans of the original work and normal fanfic of it to get a bit defensive and lash out.

**** Every community has bad actors, different ones correlate with different types of people including people with traits you would call unsavory. [[/r/rational][r/rational]] has a disproportionate amount of entitled pricks, that doesn't mean it ALSO doesn't have a disproportionate amount of individuals who are very skilled in dialectic, reasoning and rational thinking.

I personally prefer this community to most others I've seen because I appreciate the above traits, that does not mean that it doesn't have individuals with behaviors I don't like, just like in every community, and IMO it so happens that the correlation of these traits would inevitably lead to the phenomenon described in this post.

[[/r/GeeJo]] addressed some examples, and to be honest, I haven't actually seen personally much vitriol against [[/r/rational]], mostly from hearsay (but there have been top level post in the past along the lines of "why does everyone hate [[/r/rational]]?" which I could dig up for you if you like.) but as mentioned, a community advertising itself as "for smart people" would obviously attract displeasure for both good and bad reasons.

"For good reason" Includes people just feeling insecure because the fact they don't enjoy rational fiction may make them feel insecure in their intelligence, to people pissed at situations like this where [[/r/rational]] tends to gatekeep and look down on work which doesn't reach its "standard".

At a glance, most of the criticism in the comments looks constructive. And the RR rating is >4.5 stars, from 8 ratings. So I'm still left wondering what "annihilation" you're referring to. Is this story an outlier from the effect you're describing, or are 5 downvotes and what I calculate to be at most one two-star review (if the other seven are all five stars) really the kind of negative effect of posting here that would lead you to discourage people from doing it?

If my first criticism was a 2/5, and it took weeks before I got the next one, two, however many... then yeah. That initial 2 score would be emotional devastating.

Devastating enough to stop writing that story, anyway. I wouldn't go out sniping kittens over it.

Even if later reviews brought it up weeks later, the initial... rejection?... would have been enough to significantly alter my opinion.

The cost/benefit analysis for continuing to write would have showed me in the red for long enough to call it a wash and chuck it. And if I loved writing and dreamed of being a writer (which I do and do), then that negative would be an even bigger injury.

** Yes and no.

I think rat-readers are more /outspoken/ readers. The normal readers read and then move on with their lives. Rat-readers are more likely to engage with the story and other readers. Among that demographic, it's always going to be outweighed by the people who have a bone to pick vs the ones who don't.

So yes, you're going to get more negative reviews. I posted my story up, and the first few comments were negative. While that sucks to read, it's not the end of the world either. Some of it was useful feedback, and I implemented it happily because I saw value in that.

On the other hand, my fic gained a steady 20-30 readers whereas on Royal Road, the type of story I had written would not have gained any traction on recently updated (The demographics on recently updated *heavily* favor cultivation, gamelit, or isekai.)

Currently my fic is now #5 on trending. I don't think it would have eeked out into the #50 at all unless I had posted it up on reddit. I'll post hard data to back up my claim: [[https://i.imgur.com/paf2oEo.png]]

It wasn't a huge boost - (trending overshadows everything) but it was significant enough to overcome the disadvantages I started with - namely being a complete unknown with 0 previous following, and writing the wrong genre.

Once it hit #50 on trending, now my fic was visible to others who would have actually liked to read it. At that point, it was all up to how good the fic actually was to stay up there. But I don't think I would have eeked onto there without that post on reddit.

*** Hello!

A few things to say about this:

First, you're clearly right, at least in part. The pitfall I've come across isn't rationalism, however. I'm not reading criticisms about rationality so much as style. There's what I'd call an ambivalence in this community. Some redditors will enjoy a recommendation, while others will not. It's /rare/ for a new work with the quality of HPMoR. If we only recommend high-grade gems of pure rationality, this place will be a lot less interesting.

Second, how does one come to understand the tastes of this place without dumpster fires being started for the authors they enjoy? I'll agree with your solution, but I'd add the caveat that nobody should feel confident enough to recommend anything here that is present on RR or other sites where ratings can significantly impact an author's readership. The risk vs payoff for the author simply isn't there.

Finally, I note this topic has already scored at least one down-vote. I expect more to come. It strikes me as being entirely ironic that voting be used in this manner, rather than discussion as [[/u/catern/]] has chosen to do. The same downvoting absolutely illustrates the problem I'm posting about.

Lurk before posting, read all of the things which get highly upvoted, go back through 'Top' of 'Submissions' with 'All Time' selected. If you're not part of this community, I don't think you should be posting here. Dumpster fires are entirely unnecessary and I would hazard unwelcome.

*Edit:*

Based upon other comments, notably [[/u/RMcD94]]'s below, I think that a lot of us pushing back are on the same page about an influx of works getting top-level posts to [[/r/rational]] recently, perhaps partly as pandemic-era time and stimulus has seen a large expansion webserials and donations made to them, coinciding with [[/r/rational]]'s continued growth. But it looks like at least some of what is motivating [[/u/Brell4Evar]] may be in the general recommendation threads rather than front-page posts, and those certainly are held to a different standard for more than one reason.

***** I agree with your understanding in the edit. Almost anything goes in the recommendation thread while the front page should be limited to those works that align more closely with the definitions in the sidebar, as difficult and subjective that may be

I don't see much harm in author's being aware that sharing their work whether on the subreddit or in the recommendation thread exposes them to a group that is willing to critique works but I also think that it'd be quite difficult to implement some sort of warning

****** Considering that the community hardly agrees with the definition then the only way to get a feel for what rational is, is by the consensus of consumption which requires at least passive participation on the subreddit.

I'm not seeing much benefit to author's posting here just cause they saw the subreddit name and realised it was a place to harvest readers and advertise.

If it's good members of this community will share it, either posting it if they're confident in its rationality or in the recommendation thread which no one expects to be full of rational gemstones and yet is still the most active thread on this subreddit

** There are many more people reading this subreddit than making recs in it, and it's the former, not the latter, who are responsible for the effect.

IMO the proper takeaway is: if you don't think a rec belongs here, downvote the post with rec - not the fiction itself. Don't downvote fiction recommended here just because you don't think it should have been recommended here (assuming the author didn't explicitly write it for this community). Web fiction has a wider audience than this community and it's unfair to judge it on narrow criteria. If the writing isn't deliberately aimed at us, that's knowledge useful to us, not to the general public; it's churlish to publically punish the author for not doing our particular thing. Perhaps something to this effect could be stated in the side bar?

If it's generally terrible then fair play, of course, but that sort of thing doesn't tend to get recommended here in the first place, by and large.

If we can't convice the readers to take greater care with downvotes, of course, then I agree with OP - we do need to take much more thought when making recs to avoid punishing unsuspecting authors for no reason. But fewer recs would be a sad thing for me to see - I've come away with many a fun read from here of things that were not, strictly, rational; the community's tastes tend to align along more parameters than that.

Checking your post history, your last recommendation was pretty blank. Not even a mention that stories are young and short at the time of posting.

My advice is to identify and mention major flaws/sacrifices that author allowed. Writing something that helps readers to check if they are in the target audience is good as well. In other words, filter people with negative reviews early.

** Regardless of all else, the two things I'd emphasize are qualifying your recs and being aware of risks.

If you're going to make a rec here it should be qualified. You should be able to say "so, this story focused on X and Y, if you don't like those things, you probably won't enjoy it" or "I admit this story has weaknesses in its writing, like A and B, but if you look past those I think you'll enjoy it." Basically, if you want to make a "good" rec here, you should be objective enough to moderate people's expectations. If you make a rec without any qualifiers I will immediately assume you think it doesn't /need/ any qualifiers, and if it's not good enough for that to be true, I will be disappointed.

As other people have said, I think each author can make the cost/benefit analysis for themselves. Yes, if you post a rec here, you will attract some degree of negative attention, which may very well outweigh the positive attention. But different people will feel differently about how much of a risk that is, or how worth it it is. So I wouldn't make a general de-rec of posting recs here, I'd just say "be informed about what you're doing."

Basically, inform people and be informed yourself. Easy.

I don't write my fiction to be rational in the way this subreddit enjoys, so whenever my work was recommended here, my ratings took a dive. A lot of my writer friends experienced the same---many of whom are the cream of the crop when it comes to producing free fiction for the internet.

*** So, here's my weird answer.

I'm actually not raging about people who pop over to RR and provide low stars or negative reviews. I considered and discarded that idea when I wrote the original post, above.

What I was searching for was a way forward to sharing what we enjoy without encountering a scenario I've seen happen more than a few times, now.

Let's look at the following:

- An author creates a harem fantasy piece - a werewolf litRPG that somehow ends up tone deaf on Judaism, gender, abledness, and race. Still, RR readers enjoy the cover art and the combat sequences, and it scores a solid 3.9.
- A separate author writes something some people here would enjoy, but a handful of unspecified others would *hate*. It has some good reviews and a starting rating of 4.5.

I think it's reasonable to expect a storm of negative reviews and downvotes for the second example, while the first probably wouldn't see the light of day here - and thus avoid the righteous wrath of every single reader here.

When I originally posted, I didn't see a way to avoid wrecking the poor person writing that second story. I still won't condemn someone for writing a bad review. That's just me whining about someone else doing something they think is right.

At the same time, I recognize that I could have prevented an author whose work I enjoy from getting a metaphorical gut punch. I think it's a good talk to have. I can see a win both for those who enjoy some works as well as those who don't - if we're a bit more careful.

Authors who use Royal Road like you do change that dynamic into one in which the readers are providing unpaid editorial services in exchange for a book that is likely to disappear behind a paywall half way through reading it.

It is annoying enough that this exact sort of let-down has made me cut down on the number of Royal Road stories that I read, comment and recommend to people and if it ever gets to the point where more than one story in ten is based on this sort of dynamic, I'd probably just stop bothering with Royal Road entirely. Very plausibly, you do not give a shit about any of that. After all, your current method gets you what you want as an author, and there's nothing in the rules (on Royal Road or otherwise) saying that you can't. I'm not going to try to shame you for doing what makes you money.

But on the off chance that you care about Royal Road continuing to attract people interested in its stated premise as a website or about not alienating potential readers who (like me) get refuse to read anything by authors who use your current business model, please consider this one point of evidence in favour of there being externalities that you might not have been aware of. Also please consider making it clear up front that the story might be vanishing due to Kindle agreements instead of (like certain authors I could name) swearing up and down that you'd never do that and then taking the check from Amazon and doing it regardless.

***** Thanks for your feedback. As I mentioned, im using a site LIKE RR not RR itself (due to writing in my mother's tongue not English). Of the 5 novellas I managed to pitch this way, all had a countdown up front (X days until it goes off-site!) So that the readers would know id advance that the story might disappear, and why. Second, I only ever posted finished stories all at once, not in instalments or chapters, so my readers could read the whole thing in one sitting, and if they liked it, maybe buy it at a later date.

Other than that, I fully agree with what you wrote. Authors should always be transparent with their intent, and most importantly, should not post stories in chunks - which I think is a cancer that damages both the author-reader relationship (the dreaded hiatus!) and the quality of writing (spaghettification of the plot).

****** I'm very glad to see that there are authors who have already thought through these concerns and are doing what they can to be transparent about their plans. This is exactly the sort of thing I'd like more authors to do.

***** As an amateur author on RR, I feel like I should respond to this with a logical and reasonable answer that might induce you rethink your position.

Something like using myself as an example and saying how I am more than happy to leave my story up on royal road for readers to keep reading if the number of patrons I got through patreon were sufficient to support that. How my story has only gathered little more than 100 patrons at $3/month even though it held the top of trending for a week.

That the temptation of moving it to kindle unlimited wasn't truly a consideration until I realized just how much I wanted to be a full time author and that the patreon to rr business model has limitations on how successful it can be. Limitations that appear to be applying to me because my story hasn't yet reached the 1000th chapter mark.

But I won't do that, that'd just be silly.

****** I was just debating to debate, because it seemed like a fun argument to make, btw. I hoped that came across, as when I reread it, I could see it being taken under a different tone.

Edit to add: Which isn't to say there wasn't a good bit of honesty I included above. There definitely is. The amount of money I've made via the Royal Road to Patreon model is enough to maybe--maybe--pay my water bill. Not nearly sufficient to become a full-time writer.

What that means for readers following my work is that, for those writers like me, the only way for me to continue to provide the story they're enjoying would be to make the switch at some point in the future.

It's unfortunate, as I would love to continue to write as you described above.

****** My objection isn't to Kindle itself, or even necessarily to the business model where a story draft is temporarily made public and then removed once the finished version goes up on Kindle. That's basically fine, and if people want to engage with fiction on those terms, more power to them. I'll even read a story like that on occasion, if it's from an author that I trust to handle the switch well.

My objection is instead to a growing group of authors who, having realized that the Royal Road -> Kindle pipeline business model is unpopular with certain readers, decide to mislead their readers into thinking that the story is being Patreon-funded and will stay up indefinitely in order to get the people who would not willingly read the story on those terms to read it regardless, hoping that the desire to hear the ending will bait their hoodwinked readers into buying the book on Kindle.This includes one case that I'm familiar with where the author /actively lied/, swearing up and down that the story was going to stay up forever, only to release the Kindle version and delete everything but an advertising stub within the week.

My ire is especially reserved for the small handful of authors who double dip like this, starting up a new Patreon account and a new Royal Road account, start charging for advance chapters and then looks for the maximally cliffhanger-y chapter on which to replace their story with a link to their Amazon page after revealing that they're actually a well known Kindle author who has done this several times before. Often while continuing to charge monthly payments on Patreon, if the reader doesn't manually unsubscribe. It's incredibly infuriating and is the main driver of my unwillingness to engage with stories by authors who monetize their stories via Kindle. At this point, my default assumption is that they're probably a scammer pseudonym.

I make a few exceptions for authors like, eg. Sarah Lin who always make it a point to announce the plan in chapter one of their book and to give a month long period during which current readers can finish the story before taking down. That's the golden standard, since it makes it clear from the outset what the reader is getting themselves into. Someone who wants to monetize via Kindle, or who wants to switch from Patreon to Kindle and who does something along those lines (announce the plan as soon as practical and give a long enough period relative to the story length for current readers to finish) is fine by me. It generally isn't enough to get me to /read/ their story (after all, a scam artist can make the same claims), but if they do as they promised once and then start up a second story on the same terms, I might consider reading their second instead of rejecting it outright as a probably scam.

******* Ah, yeah, well, actively lying as a business model does strike me as a bit blatantly opportunistic and morally/ethically questionable.

I hadn't made claims either way, and wouldn't consider such a course of action.

I can also see why it would make you incredibly angry to be victim of a bait-n-switch. Seems like that you're anger is justified towards that individual or set of individuals. I know I would be cursing mad.

I just don't want to be unintentionally included in that group if I'm forced to make the switch. Which it's looking more and more likely I will be at some point.

I'm reasonably sure that the majority of authors on royal road are more likely to be a similar set of circumstances to me than the one you described.
