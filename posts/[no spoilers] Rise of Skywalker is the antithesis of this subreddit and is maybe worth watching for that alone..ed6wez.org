** I've approved this post, since there's obviously a demand for it and the thread had a lot of discussion by the time I got here, but this subreddit is not the place to come dunk on the current installment of some franchise that's not making an attempt at being "rational fiction", and if you want to talk about such things, we have a number of threads you can do it in, such as the Friday Open Thread or the Wednesday Writing/Worldbuilding Thread. /If you are going to make a thread/, one with more interesting content would be appreciated, and spoiler-scoping it to the film in question would be way better than spoiler-scoping such that everything for the current film needs spoiler tags (which the mods then have to police). Better, you could write your own short treatment of the sequel trilogy that addresses or discusses all the things that you found to go against the concept of rational fiction.

*** Just for the record, I am working on a short treatment and perhaps should have waited, but I think I am (understandably, but unfairly) misunderstood---

I'm not claiming "lol this is bad" with generically intense words. I am in fact /actually/ making the claim that this movie /in particular/ is the /antithesis/ of rational fiction, i.e. that it is the least-good fit for rational fiction that I have ever encountered, which is a rare claim to make, and at least potentially worth registering by itself.

**** I think that "On the nature of 'irrational' fiction (through the lens of the Star Wars sequel series)" would make for a good essay, especially if kept brief and to the point rather than delving into plot holes and minutia. Here, it's kind of left as an exercise for the reader, and I don't think any of the comments thus far have provided illumination on (or defense of) the thesis statement.

I haven't seen the final film yet, so I can't say whether it would be a better choice, but if I were going to write that kind of essay, my lens would be a work of allegory or magical realism where the object-level plot and character motivation is essentially non-existent or unimportant because the focus is entirely lifted from the object level, and the characters are meant by the artist to be understood as not being actual realistic (or even surrealistic) characters, but rather, as symbols for other concepts or tools for expression of an idea. /Mother!/ might be a good choice, or possibly /A Ghost Story/, to select recent films, though you'd probably want to pick a film that critics and audience members widely agree on as good, as much as is possible for that kind of film.

But I don't see how any of that makes it any more anti-rational than any other movie. What specifically is it about The Rise of Skywalker that makes it the exact opposite of rational fiction?

After having thought about this travesty of a movie literally at least once a day every day for the last two weeks, I've come around to what you're saying. I think you /could/ make the argument. I think I might purposefully go out of my way to attempt to go the rest of my natural-born life without watching the original sequel trilogy ever again. I legitimately hate it. I can't believe it's been allowed to exist.

The only reason I can think for why they pushed these movies out as quickly as they did with literally zero planning is so that they could simply establish the existence of a "sequel trilogy" as part of the original Star Wars saga. That way, when they start over in 2029 with the remake of Episode I (followed by remakes of II and III and IV and V and IV in 2031 and 2033 and 2037 and 2040 and 2043) they can continue on with remakes of VII and VIII and IX in the late '40s and early '50s without those future people thinking that it's weird for Disney to be making 9 remakes when there were only 6 originals.

Presumably they plan on so thoroughly rewriting the story of the prequel trilogy that they had to assume that the story of the OT will be altered enough that any sequel trilogy they made in the present would no longer fit, and rather than waste the creative energy coming up with a new story for the original sequel trilogy, they decided to just make all three of them soft remakes of the OT. I doubt the sequel trilogy remakes that come out in 30 years will have anything close to the same overarching plot as the original sequel trilogy (mostly because the original sequel trilogy doesn't have an overarching plot).

#+begin_quote
  Li Yao coughed slightly. Glancing at the two big shots of the government-in-exile next to him, he asked Cui Lingfeng secretly through the private talking technique, “Sir Speaker, what exactly is this ‘Dark Star that has been destroyed dozens of times?”

  Cui Lingfeng was sitting solemnly and wearing a grave expression, as if he had not heard Li Yao's question at all. His lips did not shiver at all, yet Li Yao somehow received his reply.

  “It is a series of movies that we shot intermittently over the past hundreds of years to boost morale. They tell the stories of how we defeated the Imperium of True Human Beings. The official title is ‘Universal War'!

  “In the movies, the evil Imperium of True Human Beings, in order to reign over the entire universe, built the strongest, evilest, and most horrible man-made planet, known as the ‘Dark Star', with all the crucial resources in the Sectors under their control. They then moved all the important government agencies, key technical personnel, and files about the valuable techniques onto the planet.

  “Eventually, Firefly took the enemy unprepared by marching into the ‘Dark Star'. The ‘brain' and ‘heart' of the Imperium of True Human Beings was destroyed immediately, and the Imperium was defeated just like that!”

  “... Fine. Although the Imperium of True Human Beings can't be that stupid, it is all understandable since it is just a movie. Then what does he mean by ‘destroyed dozens of times'?”

  “The movie was very popular after it was aired,” Cui Lingfeng said. “Soon, it was a hit on the entire Firefly and won countless enthusiastic supporters. Naturally, a sequel was shot. In the sequel, the Imperium of True Human Beings got even more ruthless and rose again. They came up with an even more evil approach to cope with the whole universe and the Star Ocean Republic!”

  “What's the approach?”

  “To build a bigger, stronger, and more terrifying ‘Dark Star II' by continuing to concentrate all the resources!”

  “Then what? The Dark Star II did not happen to be sabotaged by Firefly again after you crawled inside it, right?”

  “Yes, it was,” Cui Lingfeng replied matter-of-factly.

  “Then,” Li Yao said, “you shot dozens of sequels of ‘Universal War', and a greater ‘Dark Star' was built in each and every one of them, only to be crawled into and destroyed by Firefly in the end?”

  “You're wrong,” Cui Lingfeng countered. “Later, the Imperium of True Human Beings stopped constructing man-made planets but simply went to hollow out an existent planet and modify it into a more powerful Dark Star. After the audience grew tired of planets, we also tried white dwarves, red giants, and suns in their prime years.”

  “... Sir Speaker, I suddenly understand the anger and embarrassment that Chief Mate Ding must've had after he saw through the lies. What should I do?”

  “What choice did we have?” Cui Lingfeng asked. “If the Imperium had adopted a less stupid strategy, how could a tiny Firefly have reversed the situation on its way and secured a glorious victory in the end?”

There is so many sins committed in this franchise, you don't even need to get to the not rational part.

I mean, there is no consistency or coherence. I'll take merely three examples that for me are worth a million sinful details :

1/ If you are Han Solo, you can apparently time going out of hyperspace to land between a planetary shield and the ground. Using your reflexes. At a speed greater than light. Seriously.

2/ If you have a big starship threatening you, you can turn around and suicide hyperspace your starship into it. One wonder then why :

2.1/ One doesn't use one of the expendable, mass produced and barely sentient droids to perform the suicide mission

2.2/ One make convoluted plans to destroy a death star, losing scores of pilots in the process

2.3/ One builds a BIG DEATH STAR in the first place when any big and expensive ship becomes a liability.

3/ People doubt the Force exists, even if it played a major role in galactic history, that it is physically observable in blood (midisomething) and can be demonstrated with a simple telekinetic trick.

That's why Star Wars (and especially the lasts movies) can't ever even reach the rational level of fiction.

1/ Not respecting basic / consistent rules of a universe

2/ Not respecting precedents set by previous movies

3/ Not having minimally intelligent protagonist we can empathize with

Maybe I'm more harsh because star wars is popular and some better constructed and deserving science-fictions are not.

I think this makes sense. Jedi are and have always been absurdly rare. Before Order 66, there were 10,000 in a galaxy with a population of 100 quadrillion. When there's so few, it's easier to just assume the well-documented cases are hoaxes. They could have been using hidden repulsors. And even assuming they do establish some people are telekinetic, that doesn't imply any more mystical importance than a repulsor has.

In the first trilogy, well most were previously killed by a targeted offensive of the dark side. Fair enough.

In the prequel, we learn that finding people with a strong aptitude must be done early, in order to stir them away from the dark side and train them. Fair enough.

In the last trilogy, we have yet another spontaneous force user, who gets no training and still manage to beat trained jedi. Ahem. I mean if people with strong force aptitude can manage miracles without training, wouldn't jedi be more frequent?

And here I'm only talking about internal consistency. Let's not get started on how an aptitude that is obviously genetically conditioned and gives you super powers should evolutionary be selected for and become the norm in a few 100ish generations.

***** the (now no longer canon) extended universe actually goes into a lot of this. everything below is drawn from extended universe sources.

part of it is that the jedi rely on propaganda and that their fear of the darkside is a little overblown sometimes. there are a bunch of different force traditions scattered throughout the galaxy that are more neutral. the jedi are simply the most public and evangelical of force traditions.

there isn't actually any sort of precedent for our mary sue protagonist being able to use force mind powers without training... so that one is just terrible writing. the lightsaber combat mastery could conceivably be justified because lightsaber martial arts are written into a sort of jedi akashic record, just floating out there for force users to telepathically stumble onto. I assume (charitably) this is what they were going for when rey switches to a more aggressive stance when she was training in the second movie. if only this scene had happened before the end of the first movie, it might have made a reasonable amount of sense. this phenomenon also accounts for darth vader. he was the most deadly lightsaber duelist in a thousand years primarily because of his strong force connection, not his dedication and practice (though that helps as well).

regarding genetics and clones - secret programs of this sort to create super assassins from force users do exist, but are generally not scalable as the clones themselves are either mentally or physically unstable (clones of unusually powerful force users at least) or difficult to control (all your minions have their own super powers...) so they tend not to go anywhere. also, in the common races the genetically linked super powers only show up on their own around adulthood (individual is already at or past reproductive age) and even if you have the trait the powers show up very rarely and weakly in the untrained, thus survival of the fittest will in almost all cases fail to take this trait into account. there are some races that use the force for everyday things, and in these races they have basically 100% chance to be a force user. there is actually an empire that existed in prehistory that was like this, and a gradually increasing number of individuals being born without force sensitivity eventually led to a total collapse.

EDIT: also I haven't seen the 3rd new movie, so I am not in a position to make any sort of comment on anything that happens there.

if you do pick up some books, try "legacy of the force" and "fate of the jedi". both are nine book series which follow directly from the movies, both very good. if you want something shorter, you could check out crosscurrent and riptide: two books that follow jaden korr. he's the protagonist of the jedi academy game, a jedi who can make use of some dark side powers and not fall completely. it's a good example of how the extended universe can take something random, in this case the fact that the game lets you choose whatever powers you want because it is more fun that way, and make it into the basis for a good story.

******* from a purely genetic standpoint, why would the trait show up if a species lacks the machinery to make use of it? if an animal species lacks whatever mindset is necessary to make use of the force, then any random mutation which causes an individual to become force sensitive would not produce any reproductive advantage, likely causing the gene to not spread far if at all. the fact that force sensitivity tends to provide functionally no benefit on its own is reason enough that evolution fails to seed it everywhere.

while it is true that the force appears sentient some of the time, this is most likely an impression left by force users from traditions which expect the force to be sentient. there are a number of traditions that use the force as they would any other tool (or in some cases, an extension of their body), and I can't think of any instances in any of the books where that has backfired on them.

that said, there are also non-biological species which are force sensitive. two crystal species which I know of, which exist independent of traditional genetics. there are also machines built by a specific ancient empire which interact with the force and require it in order to operate, so the ultimate answer (if we throw out author fiat) is most likely that the force has a bunch of entry points, and that at least some of them are genetically linked, and that some of those gene variants confer enough of an advantage to make the force ubiquitous in a species, and some variants do not.

Yes, that's why it's not considered biological in origin in legends. The cause of the force is something outside of what could be explained with biology, so there's no reason to think there's a causal relationship there. It could be some mystical factor that passes down to children epigenetically, to explain why it acts like a gene within families but doesn't have a biological cause or acts like a gene in the long term. Legends has a lot of "life energy" garbage, so that could be a mechanism- off the top of my head the whole Ssi-Ruu thing makes 'life-energy' pretty explicitly canon- and if a specific type of that energy conveys higher force sensitivity, and unlike normal genes isn't passed down in an all-or-one way but gets diluted, then species would actually trend towards uniform mediocre force sensitivity over time barring random generation of that new 'life energy'.

oh, the mention of non-biological entities accessing the force wasn't connected to any sort of idea about biological origins of the force itself. my head-canon is that the force is some sort of energy field that is both untethered from space and from the flow of time (enabling access to visions of distant places, the past, and possible futures without requiring computation) and mutable/impressionable (enabling seeming intelligent action from traditions which have primed it to act that way). I've always thought of force sensitivity as a holistic evaluation of the total state of an organism with many factors to determine strength, rather than something specific that you have or don't have. honestly, you are probably dead on with the force having some sort of mystical tag that has its own inheritance method, though I am not convinced that your suggested means of transmission fits everything that can be observed in the extended universe.

if an animal needs force sensitivity to hunt effectively, such as is the case with vornskr, then that selection pressure will cause a population to gain the trait. after this, there now exists a selection pressure which will favor populations which are able to make greater use of the already existing trait, causing the animal to exhibit greater control and range of force abilities. it could conceivably work the other way - a population of animals which, for some reason, are better able to survive by having some sort of meditative mindset (or whatever it is that allows a force user to become better). maybe something like bears, with their hibernation, I don't know. this hypothetical population would then benefit from force sensitivity appearing, because then every individual in the population would be primed to make use of it, creating utility for those who gain force sensitivity and thus creating a selection pressure.

but again, without either trait already existing in a population for external reasons, there is no selection pressure to gain either of them.

Traits appear at random, their propagation through a population is determined by fitness and random chance. There is absolutely no connection between how useful a trait is and how likely it is to appear, only how likely it is to spread. The smaller a population the more significant the effect of genetic drift is on how prevalent a trait is.

Some creatures could have gone through a bottleneck where force sensitive ones happened to be the majority that survived, then evolved the ability to take advantage of that later on (unless force sensitivity is selected for or against the proportion of force sensitive individuals in a large population will stay the same; Hardy-Weinberg Principle). Once that happens once the descendants of those creatures would fill out almost every niche in the ecosystem due to having an incredible advantage.

Regular evolution also doesn't explain how sentient creatures almost universally have force sensitivity but only animals from some ecosystems do. If it's the case that only a few ecosystems had force sensitivity appear then only a few sentient species should have force sensitivity. If it's the case that it appears in all ecosystems it should be almost ubiquitous by now.

************* it is possible for enclaves of force sensitive creatures to appear, which could explain a few of the force sensitive creatures that don't appear to have a good reason to be. but again, this still relies on extremely small chance of that specific mutation appearing. I'm not saying that there is zero chance that it could happen, I am saying that it is sensible to look at a universe where it doesn't always happen everywhere to every animal population.

to explain why sentients tend to always have the potential, I assume that whatever mindset that would allow someone to eventually learn to use the force is already present. this could easily be accounted for by simply having a more complex thinking apparatus capable of many different modes of thought. what keeps sentients from ALL being force sensitive is the tendency for an untrained force user to only develop significant control over his powers long after puberty, thus avoiding any selection pressure. for the traditions of trained force users, who can wield powers much sooner, there is a tendency toward celibacy for whatever reason. the one counterexample I can think of helps to make my point - the lost tribe of the sith. an entire planet of force sensitives who train their young as much as possible. they have seen the trait spread to the entire population due to the vast utility it provides, but only because they are already primed to use it, and because they train it up early enough to impact selection.

That counterexample doesn't uniquely support your idea. The ship that crashed was already full of force sensitives. It just implies force sensitivity can be passed down through families, which we already know.

I don't think this is a satisfactory explanation for how the force appears. There's nothing to uniquely support it and it can't explain both the rarity of the force and the ability of non-sentients to occasionally use it, other than by relying on some abstract "mindset" that can't even be defined, much less identified.

I always read /Star Wars/ as following conventional Xianxia rules (even though those hadn't nearly been established when the first ones came out): there's /qi/---some sort of dark matter---out there in the world; it's a scarce resource; you [or your midichlorians, I guess] have to absorb it into your body (i.e. /cultivate/) to get more powerful.

It seems like, in the /Star Wars/ universe, there's so little /qi/ out in the universe that just a few cultivators can soak up the entire universe's supply, leaving none for anyone else.

(This also creates an actual /inverse ninja rule/ in the /Star Wars/ universe: if you create 50 clone soldiers made to all be cultivators, they have to split the already-tiny amount of environmental /qi/ between them, resulting in each being 1/50th as force-attuned as your average cultivator.)

Maybe /Star Wars/ is set in some sort of post-apocalyptic setting where /qi/ used to be abundant-enough for the progenitor of humans and other alien species to evolve the capability to manipulate it; but something happened and now it's mostly gone.

??? Xianxia is an old genre. The first modern xix novel was written in the 30s and the related traits that Star Wars used were extremely well known from martial arts movies - chi as the force, the ancient master. "Xian" just means Taoism. This is the whole point of Pai Mei in Kill Bill: the immortal master character is shot in a 60s/70s way because he's a character from the films of that era.

It's a bit like how some stories can be redefined from being sci-fi to fantasy, or vice-versa, as we better understand physics. "Speculative fiction" like Verne's /A Journey to the Centre of the Earth/ is now considered fantasy.

In both cases, you could probably argue for there being a need for a "middle word" that we don't currently have. A word between /wuxia/ and /xianxia/ to describe "stories that assume Taoist mysticism is literally true, but which try to be realistic /given/ those assumptions"; or a word between /speculative fiction/ and /fantasy/ to describe "stories that make one change to the set of axioms that the world is built upon, and then rigorously constrain themselves to evaluating what would happen in such a world, with the arc of the plot entirely constrained by the world."

This is pure nonsense. Eg from Journey To The West:

/Once an immortal who was the Marshal of the Heavenly Canopy commanding 100,000 naval soldiers of the Milky Way, he drank too much during a celebration of the gods and attempted to harass the moon goddess Chang'e, resulting in his banishment to the mortal world. He was supposed to be reborn as a human but ended up in the womb of a sow due to an error on the Reincarnation Wheel, which turned him into a half-man, half-pig monster./

And the point is that *that all the mystical traits in Star Wars were already well-known from Shaw Brothers movies.* In fact, most of them had been imported into Western pulp fiction decades before. And 1970s California was full of people teaching silly martial arts based on chi.

It's also possible that Ardvarkeating is defining "Force sensitivity" as "has intuitions and gut feelings," which /in this universe/ often originate from the Force. This would be weird, as /in this universe,/ the term "Force sensitivity" is clearly and unambiguously used to indicate either people with explicit, deliberate control over some aspect of the Force, or people who are deeply and unusually influenced by it (e.g. people who have visions but can't telekinete or anything).

I *do* think it's dumb/wrong to use the term "Force sensitivity" to mean "alive" or "present in the Force;" that's why we have the phrases "alive" and "present in the Force." I've only ever seen the term "Force sensitivity" to mean "can detect things via a 'sixth sense'; can telekinete or predict the future or feel the disturbance of mass death and so forth."

As I noted elsewhere, saying "everyone is at least a little Force sensitive" when you just mean "everyone's alive or influenced by the Force" is a little like saying "everyone knows at least a little Jiujitsu" when you just mean "well, everyone knows how to grab somebody and rassle."

You said that the way you use force sensitivity is to describe that magnitude of effects. People who do not, under your definition, count as force sensitive are capable of using the force- they are sensitive to it. It seems that force sensitivity exists on a sliding scale. You said Han has 0 force sensitivity, which is not possible outside of someone being cut off from the force unless you draw an arbitrary line for force sensitivity and call that 0 (implying that you can have negative force sensitivity and still be able to use the force, funnily enough).

If you mean [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ed6wez/no_spoilers_rise_of_skywalker_is_the_antithesis/fbtd70t/][this]], well A) just listing books without quoting specific lines is a completely unreasonable way to cite sources, and B) you weren't explicit but it seems like you were responding to the claim that pilots use force sensitivity to dodge automated defenses rather than the subject of 0 force sensitivity.

**** Don't take my ranting for a careful analysis, it is not! I actually liked the original trilogy and the prequel (maybe nostalgia, maybe I never expected much of star wars than a nice adventure in space). As others pointed out as well, the money and greed ruined any chance of making something palatable out of the sequel.

To rant a bit more about my second point. The entirety of the previous movie stands on the completely artificial deadline of the convoy of ships getting picked up one by one. At no point any of those condemned ship has the brilliant idea to make their sacrifice actually worth something for the others but turning around and attempting a face jump. It has to be the very last ship and the single most important character on board that does this. Not a single line to explain this EVEN IF IT WAS EASY! They could have said it is a very difficult jump and only the best pilot could reach its target. They could have said that it required a very large ship like the commanding one to do any damage. They could have said such a move is prohibited by Galactic Law of The Orange Bible and the commander took it on herself to go to hell for this.

ANYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER than that deafening silence.

The reskinned Empire is even lead by a mysterious old sith, with a powerful yet conflicted and angry sith general. It wouldn't be that hard to show that the First Order isn't a near exact replica of the Empire, like showing that they are merely a strong power in the local region but they no longer are dominant on a galactic scale, but nope.

Which means a suicidal dash into the opposing fleet's full firepower.

****** In my opinion, what TLJ does isn't trope deconstruction. For example even "A new hope" has a few trope deconstructions. Farm boy goes on an adventure to rescue the princess, but turns out the princess doesn't need rescuing and is better at fighting her way out compared to the farm boy main hero.So the deconstructed trope is some kind of logical conclusion: Leia is the leader of a rebellion, of course she is a better shot than the boy that grew up on a farm!Or in (earlier seasons of) Games of Thrones: The trope is that the hero always survives. But the logical conclusion is that he gets killed because he is handicapped by e.g. honor and makes mistake after mistake (which he usually would get away with narrowly).

TLJ doesn't do that. It just randomly turns the trope on its head. While the idea might be good, the execution is completely lacking. If you want to subvert the "Military Maverick" trope show that the general is competent (including communication with subordinates), that the general has a plan, and then let the ace pilot be a subordinate. If the ace pilot then doesn't follow orders the logical conclusion is that it will be some kind of disaster. "Military Maverick" will at the end be some kind of asshole/idiot or even self-centered villain, but that is the price you pay.

That's another issue. The price. If you deconstruct your main villain and you don't have some kind of backup villain you have ... no villain (and the guy after you has to somehow add a new one?). James Bond gets hit by a random bullet from a random mook, it's a cool cinema moment, it is a logical conclusion of being fired at a lot, but there'll be a lot of problems finishing that movie and the next movie in the franchise will have some explaining to do (cloning?). So it is a positive surprise if someone subverts a trope, pays the storytelling price for that while still telling a coherent story.

You mean Poe's attack on Dreadnought or maybe Finn and Rose attempting to destroy the hyperspace tracker? Because the former turned out to be the single best tactical decision in the entire movie, while the latter was simply poorly executed (e.g. landing on a private beach instead of hiding the vessel in the forest nearby, bringing a shady dude on a very important mission, etc.).

The problems experienced by the characters generally didn't lie in bold maneuvers or risky dramatic things, but in the fact that almost everyone was given an idiot ball in order to push the plot forward.

***** What I remember about the attack on the big ship at the beginning was that Poe felt vindicated because they succeeded in taking it down, but the film went out of its way to acknowledge that the good guys lost a substantial chunk of their limited forces in the process and that continuing to pull high-risk high-reward maneuvers like that presented a real risk of dooming them by attrition. I liked that; it grounded the story. As for the hyperspace tracker, I don't remember the exact details; I recall it being set up as one of those things where the good guys are going to have to eat some kind of loss or concession to prevent an even worse outcome, but the main characters are morally outraged by the idea of accepting that loss and instead gamble on an approach that's riskier but has the slim possibility of delivering a complete win. When I see that kind of setup in an action movie, I know with the certainty of natural law that it's going to be touch-and-go for a while, but ultimately the heroes will thread the needle on that one-in-a-million chance and prove they were right not to take the initial L. Except this time it not only didn't work, it also screwed up a different plan and resulted in a lot of unnecessary deaths.

It's not as important, in my mind, whether they failed purely because they made tactical mistakes or whether it was truly impossible for them to have succeeded. The point is that they took a big risk that, in just about any other action movie, would have paid off no matter how much the universe had to twist itself in knots to make that happen--and for once, it /didn't./ There were shades of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] in that the choices that felt noble or brave or righteous weren't always the consequentially best choices.

(It reminded me a bit of those thought experiments where you imagine a population threatened by a plague and have to decide between a treatment that will definitely save only X% of them, or a treatment with a Y% chance of saving everyone and a 100-Y% chance that everyone dies. In most movie universes you can pretty much assume that Y = 100% no matter how low the characters say it is.)

****** I can see your point with Poe, however I still disagree. Results-wise his decision was proven right, when the Resistance was forced to fight on Crait. After all Dreadnaught could just glass their outpost like it glassed the previous one. Moreover, while the losses in people could be considered a blow to the Resistance, later events made it basically irrelevant by killing off almost all of remaining ones. So even if they didn't die against Dreadnaught, they would still die soon after. As for the losses in ships, they weren't really that significant, since the bombers they've used were basically flying coffins. Sending then against anything other than unarmed, helpless targets was basically a death warrant on the pilots.

As for Finn and Rose the problem was not the risky decision, but the fact that due to utter incompetence and a streak of irrational decisions they basically forced their hand. Have they acted thoughtfully, the setbacks would've likely never happen. In the end the reason why it didn't work wasn't that they took a gamble, but that they brought the failure on themselves through acting like idiots.

So I would say that it's not the righteous choices themselves that were bad, but rather their execution. Also the movie was basically an antithesis of [[/r/rational]], since the plot moves forward by making most of the cast act irrationally.

If Poe hadn't ordered the bombing run, the movie would have been over in 10 minutes. The only reason the entire rest of the film could happen, is because of Poe's "mistake".

I was primed by dozens of other movies to assume that the success of Macguffinquest was a foregone conclusion, no matter what specific things happened on the way. And then that...didn't happen. Their fuckups were actual fuckups that actually mattered. The gamble was an actual gamble that was never guaranteed to pay off.

I certainly wouldn't claim that TLJ was a rational or rationalist movie on the whole. Only that there were echoes of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] in the film treating risks as /actual risks/ instead of just lip service to raise tension, and in how it rejected the idea that it's always right to do the Gryffindor thing at any risk or cost. (See: Poe ordering the retreat near the end instead of committing to a badass but doomed offensive, and this being portrayed as a wise move rather than a weak or cowardly one.)

(Unlike television producers, who at least /know of/ the job-role of "creative director", if only as "that asshole from franchise corporate who's breathing down our necks about portraying the toys correctly as characters.")

The "way movies get done" 99% of the time in the big Hollywood studios, is that a producer will /buy/ a screenplay from a Writer's Guild screenwriter on the open market; and then they'll set up a new production staff (director et al) to make that screenplay into a movie. The screenplay might get rewritten several times by the director, editor, etc. of the movie, but the seed of it always came from a screenwriter who was more-than-likely entirely unaffiliated with the production staff of any previous movie in the series thus-far.

And even movies that are adapted from novels go through this process: usually, some Writer's Guild screenwriter buys the rights to the novel, and then writes a screen adaptation, and then sells /that/ to a studio.

Even if this is not the way Disney makes their live-action movies (and I'm suspicious that it might still be), it's industry culture, in a way that makes long-term planning /not/ industry culture.

In fact, most remotely suitable novels aren't available to script writers because a studio has already optioned the rights. Another example is Amazon - not a scriptwriter - buying the rights to Iain Banks' Culture series. Or Gone With The Wind got made when Selznick International bought the rights, partnered with another production company, and hired multiple writers.

***** So like, I totally get all that, but it's still baffling to me for one small reason:

/Disney owns Marvel/.

They already /have/ a billion dollar franchise that has a license to print money /sustainably/ over /a decade/ and it's mostly thanks to starting momentum and careful planning, under the head of Kevin Feige.

Star Wars had more starting momentum than they could ever want. All they needed was to find someone who could act like Feige, possibly someone already from Lucasfilm or LucasArts or something, someone as familiar with the franchise as they could be without being George Lucas. They then have that person draft a series of phases, let them act as the last word on such trivial matters as "what is the movie about", and then let em rip.

(Actually, now that I think about it, if they could get George to do it initially, it would probably work great. He had already been doing something similar for years and years signing off on books, games, TV show plots and so on; keep him away from the script and away from the director's chair and he probably would have done fine.)

Instead they adopted the Marvel pattern of different directors without any oversight, and it fell apart.

****** Right, but that was my point, here: the culture in Hollywood is such that studios like Marvel (who plan for ongoing creative direction) or Pixar (who at least ensure continuity of direction in sequels, even if they weren't planned as part of an N-ology to begin with) are /accidents/. One studio might have institutional knowledge of the value of creative direction, but that doesn't mean that an acquirer like Disney will /inherit/ or /absorb/ that institutional knowledge from them. Usually the other way around, in fact.

The games industry is very similar, and I bring it up because there's a helpful central example of this effect in the games industry that a lot of people are aware of: EA. EA buy studios with creative vision, who clearly have often succeeded /because/ of their creative vision, and then learns nothing from them, and gradually destroys any element of creative vision in the absorbed studio.

I'm sure Disney is greedy, but I don't think Disney is more greedy than Disney. If they can refrain from letting greed ruin their IPs for the MCU, for Disney classics, as well as the live-action remakes (which are blatant money grabs, but done pretty well for the most parts), then why can't they do it for Star Wars.

There's no rule that says you can't make good movies if you're greedy. There's certainly no rule saying that greed forbids you from having a consistent plot.

If it had been purely greed, they would have made a series of boring, paint-by-numbers sequels that took no risks. Which is what they did with TFA, but not for the next two.

Is irrelevant. Those people aren't a large enough group to pay the way for big budget films. And often what they hate is what the larger market loves.

The sort of people willing to devour dozens of sub-standard SF novels because they're in a certain universe aren't a good guide to general public taste - thank God.

> The prequel movies are some of the worst fantasy films of all time,

Are the actually worse than the 3rd movie? The one where irritating teddy bears defeat an elite high tech military force? And the first is one of the most derivative films of all time. It staples together the servant characters from Hidden Fortress with a Lensman ripoff and ends with a clone of the finale of Dambusters. It's a kid's film that actually starts using a plot device that any adult would laugh it - one much more dubious than anything used in any of the other films people complain about. (The bad guys don't shoot at a lifepod because there are no life signs... In a universe full of freaking ROBOTS!) The second film was saved because they had one of the best screenwriters ever working on it - and she had a background in writing old style SF pulp fiction.

Fans might not be representative of the audience at large, but to me saying that fans are "stupid and inconsistent" only shows that you didn't pick up on the logic behind those things. Stories have a certain amount of credit when it comes to suspension of disbelief. You gain credit with some things, and spend it with others. If your objective isn't to be 100% rational it's fine to make something that's a bit weird or silly if it works, makes the movie more fun, or is balanced by something else. Most of the Ewoks' antics concern one specific battle that's interspersed with other two - a space battle and a lightsaber duel, both among the best of the franchise. Jar Jar is simply pointless, in a movie whose entire tone is more childish than any other that preceded it, and which is the entry point, not the end, for a trilogy, which means it's got to do more groundwork to get people to buy into its setting and conflict, as they're all brand new.

Fans might be selective in which things they complain about, but they're not reacting at random. I think you can make a movie that both fans and the general public enjoy, on average. Sure, you'll always have the occasional party pooper, but nothing can be enjoyable by literally everyone. Marvel movies however have a much better track record in this regard.

You're missing the point that the whole franchise is that stupid. The storm troopers are an elite force until they need to be incompetent, then they are. The freaking Imperials forget the existence of robots when they fail to shoot up the life pod. People in starships fight at closer ranges than pilots in WW2. Any idiot could easily defeat a Jedi using a shotgun. The Jedi are supposed to be wise and good but they fight using a slave army of unknown origins. Robots are easily available and the Republic has a massive population but they don't consider using droids, conscripts, or volunteers. And how the hell can one previously unknown planet produce enough clones to fight a galactic war? It's a children's movie franchise, based on the rule of cool. If you don't find Jar Jar cool but do enjoy pretend sword fights, then that's because you want the movie to pander to a 12 year old mentality rather than an 8 year old one. And really, that isn't any better - it's just a different demographic.

However, that does not mean that the amount of suspension of disbelief required to buy into it enough to find it entertaining rather than frustrating is constant. Basically, everyone tends to have a threshold of bullshit they're willing to entertain and forgive for the sake of something being cool and fun.

/I wouldn't say that fans sulked over Jar Jar either./

I remember the reaction to the film. And for that matter Simon Pegg based an entire episode of Spaced around the adult fans' hatred of Jar Jar...

And if you say that fans reacted to Jar Jar because they can't articulate their real problems with a movie, then what exactly is the point in listening to them???

Beam Piper's Fuzzies.

  Perry Rhodan is the eponymous hero of a German science fiction novel series which has been published each week since 8 September 1961 in the 'Romanhefte' format (digest-sized booklets, usually containing 66 pages, the German equivalent of the now-defunct American pulp magazine) by Pabel-Moewig Verlag, a subsidiary of Bauer Media Group. As of February 2019, 3000 booklet novels of the original series plus 850 spinoff novels of the sister series Atlan plus over 400 paperbacks and 200 hardcovers have been published, totalling over 300,000 pages. Having sold approximately two billion copies (in novella format) worldwide alone, (including over one billion in Germany), it is the most successful science fiction book series ever written. The first billion of worldwide sales was celebrated in 1986.[1]

Second, TTGL is mecha more than space opera, as the conflict is driven only by a handful of individuals in a cockpit, like the crew of a single ship (even though their mecha gets really big). Third, to mention Japanese space opera and not consider the most straightforward take of the genre, namely, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, just feels weird.

No, that's not a "strange thing to say" - you learn to need to read. The question was whether the winning side had an easy victory. No, the human population was whittled down to a million before the start of the main series, the co-protagonist dies, a lot (most?) of Team Gurren dies, Nia dies, the remaining million of the human race almost dies, the human race's apparent oppressor was actually it's greatest hero and trying to save it...

And the show's timeframe as a whole /does/ include the destruction of most of the human race - one the shorts is dedicated to it. Not that it even matters to the point at issue.

Not to anyone with adult tastes: LGH is unwatchable idiot fodder. It starts with an episode where the hero is lauded as a genius for doing the most obvious thing possible when the enemy does something a 12 year old with some experience of playing RTS games wouldn't do. It's more man baby fodder. In a show which pompously claims to be realistic. And I have no idea what happens in the franchise as a whole because every episode I tried to watch was that very, very bad. However, the fact that there are so many episodes indicates that neither side scored an easy victory, yes?

For anyone interested in why Legend is so bad: Side A outnumbers Side B - badly. They brilliantly decide to launch two separate attacks each of which would be outnumbered by B, who will see what is happening. Astoundingly, instead of cooperating by staying where they are, B counterattacks the two sub-fleets one at a time. This is presented as awe inspiring genius - what happens for the rest of 15,000 episodes is driven by the military reputation created by this. Yes, it really is possible to have a plot dumber than Star Trek WOK's "We'll defeat the enemy by moving in 3 dimensions, because a genetically engineered superman won't realise that's something you can do in space!"

Oh - and the version of the I saw show also has the most hilariously bad credits ever: a man and a woman in military uniform walking away dramatically through the stars... with hilariously wriggling asses, like they're twerking. Probably the only part worth watching - for about 15 seconds.

Wow. Seriously? I'm watching the currently airing remake, and sure, the military tactics are sometime somewhat naive. Also pretty two-dimensional because apparently the author is a Napoleonic wars geek, and drew inspiration from those. But the politics and the characters are definitely far more nuanced than in Star Wars.

And I love TTGL, don't get me wrong, and sure, as you say, the body count is immense if you consider basically everything that happened before the series proper begins. The series itself, however, and its mood, are mostly affected by the way the war the protagonists fight goes, which has relatively few casualties. But I just can't see it as space opera. It doesn't have the hallmarks of the genre. It's a super robot show, through and through, and has the tropes of that genre.

Which is better: pig swill or cow fodder? I have no urge to compare.

But from I know about LOGH, no, the politics are even stupider than the rest of the show:

[[https://medium.com/@ProjectRob/the-conservative-heart-of-legend-of-the-galactic-heroes-8d3d41d128fa]]

Gurren Lagann otoh is pretty smart about politics: Simon and most of the heroes are shown to be lousy at running the world after they save it. Rossiu is the one who keeps thing together and the other smart one is Yoko, who has no interest in politics, but saves Simon after his political fall and imprisonment.

Blake's 7, of course, is /the/ political SF show. A truly effective Machiavelian villain in Servalan - one whose plans actually are cunning, a "hero" in Blake who is equal parts hypocrite and idealist, who actually knows this about himself and distrusts himself with ultimate power - to the extent he'd rather murder millions of people than trust himself with. And a realist who knows that rationally the good guys are doomed, but that there is no point selling out to the Bad Guys "Because I wouldn't last a week."

And then there's Kill La Kill, which does the Lagrian dialectical thing with fascism. Which I suppose could just count as space opera, because there's certainly classical music, and the final battle takes place in space.

Going back to Lensman, the cannonical space opera, it's profoundly distrustful of democracy - but for very interesting reasons. It was written at a time when American democracy was extremely corrupt, with a lot of politicians beholden to corporate interests or criminals, and the author seems to have had some especially "interesting" experiences working as a scientist for a corrupt munitions company that knowingly shipped faulty artillery shells during WW2. (This was adapted into a story included in "First Lensman".)

Another weird but amusing thing about Lensman was that the author and his wife actually looked like a space opera hero and heroines and behaved with similar whackiness . From wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Robert Heinlein and Smith were friends. (Heinlein dedicated his 1958 novel Methuselah's Children "To Edward E. Smith, PhD".[68]) Heinlein reported that E. E. Smith perhaps took his "unrealistic" heroes from life, citing as an example the extreme competence of the hero of Spacehounds of IPC. He reported that E. E. Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of 'Kimball Kinnison' and 'Clarissa MacDougal'). In Heinlein's essay, he reports that he began to suspect Smith might be a sort of "superman" when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car. Smith tested the car by driving it on a back road at illegally high speeds with their heads pressed tightly against the roof columns to listen for chassis squeaks by bone conduction---a process apparently improvised on the spot.
#+end_quote

"Spacehounds" and some of his other works are here -

[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/9515]]

But "Galactic Patrol" and "Grey Lensman" are much better, in an ultra-pulp way, and cheap on kindle. Smith also made major contributions to human happiness as a chemist when he worked on donuts: I've heard that he may have been the man who perfected the coating process that led to Krispy Kremes. If so, he really should have been given the Nobel for something - just probably not literature.

******** Oh - and talking of politics, Blake's 7 was super-huge in the communist countries were it was shown, like Bulgaria. The depiction of a totalitarian regime and the tactics that it used, like framing political opponents for sex crimes or putting them in mental hospitals, and the presence of some good people in institutions belonging to the regime, trying to make the system work for the benefit of the people - who after all needed a government - was considered very realistic.

It's also got very nice plot arcing - basically the structure Joss Whedon copied for Buffy and Angel. There are continuing themes but you can watch virtually any episode out of order and skip those 10% of bad ones. (Although Harvest Of Kairos is so good-bad that you should watch it at least once: "You madam, are no lady!")

**** The thing is, Star Wars /doesn't/ have a rare setting. Lucas originally wanted to write /Flash Gordon,/ but he couldn't get the license, so he made his own mashup knock-off, combining elements of /Flash Gordon/, /Buck Rogers/, /Dune/, and /John Carter of Mars/. A lot of the success of /Star Wars/ was repackaging and synthesizing for a new era a lot of the old serials that Lucas had grown up with, and it's /highly/ derivative in a way that proves that being derivative doesn't matter so long as you execute well. Most of what was novel about /Star Wars/ was in the ground-breaking special effects and the way that it revived a genre that was close to dead.

First step of doing better is identifying what went wrong, but the second step of improving on it is out of reach to us, except in the occasional "let's make a new script" YouTube video. So here we are firing up those skills that let us pick apart the failure state, and hoping the act of doing so burns out the frustration that's settled in our bones.

The Thrawn trilogy and Hand of Thrawn duology, and the X-Wing novels, being head-and-shoulders above the rest (in my opinion).

*** I thought The Last Jedi was atrocious, but still (legit, not snarking, seriously) fascinating to watch because I simply could not fathom the creative choices made. It wasn't like The Phantom Menace--you can say trade disputes are awful dry for Star Wars, but some people might find them interesting (or more forgivable), and while Jar Jar was never remotely funny, you can see how somebody with a very weird sense of humor might think otherwise.

With TLJ, it was almost like an intercultural communication problem--like there was some missing subtext that would have made these strange behaviors comprehensible. Why does everything get ruined by the heroes getting a parking ticket? He went to some trouble to set that scene up, but it's such a stupid and meaningless way to fail. And why did he hype, then discard, the Plom-bloom guy? It feels like an enormous middle finger to the audience, that he was wasting our time. Why does Holdo refuse to let any of her subordinates know that she has a plan and they're not all going to die? Bits of dialogue, e.g. "you've gambled everything and lost," make no sense in context. Is it supposed to be exciting that the Resistance fleet spends eighteen hours awkwardly fleeing from the FO fleet, which is reduced to taking ineffectual potshots at its ass? It seems really un-exciting, plus it makes the villains seem less impressive. Why did he bother inventing a Dr. Seuss-looking alien so Luke could spend five seconds milking it?

That's just scratching the surface. And, most compelling of all: why did it receive such good reviews? Yes, it was subversive, but the subversions were less interesting than the thing subverted and didn't appear to mean anything. They added up to a story where characters said and did things for no clear reason. Almost nothing in the movie made any sense. I feel like there's some lesson in there, about American culture, or modern cinema, or something.
