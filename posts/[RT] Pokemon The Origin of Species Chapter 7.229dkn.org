** I like it!

Also, that is not how sleep deprivation works for me at all. I might be tired, but if something important happened, like the phone ringing, or some dick /stealing my hat/ I'd be halfway across the room in seconds before even noticing I was up. Five hours of sleep should allow you to at least function enough for breakfast, no? Do people seriously get like this when they don't have enough sleep?

*** Thanks!

For me it depends on what I did the day before :) If I was mostly sedentary, getting up when I didn't get enough sleep can be brute-forced. If I spent it physically active, it's much harder.

Anecdotal Evidence Alert: For me, five hours is the absolute minimum. I'm not a morning person in general, but I can't properly follow any conversation with only five hours of sleep. At least, not without caffeine.

  It takes Red a full two seconds to subtract eight from three to calculate how long he slept.

Don't you mean three from eight?

It might interest you to find out I'm running an RSS feed/proxy script for Fanfiction.net! [[http://feephome.no-ip.org/%7Efeep/rss_proxy.cgi?8096183][HPN20]], [[http://feephome.no-ip.org/%7Efeep/rss_proxy.cgi?9794740][Origin of Species]]. (Message me if it breaks for some reason!)

****** O_O

I have like a billion of these, and have started bujcoting ff.net half due to the lack of this (the other half being lack of kindle compatibility).

How do I make/find new ones?

******* Just go to [[http://feephome.no-ip.org/%7Efeep/rss_proxy.cgi][http://feephome.no-ip.org/~feep/rss_proxy.cgi]] and put in the URL of the FFN page (or you can change the number at the end; it's the FFN story id).

Disclaimer, I've had issues in the past where the script broke or failed to update; I think I've fixed all of them but I can't be sure.

That said, I'm happy you find it useful.

** Nice job, but Red doesn't sound like himself when he starts describing the optimism fallacy. Maybe you could work on that?

Also, I'm suspecting that Mitchell may have drugged Red, and that this is the start of the appearance of Team Rocket.

*** I'll take another look at it when I get the chance, thanks.

As for the drugging, normally I wouldn't shoot down fan theories, but in this case I'll make an exception to protect poor Mitch's honor: no such drugging occurred :)
