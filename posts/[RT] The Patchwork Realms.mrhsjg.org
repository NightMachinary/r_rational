** I can recommend this work if you're at all interested in lit rpgs/isekais but are frustrated at the extreme lack of quality writing or characterization. Athos is strong, but all he wants is to get home. He's a dog magicked into human levels of intelligence and it shows in his thought processes: he is hopelessly naive, loyal, caring, and protective. He's also rational, in that he knows what he wants and works to achieve it. Power is only useful if it can protect his people after all. All in all, Athos is a 5/7 doggo, and fuck Eugene.

** I'm linking to the top level on this because RoyalRoad will remember your reading progress and take you to the most recent chapter you read. Thus, there's no need to link to a specific chapter.

Summary for those who haven't read it:

Athos is a good dog. He likes frisbee, bacon, and his family (SmolFriend, Mom, and Dad). He's not so keen on falling through an interdimensional portal to a fantasy world where floating boxes tell you that you've just been given status as the 'Supreme Exemplar' of your species, a powerful package of abilities that includes human-level intelligence. Sure, being smart is nice but less so when it comes with the need to survive in a land made from bits of different dimensions stitched together like patches in a quilt. A thousand species, a thousand lands, sorcery and super science rubbing elbows, wars and intrigue everywhere...it's exhausting for a good dog who just wants to go home!

Among other reasons, Reddit's handling of the same link being posted repeatedly is different.

If you don't link to a specific chapter, readers won't know which chapter(s) to discuss in comments on this post. People will engage less, and more people will get spoiled without wanting to.

** I saved up a few chapters to read at once because I can't deal with just one chapter of Athos at a time. Really enjoying the way the worldbuilding is unfolding, the clever ways Athos has solved problems, and the examination of the extreme logical conclusion of Supreme Exemplar as applied to a domestic dog-- the Goodest Boy.

** Double plus good story of a lovable doggo learning that not all of the multiverse is treats and frisbees.

** Ah, I'd been wondering what had happened to this.

I see Athos is still being a good boi, and Eugene is still being... not that.

My only real note for improvement is that I'm having a hard time setting my expectations, in terms of pacing. As fun as it is to watch Athos kick ass, if there isn't a sense that it's accomplishing something that will get him home, or at least making progress towards a goal that, when completed, will let him /get back to/ getting home, there's a risk of it just feeling like the wheels are spinning. And while I don't think you're quite there yet, at eight chapters into this arc and with not one of the hazdahem even sighted, it's starting to head in that direction.

*** Yeah, I agree. Part of the problem with doing the Writeathon is that it rewards writing quickly over editing and planning and I've gotten a little far out over my skis. I'm bringing it back around in the next chapter or two.

** on [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30636/the-patchwork-realms-arrival/chapter/592515/chapter-20]] in the note at the bottom, the two other works have links but "My Patreon" is not a link despite seeming like you intended it to be one.
