** I saw most of the first episode of the show but didn't really care for it. Do I need to have seen it to enjoy this?

*** No, I first read the story without having seen the show at all.

(That said, the show is one of the most famous examples of the "3 episode rule" - you might find you're more interested by the time you've finished the third episode. But even if you're not, this story is very different in style from the show.)

*** The only anime I've ever watched is a few episodes of Death Note, and my general (though uninformed) impression of the "magical girl" genre is that it seems rather puerile.

That said, To The Stars is not only one of the best fanfictions I've ever read, but one of the best sci-fi stories in its own right. It's reminiscent of Iain Banks' Culture and Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers. It has one of (if not the most) plausible and best-realized conceptions of a post-scarcity AI-governed society I've ever seen. Its depiction of asymmetric combat with ultra-high-tech weapons -- both on the ground and in the air -- is incredibly well thought out. And its plot is /extremely/ interesting; I'm not quite sure where it's going but I'm sure I want to be there when it reaches it.

**** Just a heads up that you may wanna give the original a watch. I say this as someone who started with TtS and then watched the original. It's gonna subvert those puerile tropes. Stick with it thru episode 3 before you decide.

It's not as good as TtS, but still really good and worth watching. If you like TtS, knowing the original character arcs is going be interesting.

**** I like how it feels like really hard science fiction even though it has just about every physically impossible and unrealistic technology you see in sci-fi and also magical girls.

**** Arguably, even the original show itself is pure subversion. (Including the fact that this can't be inferred from its title or any other superficial properties.) It's a magical girl anime to the same degree that /Bakemonogatari/ is a harem or /Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei/ a school story. It twists and mocks and deconstructs just about every stereotype there is in the genre. So (unlike /e.g./ for Naruto fics) definitely watch the original for this one.

I'm struggling /very/ hard now not to spoil anything. You can do it yourself while getting a better idea of the content using, say, TVTropes, but better just watch the thing. (This may be less important given that you've read the fic; I haven't, so I don't know yet.)

**** Second the recommendation to watch the original Puella Magi Madoka Magica show (though not necessarily the followup movies, which are non-canon to TtS).

It's worth considering that the writer of PMMM, Gen Urobuchi, is an incredible science-fiction worldbuilder, and for someone who loves AI worldbuilding, one of his other works, the anime [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass][Psycho-Pass]], is an absolutely incredible dive into an AI-governed society - a utopia for some in how that AI system has put an end to crime, and a disturbing dystopia for those exposed to the other side of that equation.

Anime is a fantastic medium for depicting the juxtaposition of an innocent mindset with a complex and disturbing world, and Urobuchi is a modern master of this juxtaposition. Don't spoil any more of PMMM for yourself, and watch it knowing that his works are anything but puerile. It will massively increase your appreciation for the TtS lore.

And for what it's worth, Death Note is IMO a suboptimal introduction to the world of anime for those looking for deep sci-fi worldbuilding alongside philosophical themes in their stories. (And it's anything but rational as it progresses.) Perhaps even before seeing Psycho-Pass, I'd start with the sci-fi classics:

***** Thanks for the recommendations. I'll try to keep an open mind (I have, in fact, seen the 1995 Ghost in the Shell and thought it was quite good; forgot to mention that).

But, wow, I get the impression that I may have [[https://xkcd.com/386/][pissed some people off]]. My intention wasn't to vilipend the magical girl genre or even anime in general, rather to express my unequivocal recommendation of this fiction and emphasize that viewing the anime is not a prerequisite for its enjoyment.

** Woah.... I finally decided to give this a shot, as someone with only vague recollections of the show, its some of best space opera I've read in quite awhile. Currently on chapter 20.
