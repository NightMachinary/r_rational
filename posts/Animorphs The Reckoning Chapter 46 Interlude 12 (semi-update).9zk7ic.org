** I pick option B. The difference between a six month gap and a year gap for updates is not nearly as bad as the difference between a two week gap and a six month gap, because after 6 months I've mostly forgotten that r!Animorphs exists, and can just continue living in that ignorance.

I would be willing to wait a whole year for TK17 to finish the entire rest of r!Animorphs, to then be published in the span of a few very fun weeks. This may be more efficient from an authorial standpoint too, since chapters can be batch-written and batch-polished.

**** The last several updates have, with few exceptions, been months apart from each other, despite promises to the contrary. If the current release-as-written trend continues, I expect this fic to be finished in 2022. On the other hand, I would expect a hard 1 year deadline with no pressure to publish in the mean time to be more motivating and efficient, at least in this case.

****** TK17 never mentioned a deadline, I'm just suggesting one.

I don't think it's necessarily true that N chapters always take the same amount of time to write, because of planning around updates / psychology / batching etc.

My position is that if there are going to be more 6 month gaps in this fic, then I'd just prefer to lump them into one big final gap. If TK17 can publish a chapter every two weeks for the next 10 chapters, then I would switch to option A. But he's a busy person, so I doubt that's possible.

** Appears to be a request for feedback on update release schedule, with a note that the next chapter will be posted this Sunday. Apologies for the hypebait.

** B. I have trouble remembering what's happened until now, and I expect that to be less of a problem with batched updates even if there's a bigger gap between the batches.

Looking forward to the next one!

****** 1/3 of those reasons I'll grant could be called a "me problem". So what? We were asked which we prefer, and I prefer B.

I don't know what other people will answer or why, and I'm not going to sabotage the decision making process by hiding my preferences.

** One very short interlude, giving - if we are to take this as canon - a very surprising fact which I did not at all expect!

Also looking forward to the next normal chapter Sunday.

*** I cannot figure out which fact you are referring to. If it's that Marco's mom is Visser One's host, that's original Animorphs canon. An I missing something else?

**** Prior to this, there was no hint whatsoever about what Visser Three /did/ with Jake, Marco, Tobias, Erek, etc. This is ambiguous (could be a corpse, could be a live Marco) but it's still plot progress.

**** Original canon, but IIRC never before confirmed in this fic.

Also, what TK17Studios said below, but I didn't consider that quite as surprising.

***** It was confirmed during the Leeran section of the chapter where V3 sprung an ambush. Marco spent most of the last five minutes spiraling into despair and madness and disbelief over "how could they have my /mother?/"

** I'd favour B, I won't appreciate the arcs as much when there are very long gaps in between chapters, since I'll forget the fine details. I really like the approach of long gaps while an arc is written, and then eg releasing chapters every few days.

** Oh neat, it's not dead!

I think it should be pretty easy for the council to just check both Visser One and Eva's memories for treachery, but I also get the feeling he doesn't really need them anymore. He's just humoring them, and throwing crap at V1 is what he does for fun.

EDIT - Oh, and go for frequent single updates, I guess.

** Definitely A. A lot of the fun for me is speculating and deducing with other readers about what's really going on, and seeing how our predictions turned out later. That's much hard to do online & collaboratively when big chunks of information are released all at once.
