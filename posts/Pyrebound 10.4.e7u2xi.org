Pyrebound follows young Rammash im-Belemel on his quest to reform an utterly appalling society. Or possibly just not die. The story begins [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]]. Thanks to all of you who read, comment, and vote!

** Haven't heard of it before, what's the general premise of the story?

*** Here's my official blurb:

"The world has not been kind to Ram's family. Father just lost an arm. Mother can't work. And if Ram can't find a way to make money fast, a life of forced labor is the best any of them can hope for. His only way forward is through the darkest side of their dark world--fighting on the front lines of war against the demons, hiding with thieves and assassins in the shadows, wandering the wilds where the monsters rule.  How much more will the god of the pyre ask him to sacrifice?  And why, Ram wonders, should he be the one to pay?

/Pyrebound/ is a free-to-read online serial fantasy novel set in an unusual world loosely based on the cultures of ancient Mesopotamia.  The story is quite grim at points; this is a world where human civilization is perpetually hanging on by its fingernails.  Injustice is common and unremarkable.  With that said, I've put a lot of effort into making Ki an interesting place to visit, and I hope you enjoy it."

(I could probably use a better blurb, but I am not skilled at blurbcraft)

**** Thank you!

Is there anything you think sets it apart from other fantasy stories?

By the blurb it sounds fun, but doesn't explore any particular new niche?

***** For starters, the setting is highly atypical and thoroughly developed--no Tolkien borrowings here. I call it Mesopotamian-flavored because it takes place in a civilization of independent theocratic city-states along a river network in a near-eastern climate. Also there are a few echoes: similar phonemes ("Rammash," "Shazru"), ziggurats, and the like. But that's just the starting point for a unique society that diverges from the real world in (I hope) interesting ways. The story is as much about the world of Ki as it is about Ram.

I think of it as a story about power--of all different kinds--what we do to get power, and what power does to us. So, for example, there's a magical disaster that strikes the world every four days, and severely debilitates or kills everything that isn't protected by a holy fire. This makes for a highly collective and urbanized civilization, with every settlement crammed with people. It also gives the people who run the fires an enormous amount of leverage over the rest of the citizenry, and distorts their whole society. We're on our tenth arc, and still exploring new aspects of the generalized cultural dysfunction at work. That may or may not interest you, but I have fun with it.

***** I read this just a couple weeks ago after being unsure if I should take the time, and I can say that I thought it was great! It's not neccessarily way outside the envelope of general fantasy, but it's in interesting world with some novel ideas and it's quite well written.
