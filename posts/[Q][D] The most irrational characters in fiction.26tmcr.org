Using either/both of these definitions of rationality:

#+begin_quote
  Epistemic rationality: believing, and updating on evidence, so as to systematically improve the correspondence between your map and the territory. The art of obtaining beliefs that correspond to reality as closely as possible. This correspondence is commonly termed "truth" or "accuracy", and we're happy to call it that.

  Instrumental rationality: achieving your values. Not necessarily "your values" in the sense of being selfish values or unshared values: "your values" means anything you care about. The art of choosing actions that steer the future toward outcomes ranked higher in your preferences. On LW we sometimes refer to this as "winning".

[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/]]

But remember, [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/lw/reversed_stupidity_is_not_intelligence/][reversed stupidity is not intelligence]] and just because some character occasionally acts seemingly rationally doesn't mean he actually is rational.

--------------

I think the problem here is that what if some character intentionally goes against his values. Are the opposite of his values then considered his "new values"? For example, Mannequin in [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/about/][Worm]] who after trying his best to save the world became disillusioned about it after a certain disaster and then tried his best to go against his old values and destroy everything he previously valued. Is he being irrational even though he gets what he intends? Is it only irrational when you intend one thing and get the opposite of that and don't notice this over time?

Is it about sheer competence, like Voldemort trying the killing curse against Harry over and over again after it's failed the last n times?


** There's this one particular comic issue that I hate with a passion where Lex Luthor finds out that Clark Kent is Superman, courtesy of some enormously powerful computer program he's developed in order to draw conclusions. And what does Lex do? He says something to the effect of "No, that couldn't possibly be true", junks the computer program, and refuses to believe the evidence that the program has created. It's the exact opposite of rationality from a character that's usually portrayed as being somewhere between peak human intellect and /smarter than the entirety of 31st century Earth combined/.

It still pisses me off just thinking about.

**** I mostly agree with that, but there are a couple ways that a writer can get around not being as smart as the character they're writing;

1. *Think about things more than the character can*. Part of "smart" is arriving at the correct solution quickly. A stupid person can to some extent simulate this by spending hours generating possibilities and figuring out why they will or will not work, then having the character do the same in the span of minutes. A stupid writer can think up a believable lie that doesn't have any contradictory information, he just has to spend a lot longer on it than his character, who can do it on the fly.

2. *Bring in outside help*. Your character is limited to their own viewpoint most of the time, but if you're a stupid writer you can have a nearly unlimited number of people looking over your shoulder to troubleshoot for you. You should do this when writing anyway, wherever possible. The end result will be a character that's smarter than either the writer or the people who gave feedback.

3. *Research*. This crosses over into knowledge a bit, but part of being smart is knowing a lot, and a writer who doesn't have much knowledge can supplement their knowledge from the internet or things that they've read. If the stupid writer can recognize a smart argument, they can crib from it to supplement whatever they've thought up.

4. *Cheat*. Debatably terrible writing depending on how it's done, but since the author knows with certainty everything that's going to happen, they can have give the smart character the ability to be correct. The only problem is when the audience thinks to themselves "bullshit", which can be avoided with the above three points.

****** Yeah, it seems to me that this is how most "intelligent bad guys" in fiction are written. One of the things that frustrated me to no end about Battlestar Galactica was the way the Cylons were constantly portrayed as being super intelligent and one step ahead of the humans throughout the show, outright stating that they have some big master plan... then having it become clear that when the writers had to actually reveal what this plan was, there was nothing.

Similarly, Young Justice is a pretty amazing show, but it got a bit tiring in the first season to have The Light constantly mention at the end of each episode that every supposed "setback" just furthered their plans. Maybe they were just super cocky and putting up a front for the others though.

This often backfires though when a writer users a "smart" argument that they clearly don't quite understand.

****** Notable whenever philosophy comes up in the mainstream media. For some reason, plato's cave is a notable exception, with multiple works correctly understanding the concept; the philosophy of time travel is the worst offender, with no one seeming to understand many-worlds (and it's irrelevance to time travel) or closed time-like loops.

***** Not inherently a bad thing, so long as you write yourself as a compelling character.

Have you ever read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality][Sleeping with the girls]]? It's an excellent deconstruction of the standard SI fic. The protagnist spontaneously begins to port between his favorite anime, winding up in bed with a heroine from the story every time he falls asleep.

Every. time.

And they rarely take well to someone porting into their bed in the middle of the night.

I recommend it. It's a great read.

Now I just need to find the author and poke him with my cattle prod until he tells me why he stopped writing. I don't even care if he just got bored. I'm annoyed at the no-contact approach to questions.

** The more I think about it, the more I think that the award has to go to the Christian God, if you take all the stories of the Bible literally. He's got literally infinite power over everything. He's all-seeing. He's all-knowing. And then look at how he uses his powers. A large part of the problem is that the Bible was written by a bunch of people from different cultures and with different viewpoints, but God when seen as a character in a work of fiction is just ... so incredibly irrational.

(The non-literalist camp doesn't have these problems, and I don't mean for this to be taken as an attack on Christianity in general.)

***** No, no, it's better because Jewish God is outright stated to be racist (chosen people), petty (jealous god, disproportionate retribution, making a man KILL HIS KID JUST TO SEE IF HE WOULD DO IT), and vengeful (perfectly willing to kill people's innocent families for something THEY did). He's basically evil, though anti-villainous. So, he makes sense as a character. Which makes it so fucking weird when he suddenly saves 'I love everyone', kills himself, and then doesn't act substantially different afterwards.

** Surely Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Princess Celestia must be strong contenders. Perhaps extremely magically powerful entities in children's fiction generally are irrational or else solve the world's problems long before the child-hero can get there?

*** Extremely magically powerful entities in fiction tend to act very irrationally, usually because the author doesn't think through everything (or because the author did think through everything and decided to just do what was cool and fun instead of what made the most sense). Dumbledore isn't actually all that bad, since he's shown to be doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes.

Voldemort ... well, he's sort of a mess as a character, owing in part to a lack of moral complexity, and I think as a character his values are really, really poorly defined (aside from not liking muggles and not wanting to die, but that can't possibly be a comprehensive overview of his values).

**** Unless Dumbledore was secretly following along in his invisibility cloak the whole time, Harry definitely should have died in books 1,2,4,5, and 7, and he probably should have died in books 3 and 6. Well, I suppose his relationship with Voldemort would have kept him alive but not in a useful way.

Voldemort loses to /Harry/. He /keeps casting/ Avada Kedavra. His Legilimency fails because he can't comprehend True Love. /He lets his snake roam around/.

Oh, Gandalf. Gandalf is not very good at his job. Yep, don't rely on old powerful wizards in fantasy stories. They are dumb.

***** For the record, I'm not endorsing this, simply explaining.

It comes with the territory. If you have a magic system that is vaguely defined, there's really too many opportunities for it to just solve every problem. This is reasonable, but doesn't make for very compelling fiction. Authors get around this by having the one wielding the magic be completely ineffective, useless to the heroes, or the magic itself be unreliable. The rules of good storytelling trump rationality.

Sanderson's First Law of Magics: An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.

For the record, Sanderson treats his magic as a science, with hard rules and the characters experimenting to find those rules out. I wouldn't go so far as to call his fantasy stories truly rational, but they're certainly a step above Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.

I just realized I went way off topic. Oh, well.

***** I'd argue that Gandalf is exceptionally good at his job, actually. However, the actual nature of his job is not what it appears to be.

What he accomplishes is collecting remaining artifacts of the Age, putting them together in a last great battle, and having what doesn't fall leave. He is cleaning up the world and ending the Age in a last great battle, giving thematic closure and giving a clean ending to the Third Age.

If you see the world as a reflection of the music that created it, this is the crescendo that ends the Third Age and gives way to the Fourth. The dissonant refrain made by Melkor is brought to a conclusion as his last servant Sauron gathers his forces for the last time and is utterly destroyed. The Rings that he forged are destroyed or moved out of the world, the Elves that opposed him leave the world, the last of the Balors that once served Melkor is dragged out of hiding and destroyed...
