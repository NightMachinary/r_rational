*tl;dr: This is the challenge companion thread, post anything you want to post about Sherlock Holmes here, including recommendations, questions, comments, etc.*

[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/69][Sherlock Holmes books are available on Project Gutenberg]]. Sherlock Holmes exists as a character in the uncomfortable twilight area of the public domain, as some of the books are within the public domain and others are not. A recent(ish) court case ruled that the /character/ was public domain, except for those elements which were introduced in books which are not in the public domain. (I am not a lawyer.)

At any rate, there's a bunch of Sherlock Holmes out there. The Robert Downey Jr. movies and the Cumberbatch television show probably loom largest in the public consciousness at the moment (the latter more than the former).

Sherlock Holmes is very much Hollywood Intelligent; he knows a whole bunch of things and uses that knowledge to make huge logical leaps that don't necessarily follow. These days this is often poked fun at; Sherlock knows something by other means and uses a bunch of seemingly irrelevant details to dazzle whoever he's talking to. But at the same time, it's often used to solve cases that shouldn't be possible to solve that way, which might make narrative sense but at the expense of actual logic.

A special shoutout to the many characters inspired by Holmes, including House MD, who share many of the same problems as the original character.


** Maybe off-topic, maybe not, as it concerns the genre Sherlock Holmes kicked off rather than Holmes himself...

I've had a pet idea for ages for a procedural murder-mystery show that spends the first season building up the title character's detective prowess. Then, in the first season's finale, it reveals to the audience (but not to any of the other characters) that he's actually a brilliant but evil serial killer who gets his kicks framing others for his murders to bolster his reputation as a crime-solving hero. In retrospect, this makes sense of some of the inconsistencies that come with the genre - mostly questionable lines of evidence that always turn out to be right. The truth is that they /never/ turn out to be right; he just successfully tricked everyone else including most of the audience into thinking they were. His thought processes were optimizing for persuading third parties all along, not for deducing facts. And really, what would you /expect/ of one guy who keeps "stumbling on" supposedly unrelated murders? Something pretty fishy, right? In future seasons, the show is a dark drama; his serial-killing-and-framing operation continues; sometimes the side characters will start to have suspicions and get killed if they fail to hide them, until finally he makes some error and gets found out and taken down.

** Mycroft is an AI from /The Moon is a Harsh Mistress/

Watson is an AI in real life.

When is anyone going to make a Sherlock AI?

*** A company tried it in the short story [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5770263][/Enter a Soldier. Later: Enter Another/]], but it didn't work because he wasn't internally consistent (i.e., rational). [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Pizarro][Pizarro]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates][Socrates]] were simulated successfully, however.

** A fun fact about Sherlock Holmes is that he is in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#Copyright_issues][Public Domain]]. This means that any derivative work or fanfiction is perfectly legal and can be sold for commercial purposes without any explicit permission from any copyright holder. Dinosaur Comics mentions this a [[http://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2126][couple]] of [[http://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2590][times]]. Rejoice!

One of my favorite Sherlock Holmes derivative works is A Study in Emerald by Neil Gaiman [[http://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf][(link)]].

** A duology of educational and maybe-rationalist /Sherlock Holmes/ books was recommended [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ki3ey][here]]--though no discussion resulted, since electronic versions of the books seem to be unavailable.
