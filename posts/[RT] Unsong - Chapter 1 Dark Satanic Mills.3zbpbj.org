** Did anyone else realize the implication of the fact that it is "dangerous" to pronounce a name yourself instead of using a scroll, yet names can be pronounced by minimum wage workers in mass working in cubicles? Either the "dangerous" part is bullshit to give an extra excuse for enforcing the current copyright setup (likely), or the minimum wage workers are working in an unsafe environment (less likely, but still plausible given the right economic incentives). I find it sad that both seem plausible.

*** We don't know what all the other names of God do yet, but this seems like one of those things that's unsafe until proven otherwise. They're trying to find new spells /without knowing what those new spells do/. Unless all spells are universally usable without any precautions or flaws, or unless they can predict effects, it's dangerous to go hunting for new spells. What happens if the next spell you find begins producing huge amounts of carbon monoxide? Or levels the city around you?

**** - The objection the police officer has to speaking a name directly starts with the classic copyright argument. "It's dangerous" seems to be very nearly an afterthought. Agreed with by the idea that half the people in the office are doing it on a daily basis. My guess is that names are approximately as dangerous as power tools: if you know what you're doing you can use them for hours a day for your entire life without ever getting injured, if you don't know what you're doing they will tear your limbs off and/or set your house on fire.
- From the effect we see when he finds the new name, it appears that a name may not do anything unless you speak it with intent. Here, he accidentally says a name - same conditions as when randomly attempting names - and instead of invoking its effect, it simply tells him what it does.
- I'm not sure how copyright will actually work in this occurrence. Can it be argued that "meh meh meh meh meh meh" is enough of an addition for Aaron to own it himself and that he was off the clock at that point?

The company will try to claim they own it, even if they don't know the name or if they have no valid claim (the probably have some type of waver they make their employees sign guaranteeing that they will own any names the employee comes up with, even off the clock). However, my impression is that Aaron may not actually try to copyright it, but instead use its raw power for himself directly and not tell anyone the secret name. I imagine if the name is powerful enough, he will wipe out the company's records (just to minimize their chances of guessing at what he did, or if they always record everything just in case a situation like this comes up.)

I guess my reading was that the Name he discovered grants self-awareness and that this awareness is what he granted to himself. Compare:

#+begin_quote
  It stood there for a moment, a crude statue, and then a voice from Heaven spoke a Name, and the clay came to life, lumbered into a standing position. It spoke a second Name, and the clay's eyes opened, and within them were innocence and curiosity and the capacity to wonder and learn. *And it spoke a third Name, and it was as if a light went on inside of it, and the dust became aware that it was dust and in so doing was dust no longer.*
#+end_quote

And the effect he experiences:

#+begin_quote
  *I was struck by a wave of holy light. The heavens opened and poured into me. My soul rang like a bell.*
#+end_quote

This would imply that he was the beneficiary of the Name and that he did cast it by saying it.

****** Huh. I parsed the "it" in "And it spoke a third Name" as the voice from Heaven speaking a third time, and that it was targeted on the golem => man. Which implied to me that there was a targeting step, which would have to be somehow intent-based, and that the word spoken without a target does something else entirely. That's potentially much less interesting than your reading, though. Interesting.

******* Aaron is already human, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the Name would have absolutely zero effect. It might be something like sending a duplicate INSERT statement and getting back a violation of primary key constraint error. No, nothing gets changed in the database, but you still get an error back as a result. The light of Heaven goes into a hollow form and gives it self-awareness, or the light of Heaven attempts to go into a form and makes the soul ring like a bell as celestial energy attempts to fill a vessel that's already full.

I mean, it will almost certainly be settled in the next chapter, but I don't think this chapter makes it clear whether /speaking/ a Name is the same as /invoking/ a Name. The chapter exclusively uses the former in all contexts.

***** Even if saying a name initially has no effect other than to let the minimum-wage worker know what it does, that will still eventually present problems if the spell does things like instantly produce enough gold to devalue the currency of nations, drives all of the invoker's enemies insane, or turns the invoker into a winged immortal. It would be hard to disincentivize a minimum-wage worker from paying a $70 fine for potential world domination or short-sightedly plunging the world into chaos.

California law is that employees own any IP they create on their own time, using their own materials. So, the character 'discovered' the completed phrase.

Also, I can imagine that any recording system would be tied to the timer. If I have to audit an employee, I want their recordings broken into 1 chunk / 1 word anything else would be really annoying to audit.

The whole problem is that we have to posit a counterfactual legal system where it's possible to copyright a word. The closest we have are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_number][illegal numbers]], but no one is really claiming that those numbers are copyrightable (well, people building strawmen are). So in order for a word to have copyright applied to it, we need copyright to mean something other than what we mean right now when we say copyright.

So there's no real way of knowing unless Unsong descends into the arcana of a counterfactual legal system, which I don't really imagine that it will. /If it were our legal system/ it's very likely that he would not have legal right to the spell, not only because he'd be going up against someone with a lot more money, but because he was using the company's intellectual property and physical property.
