** He's back! I've been checking for updates about once every week or two for the past...too long I don't wanna think about the timespan.

It's worth a reread from the first chapters. He's said that there's been a lot of minor rewrites in the earlier text.

** What is this about? I tried to find a link to the first chapter. Is it titled "Eat Cute"?

*** It's a story about a boy meeting a succubus (though I must stress that the succubi in this world are fairly different from the more wicked, straight up evil succubi portrayed elsewhere) and essentially signing a life contract with her and all of the sexy play that comes with it.

It's very much an erotica, that's pretty much the entire point of the story in a certain sense, but the worldbuilding and level of detail the author put into it is truly mind boggling. If you're squicked out by erotica, then this definitely isn't for you, but if you're even mildly interested, I can say that the characterization and world building and magic systems and just...everything....are crafted particularly well, though the drawback of that is that it takes rather long for the actual "plot" to get moving because everything is laid out in vivid detail.

Overall, from what I can remember, an interestingly different read and definitely worth it if you're a staunch purveyor of rational works and a sometimes-or-more purveyor of erotica.

**** To add to this description - the erotica is mostly BDSM stuff with orgasm control and bondage/discipline elements but not major pain play as of yet, male dominant / female submissive, and so far has been pretty monogamous but may not stay that way for all that long. If that's not your cup of tea, the story is probably not going to be worth reading to you, considering how much of the story it makes up - and personal tastes in that sort of thing are highly individualized. The worldbuilding is unique and interesting but I don't know that it'd stand up by itself if you dislike all the rest of the story.

If you happen to be interested in "rational works and erotica." as a category, you should definitely check out Erogamer on Questionable Questing (in the NSFW questing forum, have to make a [free, low-hassle] account to view).

*** Yeah that's the first chapter and if you click in the upper right corner, it'll open up a sidebar with the table of contents and formatting options.

Basically it's a story where Hell is real, except it's actually a kinky Heaven and the people who rejected it to come back were the wierdos who gave us a distorted idea of it. The protagonist just wakes up one day with a succubus who proceeds to kidnap him away from his sucky life onto a kinky journey that sorta looks like a mishmash of Narnia and Harry Potter.

** Welcome back! At this point this is purely smut, though... Like, it was very briefly possible that it was a story about transhumanism, but now no.
