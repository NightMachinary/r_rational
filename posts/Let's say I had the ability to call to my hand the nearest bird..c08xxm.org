** I mean... you'd get in trouble for animal cruelty, depending on where in the world you live.

Why would you kill the birds instead of, I don't know, putting funny hats on them? That would go viral for sure, and you wouldn't have to worry about PETA sending a hit squad after you.

Depends on where you are, what the bird is, who /you/ are, and how the bird dies.

If the sparrow lands in your hand and expires naturally, well, that's a weird coincidence.

If you're personally snapping the neck of the Bald Eagle on National Park property while displaying your ID, then, yes.

If you have a hunting permit, it's goose season, you're in a hunting-legal area, and you're calling geese to hand before shooting them with a legal gun for hunting, that's a legal but weird flex.

** People would probably think it was staged, even if you did it live. I mean, you can train birds to some extent.

​

You'd probably get the attention of some scientific institution, who would want to study the mechanism by which this was happening (and who could conclusively prove whether you're a fraud or not). Assuming you'd come out clean and the mechanism wasn't easily identified, you'd probably be given the opportunity to participate in further research (but I doubt they'd disappear you).

​

There would still be people who'd think it was a fraud, even if a disinterested third-party verified you were telling the truth. For the rest of the people... Western culture has grown up with the idea of superheroes, and , let's face it, this isn't that great a power. At best, you'd be a minor celebrity.

​

And, yes, as [[/u/LazarusRises][u/LazarusRises]] said, while you might get an amnesty for killing the first few birds in exchange for letting people study you, if you kept at it, you'd get hit with animal cruelty penalties.
