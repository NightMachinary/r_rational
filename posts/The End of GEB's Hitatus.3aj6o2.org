This is an apology and a warning.

I am sorry for stopping so abruptly with the read through of *Godel, Escher, Bah: An Eternal Golden Braid*.

Fortunately, I will be posting the next chapter, Chapter XVI: Self-Ref and Self-Rep, on Sunday at 5 PM Eastern Time.

I already have the post ready to go. This is just to allow people to get the chance to read the chapter before I post.

Here's the links to all of the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2yys1i/lets_start_the_read_through/][previous discussions]] if you want to refresh your memory on the previous chapters.


** Damn I totally missed your post :) Glad you're continuing the read through
