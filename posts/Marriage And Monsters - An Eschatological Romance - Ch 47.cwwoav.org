** Hey all- brief update on the publishing schedule. Next week you will be getting /four/ chapters, as we wrap up Arc 3. After that the story's going to go on a short break. I've got to finish moving, then take a few weeks to plot what will hopefully be the final arc and regain some momentum. I'm planning on a one month hiatus, in total.

That's all for now. See you at the big finish!
