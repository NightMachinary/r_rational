Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I finally decided to sit down and start plotting out the outline on Sideways in Hyperspace on paper, so I wasn't just writing from my memory, and holy hell did that throw up a lot of problems pretty much immediately.

1) (mostly unrelated and mostly solved) I downloaded Space Engine so I could get a good 3d view on where stars are wrt each other in the galaxy, and immediately realized I had put the entire Hyades Cluster on the wrong side of the sky. The problem was I used [[http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/250lys.html][this map]] of space, which makes it look like the Hyades is in front of the Earth wrt the center of the galaxy...nope, it's in fact in almost the exact opposite direction. I came up with a way around it wrt the plot, but it was incredibly grating to realize the error.

2) I'm stuck at this point in the plot where I'm not sure how two governments in a state of cold war and distrust with each other would act in this situation, and its hard to even discuss it without revealing massive spoilers.

*** Gwern wrote an article that might be relevant to #2. Check it out [[http://www.gwern.net/Colder%20Wars][here]].

Also, I've been ignoring Sideways in Hyperspace whenever it pops up for...reasons that I'm not entirely sure about. I've read your synopsis now on wordpress, and I'm wondering what aliens are like in your story (I tend to read stories more for the world than for the plot). Could I get the lowdown on aliens and the setting in general? Thanks.

**** There's only so much I can say without potentially spoiling the plot for others, but here's a bit.

Like the Synopsis said, it's 2219, and humanity invented warp drive 20 years ago. Aside from that warp drive, the setting is a fairly hard sci-fi. There are no teleporters, internal dampeners, artificial gravity, or energy shields. 'True' artificial intelligence is very hard, and whole brain emulation has remained 'several decades away' for the last two hundred years. Death is alive and well, and though biological age can be reversed with access to anti-senescenics, those drugs remain out of economic reach of much of the human race. Cryogenics remains popular, with many people opting to just skip forward past the current few hundred years. Earth, Mars, and the alliance of gas giant worlds known as the Tartarus Accords, have been locked in a three-way cold war since the end of their last hot war a century ago. They all have unnecessarily powerful weapons of mass destruction pointed at each other, held in a MAD equilibrium and just now starting to step back from the arms race following the discovery of warp drive and access to the resources that entailed. It's not a perfect world, it's ragged and gritty on the edges, but its still moving in the right direction. Cancer is pretty much gone, anti-virals have come a long way, and a whole list of diseases have been eradicated.

The aliens...a lot of details about them are relevant to the plot. There's one race I'm willing to talk about, since much of the information regarding them has already been published, or will be soon. The alien race that calls themselves The Ones That Came Before are eight-limbed, radially symmetrical, quadrupeds. They have four lower limbs offset 45 degrees from four slightly longer upper limbs. Their limbs are 'feathered' and come in a variety of colors, each one terminating in a set of clawed, four-fingered digits. They have eight eyes, two every 90 degrees, set one above the other, and a beaklike mouth on the top of their head. They're capable of gliding and limited flight in the atmosphere of their homeworld. They don't have a nervous system, instead, all their memories encode directly into their equivalent of DNA, and not every individual has the same set of genetic memories. They utilize r-pattern selection and have 3-500 children in a litter, which then cannibalize each other until they've gained enough body mass (and thus genetic material) to gain a theory of mind along with the skills for whatever task they are born into. They don't actually learn, they can take in information, but can't really learn from it. They can't encode from working memory into structural genetic memory, they only learn by cannibalizing one of their own and gaining their genetic memories. Each individual is capable of very limited experiential learning, and they can't take in abstract or higher order concepts this way. They wear clothes, have 40-60 year lifespans, and eat their dead. They also travel around the galaxy picking up sentient races for their ark ships, because you really don't want to be here when /those other aliens/ show up.

***** Where do the genetic memories originally /come/ from? They don't seem to be encoding from anywhere...

(Incidentally, you might be interested in [[http://www.cherryh.com/www/worldbuilding.htm][this article]] on designing aliens by a master at the craft).

******* Okay, Mysterious Memories encoded by Mysterious Means, fair enough.

Next question. How do they relate to each other? Jim knows (or should know) that he can learn everything Bob knows if he eats Bob.

Or alternatively, Bob may trade Jim a cluster of his pre-education children so that Jim can learn a new skill be eating them (perhaps in exchange for some of Jim's pre-sentient children). If they're fairly new at the whole business of meeting other cultures, they might even offer the humans some of their children to eat in an attempt to teach the humans their language... actually, considering how slow to learn they are, they might do that anyway.

And then there's the question of mutation. These genetic memories must occasionally - slowly - mutate. (Sufficiently redundant genetic encodings can slow the rate of change, but not eliminate it entirely). So, have these skills developed small... /changes/ over time? Does the coffee-making alien now add 2% more water than his ancestors did? Does the Piloting alien do a ritual tap-dance before taking his seat every morning?

*** Regarding distrust for point 2, you may be interested in looking at how intergalactic civilizations attempt to survive in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest][The Dark Forest]], which has some ideas I hadn't really thought about re: communication and PD-type scenarios.

** I've been writing some post-apocalypse fantasy recently. My explanation for technology not being widely redeveloped is as follows:

1. Bunch of nukes detonate in upper atmosphere, basically EMP striking the entire planet.
2. Rogue AI is blamed for nuke strikes so everyone that lives has an inherent mistrust of existing computer technology thinking it might be infected with rogue AI.
3. The Sun starts acting up, so solar storms also EMP the planet every decade or so.
4. This happens a couple decades from now, so many devices that can be run mechanically, use a lot internal electronics anyways to run more efficiently. This makes reverse engineering existing technology much more difficult then it would be today (like the difference between reverse engineering Grahm Bell's phone vs a landline phone vs a modern cell phone).

I'd be interested to see some people poke holes in this explanation, or let me know how long they think it would take before we get back to our modern level of technology.

** ... I just [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][wrote]] a few lines of story about how the existence of '[[/u/EliezerYudkowsky/][Big Yud]]', living in the San Francisco area 20 years from now, has meant that a particular group of plotters have had to step up the quality of their scheming, to /really/ take into account the possibilities of existential risks. This is entirely relevant to the plot, but as entertaining as including the memetic-Mary-Sue version of said individual might be on one level, I don't actually want to have a memetic Mary Sue.

Anyone have any thoughts on how to include something close to the idea of a character who could "have us arrested with a single phone call if our plans measurably increased existential risk, and who just might be able to make better guesses about our future plans than we can", without going over the top? Would simply anonymizing the character instead of naming them after a living individual be enough, or should I throw in more background explanation about what said figure has done to warrant such caution, or take some other approach?

(Current solution: Since the point is to offer a bit of a rationalist lesson, simply lampshade the whole thing, ala "... even if Big Yud himself doesn't live up to the hype, it's an incredibly safe bet to assume that there is someone out there at least as qualified as the memetic-badass version of Big Yud is supposed to be, so we might as well make our plans around him the way some people make survival plans for a zombie apocalypse they know is never going to happen.")
