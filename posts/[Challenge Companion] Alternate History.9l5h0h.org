*tl;dr: This is the companion thread to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9l5e02/biweekly_challenge_alternate_history/?][the biweekly challenge]], post ideas, recommendations, and general chit-chat here.*

I think that as a genre alternate history tends to be closer to [[/r/rational]] material than average, partly because it tends to be grounded in heavy research and "what if" aspects. Those lead to a greater emphasis on what characters know and would logically do in their situation than some other premises.

The big problem with writing alternate history is that it takes a lot of work, unless you already know a lot about the time period in question, or you really enjoy that research aspect (in which case the research is fun, not work). Most of the alternate history I've read indulges itself in the research and history of the period, or of the alternate world that's been created by the point of divergence, which is always something that I take some joy in, because I'm a fiend for good worldbuilding. At the same time, standards are a little bit higher than in something like fantasy, because you're dealing with "real" people who are known to the reader, and their understanding of history might conflict with your understanding as an author, causing a disconnect.
