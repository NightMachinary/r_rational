*** JP's interviews are how I wish actual businesses hired people. I wanna get a job by solving an ARG.

**** I know a fair number of people who've gotten jobs through networking at puzzle hunts, which is basically like getting a job through solving an ARG!

**** It would kind of suck to put that much effort into the interview process to find they're offering a standard desk-drone job for $10k below industry-standard rates with no benefits, though. And a combination of sunk costs and the impression of excitement built by the process itself would mean they'd probably get people signing up anyway.

I think I'd rather stick with a boring face-to-face meeting swapping questions to find a match.

/But/, in my bizarre fantasy world, jobs are emotionally fulfilling, salaries are as extravagant as automation allows, and also you don't lose your health insurance for three months whenever you get hired somewhere new.
