Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

*** I'm currently obsessed with [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4]] and I don't really know why; I've probably read it three or four times already, and I read each update twice. I think it's because it really speaks to the imposter syndrome in me.

That being said the author's warning of "I love coincidences" in the first chapter holds true, so don't expect a hyper-logical chain of events in the story. Fortunately the coincidences tend to make trouble for the MC as much as they pull him out of it, so it just feels chaotic (instead of like a continual Deus Ex).

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28360/river-of-fate][River of Fate]] is probably my second-favorite Western xianxia story ever (after Cradle). It's definitely the best novel I've read in terms of expressing the mysticism and wonder I would expect from a realistic cultivation process, but that means the mechanics of the MC's abilities are a lot more flexible than I'd like (since they're literally based on his understanding of reality).

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27456/castle-kingside][Castle Kingside]] is going great as well - the basic premise is a modern surgeon gets pulled into a grimdark fantasy world, and goes from there. Up until recently he's mostly been mired in the suck, but now the novel is showing a bit of a hint of uplift (what with him introducing the scientific method plus his own advanced knowledge).

***** It gets a little bit less irreverent - the MC eventually gets down to his goon re-education program and starts taking a proactive approach to MC detection after the auction arc, but that's relatively recent.

Castle Kingside has a really rocky start, especially because the MC is basically dying slowly for something like the first ten chapters. It is very grim, but gets a bit better.

River of Fate is a lot more consistent (though it has longer chapters). If you're not in to it by the time they make it to the city, it's probably not for you.

** In honor of season 3 finally being announced, I'm going to re-reccomend the anime [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon][Log Horizon]]. For those of you who haven't heard of it, it's your standard "stuck in a video game" isekai, except it's not standard at all because instead of being about one un/lucky soul, all 30,000 people in the japanese server (plus hundreds of thousands more worldwide) get brought along. And this is no on-rails death game; people resurrected after being killed, and yet there's no obvious way to get home.

So instead of following your standard OP, powerleveling protagonist, its main protagonists (and antagonists) are already high-level players that understand the game, or at least what the game was like before the isekai. While there are plenty of battle scenes, Log Horizon instead focuses on interpersonal conflict on the scale of small societies; politics, economy, diplomacy, warfare, and discovery. And there are not just one, but several level 2 intelligent characters.

There's also this pretty famous [[https://imgur.com/a/AkeYt][analysis]] (a little spoilery) demonstrating how a particular battle in log horizon was the author adapting and optimizing the tactics used at agincourt for MMO players, which should give you an idea of how much thought went into the world of Log Horizon.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593][Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach]] is a very uplifting, inspirational fanfic of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens_(TV_series)][Good Omens]] TV show. The main character, Aubrey Thyme, is a psychotherapist, and her latest client is a bit different from her usual customers.

She is a very driven, empathic person, who is giving her all to help those in her care. I think she's perfect for your request.

Despite the supernaturally-focused source material, it doesn't deal with religion at all until pretty much the end, and even there it takes the original work's rather critical stance.

** Here's something a bit different - the stuff I've /stopped/ reading recently. Some dis-recommendations, I suppose.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28732/the-gray-mage][The Gray Mage]]: (not to be confused with Gray Mage: Alchemist, which is good but on hiatus) Mother of Learning, but as a power fantasy. The main character is basically Zach but slightly smarter. Oh also (at least as far as I got) there's zero other loopers, zero deadline, and the main character has been guaranteed that he'll know if another looper shows up.

There's just no conflict and it's kinda boring. The main character is blind, but obviously that stops being a practical concern as soon as he starts learning to use magic.

There's also sex scenes, which end up being kinda squicky if you take a moment to consider the implications of consent and the power differential a time looping person would have over literally everyone else.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28356/carlfire][carl@fire]]: A sysadmin got isekai'd into his own game (that he doesn't really play), and doesn't realize it yet. It's one of those stories set up in a action / reaction way (some chapters are from Carl's view, others are from everyone else's). It was fun at first, but the thing is just dragging on and on and on - especially since literally every event is shown from at least two angles (and often three or four). I mean, it's at chapter 54ish and just a handful of hours have gone by, if that. It's not even slice-of-life, it's just taking a microscope to a mind-numbing sequence of events.

Oh and also Carl is an /incredibly bad/ sysadmin and that's just never addressed at all.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/17051/bunkercore][Bunkercore]]: It makes me sad because I really loved the rest of this author's works, but I dunno - the first Bunkercore novel was marginal and the current one just isn't doing it for me. The main character is a high-tech dungeon core, but his restrictions are way too arbitrary and game-like for my taste. If he was in an actual game that would make sense, but he's supposed to be out in reality where there's no real reason to have what amount to "perks".

The story somehow manages to contain none of the things I like about humanity, or learning, or magic, or even about exploiting timeloop fantasies, while constantly teasing to me that maybe it does, and this utter lack of fulfillment was agony to me as I read.

There was also a singularly extreme casual moment of unjustified brutality that no one in the story ever bothered to reflect upon, and this made me hate the MC instantly, despite having spent a friendly dozen or so chapters with him up to that point, and I never regained that connection.

The total lack of stakes doesn't help anything either. Despite the fact it is regularly updating, there is nothing compelling me to check in on it ever again (especially since there was confirmation from the author that one of the things that I was reading for was never going to be a thing).

It's a pretty good and original series that is fairly rational, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman][bildungsroman]]that'll also scratch your progression fantasy itch as well.

The magic system is complex and interesting, and it's tied with their moral/religious system a bit like in star wars, but less dogmatic and more nuanced. Most good people tend to be "grey" rather than light or dark, as being light is a very difficult, and being dark easy but very perilous and apparent if you're not a master. It's a bit like a karmic system, in that everything can affect your alignment, even eating meat (slightly, but it adds up over a long lifetime), and all light and grey side magisters try to avoid it and things like it, if possible.

My least favourite part is that the author has a tendency to use medieval latin or french words for armor or sword moves or army maneuvers (he's a scholar of medieval history and Historical European martial arts) and not properly explain concepts, especially when it comes to magic. It's not as bad in this series (it caused me to drop his last one), but it can be frustrating.

--------------

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/269818-art-of-the-adept][Art of the Adept series]] is another Bildungsroman/progression fantasy kind of book. Not sophisticated or great by any means, but decent and competently written. It starts out cliched and juvenile but improved enough to maintain my interest and to try the second book, which was also an improvement.

*** Hey I like your recommendations!

I'm on book 3 of the Masters and Mages trilogy and I'm sort of... less enamored by it? The first book was wonderful, and the second book was pretty good, but I feel like as it goes the series gets off the track of self-discovery and development and more epic action, which can be good in its own right but it's not really what I was looking for in the series I guess. I might still finish it someday but for now it's on hold.

I've got a few series similar to what you're recommending.

The Cycle of Arawn (and the Cycle of Galand after it) is about Dante's improvement from learning necromancy to actually using it competently (and he does get very competent). What I liked about it is that it has a powerful protagonist and his sidekick, but instead of showing us how they dominate their enemies it's them being swindled and outmaneuvered time and time until they wisen up. The worldbuilding is pretty good, and the lore is really good. It starts somewhat weak but gets better after book one. The best part is the friendship and banter between Dante and Blays.

Paragon of Destruction starts off like a normal cultivation story with a protagonist going into magic school to discover that he has special magic, but slowly evolves into something great. The magic is of course great and powerful, but what I like about it is the amount of traveling that the protagonist does. He almost never settles anywhere for more than a few years, and so we get to see a big part of the world with him. I also liked how there are periods where he is better at magic than melee and vice versa, as well as periods where he is better at magic A and then periods where he's better at magic B. It starts kind of weak but gets very good.

Reborn: Apocalypse is one of the most addictive books I've read in a while. The premise is that one person gets sent back in time to save humanity from extinction, in a cultivation world, so he uses his future knowledge to thoroughly set humanity on track to survive. The protagonist is meticulous like Light from Death Note, and watching his plans get fulfilled in slow motion is addictive as /heck./ That is, if you can suspend disbelief enough. Characterization can be better but it's fine, the series achieves what it sets out to be, a supersonic hype train.

**** Yes, I also didn't fully appreciate the tonal shift in the Masters and Mages series. It goes from a very intimate story of Aranthur and his schooling and relationships and sword lessons, almost slice of life-like, to a hard transition to epic fantasy in the second and (particularly) the third book. I still enjoyed it, but I'm always going to be searching for more of that feeling from the first book.

If you want a rec with a similar feel, try [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25451852-dawn-of-wonder][Dawn of Wonder]]. It's got its own problems, but it's good and long and the sequel should be out this year.

As to your recs, I think I gave Cycle of Arawn a shot a few times, but dropped it. Don't remember why.

And Reborn: Apocalypse was a surprise for me, I did not expect to like it as much as I did. In the beginning I almost dropped it because the writing was so rough, but the pacing and plot was so tight that I got fully immersed.

I also read the sequel, and it was not as good, mostly due to the slower pacing and worldbuilding problems(the "system" is a mess). Also, it's very hard to write a magnificent bastard/[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero][Guile Hero]] character as a single POV MC. Most writers can't do it. That's why Light and Sherlock Homes and so on are typically antagonists or foils to the MC.

I'll definitely give the the other one a try.

I'm 80% of the way through the second book. I really like the concept, but a word of warning to anyone else looking to pick this up: the MC continually makes horrible and irrational decisions. I'm debating whether or not to even finish the rest of the book.

***** I agree that conclusion is not the best possible, but TNC can't possibly have satisfying plot conclusion in principle. It's a story of uplifting/ascension into a different level of consciousness/intelligence which is completely alien to ordinary human. There can not be comprehensive plot resolution in that kind of story, because plot resolution would be outside of human comprehension. Author choose type of the ending "Meh, we failed to ascend and we are good with it"

** I'm looking for a (short) story I only vaguely remember. It's basic premise was our reality was a simulation and one day the admins thanked us for our contributions, said they'd naturally keep the simulation running for humane reasons, but shut down / pause various subsystems to conserve calculating power. One of these subsystem was weather, which continued at whichever setting it was currently locally (sunny, stormy, cloudy, ...), another was erosion, which simply stopped. The main characters then started to explore, I think? And the story ended on them discovering a shortcut between two places, like clipping through reality. An image that stuck in my head with this story was how the shortcut tunnel the MCs walked through had trees growing at all kinds of odd angles, as if someone had disabled collision detection and gravity while placing them.

Also, since I listened to the whole Escape Pod archive at some point (and still listen to it semi-regularly) it might be on there, but I can't find it.

That being said, there are a couple of moments that I think are just too lucky for the author to get away with, as well as one scene marred by a character being really stupid. Those are minor issues though, and on the whole would highly recommend.

*** Forge of Destiny originated as a quest on Sufficient Velocity, but is currently being re-released as a novel (i.e., none of the mechanics/decisions/dice rolls are shown) on Royal Road. It focuses on a young girl, Ling Qi, who has been invited to the Sect of Argent Peak, and has boatloads of worldbuilding, cool fight scenes, interesting powers, and more. It's fairly different from Cradle in that it takes place almost entirely within the Sect's confines, but personally I think it has a slightly more mature style than Cradle, and doesn't go as absurdly fast in progression fantasy as Cradle does. The first book has also been finished (at least in quest format) and the sequel, Threads of Destiny, is currently in progress.

*** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28360/river-of-fate][River of Fate]] is my current second favorite after Cradle - it's somewhat less rationalistic, but really nails the mysticism.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy][Nanocultivation Chronicles]] is also really good, and explores a lot of the high-tech and far future topics that people like in rational sci-fi alongside its cultivation. I'd skip the first 3 chapters tho - just go straight to Girl.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15193/ave-xia-rem-y][Ave Xia Rem Y]] is another excellent xianxia, though what makes this one stand out is how standard it is; it really nails the classic xianxia tropes without feeling cliche. I'd almost believe it was a translation (it's not)

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid][Street Cultivation]] is an amazing deconstruction of "what if xianxia, but also capitalism?" (answer: things kinda suck). It's one of those "pull yourself out of debt thru hard work and some unexpected risks" stories.

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PKGSDDQ][A Thousand Li]] is another bog standard cultivation novel, though this one has fewer cliches (but also doesn't shine quite as brightly as the rest of these recs). It's more of a slice-of-cultivating-life novel.

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BJFFXL5][Painting the Mists]] is another good one - I liked the first couple of books better than A Thousand Li, at least. It started to drag on around book three though, so I haven't finished the series.
