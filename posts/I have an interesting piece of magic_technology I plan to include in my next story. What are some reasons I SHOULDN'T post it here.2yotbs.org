** - You'll remove some of the thrill and wonder from your readers, assuming that they read the discussion first.
- You'll (possibly) remove some of your own enjoyment from writing about it
- You'll dilute discussion about the cool thing by having it be split into two places

There are some secondary concerns, but those are the big ones in my opinion. In return, you get some feedback about the magic or technology, which can be helpful in pointing out flaws, or helping you think up new things to do with it.

** Depends on how critical what you post is to your book, specifically in relation to how much of a spoiler it is. Even then, it shouldn't be too big of a deal. Unless your entire climax hinges on something you explain in your post.

** No reason not to, really. You'll get down voted if we don't think it fits. I think the readers of this subreddit are looking for intelligent characters more than holding to any definition of rational fiction. If your character is smart, that's good enough to at least get our opinions

** If this tech is central to your plot, and I mean central like magic in Harry Potter, then you may not want to share it if you're trying to get published. At least not until you are close to completion. I do think posting it here before you make a final draft is a great idea. You'll likely get some good ideas on uses and have any flaws pointed out.

*** Posting before any draft is made is probably better. Think about how much work could be saved if OP discovers a major flaw /before/ writing the story, and doesn't have to redo the entire plot.

***** Also true!

But in either case, I'd consider it a strong rule of mine that worldbuilding should be worked out and finished before the story proper is started.
