From the HPMoR subreddit - Why Self Actualization is my favorite arc in HPMOR (spoilers and cursing, lots of cursing) -

#+begin_quote
  "Hermione's growth is triggered by frustration and helplessness in the face of collective insanity, just like Harry at Azkaban and Draco upon realizing the delusions of the blood purists. It's rationalist fiction, bitches"
#+end_quote

To me, this is the emotional core of most Rationalist Fiction. "People Are Crazy And The World is Mad", followed by the hero rebelling against that and embracing being the lone outcast in a desperate effort to not be swept away by the accepted social insanity.

I think a form of this would be good to add to either General Characteristics or Bonus Points in the sidebar.


** Characters in HPMOR who've been, or who've considered themselves, the Only Sane Person in Hogwarts and/or Magical Britain (so far):

- Harry
- Hermione
- Susan
- Daphne
- Professor McGonagall
- Professor Quirrell
- Mad-Eye Moody
- Amelia Bones
- The entire Chaos Legion

It's a pretty good bet that Draco is thinking this in Ch. 74. And that this is how Lucius Malfoy sees himself. And that Professor Sprout would consider herself to have a pretty good claim to the title. And so would Filius Flitwick. And then Dumbledore is just plain complicated.

A good rule of thumb is that any agenty character is, from some perspective, at some point in the story, the Only Sane one.

** I agree with you up until this:

#+begin_quote
  embracing being the lone outcast
#+end_quote

I'd say it's the exact opposite. You make it sound like they double down on being the lone voice of reason: some of the best parts of rationalist fic to me is when the protagonist attempts to spread rationality, or suffers consequences from attempting to do everything alone.

I'm writing my rationalist fic for myself, because exploring the pokemon world rationally brings me lots of fulfillment and pleasure, but I also do it for others, because discussing the themes is enjoyable and spreading science and rationality are some of my values.

No matter how brilliant, I wouldn't respect someone who decided to stay a "lone outcast" nearly as much as one who attempts to teach (and continues to learn from) others.

** Problem being this way of thinking is shared by extremists of every stripe. "Women are mad and the world is mad, I should start up The Red Pill!" "Cis people are all deluded scum and I'm the only one who can see the Matrix!" "The world is mad and we few Scientologists must save them from themselves!"

So while it works in various narratives, you probably do not want "People Are Crazy And The World is Mad" to be what you're known for.

** Most of the stories posted to this subreddit don't seem particularly /rational/, which is probably the wrong word anyway. They may (may) be smart, have interesting ideas, and make you think, but I'm not how they qualify as /rational/ fiction.

As I've said before, four of the five bullet points on the sidebar lists staples of good fiction in general. It's the four "bonus" bullet points plus the bullet point about the story being like a puzzle that make more sense as a definition of "rational" fiction. But how many stories posted to here have been like a puzzle? For that matter, how many people really think HPMOR is solvable in a manner analogous to a jigsaw puzzle?

*** In order for a story to really be like a puzzle, it probably needs to be quite a bit longer than most of the stories posted here, which tend to be quite short.

I think the sub should want to send me lots of money and women. If you're going to restrict me to a more narrow range, I'm perfectly happy with the sub the way it is. That the meaning of "rationalist" should become diluted as the movement grows is predictable (and something I predicted). Since I'm not part of said movement, I'm not particularly bothered by it, and so I'm happy to have a sub dedicated to funny, charming fanfiction about smart ponies.

  There are only so many rational fics in the world. For this reason, this sub is also for hard science fiction, hard fantasy, and deconstructionist fiction (see the sidebar).

That's why we have those tags. The meaning of "rationalist" is not getting diluted because currently most things posted here are not under the [R] rationalist tag.

** It's always important to remember the difference between /plot/ and /story/. Too often rational fiction is concerned about the plot only, and the narrative as a whole suffers as a result. The story is the emotional undercurrent of the work, and is ultimately the most memorable component.

I hadn't realized it, but now that you've said it that way it makes a lot of sense. Rational fictions /must/ take their premises as far as possible, and to do that they will likely evolve into a Man Versus World plot, with whatever character serving as the antagonist is foremost the ultimate agent of said world.

Surely such story would qualify as rationalist fiction (as long as it's teaching you something, at least).
