I read a one shot a few months ago about the Atlantis expedition where they actually prepared to go a full galaxy away without communications. I believe I read it on AO3. Any help finding this would be appreciated.

** I can only imagine. They must have brought whole disassembled factories, a lot more computing then was actually shown, and about 5 times as many people.

*** It wasn't to that extent, but it did think things through like extra Naquada Gennies, Seedlings, that kind of stuff. They REALLY went into how a colony cut off from earth would survive. I really want to find it so I can see if there was any updates to it.

**** Each Mk 1 Naquadah Generator had an output equivalent to a good sized fission nuclear plant, so there wouldn't be the need for too many more of those - they never came close to hitting cap outside of trying to power the parts of the city that required exponentially more power anyway, and so it wouldn't have helped.

Seedlings or some kind of hydroponics setup makes sense.

But more importantly, they have no way (shown) of making bullets. If there is one thing that a Stargate team needs lots of, it's bullets. Ditto with any equipment that's lost, damaged, or stolen. Modern military hardware can't exactly be put together with a few wrenches and pliers. They'd need some kind of effective construction system.

****** They absolutely would, but that would have required them to ever actually develop energy weapons. They never did.

This admittedly helped against the Replicators, but they could have kept some in circulation, or at least developed handheld railguns - they made ship and stationary emplacements.

But nope, it's P90s, P90s everywhere.

******* There was an SG1 episode where the free Jaffa are disappointed that a weapons shipment from Earth is all P90s, but the humans demonstrate that human weapons are actually much more accurate and deadly. The Goa'uld were more interested in developing intimidating weapons that make big explosions.

Given that nobody had advanced the state of the art in personal energy weapons even to parity with projectile weapons, it would have made more sense to stick with improving rifles and leave personal energy weapons as blue-sky research.

******** I've seen a clip of the scene where they do that demonstration, although not the entire episode (recently enough to remember it). I liked the scene a lot, but I wish the writers hadn't cheated. They had Sam fire the P90 at a swinging log target and it chewed right through the log, basically blew it up. Nothing less than a minigun can do that, so I wish they had stuck with a more realistic demo.

It was still full of awesome, though.

******** For Staff Weapons absolutely, but Zats were the best non-lethal sidearm in the series, and Go'auld Shock Grenades were amazingly useful.

The Kull Plasma Repeater was the best general man-portable weapon in the series. It combined the Armor Piercing and suppression ability of a P90 with the ammo and compactness of a staff.

Why they never made a naquada enhanced C4 for demolotions I have no idea.

********* Agreed about the Zats; one shot to put someone out without the potential side effects of a taser or tranquilizer and two shots to kill makes it pretty darn useful.

The Kull weapons I remember as not really being any more accurate than staff weapons. If they were, given how indestructible the Kull were, SG1 probably wouldn't have stood a chance.

Small naquada explosives would probably just be too expensive to be practical.

Plot armor mostly. Many SG teams did die to them, and one Kull killed entire legions of Jaffa and the Goauld they defended. 4 Kull killed the entire Alpha Site once.

Yeah, about that...

Anubis in season 8ish sends a planet killer asteroid at Earth.

They almost nuke it, then realize it is like 40% naquadah by volume, and nuking it would have made a small nova.

Instead, they hyperspace it through the planet.

So, it's still in the system then right?

And you have functional spaceships?

And it contains several billion metric tons of a material worth more to you than solid platinum?

So, you should probably mine that then.

That's an obscene amount of Naquadah. Like, insane amounts. Enough for centuries of fleet growth and power generation.

*********** I totally remember that, what a waste. Though, given how many naquadah mines the Tau'ri liberated from the Goa'uld, I guess they have enough supply to meet their current demand.
