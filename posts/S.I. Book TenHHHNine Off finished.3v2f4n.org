** I can't cut and paste from Google Docs, apparently.

When you're discussing "The Ritual of the Calling of the Engineer" you mix up Boomer and Brenda. Which confused me for a moment.

** That ending... I completely forgot about how you usually ended these and it managed to catch me by surprise. Wonderful cliff-hanger... but now I want more. >_<

Keep on writing, I'm very much enjoying it. :)

  Wonderful cliff-hanger

I knew where I wanted to end this Book, and I wanted this particular Book-ending enough to override the standard number of chapters - I'm glad my choice paid off. :)

** After some thought, I decided that any good hacker would start counting at 0 instead of 1, and so S.I. has gone through a Great Renumbering.

I've started using live-chat with some helpful folk, and have gotten comfortable enough with them, and with a few other changes to my process, that on the days I have time to write, I can hit more than 3,000 words a day. (Though I'm still averaging rather less.)

I'm told that the first half or so of this Book is kind of slow, but that the second half is distinctly improved.

Coming up soon: Action! Mayhem! Kidnapping! Pirates! Monsters! Kissing! A Six-Fingered Man - no, wait, that's something else. But we do have Lagomorphs of Unusual Size... :)

*** This is may be a slightly difficult question for you to answer, but does Bunny act the way you would act? Or is she a slightly idealized version of yourself where you are less lazy, a better leader, better to working towards set goals, less prone to mistakes, and other basic qualities to make Bunny do better than you'd actually do in your place?

I consider this a tricky question to ask because it involves knowing yourself fairly well and being able to admit that you aren't as 'good' (for a given subjective definition) as you'd hope/try to be before you can say yes or no.

Either way, I've stopped back in Book #5 (now #4) due to wanting to wait for you to build a buffer, and I have 5 books to read!

**** It's the sort of question I love to consider. :)

Bunny has an entirely different set of hormones running through her veins than I do, which have led her to behave differently than I in my own body would in her place. She also has very strong evidence about the nature a Singularity-like event will take, which changes her calculations on which actions should be taken. That said, in Books later than the ones you've read, Bunny makes various mistakes, and goes for counselling and psychotherapy more than once.

I'm doing my best to set her actions to be those I really would take, had my mind gone through similar experiences... but it's very likely that I'm at least slightly over-estimating at least a few of her positive attributes.

And either way, I look forward to your enjoyment of the rest of the story. :)
