Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Sort of a meta-worldbuilding question: When you've finished reading a story, do you like having access to worldbuilding docs related to that story?

*** Honestly? Totally depends. You don't want to release all your secrets if you ever plan to do a sequel, for one. And if the world isn't built very well, showing your documents can be a type of blueprint of incompetence.

I like the Mother of Learning style though. A blog full of worldbuilding information that doesn't spoil anything and helps flesh out an already intriguing magic system

*** The Tolkien approach is nice; it's better to have extraneous loredumps in the back than to have the author feel compelled to tell you all the crap he came up with even if it turns out to be irrelevant to the story. "Dammit, I spent three days modeling the spread of VD through Squivernia's brothel network; you're damn well going to hear about it, if I have to have our hero make asides every five paragraphs!"

** I'm trying to build a world for a D&D campaign and I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

Is there any particular reason an evil hyper-advanced precursor civilisation might

- Suddenly abandon their home universe?

- Leave a whole bunch of their stuff behind?

- Possibly (but not necessarily) involving a war they were having with another universe?

- Ideally allowing them to suddenly return in a dramatic and climactic fashion?

*** Wikipedia has a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_evacuations][list of mass evacuations]] that you might want to look at for inspiration. Ideally, you want an evacuation that happens suddenly, so there's little time to take everything with. Your options for war are a bit limited, because you also don't want the other side to be occupying, presumably. That said, a major biological or chemical attack would probably do it, since it would make the area unsafe for both sides. Alternately, maybe it's not an attack, but the /threat/ of attack, or, as has historically happened sometimes, an area becoming abandoned because of a peace treaty or other agreement.

*** Mines of Moria. They dug too deep/went too far and unearthed some type of great calamity and had to leave in a hurry. Then they do the same thing to their new world and end up hopping back (maybe they have spies in our world to let them know everything's died down, or maybe the player characters accidentally signal to them so they know people are alive).

For the war with an alternate universe: maybe they jumped ship to feint that they had blow themselves up, then continued to fight the war behind the shadows. Once the war is won they come home.

Another idea would be that they went too far trying to research pocket dimension tech or something similar and ended up accidentally trapping their whole civilization in stasis in some cube. The PCs find the cube and meddle with it until a whole ancient civilization pops out

*** Simple- they were never a /precursor/ civilization to begin with. They were from the far future, and intentionally went back in time to set up elaborately-constructed ruins with just enough of their future-tech left behind that it can later be used to reverse-engineer the technology in the first place, thus creating a stable time loop.

This also serves to explain how there could be a very advanced precursor civilization that hasn't had a significant impact on modern life- they intentionally didn't leave behind anything that would seriously alter the course of history.

Plus, it makes for a cool reveal, and it definitely leaves the possibility of them returning suddenly on the table.

*** This is basically what happened to the Dwemer in the Elder Scrolls universe. They performed an experiment with the heart of a god, and the moment they touched it with their tools every member of their species on the plane of existence vanished. They left behind everything, were definitely malevolent towards other races, and their ruins are full of inscrutable, still-operating contraptions which do things thought impossible by the surface world.

The only clue about where they went is a speculation that they were "subsumed into the skin of the Numidium." The Numidium is a sort of artificial deity in the form of a giant robot, and its activation causes the same temporal phenomenon as what happens when a player character is active in their world. It's called a Dragon Break, and it's said all possibilities are both true and false during one, though the timeline does solidify after.

*** Some thoughts, since I'm not sure if this is D&D fantasy or D&D fantasy in space:

A very specific kind of Magically Self-Replicating Targeted Curse meant to infect and kill off the civilization's race that would just so happen to meet your criteria.

Once unleashed, it would wreak havoc rapidly through say, 40% of their army/population and upon realization, they used their experimental universe-hopping to get the fuck out. Some percentage managed to get out and isolate themselves.

The experimental universe-hopping would have restrictions on how much they could bring and how quickly they could do so, and the curse is spreading.

The main civilization was at war with a slightly weaker civilization. The main civilization focused on say, technological advances, while the weaker civilization focused on biological advances. The civilization gradually choked out the weaker civilization through some means, then won a crucial victory that essentially sealed the other's fate.

Since this would have been a war to the death, the weaker civilization went MADD and the remnant forces sacrificed themselves in the final battle. The news of their victory and successful genocide spread throughout the civilization when after a week or so, the Curse hit. The armies/messengers were unaware that the remnant forces were a means to deliver the Curse, a spell so extreme since its cost they were only willing to take once all was lost. (The cost should be the guaranteed end of their race. The curse also affects their race)

Since they didn't expect the Curse, they allowed it to spread to a good percentage during the victory parades or whatnot.

You could work out the Curse's exact mechanics based on your setting.

It magically spreads, but its self-replication slowly degrades over time. After some time, it has devolved to the point where they can easily deal with its effects.

*** They were forced to leave the area due to the terms of the peace treaty with the other precursor civilization that they were fighting. The two agreed to leave it as an unoccupied buffer area. As for why they would leave stuff behind, it depends on what the stuff was for. Maybe it was too hard to move, or is now obsolete tech.

** Here's a few fun fantasy creatures I've been thinking about, comments welcome. Some of them aren't original, and some aren't fleshed out yet, but I've had fun thinking of all of them. This is very much a rough draft and there are bound to be mistakes.

*Drop Bear*

A catlike quadruped about the size of a dog. Its body resembles a panther, and it has a long tail and non-retractable claws. It has a face more like a koala, and has a powerful oversized jaw. It typically makes use of its fantastic climbing abilities to scale trees. It then drops down on its prey, killing it instantly with a bite to the neck or throat. It's like a mix of a hyena, cat, dog, and bear.

*Slayer snail/speedy snail/gonzales' snail/six second snail/swift snail etc*

A giant gastropod that camouflages itself. Capable of extreme speed in quick bursts, but lacks stamina. Has a lamprey-like mouth, filled with teeth on all angles. There are snail types and slug types. Snail types camouflage as rocks, plants or bushes (stone-shell, bushy shell etc) and have dozens of centipede legs. Slug types camouflage in bushes, as roots or logs, as dirt, or underground. Slug types have no shell, are much longer, and locomote as a snake does. Both make a hissing/screeching sound as they pursue their prey.

*Land octopus*

Effectively an octopus adapted for the land. They have an actual internal skeleton. The skeleton inside their arms is effectively similar to a spine or a tail, with the addition of extra rods of bone that can lock the vertebrae together in order form a straight arm, useful for added strength and leverage. They are about the size of a dog. They breathe air and have iron based blood, but have poor stamina. They still have the shapeshifting and colour changing abilities of a normal octopus. Their skin is voluminous and loosely attached, and possesses and integrated layer of muscle to aid in its configuration. They have an overdeveloped beak compared to normal octopuses, more akin to that of a terror bird than anything else. The beak can shoot out very quickly like the jaw of a goblin shark or a dragonfly nymph. The jaw muscles are very strong, and some species are venomous. They have primitive feet, with both suction cups and settae. They can extrude prehensile hair through their skin, and change the colour of it. This hair is only mobile enough to serve as configurable camouflage, and is not a weapon. Some species have claws and toes, and some species have mandibles.

*Trolls*

In fiction, trolls regenerate and are weak to fire. The same is true here. They regenerate quickly due to their plant-based nature (and a bit of magic) and are weak to fire due to same. The skin of mature trolls hardens into wood-like flesh. Many species grow leaves and twigs. They can range from the size of a man to the size of 3 men. They have 4 limbs, wicked claws, and are comfortable on 4 legs or 2 in equal measure.

*Slimes*

Slimes are a parasitic organism that infests the stomach of their victim. They generally start off very tiny, attached to edible material. They are then ingested, and cling to the stomach walls. Immune to practically any stomach acid, they are free to steal sustenance from the creature they're inhabiting. Eventually, they grow so large that they completely stop their host from gaining anything from food at all. The host then starves to death, and the slime eats its way through them from the inside out. Upon exposure to air/sunlight, a reaction builds up in the slime and they explode into many gobbets of a slime and spores. Thus the life cycle begins anew. Some species might do a xenomorph.

*Onehol/cloacan/fortran* (I thought about calling it an onahole but that's too far)

This is an animal that takes the concept of a cloaca being an “everything hole” and the defensiveness of a turtle up to the highest degree. Their body is almost entirely encased in their shell, with only one opening. To sense the world around them, they have eyes on stalks and antennae that they stick out of the hole. To move, they have six insectoid legs that can be deployed and fully hidden. They have a single hole, through which they eat, breathe, drink, mate, urinate and defecate. Internally there is more separation between these functions, and it often extends these tubes slightly out of the hole. At the end of each leg they have four toes in a cross formation, with sharp claws on the ends and strong muscles. They are quite slow. They also have a powerful regenerative ability, and can stockpile enough energy and are so efficient that they can remain holed up in their shell for a preposterous amount of time - more than long enough for any predator to get bored. If they are injured, they can fully regenerate any body part in a matter of days - so long as they're still alive. Some species have spiky or poisonous shells. Some species have a hatch that they can slide into place to seal their hole, while others have hard holeparts that form an aperture. It is an extremely hardy creature.

*Razor weaver*

These social spiders are pack hunters. Rather intelligent, but not sentient. They are about the size of a housecat. In addition to standard webbing, they also possess the ability to weave what is basically piano wire. Razor sharp, this thread can cut through all manner of things. They typical hunting strategy consists of setting up a web, then running the prey into it. Razor thread is practically invisible, and by the time the victim sees it it is usually too late and they promptly get sliced to pieces by their own momentum. They have lungs, iron based blood, and a skeleton.

*Razorback*

An omnivorous quadruped, this animal is a persistence hunter. Razor sharp blade line its body all over. An anticoagulant oozes out near the base of the blades and covers them. It typically rushes its prey and then waits for it to bleed out. A cross between a canine and a pig, varies from dog size to larger. Sometimes forms groups. Lacking in strength compared to some, but possesses great stamina.

*Corpse creeper*

A mobile, predatory vine. It has eyes, but smells and hears through its skin. It anchors onto dead animals and uses their skeleton as its own. By having a frame to work with, its body effectively acts as muscles, and it becomes much more capable of movement and action.

*Copse creeper*

Like a corpse creeper, but smarter. Instead of using actual animal skeletons, they make their own skeleton out of sticks and branches they gather themselves.

*Land whale*

Rather than being a whale on land, this whale IS land. These massive creatures are plant-animal hybrids. Using the plant-like growths on their back, they soak up the rays of the sun. They can range greatly in size, even growing to the size of large islands. And indeed, they often might as well be, with entire ecosystems regularly springing up on their backs. They are often on the move, and also eat anything they can get their mouth on. Curiously, they rarely submerge.

*Hydra / Dehydra*

A serpentine lizard that consists of 8 heads on long necks, meeting at a central body that houses other organs and orifices. It has no legs, or tail or anything, because why would it need it? It's already got 8 heads. The hydra subspecies injects venom through its fangs that will liquify the target, while the dehydra injects anticoagulant and at the same time uses its hollow fangs to suck out blood and other fluid - it does this supernaturally fast, to the point that the target can often die of dehydration in under a minute. They have a tough muzzle, often covered in armoured plating, that they use as stand ins for feet.

*Chamelee*

Sentient lizardmen. They have 4 eyes, 4 limbs, and walk mostly upright. They have a somewhat prehensile tail that naturally curls up in a spiral. They have hands/feet like that of normal chameleons, but with greater separation between each finger. They have the same vocal capabilities as normal chameleons, which means their language is communicated via colour changing. The pattern of the colours, the location of them, and the sequence thereof all have an effect on the meaning, making chamelee language quite complex. They are omnivorous, and have somewhat humanlike teeth, only generally more sharp. They have a slight hunched over posture. They have two large, highly mobile eyes on the sides of their heads, and two smaller eyes at the front that are better for detail and focus. They have short, somewhat blunt claws that are non-retractable. They are slightly physically weaker and less dexterous than humans. Because they are sentient, they can use their colour changing abilities deliberately as camouflage. Chamelee performance art often consists of various uses of their colour changing ability. They have a barbed tongue that has paralyzing nematocysts on it, and they can extend it with great range and speed. They have a pouch on their belly. They have extremely good vision, and especially potent ability to see and distinguish colour and other wavelengths of light. They have only average hearing.

*Let me know what you think! :)*

*** All in all I had fun thinking about your creations, thanks for sharing them!

*Drop Bear*- An ambush hunter that I could see in a jungle, other than that a pretty standard mishmash of normal animals.

*Six second snail*- This would be hell if they were a pack hunting hive mind, or if not a hive mind than a collective like ants or wasps but if they were they might end up having to move a lot due to over eating an area.

*Land octopus*- With a internal skeleton it would mess with their shapeshifting? Terror bird sized beak may get in the way of moving? While a terror bird shaped beak should probably be alright. Seeing that they have low stamina I see them being a lot like Drop Bears and hanging in trees or being like a Trapdoor Spider.

If that's the case I can see how a large beak and a better ability to grapple would be useful. Possibly using the over large beak to dig?

*Trolls*- I read this and I think giant plant bears lol. Wicked claws and something that switches around between four and two legs.

*Slimes*- A horribly slow and painful way to die. I see magic and medicine dedicated towards eliminating slimes from the body. Also this being used in warfare as a bioweapon if cures are costly and or impractical to implement on a large scale.

I read "spores" and I think plant and fungus. So eh, I got nothing much other than that. Oh how would they develop underground without sunlight or possibly whatever they react with in the air? Or underwater? If they react in some way to water than fill the stomach with water and throw up, if with any air than purposefully swallow air and then burp.

*Fortran*- A scavengers that eats rotting animals or is a herbivore. Could possibly inhabit any environments where a turtle/tortoise can be found: tropics, deserts and the sea. Basically an extreme testudine like you said lol. I have no idea how a poisonous shell would work. Poison spikes? Then how does the spike get the poison? A poison coating? How is the shell coated, and is it all the time or only when in danger?

*Razor weaver*- [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=Nq8fgEZIH-g][Piano wire]] seems legit. Would they cut themselves though?

*Razorback*- I imagine a porcupine combined with a dog? Though with possibly shorter thicker quills? Unless you mean it literally has thin edges sticking out from its skin all over, in which case I'd love to hear how they keep the numerous blades/edges sharp.

*Corpse creeper*- A plant that plays at being an animal by taking the bones of animals. Matter that makes up thorns covering the teeth to keep them in place, parts of the skin hardens into bark plates, the nose and parts of the ear staying much the same as the original vine to be able to smell and hear.

Though I gotta ask if it grows organs in the rib cage and such or if its just a big Venus trap acid bath inside?

*Corpse creeper^{2}*- I mean... bones are typically harder than wood or anything other than what could possibly be found. Plus there's the added bonus of the inherit symmetry found in skeletons while this plant will have to start from scratch if it wants equally long limbs. Unless its a shambling mass of vines, branches and twigs.

*Land whale*- Do they group up in pods and make moving island chains lol? Also breeding. Breeding HAS to be underwater (how else would it?) so everytime they get frisky it's a salt water bath for anything hitching a ride.

*Hydra*- Eight headed snake. How big? And its eight heads possibly sending a bunch of commands to one body. Then there's eight heads smelling/tasting eight times with its tongues. Plus it'd have a harder time going into burrows with eight heads, assuming of course that it is normal sized.

#+begin_quote
  The hydra subspecies injects venom through its fangs that will liquify the target
#+end_quote

That's an acid.

Blood sucking sounds like a good way to get disease (think mosquito or flea) while on the side it involves filtering all that water from the blood to get at the stuff you actually want. A fast metabolism is not a snake thing. The use of some heads for walking is lol

*Chamelee*- Seen these. Or at least something similar in a story a while back, they were interesting. Yours have the added kick of being based off of chameleons with the added kickes of stretchy poison tongue, belly pouch and tetra eyed.

Again very fun to think about for me!😁
