** "Are you?"

Will this stop the theories that robber is the assassin?

I think not.

Edit: how much damage could do a pocket sun to the tower?

*** A lot, we haven't seen the last of the sun THE SUN THE SUN THE SUN

Excuse, that got the better of me all of the sudden. Anyway, i doubt it will be used against the tower itself. This battle of Callow and the tower is one of institutions and long lasting change. Merely bringing down the tower won't change anything. Praes will just rebuild.

Its more probably that it will be used vs The winter king.

***** I don't Thief is a transitional name like Squire, Apprentice or Heiress

Though she could maybe claim a new one like Sabbah

*** If anything it's evidence for it. Assassin can change her appearance, so the fact that Thief met her and didn't recognize Robber no longer means anything.
