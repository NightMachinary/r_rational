** Okay, I'm calling this one out. Why haven't Daimen, a highly experienced and competent treasure hunter, even thought about the underground before, until Zach of all people pointed it out? It would be one thing if the jungle didn't have a known and extensive underground system, but he doesn't have even that excuse - from the wording of the exposition it seems that the Dungeon-like underground of the jungle is uncharted, but hardly unknown.

**** To be fair. This is more of a they tracked it by tracking the movements of the last people to have it, who died in the jungle. I think they assumed it would be above ground because there was no real reason for it to be underground. When someone mentioned underground he scolded himself for not thinking too hard on it, but even in the end its not really deep underground, it is in a place they already checked. Assuming treasure = underground simply because it is a more attractive option as a hiding place is really stupid, and probably not very realistic.

***** That explains why they bother searching aboveground at all despite Awan-Temti's little crusade being an old history, but doesn't explain why they don't even think about the underground. Stuff he carried could end up underground for a large variety of reasons, like the emperor carrying it there himself in a vain attempt to hide from the dangers of the jungle, or even simply being washed underground by rainwater during a rain season (it is, after all, a jungle). And these reasons should be even more apparent to a qualified treasure hunter.

******* In order of the chapter's progression, my three guesses were actually that:

1) either the drakes kept relocating the orb when they saw yet another human party approaching;

2) stored and protected it in their nest because it gave some magical bonus (increase monster production by x%, for instance);

3) or was swallowed by the hydra, making it bigger and stronger than normal.

Also, I too agree on the Idiot Ball.

He could either scrap the ritual and say that the maps they have of the underground are from previous explorations of it or keep the ritual and claim that it's a new ritual that they've only developed sometime since their last attempt at exploring the underground. Daimen could still be annoyed that he hadn't thought of the underground - just make it clear that he's annoyed that he hadn't thought to re-explore the underground earlier /that day/ rather than annoyed that he hadn't /ever/ thought to explore the underground.

*** Because he was using logic. It was highly unlikely that Awan-Temti got separated from his retinue. He was not stupid enough to do it on his own, and it would be too strange coincidence if some powerful creature carried away specifically him. And for all his train to go underground for some strange reason? You see, Daimen is not genre savvy. He don't know he is in the book. If he would know he is in the book it would make underground pretty obvious. However he erroneously thought he is in the real life, and in the real life archaeologists usually base their plans on evidences and logic.

Previously they needed to search underground and on the surface. This time they have Zorian's detection ability, so now they don't need to go on the surface at all, they can detect the orb on the surface from just below the surface.

I also think it's natural enough that Daimen forgot to check underground - though he was right that it was a significant mistake. If I were trying to find where someone deliberately hid a treasure in their house, I would look for trapdoors and basements, but if I were hunting all over the house for my keys, I would just focus on working out where I'd been. Daimen has spent his efforts narrowing down where the emperor fell, and it didn't previously occur to him that the orb might actually be hidden from view rather than just lost.

Then go from that assumption to months of searching a jungle when you've already discounted the underground as an option, and it's not unreasonable.

if simply living in mana rich environments led to higher resistance, then living in Cyoria would be perfect (but this is not the case). plus ambient mana is mostly poisonous anyways so we can assume (and I think already confirmed?) that all things with souls have resistance

though I guess the core question is where this resistance stems from. it might as well be because of life force. I should check again the worldbuilding pages to see if this was mentioned specifically

********* Chapter 51:

#+begin_quote
  If he remembered correctly, life force was simply a special type of personal mana that wasn't part of a mage's mana pool and was used exclusively by the body to keep itself living and resist foreign magics. Since the amount of life force rarely varied much between humans, and couldn't be used to power spells, the academy instructors hadn't spoken much about it.
#+end_quote

The high mana density which comes from the Hole is the reason why Cyoria is a thing. It /is/ the perfect place for beings who either require or make use of vast amounts of mana. However, I don't think that strictly speaking leads to a higher resistance. Evolutionary factors aside, high mana density doesn't give you higher amount of life force, just enables it. Highly magical creatures need to hide in the depths of the Dungeon or they will wither away, and as Zorian conveniently mentioned in that paragraph, human life force levels are mostly the same.

Also, ambient mana is toxic only if used as-is to cast spells. Mages are constantly assimilating it into their own reserves to boost their regen.

Completely decimating the population before they can summon the hydra would be optimal.

They're only dealing with 100 odd barely sapient lizards that are incapable of using magic. A small elite task force is easy to organize, especially because Alanic is in charge of said elite task force (battle priests).

If facilitated teleportation isn't possible, he could have used a simulacrum. Have his simulacrum shapeshift into some small robust creature, and throw the shapeshifted simulacrum into the cave. Shift back into human form, collapse or bar the cave entrance, and gate in the rest of the team.

Zorian definitely knows how to teleport, so that wasn't even a consideration.

There's no restriction going out of the cave because Zorian has already been to locations in the vicinity that are outside the cave, so distance won't be a limiting factor. There's a potential restriction going into the cave because we haven't gotten the details of what constitutes having been to a location.

Anyways, the point /was/ infiltration. The whole reason the battle happened was to gain entrance into the cave. So have the entire group throw in the irritant gas and have Zorian hide. While they draw the battle elsewhere, Zorian could teleport/gate in. When the drakes realize imminent defeat and retreat, keep their attention while Zorian explores the cave.

** seeing the soul-bounded drakes makes me wonder though, what would happen if he soul bounded with a thing (ive been insistent about the grey hunter so ill say something else) for instance the hydra (haha). what would happen one the restarts ? would the binding continue ? what would happen at the end, would the hydra leave with them ? would the guardian see that as too much alteration for one soul to go through ? (if ever) Of course the hydra is just an example.

*** While it possible the drakes are soul-bonded, the word bonded alone usually meant paired, sexually bonded, or blood relative. But yeah, interesting course of thought there. If we take Briam's word, soul-bonding gives better efficiency for some spell, outright cheat for summoning, and it feel a little bit weird. But Briam also told that bonding required a ritual. Can Zorian subdue the creatures so they can do ritual voluntarily?

*** The real danger of any soul modification is that Zorian's already-broken marker might get further broken and stop looping him. Too risky.

Zach's intact marker, on the other hand, would almost certainly intervene and reset the loop if he tried it.

** Awesome chapter!

Following the line of reasoning that Orissa and her family might be interested in Daimen because of his mind magic, it seems possible that Zorian, newly announced as Daiman's prodigious brother, may come under some romantic scrutiny :P

** There was a bit of odd word-choice I noticed. At one point, Zorian says that he's been "spamming" the Key detection request to his soul marker.

But "spam" and "spamming" are very Internet related terms, referring to the Monty Python skit about spam, and the annoying advertising on Usenet.

And since the Ikosians don't have an Internet, I found it a little jarring to use Zorian use that term.

*** To be fair, a lot of words are like that, but they now have independent and useful meanings. Especially words derived from mythological/historical names and places. "Spam" may be of newer vintage, making it more jarring, but it's no worse in principal than something like "titanic" or "mercurial".

*** Not the first time it's happened. I'm pretty sure Zorian mentioned "tanking" in terms of having a shield withstand an attack, and I don't think this world has tanks yet. (Golems, yes, but not tanks.)

Considering they technically don't even speak English (and their verbal and academic languages are apparently completely different without the readers being aware for 60+ chapters), just take the dialogue as how they would have sounded in modern English. Interpreted through Zorian's mind, since word choice is kinda similar between individual characters.
