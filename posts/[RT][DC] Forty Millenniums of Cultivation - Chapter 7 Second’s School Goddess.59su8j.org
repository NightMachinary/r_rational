*Synopsis*

“Even if this universe is truly nothing more than a brutal, bloody, shadowy forest, we Cultivators will burn all that we have just to give off a single weak flickering spark in the darkness!

No matter how weak each spark is, how short-lived, how small... As long as the sparks flow unabated, then one day one of those sparks will light some tinder, and that tinder shall light some fallen branches, and those branches shall set ablaze each and every last tree of the forest!

In the end, even the smallest sparks will eventually set the shadowy forest ablaze, and illuminate the whole world!”

*Nice Synopsis from [[/r/Rational]]* In FMoC, sweeping social change has changed the landscape of the Xianxia world forever. Secret sects have developed from being merely schools of kung fu to being corporation-like entities, with grandmasters and elders becoming equivalent to CEOs and Board Chairmen of modern-day corporations. Sufficiently advanced martial arts is the flavor of the setting; martial arts is interwoven into the entire world.

Schools of fine cuisine teach their chefs methods for cooking their food with magical fire and secret techniques for punching the flavor from one food into another.Universities host martial arts tournaments instead of football games. Scientists debate if the fundamental unit of Chi is a Chi Particle or Chi Wave, and have built Large Essence Colliders to test their theories on the nature of Chi. Magical physics is a study in and of itself!

The military uses high-powered enchanted swords that home in on the spiritual markers of enemy souls, rather than drone strikes, and invests countless crystal credits into researching military applications of magic.And all over the world, everyday practitioners of magic use their abilities to create new technologies, working alongside regular humans. Thanks to the integration of common humanity with the magic of the Cultivators, all sorts of wondrous things have been created, including healing pods, magical prostheses that can even replace the entire body in extreme scenarios, and even transhuman methods of capturing lost souls and bringing them back to life- all things which were once only available to the magic-users, but which have since become available to all, magic users or not. Heck, they even built a magic internet for muggles and wizards alike!
