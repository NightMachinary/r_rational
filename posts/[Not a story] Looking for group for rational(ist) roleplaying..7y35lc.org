One of the things I have enjoyed a lot over the last couple of years is roleplaying in the format of play-by-post. Most commonly it takes a form similar to pen-and-paper with the main difference being that it's done on a written form which, in my experience, allows players to go much more in depth with their characters thoughts, feelings and demeaner. It also allows people to play cross time zones and with vastly different schedules although it have a tendency to be pretty slow.

When I have been reading the various stories on this reddit I've been unable to stop thinking about how fun it would be to be in one of those. What would I have done if I were thrust into a world with vastly different (and rigid) rules? How would I have used a time loop for?

I've had good experiences with similar games in the worm setting and think it would be a lot of fun to play a character in a setting similar to that in one of the hard fantasy settings that are found on this subreddit, or a completely new one with different rules to be explored. Anyone interested in playing or running such a thing?

--------------

Edit:

I suggest that those who want to be the Destiny Maestro/GameMaster write a pitch for their games, either here or on the [[https://discord.gg/DCcHUX][#Looking_for_group]] on the discord, people create characters for the games they think are interesting, and GM's pick which characters they think will suit their game best. [[/u/GaBeRockKing]] have some suggestions for places to play the games further down.

A pitch could include the basic outline of the world, what the players would be doing, the degree of which the story is preplanned vs. how much player, expectations for player/characters, GM's wants/expectations for the game, focus area of the game, tone of the game, system used.


** I'd be interested; it's been a while since I've done play-by-post, and I'm missing it.

That being said, reddit isn't the best platform for it. Maybe we could gather players here, then move to [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/][sufficientvelocity]] or [[https://forums.spacebattles.com][spacebattles]] instead for the actual RP? I know there's a lot of overlap between [[/r/rational]] users and people in the SB/SV/AH/^{^{^{^{QQ}}}} crowd.

**** QQ is [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/][Questionable Questing]].

It split off from SB before SV did. There is an overlap in the userbases of the these three sites, but QQ's is definitely the smallest.

Most significantly, there is a distinct lack of a puritan administration, so a lot of NSFW or boderline-NSFW content that would go to SB or SV, if it were allowed, gets posted on QQ instead. (You need to be logged-in to access QQ's NSFW sections).

** I'd be interested, though it's already becoming apparent there's probably too many people interested in being players for this to work as any normal game. So maybe set up a discord or something and hopefully there will be a 1:4/5 ratio of people who want to GM to those who want to play and people can split off into groups of manageable sizes.

** I occasionally run a play-by-post murder mystery roleplay in a futuristic setting with a few of its own "rules," in that certain fictional technologies are available. In terms of rationality, I did my best to write a "smart" killer, and to set up the clues in such a way that the players can systematically eliminate suspects and solve the mystery through careful observation and deduction (or, in the case of the killer's player, manipulate and mislead everyone to their advantage). The game lasts for two IRL weeks and players can post at their leisure. It's not exactly what you described, but is that something you (or anyone else here) would be interested in?

****** Yeah, it's the same mystery every time with a different player group. It's pretty complicated (comprehensive timelines for each player, a map, shitload of clues, etc), so it would be prohibitively time-consuming to write a new one each time.

If you'd like, I can PM you the main game document. That should give you a sense of what it's like without spoiling anything.

**** I like your suggestions, but I don't plan on running it again until late spring at the earliest, so it's probably too early to make a formal pitch. I'm just gauging interest at this stage. Each game requires 10 players so it's always useful to know of a few people who might want to play.

** It's something I'd be interested in: the story I'm writing at the moment is based on OC freeform roleplaying that I've been doing /basically/ for the last 15 years, previously over MSN and more recently over google docs. Problem is I might have a hard time with immersion given the setting (i.e. I'm really fussy), and I tend to prefer character-based stories than munchkining-based stories.

**** Not sure I'd be interested in /running/ a game, I mean I /could/, but the only game I'd be interested in /running/ would be a very self-centered one concerning my urban fantasy setting, and that's not nearly well-developed to allow character creation or proper munchkinry: really you need a fanfic setting. I /suppose/ I could do Stargate...

That said, I do have experience GMing nWoD and a couple of "single session pickup systems" IRL and I like to think I do quite well at it. I'm not sure how much of the GM role transfers to a play-by-post setting?

Really I'm not sure I have time to run anything. If anyone wants to invite me to one of theirs feel free. (And thus, inertia reigned supreme)

** I'm really interested by this ! But reddit is probably not the best place for it. Generally I see such roleplay occasionally in some forums, as side games, since it allows this kind of format.

However I don't know if there exists any forum dedicated to that. If you find any, be sure to tell us !
