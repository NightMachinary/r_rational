Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** *Seeking: Eutopias*

I'm poking around with a new story idea, aiming at being more hopeful than my last one. So I'm trying to think up ways to exceed reedspacer's lower bound. I'm starting by jotting down the existing settings I can think of, and what they bring to the table. Can you suggest any ideas I may be neglecting?

--------------

- Iain Banks' "The Culture" (space! Immortality if you want it!) [bleah bored modosophonts] ?The Minds, drug glands?
- "Thousand Tales" (uploading! Immortality! Custom VRs and avatars! Important jobs to be done!) [bleah techno-primitivists, anti-upload terrorists] ?AIs?
- "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect" (uploading! Immortality! VRs! safety!) [bleah boredom, bleah nihilism] ?PI's value-function?
- "Friendship is Optimal" (uploading & immortality & VRs! Custom communities!) [bleah constant nudging towards ponydom] ?CelestAI?
- Star Trek (space exploration! Strange aliens! Cute aliens!) [bleah hostile aliens, bleah wars]
- the "Bitchin Society" from Doctorow's "Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom" (clone-revival immortality!)
- Spider Robinson's telepathic future (a culture made out of sane people!)
- Elf Sternberg's "Pendor" (Space! Ringworld! Cute aliens!)
- Scott Alexander's "Archipelago" (liberal values! Communities for all sorts of folks!)
- "The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in 8 Easy Steps" (space! Easy to start!)
- Varley's "Eight Worlds" (Space! Custom bodies & memory-backup immortality!) [bleah Earth being off-limits]
- Eclipse Phase (space! Tech! Uploading & immortality! Important jobs to be done (as part of Firewall)!) [bleah Titans, exsurgents, corp-states, people stuck in clanking masses] ?Prometheans?
- "Orion's Arm" (Space! Uploading and personal mental upgrading! Strange aliens!) [lots of bleahs: Queen of Pain, perversities, blights, etc] ?Higher-level minds?
- Disneyland (fun! Cute people!) [bleah capitalist-derived exclusivity]
- Oz, ruled by Ozma (fun! Safe! cute/strange nonhuman people!)
- James Cameron's "Avatar" (glowy plants & animals! A close-knit community!) [bleah techno-primitivism, bleah hostile militaries, bleah conflicts]
- "Ready Player One' (fun!) [bleah almost all non-VR life]
- some depictions of heaven (immortality! community!) [bleah exclusivity]
- the Harry Potter wizarding world (a "zeroth world" better-than-first-world society!) [bleah dementors, racism, etc]

*** Don't forget Greg Egan's far-future novels, which feature universal immortality, uploading, and generally enlightened societies with very little conflict. Could be tough to set a story in that sort of setting, though- unless, like Egan, you're mostly just using it as a backdrop for clever thought experiments.

Another, more ambiguously utopian setting would be the pre-Melding Plague Yellowstone system from Alastair Reynolds' novels- which had a post-scarcity economy, ubiquitous transhumanism, and life extension, but also had psychopathic AIs, people trapped in "voluntary tyrannies", and which ultimately collapsed horrifically.

***** Hard to answer for Greg Egan - many of his stories take specific elements or pieces of terminology from each other, but they don't build up into a single setting. (For one thing, the Earth would have been physically destroyed at least twice.)

Immortality! Uploading! Self-modification and copying, with the attendant existential mindfucks - except in stories where it's just normal. Space travel but no FTL, so people and cultures 10,000 years old with all the stability that implies. Post-scarcity, by the high standards of the main characters. (my favourite: in /Incandescence/, one character's request for enough energy to boost a 1kg supercomputer to relativistic speeds is described as "on the edge of politeness".) A taboo around exponential growth is mentioned sometimes, which might explain how they've managed to not use up any stars over the millenia, but it's unclear if this is something that everyone keeps to or just the characters who bring it up. No super-AI by authorial fiat - one story mentions a "General Intelligence Theorem" stating that all minds of at least human intelligence can solve the same class of problems, and the only real upgrades past that point are in speed and memory space. Ditto for aliens, when they exist.

** I'm working along writing a VRMMO fiction that focuses on a small company that (almost accidentally) creates the first true VR, when they try to build one up around an AI alternative. Mostly going to be a bunch of connected stories about the dev teams building the world and testing different aspects, formed into an overall narrative. There's a lot of Westworld-style ideas I want to apply, and character building I have ideas for, but I don't have a /solid/ outline, really. I mostly just want some fun fluffy writing to put in the rotation of my more serious/drama writing stuff.

*** As someone who generally hates furry stuff:

Most furry stuff is in the "funny animals" style, rather than actual anthropomorphized animal style. Most of the weird and strange things about animals get sanded away to make them more appealing to humans. It's much easier to tell visually though, and in terms of text, I'll tend to immediately bounce from any story with anthro animals just because it's so likely to be furry stuff that I'd rather not bother.

(This is pretty common for people who have exposure to fetish stuff that they don't like; if someone gets pregnant in a story, they're much more likely to assume that this is fetishistic than just someone getting pregnant as part of the story in a non-fetish way, and they're leave before the assumed fetish stuff happens. So you've got that working against you.)

As for how to predict whether or not something is fetish material, and therefore disguise fetish material as non-fetish material ... a lot of it is vocabulary, and some of it is just the attention and focus of the prose. Fetish vocabulary often mimics that of erotica in its descriptions of the object of fetish, which for furry stuff is, e.g. tails, paws, fur, etc. All that stuff then gets a lot of description and mention in the prose, much more than you would expect of a non-fetish version. The near-constant reminders are a big signal.

I personally think it's pretty doomed. Furries are a well-known group, and most people will just (correctly) assume that you're a furry if you're writing about anthro animals, regardless of what's in the text itself.

*** The most important piece of advice I know is to imagine dropping humans in place of your furry characters; if the story still makes sense, then it's obvious that it's furry fiction instead of fiction containing some kind of anthropomorphic animal. There are plenty of ways around that: fantasy furries as another kind of elf/dwarf/orc/etc; SF with geneered critters; urban fantasy with shapeshifters; modern social commentary ala Zootopia; and more.

(Amateur authours have been asking similar questions for years about their favoured meta-genres, like the decades-old transformation story mailing list.)

*** I think also avoiding the standard "sexy" fursonas will help: so all dogs/wolves/foxes are out. As well as Lucario, Gardevoir, and Renamon.

Why do you want it to be furry specifically? Could you do it "feral" style, like Animals of Farthing Wood, Watership Down, or The Rats of NIMH? If so, then depending on your universe, you could even pass it off as fanfiction of one of the above.

***** Yeah, unfortunately I think if I was reading a transhumanist story and the main character was a wolf-human and the love interest was a fox-human I'd have the furry alarm bells ring. I'd probably still give the story a good chance but I'm not super opposed to furries - I mean it's very much not my thing at all in a sexy way, but if the story's about anthro creatures but otherwise is interesting, whatevs.

I think if you did werewolves that would be fine, though, as long as it stayed clear of the really reviled furry tropes. (Being: "normal human waking up transformed into a furry and being super into it", "sex freely available", "everyone is really sexy").

If you want to do it with GM, could they perhaps be a bit horrific? I'm not sure if you've read /The Hunger Games/ but in the third book there's a character who's been surgically modified to look like a cat and it's described in a very "uncanny valley" type of way.

The other way is to literally sneak a catgirl or two into a story. So have a cast of, I don't know, one person in a robot drone body, someone who inhabits a swarm of tiny bee robots, one person in a natural human body (who is super looked down upon for being boring, natch), a cyborg, someone who has transformed themself into an elephant, and a cat person.

******* The snippet doesn't get far enough into the story for me to judge whether it's in the "furry valley" or not, unfortunately. I think the premise seems interesting/intriguing.

I also think life is too short to worry about shit like this. If it'll make you happy, write your furry story and don't try to hide it, if it's good people here will enjoy it.

#+begin_quote
  Which of the MC's possible reactions to the transformation would ring alarm bells?
#+end_quote

It's more a writing style thing? That said: if the MC doesn't take the transformation as anything other than very, very weird and disturbing, it's going to seem furry. Like, in a furry story I imagine the MC being all "this is weird... but having a tail is neat!" and then doing some random wish fulfillment stuff with the tail or pretending to be a sick puppy and having cute girls pet it, etc.

I'm trying to think of an analogy, and just imagine you were reading a story and they spend a /lot/ of time describing the feet of the characters, and take care to mention shoes even in passing. There's also a scene where one character helps the other put the shoe on their uniform (or something) which seems to be described in excessive detail.

Unless you're into feet, it'll be jarring and make you wonder if something's going on.

But again: write the damn story you want to write. Fill it with yiffing if you want, and honestly you'd probably get a bigger audience on a furry fandom website than on this subreddit. And regardless, if you're good, you'll help make the community here more diverse which can only be a good thing!

******* If I had to give you one suggestion, it's that people are very willing to accept furries /as long as they aren't called that./ As long as you call them monsters, as long as you give them weird names or add decorators to their species, as long as you keep in mind that "monster" is just code for "stacked furry" and therefore the furryness is already baked in, you don't have to worry about anything.

Look at [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20364/chimera][Chimera,]], the MC just goes full furry and it doesn't come off as furry. As long as you stay away from the /language/ of furry culture, you should have a wide latitude to crib the /aesthetics./

*** Abuse the rationalist part of:

#+begin_quote
  Genre Savviness: characters are familiar with common genre tropes and try to avoid or exploit them.
#+end_quote

So a cat girl - or her companions - would make jokes about her being a cat girl, and she would intentionally act in defiance of those tropes. Make the non-rationalist characters behave in ways where they "don't get it" on all sides of the spectrum (e.g. both overly furry and overly anti-furry).

** I've been writing a NSFW Gamer/MGE story over at QQ these past few months. I've tried putting in some rational elements (examining motives, self-reflection, communication) and now I've reached the point where I need to straighten out some of the infamous knots presented in the original setting.

The biggest problem I'd found when writing was pointed out by the readers: is KC's setting supposed to be grim? Some of the posters got a spat or two about it.

I figured that KC's intent was to make the MGE universe perverse, first and foremost. Consistency and implications didn't matter so much until people pointed it out to him. So trying to find organization in that setting is an exercise in futility -- and that's okay.

It's only a problem when working the MGE into a story.

But since the setting I'm writing in is supposed to be based on the MGE, I'll need to consider those problems.

--------------

One of the questions I'd seen was if monsters should be people.

I'd say, yes, if “people” means “sentient, intelligent being,” and no if “people” means “moral, humane being.”

The lore implies that the current Demon Lord existed since the previous Demon Lord's time, which means she is a product of the Chief God's creation. Her ideals shouldn't be interpreted through romantic fluff, because it shouldn't exist (unless human-monster relationships existed in previous eras).

So, I'm comfortable with applying a creationist/intelligent design spin in her thinking:

Succubi survive by feeding on spirit energy, which they can get through fluid consumption or sex. This has not changed through any of the Demon Lords.

It's difficult to feed on the energies of multiple men (war, hostility, geographic inconveniences), so finding a consistent source of food is invaluable. That means killing the target is bad. That means cultivation (incubus transformation) is necessary. That means establishing some cooperation or co-dependence (seduction, sexual skill, inviting affection) is a must.

As the MC puts it:

#+begin_quote
  Paradise for a succubus had to mean something special.

  “Standardize the needs of monsters to simplify her problem set,” I began. “Cultivate men's spirit energy potential to introduce a post-scarcity world. Monsterize women to eliminate reproductive competition. And install herself as the dictator so as to stop divisional problems in the future. That's peace and prosperity in a nutshell.”
#+end_quote

There's more to tackle, of course. Competency among heroes, the motives of the Chief God(dess), and the Order among them.

What are your thoughts?

This is a decision you've got to make yourself... And frankly, you should have made a decision on the level of grimdark in the setting /before/ you got far into the story.

As someone with basic familiarity with MGE your ideas don't seem bad though.

** Anyone handy with aerodynamics?

What would the terminal velocity be of a human in a wingsuit, in an environment with roughly 1/5th of Earth's gravity and 2 times Earth's atmospheric pressure? Eg, would they be able to move slow enough to land safely if dropped from a few kilometres up?

(In case it matters, the "wingsuit" would actually be the patagium of a person who's roughly a human-scale geneered flying-squirrel; and the gravity is actually from the rotation of a 4000-km-circumference, 1/60 rpm toroidal habitat.)

*** I have a decent grasp of physics, so I can guesstimate a little bit:

- 1/5th gravity would cause the terminal speed to be =sqrt(1/5th)= (~45%) of the normal value.
- Assuming all other things are equal (temperature, atmospheric composition) 2x pressure would relate to 2x density which would cause terminal speed to be =sqrt(1/2)= of the normal value (~70%)

All in all the terminal velocity would be roughly ~30% of that on earth, so for a wingsuit that would be 60km an hour on average (or 15km hour if you were skilled in manipulating it, but that requires it to still work correctly) /theoretically/.

However lift generation would likely be affected by the gravity difference and atmospheric difference, and I don't know enough about that to even guesstimate what direction (better or worse) it would go. For example, part of the way wingsuits generate lift is by using their gravity assisted velocity. Also consider that this will change how fast they can go horizontally, and it may still be problematic stopping in that direction.
