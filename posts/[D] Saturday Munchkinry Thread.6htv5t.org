Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

Tweak the wording and you could do something similar. You'd technically be under a curse to obey someone. That sucks.

But since you're obeying yourself, it doesn't have much practical effect beyond blocking any lesser mind-control spells.

See this doesn't make a lot of sense to me, because as a pessimist, it is my belief that *EVERYTHING* is technically harmful. And just plain harmful in general as well.

I could curse myself with riches or beauty or love. It's technically harmful because now others will envy me and may try to rob me of them.

I could curse myself with immortality. It's technically harmful because now I'm stuck in this horrible world.

I could curse myself with happiness or any other kind of positive emotion. It's technically harmful because the state of happiness impairs my ability to make judgments.

I could curse myself with the ability to always make accurate judgments or any other kind of intelligence boost. This is technically harmful because now I would always be exposed to horrible underlying truths.

I could curse myself with super speed. It's technically harmful because now I have to live through this horrible world at super speed.

I could curse myself with omnipotence or any other kind of power boost. This is technically harmful because a large majority of humanity believes that with great power comes great responsibility, and so will demand I slave away to save them from bad guys and what not.

I could curse myself with utterly nothing. This is technically harmful because one day someone might learn about what I've chosen to curse myself with and laugh at me because they think I'm an idiot who wasted his chance for a beneficial curse.

***** I see, so it has to sound harmful to the Dungeon Master, not just to me.

I curse myself to never kill anything. Now I am a supreme power leveler/trainer, able to utterly destroy enemies until they have 1hp so my allies can killsteal, and also able to whip my allies into shape without fear of accidentally killing them.

I curse myself to never win any gambles. I get my allies to bet the opposite of whatever I bet on, and thus become filthy rich.

I curse myself to never finish a battle. Then, since a battle is finished if either I or the enemy dies, I can be an indestructible tank. So I can stay in dungeon boss fights until both the boss and I are at 1hp, then flee the fight and let my allies kill the 1hp boss.

I curse myself to temporarily gain the elemental weaknesses of whatever I'm thinking of at the moment (or whatever I last touch). E.g., if I think of a fire spirit, I'm now suddenly extremely weak to water. Now I can use myself to identify the weaknesses of any dungeon boss. Think of the boss (or touch the boss and run), then try a bunch of minor offensive spells of different elements on myself until I find one that does damage.

Same thing but now with skills/stats/the opposite of the enemy's strengths/etc. Now I'm a walking pokedex with extreme detail, able to fully analyze everything about every monster.

I curse myself with an extreme allergy to demons/evil/other kinds of enemy essences. Now I'm an enemy detector, if I start sneezing like crazy, there's enemies around. This will greatly hinder my combat ability, but my party will no longer be ambushable.

I curse myself with total inaccuracy: my attacks will never hit anything. Now when fighting invisible enemies, I can cast an AoE spell. Whichever spot my AoE spell doesn't hit, the invisible enemy is there. So my allies can now see the invisible enemy and kill it.

I curse myself with the hatred of the entire world, causing all enemies to attack me instead of my allies. My allies would also attack me, so I would only use this with my defense is much higher than my allies' attacks. So it's a curse for a super tank.

I curse myself with lag. My communication with the DM takes three "turns". So if I want to attack an enemy, my attack happens only three rounds of combat later. This makes you unable to react properly to enemy movements, but would allow you to pull off some interesting lag kills. Conversely, if an enemy wants to attack me, its attack only affects me three rounds of combat later. So this would also increase your survivability in some ways. Note: The DM's head will probably start to hurt in a while.

And finally, if the DM refuses all my suggestions:

I curse myself with complete obedience to some other player. Now that player can control my character, and I can go play a game that isn't run by this DM. > _ > < _ <.

******* This is a real thing. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)][Chirality]] is a chemical property of some molecules; using the same building blocks, and the same basic arrangement of bonds and atoms, you can build a molecule that's /almost/, but not quite, the same as the mirror version.

Pretty much all sugars derive from natural sources, and pretty much all of those sources produce D-sucrose, the sugar that we all know and love. However, if you do a lot of stuff in the lab, you can produce L-sucrose, which is the same as D-sucrose except with the bonds mirrored. To your taste buds, it's the same, but to the bacteria in your mouth and to your stomach, it's unprocessable. Everything that makes sugar makes D-sucrose, so we haven't evolved to deal with L-sucrose since it's not found in nature.

(I was on a drug called Celexa for awhile; the process that makes it makes a left-handed and right-handed version of the molecule, where only one of those actually does the proper SSRI thing it's supposed to and the other is basically useless/detrimental. Lexapro has the useless part removed, but it costs more, so they only prescribe it if you have symptoms. You need half as much Lexapro as you need Celexa, because it's removing the half that doesn't do anything.)

#+end_quote

Think of it this way, you body needs to know what it's eating so it knows what to do with it. In order to tell what all this food stuff is, the most common way is shape. Your body creates relatively large molecules that are like gloves or shoes, and the stuff you eat fits into different shoes depending on what it is. So there are shoes for different sugars, shoes for different vitamins, etc.

Right-handed sugar and left-handed sugar are like your right and left feet. Sure they look the same, but your right foot doesn't fit in your left shoe (at least, it shouldn't. Unifoot shoes are weird). The same thing happens here: your body only has shoes for right-handed sugar. The right-handed sugar you eat fits in the shoes your body makes, so your body can tell "oh hey this is sugar" and then use it. The left-handed sugar just bounces around without properly fitting into anything, so your body doesn't know what it is and doesn't do anything with it.

I'm less certain of your (reflected) body's ability to function /at all/, since every single molecule in your body would be reflected and that would give some of them different properties. That probably wouldn't be a problem until you started eating or drinking things (since water and air are non-chiral), but once you tried ingesting things you would run into problems. (L-glucose and D-glucose taste the same, but I'm not sure this is true for all tastes and smells; naively, I would think that both rely on bonding, which relies on configuration, which means that taste/smell/digestion would be impacted.)

I see a few interpretations of this statement:

Case 1) Everything I'm holding in my right arm teleports to my cut-off left arm.

Case 2) My right arm, along with everything it is holding, is cut off and teleported to the location of my left arm, while my left arm is teleported to me and reconnected with my body.

In these cases, the stuff gets teleported.

Case 3) Everything about my body is mirrored at once, so my cut-off left arm teleports across my body to its mirror location, still cut off. Based on what you just said, I now assume this is the correct interpretation.

This case is trickier, but still easily exploitable. Just get someone else to put the stuff on my cut-off left arm, and call me to tell me when to activate my power.

Actually this case is the most exploitable, since the teleportation would be able to send you to places you haven't been before.

So for example, say 100 km in front of you is an enemy base. Go 100km back, hold a bomb in your left hand, and cut it off. Now go back to your original location and stand such that to your left is your left hand, and to your right is the enemy base. Activate your ability. BOOM.

You now have no right hand. But the enemy base is no more.

** People have spirits. Spirits can affect the physical world. Usually, a person's spirit remains inside their body. However, it's possible to send one's spirit outside one's body to perform tasks in the physical world. Using the spirit to observe and affect with the physical world requires expending energy from the body. Energy consumption increases (usually exponentially, but the exact fashion varies from person to person) as the spirit goes farther from its host. Consequently, if the distance is too great, the host will die of exhaustion.

The spirit can affect the physical world in the way the body does---imparting kinetic energy to objects (i.e. picking things up, manipulating them, hitting, throwing, etc.). The amount of energy the spirit can use is limited only by how much energy is in the body, so theoretically, the spirit could e.g. tear apart reinforced concrete, given enough energy. The spirit can also be used inside the body to augment the host's physical strength or durability.

It's difficult for two spirits to exercise physical influence in the same space in the same way that it's hard to push one's hand through someone else's hand, meaning that it's possible to defend against spirit attacks on the physical body.

I might push at this a bit more. In the real world, I'd expect a VIP to have ~5 body guards, or fewer. Even if those body guards are fantastically trained, I'd expect them to lose a brawl to a crowd.

Body guards work in the real world partly because we use metal detectors. This means that VIPs can have armed guards. Also, there are severe real-world consequences for trying to attack a VIP. No one wants to rush a stage at a concert if it means they'll get their nose broken by security.

These consequences wouldn't obviously apply to spirits. I wouldn't expect to be able to shoot one with a gun. And even if I could detect a spirit, it might be hard to trace it back to a specific person.

You also have the problem that any body guard who's using his spirit to protect a VIP is a body guard who's vulnerable to spiritual attack himself.

If I were leading an intelligent group of attackers, I'd pick a situation where we outnumbered the guards. Then have our spirits attack the guards in waves. The guards would either lose, or be forced to withdraw their spirits to defend themselves. At that point, the group attacks the undefended VIP en-mass.

I can see a few options that would let VIPs defend against this.

The first is to ramp up the exponential decay of spirit-strength. Then force VIPs to stay 30' back from crowds at all times. That way, they'd have enough leverage to defend themselves. This has interesting story consequences; anyone who's sufficiently famous loses the ability to have a normal public life.

Alternately, add physical ways to defend against spirits. Maybe they can't cross a line of salt. That makes it possible for VIPs to shower in private. The interesting story-prompt here might be: It's your anniversary. You send your spirit home to whisper 'I love you' to them. The spirit discovers that your bedroom has been warded. But there's a good reason...

A third option might be to add consequences for misuse of spirits. Maybe they can be trapped. And this causes some kind of terrible damage to the person who's now lost their magic. For instance, you can only fall asleep when your spirit is inside your body.

If this is true, I can imagine a story prompt like: Teenager hears that [pop-star] is doing a photo-shoot at the beach. Teenager, being dumb and horny, sends their spirit to watch. Someone anticipated voyeurs. The teen's spirit is caught in a necromantic trap. They have a very short window to find and free their spirit.

*** It seems like the best practice is to use spirit to augment yourself, and only use it remotely for special circumstances like scouting, and espionage.

It's similar to the magic system in eragon. Requiring the same amount of energy it would take to complete the task yourself and exponential energy requirements with distance.

Two big questions:

How fast can a spirit move?

Can it 'snap back' to the body or does it have to travel the distance?

There are three scenarios in one on one fights between spirit users;

- Both using Spirit separated from their body.

Two spirits fighting is pretty much a fight of endurance, whoever runs out of energy first loses. Less distance between you and your spirit means less energy use, and efficiency is the biggest advantage you could have.

The contest would basically be both spirits trying to locate the unprotected body of their opponent while also trying to maintain leverage of distance without giving away their own position. The best way would probably be to sneak up on your opponent with your real body, keeping them distracted with the fight. Or luring your opponent into a trap.

There's plenty of mind games and strategy to explore here. But this is all all attack, no defense strategy. If you choose this fighting style it only makes sense if your goal is to attack the body directly, expect high risk feints and gambits, not a direct spirit to spirit fight, because that would almost always equal a loss to whoever is furthest from their body. Both would have to be the 'sacrifice all your peices for the checkmate' kind of people to end up fighting like this.

That or one got caught snooping and got forced into this method of confrontation. Try making a tactical retreat while keeping your spirit in range without letting it give away your direction or position for them to send the army after you, or without losing the leverage of distance and dying anyway.

- second fight scenario

One person with no defenseless body to sneak attack, just a spirit with it's power source directly inside it with no loss over the distance squared.

Vs someone with a weak defenseless body and a spirit unnecessarily leaking energy somewhere away from their pathetic body. Blow for blow against our friend they will lose the most energy in Spirit, or their body will get smashed into paste.

Having your spirit outside your body against another spirit user is a bad idea. Which leads us to scenario 3

- Both using Spirit to Augment the body.

Use a crossbow or something first to drain as much energy from your opponent possible and gain the advantage before you jump in. Maybe use your spirit to quickly grab a spear from behind them, or use it to shoot the crossbow while you stay out of harms way if you must.

Using spirit outside your body should only be for specialised tasks like unlocking doors from the inside, triggering traps remotely, or using tools like crossbows that provide decent return for your expended energy.

If it doesn't cost the enemy more than it costs you, it's not worth it.

Heck, in a first scenario fight, my strategy would be to keep the fight as close to my body as possible, then retreat into my body and go offensive on the spirit to drain them dry, follow them back to their body if they try to run and end it there after they wasted most of their energy being stupid. (Maybe they're trying to do the same thing to me.)

Arbitrarily fast, given enough energy. Spirits have to move through the physical world by interacting with it (i.e. walking, running, etc.), and therefore have to have at least a tiny amount of mass (a grain of sand is usual---though this may be a conceptual limitation) to be accelerated. However, low mass means it can be easily stopped by other spirits, so in a spirit fight, there's a tradeoff between speed (low mass) and power/energy consumption (high mass).

You could have non users with greater resistance to spirit enhanced attacks. Or a basic resistance in everyone to prevent fuckery.

You could incorperate little things into the lore, for example; when people get the feeling that something bad has happened to someone they care about, or parents somehow knowing where to find their lost children, maybe they've subconsciously been keeping their spirit near that person.

Or an obsessive stalker that feels like they need to be near the object of their obsession because the distance has an affect until they waste away or learn to let go.

You could have a loophole in the distance restriction if two people have their spirit with the other person, substituting their own. Kind of like a stable link between two people. There would be a tangible sense of loss when the other died.

The fluff is that there's a spirit world and a physical world, and non-sentient blobs of spirit leak over to the physical world and inhabit living things. When those things die, normally the spirit incarnates in another random living being, or goes back to the spirit world and loses its shape/history, like an ice sculpture melting in a pond. However, if the being is a human, then the spirit retains self-awareness when the body dies, and doesn't want to go back. So (unless it's a hippie or suicidal) it finds another human to incarnate in.

  Do spirits retain memory? This could be a means of immortality.
#+end_quote

The spirit is not the mind. When someone dies and their spirit gets reincarnated, the new person gets access to the previous incarnation(s) in the same way that we have access to Albert Einstein---we have his notes, and we can make good guesses about his behaviour, but he really is dead. If Alice has a conversation with previous incarnation Bob, she's really talking to herself, using Bob's experiences as a sounding board. If Bob disagrees with her on something, it's because Alice is conflicted and the fragment of her mind simulating Bob is pointing it out, not because Bob has his own volition.

  How can Jane ensure that her child gets the best spirit?
#+end_quote

She can't, 'cause of some fluff I'm gonna make up right now to prevent reincarnation within families/lineages/etc. After someone dies, their spirit goes to the spirit world. If the person was strong-willed in life, they can resist melting into the void (for a while, at least) and find their way back to the physical world to be reincarnated. (This is also why so many past lives are important people---if you have what it takes to make it out of the spirit world, you probably kicked a lot of ass while alive.) Of course, there's no telling where they'll end up when they get there, and they only have so much energy to expend in travelling to find a preferable body.

By the way, I came up with an idea about why the spirit/physical dynamic works the way it does:

- Physical beings can only replenish their energy/heal by taking it from a physical source or from their spirit.
- Spirits can only replenish their energy/heal by taking it from a spirit source or from their physical incarnation.
- Energy can only be transferred between a spirit and its incarnation. No third-party energy transactions. (Alternately, nobody has yet figured out a means of transforming physical energy into spirit energy and vice-versa except the bond between a spirit and its incarnation).

This explains why harming a spirit can harm the physical body (it doesn't directly, but the body deteriorates if it transfers too much energy into the spirit) and sets up some interesting possibilities, e.g.:

1. Find a spirit-energy source with the output of a nuclear power plant (probably in the spirit world).
2. Transfer energy from your spirit to your body continuously.
3. Become Goku.
4. ???
5. Profit.

In the physical world it acts mostly like an invisible extra limb that's also a hard drive for memories (but no CPU). Since the mind originates with the physical body, it's not possible for the spirit to exercise volition unless the body is dead. The spirit is left with an imprint of the mind (neural networks, whatever) which degrades as the spirit uses up its energy (another reason not to wait around in the physical world before reincarnating).

In the spirit world the spirit is effectively a second body---the primary body, in fact, because the physical body can't affect spirit (except by using up spirit energy).

Human spirits tend to reincarnate where there are humans (i.e. they don't get dumped in the middle of the ocean), but other than that, it is indeed random (mostly because organising the spirit world so that specific exits lead to specific places in the physical world would require a /ridiculous/ amount of energy, both spirit and physical).

I think there should definitely be energy sources in the spirit world. If the physics change based on what people believe... maybe, at first, the source of energy is sheer willpower. As cities and then empires are built and the population increases, the spirit world begins changing to resemble the physical world, with rivers, plants, maybe even animals (some unique to the spirit world)... but the physics are Aristotelian, working based on intuitive assumptions. Then, as scientists' spirits start trickling in and new ideas propagate, the physics change again, and it becomes possible to build spirit steam engines, and then turbines, and even spirit reactors. Of course, if the physics varies throughout history, it can vary from area to area, so a device (or nuclear reactor/eternally rotating axle/floating crystal) that works in one place might prove unreliable or even unusable somewhere else. Exploiting the reality-bending nature of belief would probably become an important art/science.

True. The point is, though, that the spirit guarantees nothing. You could indoctrinate someone to believe that they're a direct continuation of the previous incarnation, but really, every new incarnation is a new person with their own agenda (even if they believe otherwise).

It doesn't depend on whether you /think/ you'll die---it depends on whether you actually die. When your body dies, your brain stops being you, and your spirit starts.

Let's play this scenario out. The villain has captured thirty people they know to have reincarnated at least three times (no small feat!), and has a pregnant woman on hand about to give birth. The woman goes into labour and the captives are executed. Each spirit arrives alone in a random location in the spirit world. Seven decide to stay in the spirit world, alone or joining the local village/warlord/republic. One melts into the void. One ends up getting killed after robbing from a gang. Twenty-one make it back to the physical world. Five reincarnate on the same continent as the villain. The closest one reincarnates about 400 km away as a tinker's daughter. For twenty-five years, the villain searches, but in vain. Broken and destitute, he is finally murdered by one of his victims, who reincarnated an ocean away as a vengeful but not particularly smart noble. The tinker's daughter considers taking revenge, but instead decides to use her past lives' experience as a merchant, alchemist, and blacksmith to invent an improved steel-making process and found an industrial empire. She dies old and obscenely wealthy.

Okay, so as soon as the baby is out of the way of the Mom's spirit - basically, as soon as the baby is removed from the mother? I think that means that, if the doctor handling the delivery is in on the plan, it can probably be set to very close to a specific time (assuming the doctor gets to guess his best idea for the exact time of birth and then deliberately help that time to happen) - though I'm not a medical person, you might want an actual doctor's opinion on this.

But it seems reasonable to me that, five minutes before the birth, the doctor can call out to an assistant who sends a five-minute text message, and causes all thirty victims to be killed exactly five minutes after the message.

...hmmmm. I just went and looked it up - worldwide, there are an estimated 4.3 people born per second. Which is 258 per minute. So, this villain has a less-than-ten-percent chance that his golden child will be born with a strong spirit.

If you can sever the connection by e.g. drowning in cold water, and then get revived, what happens? So I'll say: the connection breaks when the body can no longer be revived.

A new siege weapon is a line of people standing in front of a mid-sized rock. The first person's spirit shoves the rock forward hard enough to exhaust themselves for a period of time (between a minute and a week), followed by the second, who pushes the flying rock, and the third, who pushes the /quickly/ flying rock, and so on until all of the people have added their energy to the rock, making a cannon.

**** Seems like I'll have to figure out how rare to make this ability to avoid story-breaking stuff while keeping things interesting.

#+begin_quote
  Eavesdropping/spying becomes much easier.
#+end_quote

Maybe. Depends on how common spirit-usage is, and on whether people are trained to detect other spirits.

#+begin_quote
  Mechanical repairs and surgery also become easier, as you can access the inside of something without opening it up.
#+end_quote

Surgery not so much. If you can get your patient to move their spirit out of their body (or you know how to force it out), definitely, but otherwise, their spirit gets in the way.

**** While the spirit railgun idea is entertaining, I don't think it would work for the same reason a human railgun wouldn't. The first few people are okay, but the people later in the line would have to push a rock that's already moving at high speeds. That's like trying to catch a cannon ball in mid-flight. Even in spirit form, I don't think humans would have the dexterity to do this.

***** The release of energy doesn't have to be provided by the spirit directly as propulsion. Use it to provide potential energy that gets released all at once later.

Give them absurdly powerful bows that a normal person couldn't operate. Something that for normal humans to get the same amount of power, would need to be stabilized in the ground and cranked up with gears. Basically seige weapons. Portable seige weapons

The biggest advantage of spirit is the ability to release large amounts of power at once, the downside is range. Powerful ranged weapons seems perfect for them.
