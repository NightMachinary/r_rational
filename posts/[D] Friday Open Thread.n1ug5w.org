Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I stumbled on this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4][video]] in another subreddit and thought the people here might enjoy. Essentially it's a Sudoku solving video with extra constraints and a seemingly impossible starting position. The narrator's sheer delight at engaging with the puzzle is really fun to watch.

I recommend skipping to about 3 minutes in when he actually starts trying to solve it.

*** Cracking the Cryptic puts out a lot of sudoku games as well, and "Miracle Sudoku" is the most recent one I've finished. They all have the center mechanic of not allowing orthogonal squares to have sequential numbers, but the details vary beyond that.

*** Huh. I don't know why I haven't recommended Cracking the Cryptic here, or seen recs for it before. I've been watching the channel (well, Simon's videos) for almost two years now, and both the creativity of the puzzles and wit of the solver continue to impress me.

** I noticed that [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-intermission.787978/][Companion Chronicles]] has started updating weekly again.

It's not especially rational, and never quite recaptured the magic of its initial Worm jump, so I'm hesitant to bring it up in the monday fiction thread. But since I first came across it here, I thought some people might appreciate knowing that it's off hiatus.

Ehh I read the first couple chapters it had on Worm and it didn't really interest me. The MC doesn't really act like a person in the setting at all. I don't care about things being perfectly rational I just want it to make sense. The MC doesn't really have any goals and just hangs out with people she likes from the original story.

It feels like a less self-aware version of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mary-sue-saves-the-wormverse-worm-si.766162/reader/][Mary Sue]]

**** The end of the Worm arc actually deals with that. Basically Taylor never forgives the MC for not intervening and preventing her trigger event, and the MC realizes how the just wanting to hang out with her favorite characters is messed up when they're real people and you don't help them so that they become the characters you know them as.

So I would say it's plenty self-aware. I can't actually remember the motivations of the MC in that jump though so I think that part is probably a valid criticism.

Also I skipped the Dragon Quest jump because the setting wasn't to my liking, still enjoying the interludes though - Scion is a companion!

**** Well it's more of a character-oriented story, mostly about the existential horror that is the jumpchain genre.

*** I love how every story arc is adapted to the genre conventions. I.E. in Worm things escalate and get worse, in Star Trek basically every story act has an episodic structure with beginning, middle, end, and moral lesson, and in some JRPG that I've never played the main character occasionally suffers from Cut Scene Incompetence.
