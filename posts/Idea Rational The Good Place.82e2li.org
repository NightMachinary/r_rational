Eleanor gets a super-rationalist upgrade, without getting an intelligence upgrade.


** [[#s][Season One spoilers]]

That said, like a previous redditor once commented: ideas are cheap. I would love to see this attempted but lack the time and talent to see a project like this into fruition.

Edit: spoiler tags failure

*** SPOILER

Eleanor is already fairly rational (or at least becomes so over the course of the series). The main difference would be making her more curious so she actually investigates the history of the system, what exactly Janets are, the arbitrary bureaucracy, metaphysics and control systems (stuff like Janet's button). At some point she may well suspect she is in a nested simulation and then you could make it a crossover with the matrix or something.

**** So how would you recommend keeping spoilers hidden? Rot13 is cumbersome (especially on mobile), linebreaks don't work for a lot of people and not mentioning spoilers at all hampers discussion. The current spoiler tags aren't ideal, but at least you don't accidentally spoil anyone.

You can't do that if you are just replying to a post though.

That's a fair point. I do agree that this is a topic that could have benefited from a general spoiler warning in the title, but as someone replying to a topic your options are: not mentioning spoilers, using spoiler tags or potentially spoiling people.

*** I think that's a scaled-up version of the problem with any fanfic of an ongoing work. The only way around it is probably to pick an episode as a point-of-departure for the AU, and then ignore canon developments after that point. We'd probably want to start writing in the gap between seasons to give the fic time to develop its own story before it starts coming out in parallel with new episodes.

For example, [[#s][Major Season 1 Spoilers]]

** I'd like to believe that a rationalist in the [real] Good Place would tear the whole thing to pieces with his inquisitions.

I'll bet everyone here suspected from the beginning that they were not in the Good Place because that would generally be a boring story.

But there's also a hard problem because Good Places should be full of people trying to fix the system. Any story teller in this universe is probably painted into a corner so that they cannot actually depict the Good Place. Or else The Good Place isn't actually that good because it somehow restricts people from being able to fix the system.

Maybe the only one who can fix it is a person from the Bad Place.

Hmm...

I actually thought this was handled pretty nicely by depicting the Architects et all as having basically human motivations and flaws. Things like Michael talking about his bosses, how it was his first time designing a neighborhood, plus the fact that they made a mistake with Eleanor did a good job of setting up potential conflict even if they had been in the real Good Place. I think it's possible to do a r! AU fic where they actually are in the Good Place, but unlike most rationalist visions of immortality they don't have any way to modify the residents' minds, so they can't use transhumanist hand-waving to make them immune to boredom and ennui.

The whole point of S1 was to make everyone suspect that from the start, and then slowly lull you to sleep and convince you that you were overthinking the show before asspulling you with the big reveal. It was a masterpiece of engineering audience expectations.

I did not straight up suspect /that/. I did think the whole affair was fishy, but thought it was headed more towards a "Heaven ain't that Heaven-ly after all" direction. With subversion of the whole system (that was obviously unfair, with people getting sent to the Bad Place for trivial reasons) being the end game.

I also had my suspicions re: Tahani because come on, how is she Heaven material, but then I thought maybe this was supposed to be a subversion, and to invite thought about how one could be a good person even regardless of personal flaws as long as their actions did good. Turns out, no, they buy into the virtue ethics argument, moral desserts invalidate the whole thing.

Frankly it's a pretty crap world. I don't think they'll have the guts to end it this way, because even without explicit references to Christianity it'd still be a bit too much, but the only really good thing to do would be burning the entire system down however possible.
