** Good lord. That was.. something.

A plan working out flawlessly and quickly, which may or may not be the first time I've ever read that happen.

/Three/ teams making it out of the forest, with everyone else likely dead, just like that.

The sheer callousness of the ninja - the chuunin and the cloud ninja in particular.

The casual, instant death of the cloud girl.

It's.. it's like this isn't even shonen! Amazing!

*** My thoughts exactly. I was enjoying this fic enough that I didn't care that it seemed to be turning into a fix-fic. This chapter was going along in the same pattern, Naruto's team casually winning with no real struggle, and then a large number of likable secondary characters are just wiped out. No plot armor for anyone! I like it like that.

** Everyone is failing very hard at rationality - given this social structure, the only reasonable course of action is to flee. The planet, if possible.

I'm not even joking. Remember that anti-social branch of Naruto's family that went to live on an island to be left the fuck alone? Right idea, insufficiently extreme execution. They are living in a world in which it seems like someone systematically rigged... well, life.. to suck.

The rational move in this game is not to play - Focus on utility-techniques for chakra and found a village which is well and truly /hidden/. I'd suggest burrowing into the bedrock a couple of miles under the artic, or researching travel techniques to bail on the planet.

**** Pfth. Sure you can. Doing better than this crapsack social settlement is not even remotely difficult. They are currently running casualty rates comparable to... communist cadre during stalin's purges? Except, it's the norm, not the reign of terror of any individual.

And that doesn't follow inevitably from chakra use - we hand out multi-tonne high speed vehicles to essentially everyone, and they are hardly ever used as weapons. Some places literally give everyone actual weapons, and those also don't turn into bloodbaths.

This world is the result of malign social engineering. The tailed beasts are not really the problem, the social structure is, to an extent that is just ridiculous.

The trick is to avoid the fate which befell Naruto's isolationist kinsmen - Presumably they were destoyed because it was feared that by the simple expedient of just, you know, /not/ murdering their children in droves, they would eventually be back with numbers that could not be fought. So, in order to do this right, you need to arrange to not be findable at all. Or to be thought dead. Or alternatively, be in a place where you cannot be realistically followed/attacked, even if found.

That is a benefit to fanfiction that is commonly underutilized. Since the audience is already familiar with the characters, the author doesn't even need to build up someone for an emotional impact before they kill them.

**** I don't see the emotional impact here. It was too easy and just gives the feeling of them not being important in the fic anyway. If there was a chapter for team Sakura before this test, it would have been way different.

It's still cool to actually have the "good guys" take real damage. Now if author would just kill Naruto off and make this Avenger-Hinata-fic...

** Prediction: everything just before the Rain team ambush is a genjutsu.

Circumstantial proof: Canon has a rain team with wide area genjutsu that was leading the original team + Kabuto in circles. Cloud were demonstrated too powerful in a previous fight, them losing a member in one is a bit far fetched, combined with the fact that Naruto's team won easily over both Rain and a cloud chunin, I call shenanigans. The chunin in charge of preliminaries, doesn't know Sasuke's name, which is weird because the story of Uchiha is well known in the Leaf village. Naruto's description of how wrong everything is going wrong, from dice rolling to chunin not giving a time to rest for Neji's team, or even letting Tenten leave on her own. And I think the dice rolled on Sasuke because the Rain wanted to see his techniques in action.

And seriously, everyone is to callous about death and suffering, this behavior makes sense in a warlike desperate situation, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, I can guess the author is making a point about power distribution between people, when some of those people can move mountains and therefore easily rule the normies.

EDIT: according to the following chapter I am in the wrong. Unidammnit Nappa.

*** I think the cloud ninja was overconfident because she was expecting Sasuke to be as weak as TenTen.\\
In canon at this point Sasuke was near exhausted, only had a two tomoe sharingan and was actively having to suppress using chakra to avoid having the cursed seal kill him, and he still won the preliminary match against the chakra draining ninja with some trouble.\\
In this story, Sasuke is fresh, has a 3 tomoe sharingan, and is boosting his power with the cursed seal. I'd expect him to easily beat anybody in the exam except for Naruto, Neji, and Lee.\\
Also the Byakugan should be able to see through a genjutsu like that.

  Historically, dice is the plural of die, but in modern standard English, dice is both the singular and the plural: throw the dice could mean a reference to two or more dice, or to just one. In fact, the singular die (rather than dice) is increasingly uncommon.

******* There are two differences between invented pronouns and singular they; the most important is that everyone uses singular they without thinking about it, and invented pronouns only people who are specifically thinking about it use them. The second is that they is an indeterminate form rather than a determinate nonbinary form, which invented pronouns might not have been in theory but definitely are in practice.

When Time Braid's author used singular they, I guarantee you they weren't thinking about it. They just wrote in natural language, and in places where they would use 'they' in speech, they used it in writing. Just like I did here; I don't know the author's gender, and it might be nonbinary, so 'he or she' is inappropriate, so I used they, like everyone else. Which includes y'ou, I guarantee it. It's been demonstrated before that even the most fervent haters of singular they still use it regularly in conversation.

In written conversations, I very often use "it" to refer to people of indeterminate gender.
