Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Zombie Related Hypothetical:

A genie announces that, a week from now, everyone who dies will have their body vanish and be replaced with an adult grizzly bear.

The grizzly bears are like normal bears, except they have a bright-red-coloring (to distinguish them from mundane wildlife) and a violently aggressive disposition. The bears will attack people, within the normal ability of bears.

Does society break down? And how much of the breakdown would be due to bears, and not everyone suddenly learning that magic is real?

--------------

I'm asking because I really like the 'mood' of Zombie stories; it's cool to think of how a few people might survive in a wasteland populated by strong, but not-particularly-smart foes.

A the same time, it's hard to imagine how we get from here to there, without a bunch of authorial handwaving.

*** It's /possible/ that society breaks down.

The big problem is that either /everything/ needs to be grizzly-proofed, there need to be grizzly kill-squads, or society needs to have near-total control of when and how people die. That's a whole lot of load added to society in the space of a few weeks, which doesn't necessarily cause societal collapse, but which /does/ put pressure on sensitive parts of society that are already load-bearing (pun not intended).

Big cities are probably one of the weakest points. New York City doesn't have enough food supply to feed everyone in it if the logistic disruption is severe enough, and it's /already/ got ~400 deaths per day, though most of those are probably in hospitals. It's not /impossible/ that there would be runaway feedback loops that took out a major city like that, which would result in waves of refugees impacting other places and creating logistics disruptions elsewhere.

Mostly likely that doesn't take out the government, and the wasteland would be unevenly distributed, with "clear zones" that are assumed not to have any grizzlies (and policies and procedures in place to keep them that way) and "wasteland" that's been essentially condemned.

**** I think the bigger issue would be that the "wasteland" would also be a significant percentage of the world's economic activity. [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/us-gdp-map-2014-2][Just take a look at this map.]] if the largest cities, like New York, all have this runaway effect causing the city to collapse, then we'd easily see a quarter of the country's economy simply falling apart. Companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, would be severely damaged as their headquarters become inaccessible. Not to mention the New York Stock exchange would have to shut down for an unforeseeable length of time. More than likely the world would go into economic collapse. Internet services and power grids would slowly fail as the centralized systems have no one to control them anymore.

I also highly disagree that it wouldn't take out the government. DC is a massive economic area. The things that are true for New York are true for DC, but instead of just taking out some businesses, it's congress, and the FBI, Homeland Security, the EPA, and NSA. Of course the president would get out, along with much of the high level white house staff, but they wouldn't have the infrastructure to manage the whole country anymore. The parts that they could manage would be run essentially like a dictatorship as well.

I'm not sure how the rest of the world would fair though. I expect similarly.

Couldn't they just eat the bears? (assuming they're not poisonous or whatever)

The problem with relying on hunting/breeding for food is that the animals you're eating need to eat a lot of food themselves, and oftentimes you'd be better off feeding the food directly to people. Magic bears that appear out of nowhere don't have this problem.

***** Logistics is still a huge question mark. You get ~400 bears (before bear murders) that have to be cleaned and butchered so that their meat can be distributed to the people who need it, and that's assuming that you can actually /get/ the meat while it's still good, because slaughtering a bear properly without its willing compliance is probably pretty tough.

(Some math on caloric needs: 400 bears times 600 pounds times 600 calories per pound = 144,000,000 calories, which is enough for 72,000 people per day assuming a 2,000 calorie diet. Population of New York City is ~8.5 million. Not entirely sure that the numbers I grabbed are for the same statistical areas though.)

*** I'm thinking there will a terrible period of adjustment, before the surviving outposts of civilization settle on norms that involve everyone wearing steel rings around their necks.

Unless the transformation is an instant replacement of all nearby matter, in which case... I expect death-by-bear doesn't often lead to a net increase in bears, since the one doing the mauling will get its head and paws truncated.

Do these bears need to eat things other than humans? The biosphere is going to collapse really hard, if so. It may be that the only land animals that survive are those of Antarctica and insects. Almost any plant edible to humans is going to be driven to extinction as well.

The color red is going to get new connotations, whatever happens.

Any squirrel or moth or cow or whatever that dies is instantly replaced with a grizzly bear, colored green to distinguish it from the other bears.

Bears resulting from grizzly cannibalism are denoted blue. Bears that die of natural causes, starvation or being crushed by a tsunami of multi-colored bears, reappear completely black.

**** I'm not sure if grizzlies are among them, but many breeds of bear are scarily good climbers, like, give-spiderman-a-run-for-his-money climbers. Ladders may not be as effective as you'd expect. Granted, this is mostly in regard to trees, but it's still cause for concern.

*** Advance warning we take serious?\\
Bears are no problem.

There shouldn't be too many deads because of bears.

Just give everyone a necklace big enough for humans, too small for bears. You will get rid of all red bears. (For Zombies, we would wear helmets, no bites.)

And for the long term, change how houses are built. Make doors impossible to open for bears and hard to break.

In places with many dying, like hospitals, have security/bear guards.

Personally, I think we could have still our civilization, even if we turn into zombies/grizzly bears after we die.

** I used to watch /True Blood/ (an urban fantasy show) back when it was on, and there's a time where one of the vampire characters remarks: "We've got Louis Pasteur working on this scientific problem we're facing."

Made me realise, with vampires being A Thing, probably one or two historical figures got Turned.

So, are there any historical figures who might have been made into vampires? Ideally, they'd have to have weird behaviour in their later years, or suddenly disappear from the record with no body.

Of course, depending on the number of vampires, it's unlikely that many historical figures got turned; but I thought it would be fun to think about, but I don't know much about any particular historical figures to make suppositions myself.

How about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_FitzGerald,_11th_Earl_of_Kildare][Gerald FitzGerald]], wizard inheriting from a suspicious number of ancestors with the exact same name? All charismatic, all intelligent and well-read. Well, for at least three generations, and maybe the 8th was hot-headed.

There's also this creepy serial [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Kiss][murderer]].

I'm getting these from a list of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_occultists][Occultists]] on the Wikipedia.

Edit: Just thought of Nikola Tesla. This line from the Wikipedia stands out: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla#Birthday_press_conferences]["Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom."]] Although... since he was known to age, maybe he isn't such a natural choice.

*** I wasn't a tween girl in the 90s, but my sister was, and I read a lot of the books since I was a voracious reader and they were around. I'm not sure that I remember them well enough that I could ape them though, and I'd probably have to read the wiki that probably exists. It would be interesting though - I'd read it if someone else wrote it.

In a somewhat (but not really that much) similar vein, there was a series of articles that were Babysitters Club in the style of Bret Easton Ellis that I remember enjoying, [[http://www.alloy.com/lifestyle/baby-sitters-club-by-bret-easton-ellis-chapter-1/][link here]].
