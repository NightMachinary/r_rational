** There's a theme I'm noticing in Worm fan-fiction that's a solid departure from the original: The main characters get time to set up.

Original-Taylor never got enough time to be /ready/, although she did get time to prepare. Partly that's her own fault - that first night out, before everything was done, but that's /almost/ the only time she actually get enough time to get ready for something.

*** And it's especially bad when you have characters like this that can get so much more powerful.

They're lucky Worm has like three or four good monkeywrenches to throw into things (and a few bad ones) but even then it doesn't always balance out.

****** She kind of does. In the same way that Dumbledore in HPMOR [[#s][]] to reach a given outcome, so too can Path to Victory.

Maybe she lets a dog loose that runs into traffic that causes a pileup which causes someone to be late for work which causes a business deal to fall through which makes someone homeless where they meet someone else who is important for them to influence.

Butterfly is the name of the game with PtV

*** To be fair, in Taylor's first night out she was suicidal. She was attempting death-by-heroics. That's the only reason the entire series kicked off as it did.

** I know it's weird to complain about breaking laws of physics when there's Magic going on, but she can apparently build "catalytic water converter" that turns water into h2 + o2 without energy input. And then they are worried about water tank size :)

Also that's using Tony Stark physics not tinkerer's physics.

**** Yeah, doesn't seem like it improves.

The big issue is that there's too much exposition from the narrator; the tech/worldbuilding stuff is fine but characters and dialogue should be handled more subtly. Show don't tell.

I'll be honest, I think this is one of the lowest quality of Worm Fanfics I've read. Which is rather surprising, considering how good Worm Fanfics usually are; they seem to be immune to Sturgeon's Law.

***** Oh, no, there's tons of drek out there. Most of the crappy ones just die out quickly. This one is middling. The not-great writing is buoyed by the conceit.

****** There's also a lot of writing (in general, but also for fanfics) that falls into the category of "fairly crappy, but some parts of it are appealing to some people" in every genre. If we're going to stick to fanfiction, there are a lot truly awful of Harry Potter fanfictions that are like 400k+ words (and some over a million words) with many, many reviews and favorites on fanfiction.net

******* Worm as far as I can tell has a higher standard of writing in terms of grammar and such -likely because it's centered around a forum and it can be intimidating for bad writers (who can't just dump something on FFN and not taint their account) and they have a thread specifically for snippets so people can feel out interest or let things quietly die- but in terms of the character work, story choices and fanon stuff that's unsubstantiated...they're as bad as anyone.

******* Hm. I meant it in the secondary meaning of a central concept/theme, but the precise definition doesn't really match what I had in my head. Rephrase as "The writing isn't great, but not so bad I can't enjoy watching a fully OP Marvel character wreck the wormverse."

** I had thought I would enjoy this, but the writing is just so /clunky/ that I can't get into it. The things that should be handwaved away instead are ground though at a glacial pace. In chap 6/7 the author goes over one set of information twice from three different perspectives without any of them really adding anything, and it's not the only time they do it. The characters feelings or thoughts aren't hinted to, but blatantly stated. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBhR4QcBtE][In conclusion.]]

But hey, other people are enjoying it so maybe this is a thing that I care about more than other people do.
