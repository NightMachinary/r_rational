Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** Hi guys, so right now I'm working on a story (I failed nano) and the first few scenes take place in a city on the coast.

By virtue of being in this city, residents can magically summon small quantities of fat. Think Barren Jewel, except you can customize what kind of fat you get (butter, olive oil, lard, whale blubber, etc.)

This is a relatively common phenomenon in this world, and people in other areas can summon other things to varying degrees of usefulness (think, being able to summon pollen. Or fog.) but I haven't fleshed out the rest of the setting yet and don't want to bias any possible responses here.

But my question is: what kind of economy and culture does this city have? So far I've got:

-Export candles and soap

-Diet of fried fish, eels, crayfish, stingrays

-Suet bird feeders hung everywhere to attract tropical birds

-Lots of cosmetics, its common for both men and women to wear makeup

-Weather prediction via shark oil barometers

The technology level is roughly analogous to the Bronze Age and the plants and animals are mostly from Australia, Melanesia, Polynesia.

*** Cheap candles, and thus cheap lighting after dark, would be amazingly useful for any kind of scholar class. Cheaper than any time before the invention of electric lighting.

Fats, particularly suet, are really useful for food preservation. Pemmican is a combination of dried meat, tallow, and dried fruit. It lasts a really long time without any other preservation techniques, and would be a really good thing to export. Potted meat is a form of preservation that puts meat in a jar and has a layer of suet on top to prevent airborne bacteria from spoiling the food. Not terribly long term, but the ease of getting suet would make it extremely common.

Lots of oils don't last all that long without additional preservation, but some do. Salted butter and ghee are different methods of preserving butter, and would be pretty simple to make and export. Suet, and all the liquid oils we use in the kitchen are obvious exports.

Soap is a good idea. I believe you can make a good base by burning seaweed, and you already have the oil.

Pastry could be popular.

Pre-industrial societies have the vast majority of their population farming food. With free calories from oils available to every citizen, there's a lot less need for so much food production, and easy food preservation lowers that need further. This city would be far larger than a normal Bronze Age society could support, and soap production could make said city vastly cleaner than cities ordinarily would be for multiple technological eras. Well, provided someone notices the connection between soap use and less disease.

A barometer seems much more advanced than a bronze age society could produce, given they were first invented in the 1600s.

**** A scholar class is a good idea, using whale blubber for oil lamps seems like it could circumvent the big hurdle for light and the development of large amount of writing.

There's an equivalent to the Australian outback as well as Polynesian seafaring in the world, so exporting preserved food would be a good idea for long journeys. There's a lot of sardines in the water too, I wonder if those could be preserved and exported with any potted meat or pemmican...

And shark oil barometers are literally just shark liver oil in a glass jar. Apparently they are a thing in [[https://books.google.com/books?id=j-J4Rz5zlxYC&pg=PA131&dq=shark+oil+barometer&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig97Czn7XRAhXJSSYKHUbADnsQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=shark%20oil%20barometer&f=false][Bermuda]]!

**** fat could also be used as fuel for any work that requires high temperatures (smithing, baking pottery, drying wood etc).

Some fats would make excellent fertilizer, especially if composted or burned first.

Atop of all of that, polymerising fats (like walnut oil, or linseed oil etc) do not go bad, and can be used to water proof and wear-proof basically everything; from buildings to ships, from leather to furniture etc, making everything last easily 2x as long.

*** - Art industry: You could produce oil paints from linseed oil, though you'd still need pigments to mix with it. There is no evidence of oil painting in the bronze age, though if all types of oil and fat are free and easily accessible, I imagine oil painting would be discovered quickly.

- Textile industry: You can make waterproof cloth known as oilcloth by applying several coatings of boiled linseed oil. This can be used for making umbrellas, water-proof cloaks, raincoats, water-resistant satchels, and waterproof coverings for carts, wagons, and carriages. You could also make waxed cotton sails and waxed jackets. Given free access to linseed oil, wax, etc., I suspect this kind of stuff would be developed quickly.

- Wood finishing: You could produce drying oils (like, again, linseed oil) as an ingredient for wood varnishes, though varnish would still require a resin like amber or shellac, as well as a solvent like alcohol. Wood varnishes have been in use since at least ancient Egypt.

- Lighting: Oil lamps/lanterns, torches, and candles could all be fueled fairly easily, and all date back to before the bronze age. For best illumination, you'd probably want an oil lamp with its wick in a narrow tube of glass, similar to [[https://www.garrettwade.com/extra-bright-brass-oil-lamps.html][this]]. Glassmaking as an industry started taking off in the late bronze age, and if the fuel for lamps is free, it makes sense to experiment with ways to get more use out of it.

- Pharmaceutical industry: This could allow for the mass production of naturally-occurring steroids like cortisone (anti-inflammatory), testosterone, estradiol (an estrogen hormone), as well as vitamins A, D, E, and K. Discovery of these obviously occurred well after the bronze age. However, depending on how the magic works, it might still be possible to produce these even without really knowing what they are or where they come from.

**** This is an incredibly helpful comment, thank you. I really like all these ideas, I hadn't even considered the art aspect with textiles and oil painting but it's an interesting avenue to explore.

And advances in medicine completely slipped my mind. I'd been doing research in traditional medicine in Oceania but man, the good ol' doctors from before modern medicine would use anything. The things Nicholas Culpeper listed as "medicine" make me shudder. Of course the doctors will try any oil they can get their hands on and use it to "assuage pain of the womb" or something.

And the naturally-occurring steroid thing is interesting but it honestly might be too powerful, I'll have to do some research before I introduce that into the story.

even applying raw linseed oil to wood would produce a durable coat that water-proofs, weather proofs and rot-proofs wood for years. ANd since now people can quite literally re-coat wooden items in oil by slapping them, their wooden objects will easily last for 3x time they normally would. Wooden ships in particular would become near immortal, with all the hands-on care and repair they normally get.

*** Cool! I'd love to read that.

Is there a cost to the summoning? Being able to summon extra calories could mean that's no longer a limiter on population, which could lead to interesting problems.

It puts an interesting twist on the status of food. Rich people might tend to eat food low in fat because it's poor food. Poor people might have plenty of calories, but [[https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/protein-deficiency-symptoms][lack in access to protein]] or perhaps complete proteins. In particular, you might have elevated rates of disease, or periodic epidemics, or maybe people would just be more aware of the dangers of a high fat diet.

*** by far the most important use is that fat is excellent fuel. Smelly, but highly energetic and slow burning.

THis means that cooking, smelting, bronze-smithing, pottery firing can be done with fat. This saves them a lot of wood, that otherwise would be burnt.

Atop of that:

- polymerising fats (like nut oils, linen oil) are great sealants, that can be used to make boats (including crude inflatables), sails, waterproof clothing, roofs, waterskins, food packaging, etc.

- other fats can be burnt to a tar-like gunk, and thus used as a glue, mortar, sealant, or even crude plastic if mixed with ash-cement.

- military: they can use clay-pot molotovs filled with distilled oil. Combine with resin and fruit sugar and its napalm and Greek Fire for sieges and ship-to-ship combat.

- most importantly, fat is extremely nutritious. A handful of lard contains more calories than a person even needs in a day, and it contains some of the vitamins as well. Fish fat and oil is even healthier. In fact their whole cuisine could be based on fats mixed with vitamin-rich additives. They are safe from starvation: a rare thing for a Bronze Age society.

All in all, this Lipokinetic power (fat-bending? Fatcraft?) Would produce a fairly secure, well fed, and safe society, which needs for food, shelter, fuel, transport and military might are well secured.

Of course this is only a view in absence from the competition from other societies, which can very easily be far more powerful (likely, the more abstract their summoning focus, the more overpowered the society would be by using it creatively).

**** The safe-from-starvation thing was the big motivator here, because the city is set in an environment where there isn't a good native staple crop.

I also wanted them to be a military and economic power, which I may have succeeded in too well. Greek Fire is a powerful weapon. I guess the only caveat is that the geography isn't ideal. The city was built around the fat, rather than the other way round. I might have to make limestone really rare just to nerf them. Hmm... that could potentially turn into a plot point.

And yes, competition from other cities is an important theme in the book, although mostly in the background as part of the villain's plot. And I still need to flesh out the rest of the world, I'm not even 30,000 words in yet.

*** With what others have said, being a big naval tower and fairly wealthy, and with the cheap fuel, the city probably has a large and iconic lighthouse, like the Alexandria one.

With wood being used for varnished furniture and ship building, it probably isn't burnt as fuel even in the places where it would be superior. There'd probably be well developed designs for oil fueled stoves and heaters, in both large stationary ones and smaller ones for carrying.

Kerosene can reach much higher temperatures and energy densities than wood, we still use it as jet fuel and rocket fuel to this day. It might be possible for them to melt ores that were not economical to use until much later in our world, or make large fuel-air explosions by aerosolizing it using their mouths. Speaking of which, "fire-breathers" might be more common for entertainment.

** *Navigation and Mapmaking in a Shifting World*

*Intro*

Hi guys! I'm working on a project I've dubbed Skysong.

Himna is a fantasy world of floating islands suspended by “magic” antigravity crystals above the perpetual storms of a gas giant.

The crystals, and the islands they support and give life to, loosely orbit an immense Obelisk at the center of a shattered continent.

In previous WB wednesdays you all have helped me explore some of the cultures and technology that might emerge in this world (and more of this is always welcome!) Today I'd like to focus on a particularly tricky profession on a planet where the ground itself is in constant motion: Mapmaking and Navigation.

The floating islands of Himna are in perpetual flux, massive edifices drifting through the clouds, colliding, combining, and re-splitting in shattering skyquakes as the magnetic/gravitic forces of the crystals inside them fluctuate. Some have formed semi-stable mini-continents, slow moving and persistent enough for civilizations to arise, while others are small, independent islets flitting about through the atmosphere.

At the center of all this chaos is the Obelisk - immovable and absolute, towering tens of thousands of meters above the continent it bisects, and plunging into the unfathomable depths below. While it is not always visible due to clouds and global curvature, its immense stature and fixedness makes it a singular landmark around which most sense of direction would likely orient.

Various skyfaring peoples populate the world, and they will have marked interest in being able to track and find specific islands as their cultures spread.

I would love input on how a few different types of cultures might adapt to these conditions.

*Race 1: Azkhal*

First, we'll take something simple. The Azkhal are a feudal militaristic society of Dragon riders. Their technology level is mostly late medieval, with some recent leaps into renaissance-era discoveries made by their one-time thralls, the Gragir. They have an interest in conquest, and were once fully nomadic warrior tribes, essentially Sky Mongols reaving from island to island.

However, even in the early days they would have had breeding creches for their Dragons in particular mountains that they would want to return to. I imagine this would have limited their range and scope of their movement, except when caravans set out for new lands with a young brood mother and the express intent of never returning.

Writing would not have been a strong suit in those early years, but they have since settled down into a more stable and rigid hierarchical society with landed nobility. Education in the arts is valued by the elites alongside warrior prowess, and they would have developed all the trappings of medieval civilization by our current era.

I imagine they would have some maps of larger islands and descriptions of the relationships between important islands that house major cities. Perhaps there would be some moveable maps with pieces carved of ornate wood in the homes of the rich and powerful. Some work would be put in by court astronomers/meteorologists to maintain communication between islands to update records with their relative trajectory and predict their future course.

*Race 2: Gragir*

In the modern day, most of this work would have been done by the Gragir, mountain-dwelling dwarves who were taken as thralls in the early period. They are shrewd and inventive, and much of Azkhal's industrial advancement was made on their literal and figurative backs.

The Gragir have recently rebelled and struck out on their own, taking with them most of the Azkhal's newly crafted Airship fleet, an innovation of this generation. Until their departure, they were managing a rapidly growing inter-island commercial network, using the greater load and reliability of airships to move substantially more goods between settlements.

Theirs is a decidedly steampunk culture, and they could have technology as advanced as radio, allowing for much more consistent contact between islands assuming an unbroken relay chain.

I picture the Gragir's charting would be more advanced and mathematical. Perhaps compasses, homing beacons on floating balloons, detailed schedules of major Trade Winds, and clockwork maps with moving brass segments for the major continents.

*Race 3: Kipii*

Finally let's look at a more primitive culture. The Kipii are a tribe of sentient mammals, akin to large Sugar Gliders. They are capable of using strong winds to glide great distances, crossing the chasm between islands in search of fresh resources. They also have a keen sense of hearing and sensitivity to the Crystal's magnetism, the combination of which they use for something like echolocation.

Their culture revolves mostly around oral traditions passed down through song. They would likely have Homefinding songs that gave directions to scouts and explorers on what to listen for when making the passage to another settlement. Certain islands might even have specific harmonics associated with them that serve as names or homing signals.

Kipii navigation would be far more intuitive and instinctive, perhaps even spiritual. Their culture maintains a legend of a Lost City, full of wonders, riches, and magic, that many a young scout has flown out in search of, never to return. The Song of the Lost City purports to tell the would be reclaimers the way, giving through its melody the harmonic vibrations one must follow, but none have heard any whisper of its signature in living memory.

So, there's a brainful of storming. What other ideas would fit in this aesthetic? What tools or processes would people invent to help solve the problem of finding their way home? What have I overlooked?

If you got through all of this, thanks for your attention!

*** Very interesting idea you have going. For the Kipii i personally imagine a race that has been forced to be nomadic due to sparse resources in the region the live in. I'd say to have the way they navigate is to have each individual island have it's own unique magicfield they can feel. The bigger the island, the stronger the field and the further away you can feel it. The songs they sing would then have a certain direction from the obelisk while also subconsciously imparting a magneticfield that the Kipii can use as a homing beacon for the specific island once they get close, this is important as the island could've moved from when the last updated song about it was transferred to other parts of the race. The Lost City could be the an ancient living place where they lived with abundant resources before something forced them away from it. The Song of the Lost City is actually well known and song for all children giving them a sense of longing for their homeland, but it does not contain any magnetic guidance. This could be because the song does not origin from guidance to the place but from some magical melody they wind plays while passing through a cliff overlooking the city, or something along those lines.

An idea could also be to look into ancient nomadic tribes and their cultures. Ancient Mongolians and Polynesian tribes comes to mind.

I'm just throwing some balls in the air, catch those you like.

Now some questions for you; is there a general movement to all the islands around the obelisk ie. do the circle around it like some massive whirlpool of continents and islands. Does the obelisk turn as well or is fixed in place. Are there seasons and how do they work. How is water treated as a resources seeing as it has a tendency to down and off the edges of stuff.

I personally imagine the spot on Jupiter with the obelisk in the center of the spot. Is summer then when islands are closest to the equator and winter when closest to the poles, with spring and fall being on either side of the obelisk depending on the direction of rotation of everything. The islands would still move around compared to each other, but at the same time follow the general rotation.

**** Hey! Yeah great thoughts, this definitely aligns with how I imagine the Kipii. I definitely think it's something in between echolocation and the magnetic homing that birds do during migration. I definitely love the idea of the Song of the Lost City as something they all grow up knowing, but they can't find the harmonics in the magnetic lines anymore.

Polynesians is a really good idea! Now that I think about it Moana totally has lines about the Songs that help them find their way home. This is a great parallel, I should be looking to that culture and aesthetic for inspiration. I think they used a lot of star navigation, even very early on in history, to traverse pretty vast distances.

Happy to answer your questions =)

I think the larger islands do orbit somewhat consistently, but it's not as predictable as planetary orbits due to changes in wind and fluctuations in magnetism, and the interactions between the different islands when they pass by or collide with each other. There's a few big continents that generally drift in a fixed trajectory, but many middle and smaller islands that are moving very chaotically through this space.

The obelisk itself is essentially fixed as the center of the world. In Kipii creation myths, they say that the obelisk was the Lens through which their Goddess created the universe, but that it shattered when her essence entered it to manifest the physical world, sending the shards of crystal and islands out into the sky. Whatever its origin, it is absolute in its permanence, despite the cracks and slivers along its surface. No known force can move it, and its limits into the depths of the clouds below have never been explored.

Seasons are a really interesting question. I think I should probably do another whole post on season and meteorology to think through that. I think there would still be seasonal changes and regional differences as you traveled toward the poles of the planet.

your idea about the whole system drifting north and south to create seasonal changes is really interesting, I may have to give that some thought and consider how the obelisk plays into it. it could be that as islands rotate around the obelisk they tend deeper into the north or south poles and have seasons based on their latitude. The spin of the planet would mean you have very complex seasonal cycles, as you might do a full circuit out of sync with the planetary year, and have several mini-winters followed by a super winter when your island's movement lined up with the planet's tilt. Calculating all this would be a tremendous job for budding scientists.

As to water, there is a weather cycle of rain, runoff, evaporation, clouds, and condensation that keeps water flowing onto the islands. the Crystal's "magnetism" causes increased condensation in their vicinity and tends to pull clouds and water around the islands to feed their lakes and rivers. Deep in the clouds there must be a massive sea somewhere as they start to condense with increased atmospheric pressure. The existence of this "great sea" is theorized by meteorologists but has never been confirmed by anyone who has returned. However, sometimes strange floating fishlike creatures and even massive Behemoths will ascend from the depths in search of new prey. There's good money to be made in whaling ships that can brave the deeper storms to search these out.

***** With regards to the seasons, if you don't want to think to much over them you could always say the planet doesn't have any tilt. This would make the seasons purely dependent only on the latitude you're at. But it all depends on what you want.

With the obelisk being such a main focus of the world i'm thinking there'll be a lot of religions around it. The land closest to would probably be considered holy land and something the different races strive to control, like Jerusalem back in the days. You could either have great internal strife between all races close to the obelisk, or have had everyone expelled from the area due to powerful beasts and be fighting to get closer.

With regards to the Azkhal and their culture there's a couple of things you could consider. Are there different zones that different people live in? Example: The high zone, common zone, and the godless zone; in the high zone you'd be close to the obelisk, in the common zone you'd be able to see the obelisk but it's small on the horizon, godless zone is so far away from the obelisk that you can't see it for the curvature of the earth. The closer the continent you live on is to the obelisk the better. Maybe it would just be about what height the continent floats at. Higher in the air means you can look down on the continents floating below you and it's usually the strongest predators that soars the highest. Maybe some islands are so high up airships can't reach them which could make for tactical settlements. How many different continent might they have settled. Are there settled land with only farmers on them which pass the main continents are regular intervals? Twice a year maybe, and then they have to pay taxes when they do. What kind of celebratory events are there. "Day of the obelisk"? the day your continent is closest to the obelisk, any natural way to recognize that day, or do they kinda just guess when that day is from the size of the obelisk. Maybe some holy object is the same size as the obelisk when viewed through a lens on the closest day of the year. Some kind of special event around the dragons mating season/hatching date would probably also be something you'd expect to see.

A fun weather phenomenon that would exist in your world: If and islands is moving in a certain direction a wind would always be blowing from that direction on the islands and anything not attached to the island would drift off into the distance because it's stationary while the island moves. Being on a very fast moving island would be like standing in a hurricane

** I am working on a setting called Lightrot. In a world otherwise dominated by feudal city states and temporary empires, a single city, Athens, safely tucked on the edge of the world has maintained stability and technological and magical superiority for 6 millennia- until one day, they discover radioactivity, and the true nature of magic and the history of their world is unfurled.

The magic system:\\
All sufficiently intelligent creatures are capable of using magic. The type of magic depends however on the type of brain. Humans, birds and land mammals all can use heat magic. Typically, only 5% of humans can use magic easily, and less than .5% can use it effectively; however, in Athens the number is nearly 100% due to intensive training and centuries of scientific refinement of said training. In the outside feudal world, it is obviously beneficial for the ruling classes to refer to magic as a difficult, ineffable, and often religious force. Heat magic consists of first creating a small mote of thermal energy within 2 meters of yourself, and then moving and manipulating that mote to create various effects. The mote can only be summoned inside a material at most as dense as water, and cannot be summoned into a vacuum. The energy of the mote is taken directly from chemical bonds in the casters body, but since one's mouth counts as being inside your body, mages do not have to become obese, as in a battlefield situation, they could sit in the back ranks and be fed sticks of butter. Mages can manipulate heat motes to fly, to create walls of heat, and to burn arrows in midair. Elves and cetaceans use light magic instead of heat magic. Octopodes (correct plural BTW) use another type of magic I will not spoil. All creatures, regardless of magical ability, produce a defensive shield the Athenians call Pridemight. The more intelligent a creature and the stronger its ego, the greater its defensive capability against motes. Pridemight does not violate conservation of energy; the motes are simply stopped , not destroyed, and in the case of light magic light simply travels along the perimeter of the shield and keeps going in the same direction. The average human Pridemight is 500 kilowatts and 2 meters, but the average feline Pridemight is 5 megawatts and 20 meters, so cats are used to defend buildings from magical attack. Other animals are also very useful for there magical capabilities: ravens, crows, and parrots can use magic to move at hundreds of miles per hour in short bursts, distracting enemies and sending messages across battlefields. Elephants can shatter Pridemights from a kilometer away. Pridemight only applies to magic; so if an enemy mage sets a ground of dry leaves on fire, everyone would still be hurt by the now natural fire unless the mage was actively producing it. With great difficult, a mage can destroy their own Pridemight and kamikaze, releasing about 160 pounds of TNT. The efficiency of magic is 100% at up to 25 meters, 80% at 50 meters, 60% at 100 meters, 40% at 200 meters, 20% at 400 meters, and ineffective beyond 800 meters. Note that in the case of light magic, the effective range can be to the horizon as the photons do not vanish at 800 meters, and the efficiency only matters when generating a photon far away, say to zap someone behind a hill.\\
The second type of magic is Seethstones. The Athenians recognize than the 2 magics are virtually unrelated; heat and light magic follow strict, simple rules and do not violate conservation of energy, while the Seethstones warp reality in creative and diverse ways. Each stone is an unbreakable frictionless sphere 5 cm in diameter. Every 64 days, every stone shines omnidirectional light that passes through all matter and only interacts with eyes, so stones can never be buried under rubble and forgotten. The stones have a 10 digit binary number on them, suggesting there are 1024 stones. The Seethstones play a large role in the plot so I won't reveal many of them, but they do unique, physics violating things like controlling insects, turning people into art pieces that represent their memories and personalities and can be painted over to change them, summoning bolts of lightning, teleporting objects but only the 3 most common isotopes in that object(so a human would arrive a wet pile of coal dust), ect.

*** The geography:\\
The shape of the continent of Lightrot is just the continental united states, but as it was in the Cretaceous, with an inland sea where the Mississippi is. However, instead of being 3000 miles across, it is 300,000 miles across (thus the small scale geography is wildly different). Athens is located where Buxport, Maine is. The world is shaped like a half donut- a donut that makes a full circle, but the inside half is cut out, so the side of the donut closer to the center point is flat, or in this case nonexistant. The planet is noeuclidean- the north line (not a point pole) wraps around the the corresponding longitude at the south line. From the North Line to the South Line is 1 million miles. The Canadian border is a seemingly infinite abyss a kilometer across, with a hurricane force constant downdraft, it thought to be uncrossable. The abyss border extends northwards from Washington and Maine in a trapezoid all the way to the North Line about 50,000 miles away. The Mexican border is just a normal coastline. As for the east-west curvature, the world is thought to be flat and infinite by most cultures, but the Athenians have measured an east west curvature suggesting a circumference of 80 million miles. The Atlantic Ocean has been explored to a million miles with no sign of land. The City of Athens is protected from the outside world by a river on one side, which provides it with abundant hydroelectricity, and mountains on another, and sits on top of a tall mesa. The sun of Lightrot's world is a torus far above the equator, that turns on for 16 hours a day during the summer and for 8 hours a day during the winter (seasonal changes are abrupt and occur every 6 months). In either season, no sunlight reaches the polar lines, and there is a ring of extremely high terrain (above the atmosphere) at the poles as well, so at the edge of the world, the tens of thousands of miles of water ice icebergs give way to rivers and eventually glaciers of frozen air. It is in one of these glaciers that Alexander Fat-Athens went to and froze himself 6,000 years ago using Seethstones, tasking the city he founded with one day reviving him to lead the conquest of the world. Without the Seethstones he took with him, even reaching him would require incredibly advanced technology, ensuring Athens would be ready for conquest when he was revived. (cont.)

  Typically, only 5% of humans can use magic easily, and less than .5% can use it effectively; however, in Athens the number is nearly 100% due to intensive training and centuries of scientific refinement of said training

The biggest issue here I can see is population. If their methods are so effective, we should expect to see them have a population boom relative to their neighbors, which eventually should result in some form of colonization as surplus population seeks space and advantage in the periphery. Even if they are perfect at suppressing discovery of the secrets, the techniques should spread as the more effective population pushes aside the less while bringing their techniques with them.

This could be solved by adding birth control as a very early and easy facet of magic, but this just introduces the opposite problem where magic using populations might decline. This can be made up in immigration, but nonetheless makes it hard to keep the techniques from spreading back along kinship lines.

These can be avoided or ignored for a time, but not for the 6000 years you're looking for.

**** The technological advancements Athens has allows children to be brought up training magic several hours a day every day until they are 15, while other societies need children for manual labor. The population growth and colonization from magical advancement will happen to Athen's distant only rival, but not to Athens itself because it is not a normal society, consisting entirely of kidnapped "orphans" (the Athenians are the reason they're orphans) who are taught to not reproduce (one of Alexander's directives) and have access to non magical birth control.
