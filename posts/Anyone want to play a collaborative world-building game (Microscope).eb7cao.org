This post may be better suited for one of the weekly open threads, and I can move it there if needed, but I just had this idea and I'm wondering what this subreddit's thoughts are.

[[https://rpggeek.com/thread/716449/share-game-microscope][Microscope]] is a "fractal roleplaying game" in which players take turns adding detail to a growing world timeline. By itself, that sounds pretty dry, but the game's loose rules and restrictions can lead to an engaging, organic creation. The timeline isn't built chronologically, and each player gets nigh-unlimited authority on their turns, adding detail anywhere in the timeline at any scale, from generation-long periods to short first-person scenes. The game isn't about meticulously planning out an overarching plot, it's about throwing together a lot of cool, localized ideas and watching a world slowly come together. (I'm not super happy with this explanation, so I've included a link to the game's creator giving a short overview of the rules).

I'm a sucker for world building, and I'm sure there are more than a few kindred spirits in this subreddit. I'm proposing that a few of us set this game up online, with a slow turn rotation so we can have it running in the background and dedicate as much or as little time as we want.

​

Implementation Details:

All of the particulars are open to adjustment, but here's the scale I was thinking of:

- 7 players
- 1 turn per day

Some of the original game rules would have to be cut for long-form play, specifically the direct roleplaying aspect for scenes (When creating a first-person scene, a player usually proposes a question and all the players then roleplay and improvise that scene until the question is answered). We also would likely loosen the detail restrictions for player entries, because if you're only getting one turn a week, you might want to flesh out that city you're adding, or the setting for an assassination, or whatever else you've got stewing.

The game is usually played by writing entries on notecards and laying them out to create the timeline, allowing easy stretching and nesting. In this online form, I'm thinking we'd create a small wiki, allowing posts of arbitrary length which can be nested in larger periods or inserted anywhere on the timeline, ideally with the ability to comment (non-canonically) on each others' entries.

​

To finish up this long post, I have no idea if this would end up being fun to play, or if the implementation details will pan out, but if anyone's interested in giving it a go, I'd love to experiment with it.

Let me know if you're interested, if you have questions, or if you think it will or won't work :)

*** Keeping required time commitments low is an essential, at least for the game I want to play. Hopefully if the minimum is low enough that it never becomes a chore, even if you're having a busy week, then the game will be able to last for a while.

Questions\\
-Does the rule book need to be bought?\\
-How would it work? As I'm presuming that the participants will be online and the game is intended to be played in real life with note cards.

*** The rulebook is on library genesis. Obviously "microscope" has way too many results to comb through, but searching the author's name will return it quickly. I can't post a link publicly (for reasons detailed in edit), but PM me if you need one. Or just search libgen like I said.

EDIT: Can't give a link publicly, sub is forced by reddit to stop the free distribution of information. Not the sub's fault (Although subs that aren't focused on piracy specifically aren't hit very often AFAIK, and even piracy specific subs can usually live for awhile before needing to migrate, so actually enforcing it actively beyond the most brazen stuff is probably overkill, especially when it's piracy of books which is less actively fought against than music, movies and TV. Still, I understand the caution. Down with intellectual property, and down with capitalism!), but it sucks. If you need one you'll have to PM me, or just search libgen like I said.

**** Reddit has sitewide rules against piracy, which this subreddit follows, not that it comes up very often. You can [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b28d9q/rpiracy_has_received_a_notice_of_multiple/][see this thread on /r/piracy]] which shows what a message from Reddit Legal looks like. I don't want this sub to be on the receiving end of one of those, and will comply (via removal) with any reports pointing out something that constitutes distribution of pirated material as I understand Reddit sees it. If you want to pirate, do it on your own time, with your own resources.

*** The rule book definitely doesn't need to be bought, though it may help if one of us does want to buy it. I won't have access to my rule book until after the holidays, so we'll probably just be going by ear with the rules as I remember them. I've also got some ideas for a few rule changes to better accommodate an online, long-form game.

I'm currently testing out a very simple google site, which I'll share for editing with all the players. Entries will take the form of pages on the site, and with links to any nested entries. It won't be the most convenient possible medium for this game, but I think it'll still be pretty easy to use.

*** Unless someone in the current group leaves, we're all full up for this game. But as DrFretNot has commented, a second group is definitely possible if someone takes the initiative to set it up. It's not like you need to get up to 7 players. None of the rules I've set up have been tested, and it may be that more or fewer players is better.

**** I'm interested in setting up a group, but I'm going to wait because it sounds like (1) this is the first time you're running Microscope online and (2) you're adapting it yourself rather than using anyone else's tried-and-true methods, and I'd like to see what works/doesn't work before I move forward.

If your group doesn't want to make the game public, for whatever reason, could you PM me in a couple of months to say "This, this, and this worked; that and that didn't work; and this other thing sooort of worked but in retrospect I'd do it differently"?

***** Yea, we're in uncharted waters here, at least as far as I know, so it definitely makes sense to wait and see how this experiment goes.

I'll either edit a public link onto the original post, or I'll try to remember to send you that message in a couple months.

** I'd definitely be down, as long as being an experienced writer isn't a requirement. I've done worldbuilding for fun before but I've done very little fiction writing that was actually meant to be READ by anyone since high school. I do have TTRPG experience, but only as a player so far, I'm still planning my first campaign as a GM.

One day per week sounds like a time investment I can make as long as it's not a big deal if I occasionally end up busy on a day and can't post much (or even at all, as long as that doesn't happen /too/ often). I don't actually anticipate this being a huge problem, I just can't promise my schedule won't change.

I wonder if there's a way we can make the "scenes" aspect work? Probably not with ALL the players, but maybe we could have a discord where players can coordinate to do scenes between two or more of us? Eg, we might not stop normal play to do a scene with all of us, but if someone creates a scene on their turn they might reach out on discord, see who's available and interested in that scene and play it out when possible, not necessarily even still on the player who created the Scene's turn.

*** Don't worry, I'm far from an experienced fiction writer myself, so any game I'm in will necessarily have a low bar for writing skills, as long as it's not actively hard to read.

I have exactly the same qualifiers on my schedule, so there shouldn't be any problems there.

And as far as scenes go, I'm definitely not opposed to having that option open for players, although I'm skeptical that it would get much use, especially if the player then has to summarize and publish the result. Of course, there's no downside to allowing it, so I'm on board.
