** This one hits themes that we're interested in, and tackles it in a seriously interesting way, but it doesn't feel like "ratfic." I think a ratfic hero would have found a better way to handle the problem.

I suspect that if the story had included a few paragraphs calculating probabilities of alternate plans working and their failure modes, and changed nothing else, it would fit the ratfic feel? But that would have dulled the emotional punch at the end. And it would have felt very much like the author making excuses for the protag. Which makes writing ratfic a hell of a quandry. Does anyone else think it would have made the end weaker?

*** It would feel more ratfic, but would totally ruin it. I can't imagine how it could be done well.

I don't quite understand this story, I think. Becker has a backdoor in her aug which shuts down her consciousness for 20-60 seconds following exposure to the radio signal, right? After which it no longer works, and she gets around that using a system clock change (lol as if). What's the motivation of the person/group who set up her killing the students?

And I agree, it seems like a weak way to address the problem. By this time mass shootings would have been occurring for a century, her actions wouldn't make a difference. I think. Certainly wouldn't stop China.

***** My understanding was that the first killings were set up in order to establish a precedent: something like this was going to happen sometime, so make it happen now, when you're ready, with the perfect candidate, so that people with sympathize and see things your way, and will therefore be much more likely to continue seeing it your way in future cases because the jury of public opinion has already agreed that these things just happen and they're sad industrial accidents rather than awful war crimes.

****** Yes, I think you're exactly right. Seems obvious once you spell it out, haha.

Aside: are spoiler tags needed for discussion of linked content? Seems a bit silly.
