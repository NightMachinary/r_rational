*** I kinda hoped by the middle of the third book that she'd get killed by the fae and the series would outgrow her, but now I only wish for her to at least get a last moment like William's, where she /almost/ understands what the world looks like beyond her blinders, and dies pitifully. I know her banter is funny, but it's more because she's had more time with the Woe and learned to mimic them, since there's no solid reason for her to have a change of heart at the point she did.

***** I'm talking less about what her apparent objective is and more about attitudes and worldview that would accompany that change. She's still behaving pretty much the same until the assassination attempt in Keter - pet names, milti-layered deception in the dialogues she has time to think through, perceiving achieving "greatness" as the measure of success.

Somewhere in the middle of the "plan" sequence Catherine begins to notice how Akua starts picking up their habits, and after that fiasco she finally manages to get a good enough read on Cat's priorities that [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/09/12/chapter-55-outskirts/][chapter 55]] is more or less a close retelling of a less patient reader's arguments, just one more step of escalation offered instead of "do not think, ascend" of [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/07/25/chapter-35-stroll/][chapter 35]].

From my point of view, neither the idea nor the form it takes by the time of trip to Everdark doesn't originate from the Grey Pilgrim: Akua's been thinking about wiggling her way into a "redemption" since her [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/05/30/interlude-kaleidoscope-iv/][plan of escape failed]], and ironed the kinks out at some point before [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/10/22/chapter-66-tremors/][chapter 66]]. By then it was clear that Cat wasn't going to fight the crusaders head on and would rather coopt the Grand Alliance for the puropses of enforcing the Liesse Agreements, in which Akua's usual modus operandi wouldn't fit.

*** Unless something changed from chapter 66 onwards (when Cat commands her to reveal her plans), I am of the opinion she is still the same prideful monster. Being pleasant, flirting with and growing on Catherine, being helpful and working towards her goals are all stated parts of her plan to survive. She almost screwed Catherine over when she tried advocating for her against the sisters to the point that Cat had to maneuver both.

A few times now she has mentioned stories of her past. On one she mentions she should have killed her mother herself, "mother to daughter". And now she tells the tale of her grand uncle being tortured and killed by blood /sweating/ for a year by his brother in an effort to prove Praes/Sahelians are not beyond kindness and can be redeemed. I have no words.

I don't get why she is still here. Time and time again it was mentioned how you shouldn't rely on a trick or tool, least it fails you when you need the most, like Cat is relying on Akua. She is a bloody nuclear disaster waiting to happen /again/. A smart political advisor is not worth this much risk.

*** She's not the same monster, but she is still a monster. Her choice to not turn on Cat last book was real. At the very least, she's decided to hitch her wagon to Cat's unambiguously.

However, given that she's capable of change, she also capable of backsliding. She's a snake and, given enough opportunity, would eventually bite. There's an interesting discussion to whether Akua is (trying to be) Cat's friend or whether she's using it just for story potential. Her ultimate goal is survival and their's setup for both. There's also the fact that she chose the friendship story path over others, arguably. I wouldn't trust a wholly resurrected Akua though.

** I think I see a parallel in the arc of Cat's story and of Black's.

Black avoided many of the potential pitfalls of Evil by siding with Malicia; advising her and letting her climb the Tower was not what even some of the other Calamities expected or wanted from him.

Cat's story replaces the Tower with Apotheosis. She took many of the steps along that road, and handed it off to another, who she remains an advisor to. The power that the other wields can still advance her goals, if imperfectly.
