Don't read it, work in Important stuff instead.

But this does read a /lot/ like it should be the first chapter of Ra.

****** [[/u/sam512]] ended the story on a controversial, but realistic, note. It's not the most satisfactory ending, although I wouldn't call it bad. I think he mentioned burning out on fiction a bit, and it's not what I'd consider his best work.

If you're going to read stuff on qntm, read through his short stories, or the ed stories, of fine structure.

******** Especially the bit on how biologicals still resemble virtuals so much that we, the readers, view them as practically identical!

Sam's Ra [[#s][spoilers]] that the ending comes off as unsatisfactory because it's so far from our current reality.

I love how the biological is called an "old-timey racist" for being non-PC about virtuals. it added a nice centering point that no matter how much things change, human nature still remains the same about the Other.

  You can keep an upload going in the absolute lap of virtual luxury for the amount of electricity it costs to simulate their brain. Now admittedly VR means things are pretty cheap for us too, but it's still orders of magnitude more. The population's growing exponentially these days, pretty much as fast as they can manufacture more computers for uploads to live on.

This is not a fixed cost. You can use slower, less power hungry computers.

Still too limited hard drive space? o.O For processors, you can just divide the processor time for everyone. They will not notice a difference unless you give them a window to "the real world". Wasn't there an XKCD about this guy who simulated an universe with moving small stones?

*** My answer for both aspects is that this a world that until very recently was dominated by biological humans living in real time, and which is still sort of anchored to that. So yes, you could produce a lot more minds running much slower if that's what you wanted to do, but the point isn't to have the maximum number of minds in existence, it's to do something economically useful with them, which is tougher if you make them super-slow.
