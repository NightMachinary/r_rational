I just finished HPMOR. I've read Worm too. I'm a huge fan of the idea of web self publishing and would like to read more. I also have a vague idea of curating a list. Up until now I've only used Eliezer's notes to find things.

I hear that you guys offer great rationalist fiction recommendations. What other communities on reddit or the wider web actively read, discuss, and recommend web books? Even if they aren't rationalist books?


** [[http://www.rationalreads.com][Rational Reads]] serves decently for rationalist webfiction and good webfiction in general.

*** Note that this is purely meant as a site to recommend fiction. There is no discussion or debating on the site.

** In general, the fanfiction threads on [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/the-index.63/][spacebattles]] tend to consist of better-than-average recommendations (at least, better than most other fanfic recs - though this is a generality, and not all recs there will be good or even readable).

*** Yes, Spacebattles has a quite amazing group of folks over there. There are quite a few fanfic writers who seem to write only within Spacebattles in the forums - several of them write well enough that they could easily do original fiction.

Recommendations range from extremely good, to not so great, but I've found that the lower quality stuff really doesn't get many recommendations.

** Well, /this one/ is pretty good (but obviously you already knew that).

Spacebattles and Sufficientvelocity have excellent creative writing forums.

Even just TvTropes can fill this purpose. Find an example of a story you like, and look at which stories share key tropes with it.

** The entireties of Peter Watts's Blindsight and Charles Stross's Accelerando are available online. I found Accelerando enjoyable and Blindsight mind-blowing.

** There is also [[http://webfictionguide.com/][Web Fiction Guide]]

The forums have some discussions. The discussion on the front pages is mostly recommendations.

I have been hearing that there are plans to change how some of the site works, so it's not so heavily editor-dependent.

** I just posted another thread with mockups for an idea I've been messing around with for a while:

[[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/30ed4d/feedback_please_siteapp_that_tracks_unread/]]

It's an app that keeps track of where you are in several different web books, and notifies you when new chapters are available. It links directly to the author's content. Like the podcast app but for web fiction.
