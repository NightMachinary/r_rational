Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** See if you can munchkin a 'guidepost spell' that came up in a RP group recently. I didn't make this spell, but when told about it I thought it would be interesting to munchkin.

Note that the local tech level is Edo period Japan, the year 1605. Explaining the entire setting would take all day.

#+begin_quote
  You have earned favor with a nigh-omniscient guiding god. Once per day you can cast a spell that allows you to see the 'shortest safe path' to your party's destination. You pray to the god, tell them where you want to go, and then they make you hallucinate lines on the ground leading you there.
#+end_quote

When I heard about this I naturally had some questions.

- 'Safe' in this case means 'your chance of death if you follow this path is less than x%' where x is a unknown small number. The god can see many possible futures and will guide you on the path that gets you to your destination as soon as possible while keeping your chance of death below x%.

- You don't know x just because you know the spell.

- If no path is possible that keeps your chance of death below the threshold, the path offered will ignore safety concerns entirely and happily guide you to your death.

- If no path is possible regardless of safety, you see nothing.

- If you ask for 'the nearest pile of treasure worth X' it will guide you to a pile of treasure worth that amount. It will also guide you to people you've met or can imagine in sufficient detail, or even vague things like 'the nearest person who likes the color blue more than I do'.

- You an only see the lines out to a distance of ten kilometers. The lines disappear after twenty-four hours, even if your journey would take longer than that.

- The path might rely on you doing things like 'stealing a boat' or 'not drawing the attention of a group of bandits'. The guiding god deliberately rejects meta thinking on your part: if you think "I can just waltz past these bandits, the path is safe!" they will attack you.

- To elaborate, your mind state when you ask for the spell is all the god considers. (Presumably the simulations substitute some generic version of 'you' when deciding how safe a path is, and that version of you pretends it's not following a path. This part confused me.)

- Despite that, the spell is vulnerable to abuse from those outside your party. For example, if you arrange to be killed by someone outside of the party unless your path takes you to an address that is the combination for a lock, the god will guide you to that address if it exists.

- The god simulates everyone in the universe perfectly except for those in your party.

How would you munchkin this spell from inside the party? From outside?

I will answer questions about the spell as best as I can.

Edits/answers:

- The power only guides you to things that currently exist.

*** Depending on how lenient "vague things" means, you can have some serious shenanigans happen.

Carve large letters in the ground for each letter in your alphabet (and some characters for punctuation). Hire someone outside of the party to record which letters you step on.

Then, ask your god for a path to a scroll written by the person you hired that answers the question:

What are the instructions that will allow my party to control the country within 10 years?

What are the design specifications and explanations that will allow for the greatest advancement from our current technology level within 10 years?

What must I do to maximize my utility function?

...or any other arbitrary question. Also, if you don't trust your hired scribe, preface the question with "when decoded using the one time pad written in the book in my bag".

**** I suggested almost exactly the same thing.

The power only guides you to things that currently exist; asking for a path to a scroll not yet written returns no answer.

A further consideration: the god wouldn't care about your 'chances of success' in the instructions that result from this strategy. That is irrelevant to your safety while walking the path, so it would attempt to guide you to a blank scroll (presumably the fastest path you could physically walk). If you disallow a blank scroll somehow, the plan 'do nothing' is an answer with a small chance of success. Since no result can guarantee success, if you demand a foolproof plan the path doesn't exist.

Still, I thought it was a thing worth testing. Rather than carve large letters, I put stakes in the ground to walk around.

I didn't worry about trusting the scribe, though: good point.

Edit: Or there might be a path to things that don't yet exist, and the god might actually care about your chances of success. The spell as I imagined it wasn't the same spell the DM ([[/u/SirRaiuKoren][u/SirRaiuKoren]]) had in mind.

**** It is I, the person who designed the spell and spoke of it to blasted0glass.

Even within the context of playing the game as intended, these would be perfectly valid questions that would return the expected result.

The first scenario would indeed show you to the room occupied by Mr. Black's murderer. It may not be in the hotel.

The second scenario would show you the path to the /closest/ person who bribed Lord GamblingDebts, unless that person would harm you for figuring it out. It would, in that case, send you to the next closest person, and so on.

The third scenario would lead you to a magical weapon /you could wield and use proficiently/ capable of slaying said vampires. It is implicit in the statement that the seeker wants a weapon they could reasonably use.

Side Note: One stipulation that was not directly stated (but is implied) is that the Path is always true and cannot fail. If you ask for an impossible destination, there will still indeed be a path, but one that a mere mortal could not hope to follow - that's the only route available.

So, it's not just dangers on the path - it also takes into account dangers at the destination caused as a result of the journey?

So, if I were a diplomat, and I suspected the visiting diplomatic delegation in the other room was under orders to kill me; could I ask for a path to the visiting delegation, and thus find out whether or not they were trustworthy?

#+end_quote

This is correct. The source of the spell is perfectly capable of intuiting your intent and will use that intent to determine the proper destination in the event you seek a non-specific target, such as "any weapon that can kill a vampire." It will always give a true path in good faith to your intent, even if that path would lead you to an unexpected result - in the vampire example, you may be intending a sword, but you find the path has led you to a magical garlic field because the source knows you could use the garlic to better effect than a sword. (In the game world, the source is fond of giving unexpected results that are both true and more useful than the seeker imagined).

#+begin_quote
  Hmmmmm. So, I could ask for a path to 'yesterday' and it would give me one, just one I am unable to follow?
#+end_quote

There are two answers to this: a hypothetical answer, and the real answer.

Hypothetically, yes, it would give you a path that a mortal could never follow on their own, such as a path that leads you to a shrine in the mountains dedicated to the Kami of Time, where you would have to pray and just hope that the Kami would grant you time travel.

However, in my game world, time travel does not exist, with one exception. Hell is a realm that exists outside of spacetime, a plane of eternal darkness and endless nightmare, where time and space have no meaning and all that exists is the tormented minds of the inhabitants. There is precedent that if a soul somehow escapes hell, they could appear anywhere in the universe at any time. I'm not actually sure Tsukuyomi (the kami that is the source of the spell) knows about hell; most non-death/non-underworld gods don't, and even they don't talk about it out of fear. We can argue that hell cannot enter the spell's predictive model of the universe because it exists outside of the universe. I might have to think about where that path would send the player, but I know the spell is designed to always give a path that is true, so I must assume there is a correct answer.

Well, then, /clearly/ the One Path must go via there. Does it matter whether or not Tsukuyomi knows about it? (If it matters, then the path might first go to, say, a Kami of Knowledge who the party would need to ask a few questions of - not so that they find out the answers, but so that Tsukuyomi does, by listening in to their questions).

Actually, I think I was unclear. The path will lead to your destination regardless of the danger if that destination is /specific/. *THE* delegation next door will take you there regardless of their murderous intent. *A* delegation anywhere would lead you to the closest delegation that wouldn't threaten your safety. If that would take you past the one next door, you know they bode ill for you.

Additionally, if they know you have this power and might use it to that effect, they could not foil it in such a way. The power would know they were waiting ten minutes and thus leading you there would still threaten your safety (it is capable of perfect predictive models).

We were talking yesterday about an assassin that knows you have this power and tells you, "Walk around these letters in such a way to dictate a perfect plan to rule the world or I will kill you." It is assumed this assassin is certainly capable of doing so despite your best efforts. She instructs you to then designate the other side of the room as your destination, and will kill you if you do not produce the plan before reaching that side of the room. What happens?

The answer is that the path would lead you in such a way that - if you followed it accurately at a normal walking pace - would cause the assassin to Final Destination themselves in their attempts to kill you (some incredibly improbable event would occur leading to their death, such as tripping and breaking their neck). That is the shortest, safest route to the other side of the room.

Tsukuyomi frowns greatly upon abusing people to whom he has given his gift.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The Kami of Knowledge would certainly be the most plausible result, that's good thinking. If Tsukuyomi doesn't know and has perfect prediction models, he would know that the answer lies outside of the material universe and would then lead you to someone who DOES know about such things.

There is indeed a limit, though it is designed to be opaque (though I have seen some good ways to discover it in this thread). I can say that leading you to that room would not put you in any /immediate/ danger, with immediate referring to the duration of the spell (for the sake of the argument), which is 24 hours, and so the path would lead you there.

*** Set up a room with a door and a small viewport. The door has a lethal trap on it. In the room is a lever that arms/disarms the trap. Have a scribe lock himself in the room and watch stakes beyond the viewport. Ask for a way into the room. If the path leads to the viewport, then through the trap, find a scribe less susceptible to breaking protocol through bribery and threats such as the god's model of you can improvise. Protocol options:

- Tell him to roll a d20 each time you walk around a stake, and disable the trap on any 20. The number of loops you see gives you an estimate of x.

- Tell him to write text corresponding to the letters on stakes you walk around, and disable the trap after a thousand letters. The number of loops gives you an estimate of the security of the setup - a bribe or threat such as a god can divine, or the name which summons that devil which will gladly teleport you into the room for your soul, or Cthulean whispers that may break any number of preconceptions of reality. Needless to say, think twice before executing the divination of any text with at least this many letters.

Huh. Got an eidetic memory? Draw two parallel lines on the ground, one for 0 and one for 1, both stretching out to a distance of 10 km. Then every program's binary code corresponds to a specific path, zigzagging between the two parallel lines until you reach the end. Arrange for someone to write down the program code according to the path you walk, and kill you if the program is incorrect. Now ask god for a safe path to the end.

Provided the program is sufficiently concise, this should allow you to ask god for the code for any program. Now ask for the code of a friendly AGI.

P.S. For larger programs, you could make use of the third dimension as well. Extend the two parallel lines into two parallel walls, and get tools so you can wall jump between them on your path.

Lets suppose I asked it for the code to /Doom/ instead of an AGI (since I can't look up the size of an AGI). At 2.4MB, if you try to display /Doom/ over ten kilometers each bit is 1/20th of a centimeter. Memorizing the shape of that path is solidly beyond human capability, I'd say, and writing it down at a rate of 200bits/second (to finish just in time for the spell to run out) is not really possible either. Beyond that, you have to perform your safety tests before you reach the end of the path as well, which is a tall order for many programs. Don't be surprised when it's just the first level of DOOM--that path is a lot shorter, I imagine.

Of course [[/u/SirRaiuKoren][u/SirRaiuKoren]] has revealed that the god you pray to will see your intent and try to fulfill it, so you perhaps don't have to test anything. You've kind of got the ear of an AGI already.

So you could, for instance, program it only to be permeable to salt, and then dump a bag of pretzels over it and watch only the salt fall through. This substance has to be clearly specified and identifiable ahead of time, so you can't define the substance to be "only those Scrabble tiles that answer such-and-such question".

*** I'm assuming you only want uses where the semi-permeability plays a role, so I won't mention the standard uses for forcefields such as shields or telekinesis.

- You could use forcefields to make yourself immune to poisons, simply by covering your body with one that is permeable to everything except every poisonous substance you can identify (start reading up on some toxicology so you can do this better). And not just poisons in foods. Your forcefields can clean poisons in air and water just as well. Depending on how large or easy it is to create such forcefields, you could extend your poison immunity services to other people, or even large buildings/cities/planets.

- If you can create sufficiently large forcefields and move them around, you could fight climate change by making gigantic forcefields that are permeable to air but not greenhouse gases, then using those forcefields to sweep large amounts of greenhouse gases out of the earth's atmosphere (either into the ground or into outer space).

- You can be a great customs officer by creating forcefields that are permeable to everything but drugs and other banned substances. Or join the police force and hunt down smuggling rings and drug dealers.

- What is a substance? Just chemicals? Can you identify people and create forcefields that only let some people in but not others? That would be a great way to ensure no spies are sneaking into your base.

- What about temperature? Can you create a forcefield that only lets hot items in but not cold items? What if the hot item is water vapor while the cold item is liquid water? If so, you may be able to provide cheap heating/cooling devices. For example, you could put a forcefield in front of a fan that is permeable only to nice cool air, not hot air. Since air typically contains molecules that are at a large range of temperatures, this should work to blast cool air at you. Just don't stand behind the fan where all the hot air is building up.

** You have the ability to 'paint' any sufficiently smooth, flat surface with a touch. This 'paint' takes the form of a two-dimensional plane which hovers a couple microns away from the surface to which it is affixed. It follows the movements of the surface, is suppressed temporarily if the plane intersects a solid, and is destroyed if the shape of the surface changes (with tolerances similar to the distance it hovers from the surface). The optical qualities of the image are always uniform across the plane, and can be tuned at-will. The plane's reflectivity over wavelength must be within (0,1) for all wavelengths and must be smooth, but is otherwise under your control. It's properties are symmetric across both sides.

What do you with this?

*** Can you clarify a bit more on how this ability works? Are you transferring paint from a bucket or are you just magically creating it out of thin air? Can you use any substance you want, as long as it forms a paint-like appearance? If it appears out of thin air, can you use your ability to mass produce substances?

When I use my ability to paint with a touch, is the quality of the painting perfect? Or only as good as my actual painting skills? Can I mass produce indistinguishable counterfeits?

When I paint on a surface, it creates a plane that hovers a couple of microns away from the surface. But, a plane is by definition, a smooth flat surface. So can I paint on top of my painting?

What exactly happens when a painting is suppressed or destroyed? Does the paint layer just vanish? Is the destruction localized to the point where the plane is intersected or the surface changes? Or does the destruction spread throughout the entire painting? If it is the latter, it could be used as a form of communication. Morse code could be sent by repeatedly tapping one end of a painting and thus flickering the suppression on and off on the other end.

Also, does this paint weigh anything? If not, I could do fun things like making super thick layers and layers of paint on the outer hull of ships, vastly increasing their volume without increasing their weight, and thus making it much easier for them to float. Assuming that the paint isn't suppressed by water, and can be made waterproof.

**** You seem to have misunderstood. You aren't depositing a substance in a layer. You a creating an insubstantial two-dimensional warping of the EM field. It is an 'illusion' essentially. Immaterial.

When you 'paint,' your 'color' (IE the reflectivity curve you choose the plane to have) is uniform across it. So you can only paint a surface one color. In order to create a complex image, you'd need a large number of slightly off-angle surfaces, and you would essentially be doing paint-by-number, each section being one solid color.

When suppressed or destroyed, the image vanishes, propagating from the point of suppression/destruction. You could use that to communicate, but it's only light-speed, which isn't much faster than literal Morse code on the scale of a planet, IIRC.

The 'paint' does not way anything because it is not a material. It doesn't interact with matter except reflecting photons and being disrupted by solids. It can technically be applied on top of itself, though I'm not sure what use this has.

Well, it could be useful for making dungeons. Apply several layers on a corner of a hallway to make it look like a dead end. Apply several layers on a hole in the ground to fill it up, so unsuspecting people fall in when they walk over it.

Hmm, how about a different method of communication then. Get a brick, apply a layer of paint on one side. When you rotate the brick, the paint layer also rotates right?

So first, hang the brick in midair (use a rope or just put it on top of stuff). Rapidly apply arbitrarily many layers of paint horizontally. Since the paint is weightless, this should be no problem. Now when you rotate the brick, you can bring the layers of paint upwards, forming a giant pillar, visible from great distances.

While light-speed may still apply to the rotation speed, this is now an extremely cheap method of communication, since all you need is a flat enough rock or anything you can rotate. You can now rotate it around in intervals to communicate using morse code. You can also set up several pillars if you are lost in a forest/maze and want to keep track of where you have been before from a distance.

The rotating pillar trick can also be used to blind enemies from a great distance. Get a large shield with a flat front surface (like a riot shield), now apply tons of layers of paint to it and swing the paint pillar into the faces of your enemies. The paint suppression means it won't hurt them physically, but it will certainly make it very hard to see.

Perfect energy shield for a space ship? I'd think a ship with this could be a short distance from the sun (outside its atmosphere) and hardly get warm.

Can it be made reflective in non-visible wavelengths like gamma rays?

Actually, I suspect the ability to create 100% reflective mirrors would be wildly useful in a wide variety of ways.

*** Exactly how much magic are we assuming here? Intelligence and the ability to speak are both (largely) genetically determined, so can we start uplifting viruses or tiny insects with this power?

Assuming a fairly generous amount of magic, the first couple uses that spring to mind:

1. The most obvious one: There are several species of tortoises that don't age. It's not a valid strategy to beat death altogether (because there is only one of you and 7 billion other people), but giving yourself and as many other people as possible biological immortality seems like a good start.

2. There are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planarian][apparently]] species of flatworms that are able to completely regrow damaged body parts. While that is a useful ability to have in general, the really cool trick is that if split down the middle both halves can regrow into complete animals. Both halves seem to retain the memories of the original animal, so hopefully whatever magic gives us these powers is copied along as well. /Now/ you can start mass producing immortality.

3. This is largely cool factor, rather than practical use, but uplifting other species and giving us more than one datapoint for intelligence seems like an interesting trick. This power also conveniently doesn't allow you to create smarter-than-human minds since we are copying humans to begin with. Do the modified animals pass on the copied abilities to their offspring? If so, try to stay away from species that reproduce too quickly (or only use animals that are beyond reproductive age), creating a population boom of new intelligent minds creates a lot of moral issues that are tricky to deal with.

4. With that out of the way, we can move on to the cool party tricks:

   - Almost too obvious to mention, but heat detection and echolocation from bats and colour perception from mantis shrimps.
   - You mentioned bloodhounds for scent, but both bears and elephants have them beat in this regards (between the two, iirc, elephants can distinguish more different smells, but bears can smell things from further away).
   - Wings would be neat, probably aren't going to be able to lift a human body of the ground, but still stylish as hell.
   - Prehensile tail would be handy too, giving you what is essentially an extra hand.
