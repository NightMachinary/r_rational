Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have the power to cause paper to spontaneously take itself through the series of folds to make an origami figure. You can do this at will to any paper that's in a six foot radius centered on you. You can also "charge" a piece of paper to become origami at a later time, but time delays of more than a month don't work - the charge dissipates after that point, so the folds are unstable. The difficulty of folding scales linearly with the volume of the paper - so thicker paper is more difficult. After practicing this for a while, you can affect a 3ft by 3ft square of normal thickness paper, and your ability seems to have plateau-ed there. Your goal is to become a world-famous assassin.

Alternatively: a world-famous assassin with this ability is coming after you -you've been tipped off somehow. How do you defend yourself?

*** I can't remember where I read this, but there is an entire field of mathematics (in Japan I think?) devoted to origami and someone proved a theorem that any three dimensional shape can be constructed from a piece of paper. The catch is that it will likely take an exorbitant number of precisely made folds. They even came up with an algorithm to figure out how to make a snake as an example and made one /including the scales!!/

**** Yes to the printing press - I was imagining this taking place in our present world. You are delayed only by your ability to focus on each piece of paper you want to affect. You can affect multiple pieces at the same time, as long as the total volume doesn't exceed what I mention above. There isn't a significant cool down, but similar to using a muscle if you consistently lift things at the upper end of your range you get tired after 30 min or so. I'll say that more complicated triggers are possible, but must be very precisely worded and require you to meditate for one hour for every 140 characters of code.

You don't have telekinetic control of the paper - you can just make it fold/unfold. So you can't spin a circular saw made of paper ([[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rYfkhdKcEiE]]) but you could cause a bird to flap its wings.

You can also set up active 'circuits', defined as two locations in the paper which triggers if the paper is ripped in such a way as to separate them from each other.

Still, that's only mass-production of a one-month-magic-laptop per hour. Can I also detect what direction light comes from, so that I could throw face-recognition software at the input, instead of merely fingerprint and voice recognition software and folding pin-hole cameras when I'm sure no one's looking?

How does output work: Do I manually provide one/multiple API calls to specific fold patterns that can be used one/multiple times, or can the code specify them? Can rapid activation produce audio output through vibration?

**** In material aspects, there's nothing special about the paper while it's folding (i.e. it's not supernaturally strengthened and can only exert as much force as you would be able to exert by pushing paper against an object). If it's impeded, it folds as much as it can until the obstacle is removed, at which time it completes its path. However, this is subject to the same time delay rules as before.

*** Step 1 would be to find a way to attach a tiny metal blade to the edge of the paper, in a way that will let the folding function properly while still retaining sharpness (maybe attach a series of not very wide blade-edges to emulate flexibility), and now the motions of the origami can cut things as it folds. This assumes, of course, that the folding takes place with enough force to move the attached metal and use it to cut things like throats.

With 'origami' as arbitrary as it is, I take it that I can use my power to specifically induce folds in the paper towards a desired end form without tearing the paper or specifically moving it. Which means that if I know how to fold paper cleverly enough, I can make it assume an arbitrary folded form.

Given enough power behind it, I could take a long, thin piece of paper with metal razor edge and fold it in such a way that a large part of it is turned ninety degrees from the flat part resting on the ground. Then, another fold from the flat part will send the turned half scything through the air, and from there the only limits on what it can cut through are how much force is exerted by the folding process. This can be used to put a piece of paper beneath someone's bed and, if the folding is powerful enough, cut through the mattress and a person sleeping in it.

If the power can be exerted to unfold as well as fold, you can fold many long thin pieces of razor-paper into small paper balls in an unassuming package and have them unfold with great force at the right time. I'm not entirely sure, but I think you could make a bomb that, once it activates, cuts through everything in the house violently at random. This would be helped by somehow making the paper look like packaging material and putting an object and note in the box to ease suspicion. If the method works, as long as the paper's in the house when the timer goes off, you've got a kill.

/However/, when I think about the average target, the power's basically redundant. Why slice through the bed when you can remote detonate a bomb, since you evidently got to the bed to put the paper under it? Why send an elaborate sword-paper trap in the mail to destroy the house and occupants when you can just put a bomb in the mail? At the end of the day, I think this power is still outclassed by regular technology in direct applications.

**** You know, it's never said that you can't affect yourself with your power. And if you can move at arbitrarily fast speeds, as long as there's a distinct path it's effectively teleportation. So your space launches could have you pick up the target with your mind, take it with you up to space at the speed of whatever-you-like, then give it the right orbital velocity and let it go on its merry way before coming back down.

We might not even be limited by FTL here, so that's an easy way to potentially get to the nearest solar system before lunch with a 10m radius sphere of telescopes and life support to document everything. The only major limit would be ensuring your trajectory and making sure you have a way back (wouldn't that be embarrassing).

** While you have no powers yourself, you know that in this world there are those with the ability to manipulate minds. The exact nature of these abilities varies, and it can range from possession to rewriting hierarchies of desire; from puppetting bodies to issuing specific compulsions or mandates. There will always be some 'tell' to the mind control, however.

You are in charge of a paramilitary security organisation. What security measures do you put in place? What kinds of checks do you implement to tell whether individuals have been compromised?

At this point, my ideas are regular psych evaluations and surveillance analysis of gait and mannerisms (to catch if someone suddenly walks or talks differently). If someone is suspected to be influenced, implement protocols where everyone is to be observed by at least two others (either physically or through camera surveillance, randomly assigned each time), and specific individuals thought to be compromised put through an fMRI scan and analysis of micro-saccades.

**** Generally speaking, there's a hierarchy of the controls: subtle manipulation may be harder to detect and longer-lasting, but is overridden and slower than more blatant effects. So if a victim is slowly being conditioned via a Pavlovian-esque manipulation, then someone overwrites their personality entirely, the overwriting will probably override the conditioning. Likewise, someone who is compelled to go kill the mayor, if possessed, would do the bidding of the possessor. And even then, if someone controlled the body, the possessor would be just as helpless as anyone else to stop it.

Does that make sense?

This is a long and convoluted way of saying, "sort of, but it would be cutting off your nose to spite your face." Also, there is a (justifiable) suspicion of anyone who has these powers, and therefore using them in this way would be a last resort, if at all.
