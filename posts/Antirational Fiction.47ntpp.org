**** No, I mean, I don't understand what you're trying to do and why I might want it. "Primalist fiction" returns no google result. I'm guessing this is something talked about in some other rationalist-adjacent community, but there is an inferential distance to bridge here.

The problem is that primalist fiction is bad. It's no good. It's dark arts fiction. Intentional derangement is /not good./

** Not many people here will engage you on this. The rationalist communities generally don't take kindly to anti-epistemology. I'm not exactly sure how what you've written relates to anything in the paragraph above, or how it's anti-rationalist in any way, but I suppose that might be the point?

'Primal fiction,' using what you posted as an example, has been done elsewhere. If you're looking for rarely-coherent/surrealist/dada writing that appeals deeply on emotional and instinctual levels, I recommend you look into poetry, and probably heavy metal or other music along those lines. What you wrote did engage me somewhat on those levels, but the style in which it was presented (prose, all caps), does not lend itself to being accepted, especially here.

You should read Howl, by Allen Ginsberg. I can only recommend Howl because it's the only other example of primally-engaging writing I can think of at the moment. You might want to be in a more motivational subgenre, though. Not all primal thoughts are about fucking tigers.

** That's just misguided and irrational faith in a processes leading to blinkered monomania as a solution, all based on an overly simplified model of reality and likely a misunderstanding of game, information, decision, and chaos theory; but that result is also a strong trope in storytelling.

This writing example here is just oh-so-random purple monkey dishwasher, of course--acontextual and signifying nothing.

Irrationally successful monomania is standard low/modern/high fantasy or horror fare, typical of young adult and other simplified fiction written quickly, cheaply, and poorly.

  "Shouldn't we talk about this some more?" she asked. "We're up against this oddly specific representation of some of society's evils that has poorly explored motives yet strongly stated goals. Why is this complicated solution to all our problems up to this point you're suggesting the best and most certain way to win?"

  "Because I'm sure, more than anyone else in the world, that I'm right," he said, jaw clenched in certainty.

  Seeing he was having some very strong emotions, she suddenly felt he was right about everything, very handsome, and sure to win the day without losing any important body parts.

  He was.

*** What you said is unconnected to the doc I linked, as though you're just snapping against the fact that it sounds kinda different from this sub's default writing style, which...the title says is the point of this game. And if you're not viewing art as a game that means you're not here to make it, so at least criticize it with the rigor of a critic.

But as for what I said in the post, here's an example. Most of the data our eyes gather is quickly filtered out, to leave us with a visual model that's far less accurate than it could be but serves us far better than a more detailed model that used more mental bandwidth. Pretty basic.

**** Not sure which pills you're off, but I suggest get back on them. Science is good, medical science very much so.

If either English or logic isn't your first language, I apologize. But also, maybe don't front so hard if you can't deliver when challenged.

And if this is intentional, experienced, correct chemically speaking, and not affected, well...

If you can't debate, at least make coherent points in standard essay format. If you can't fall back and prove basic competence in either debate or thesis writing, few will take you or you ideas seriously. Things aren't being presented with any context or rational currently. Hardly a good way to comport oneself if actually attempting to share ideas with others.

Of course, you're not really reading this in your haze of dank "creativity," are you? Just reacting to random words and phrases out of context and without any real understanding of my points. And your next response will be just as emotionally and factually disconnected as this was.

Ah well. Maybe I'll be proven wrong. Doubt it.

Anyway, I'm not fronting on a thing, and you never launched a single challenge. If you have one to throw, throw it and I'll answer. Your one correct accusation is that this was written quickly and easily, partly because this type of fiction's inhibition-demolishing quality would be lost if it were overly labored or taken seriously. I have nothing riding on it. But that only makes it more scornable that you can't summon the small effort necessary to try it yourself.

The message I get here is that primalist fiction should not be pre-planned, should be written in a hurry, and should not be edited -- doing any of those things would be labor and/or taking it seriously.

Have I understood your intention correctly? If so, how do you expect to achieve quality?

If you'd care to pretend that I am a dribbling idiot, perhaps you could explain what on earth you're getting at? And how are you supposed to judge a primal expression of subconcious thought? The constraint of expectation would surely shut down the pure act of creation inherent in elaborating on crystaline eyeballs and ursine urine in prose.

********* Rationalism = consciously reasoning through things, which means bringing stuff to conscious attention. (Ofc, practicing rational thought is bound to make your subconscious intuitions more rational.) So antirationalism would be about letting your subconscious do its thing. Running with the current machinery, rather than updating it. So yeah, that's probably about right.

I think primalism/primitivism as an aesthetic is related. It's about satisfying the pleistocene mental ware we have, rather than trying to update it to the environment that it's in currently. Less responsible but potentially more satisfying

********** Rationalism is simply the study of how to most effectively achieve your goals, whatever they might be. It has nothing to do with conscious vs unconscious and if you look at Kahneman or the CFAR curriculum you'll see a lot of discussion on non-conscious mechanisms -- TAPs, System 1, urge propagation, etc. Rationalists accept that being a Vulcan doesn't work and that it's important to use all your resources, logical and emotional.

I would suggest not using the word "antirational". First, because it doesn't mean what you think it means. Second, because it's defined negatively -- the name tells you what it ISN'T, but not what it IS. Similarly, "primitivist" is a bad choice because it's associated with the term "primitive", which is often used pejoratively.

Using something like "subconscious" or "flow-driven" will get you a much better first impression when presenting your ideas.

*********** Be aware though that that's nonstandard usage. The standard definition of rationalism is that it's about logically reasoning through things. Even the techniques you mention are about trying to consciously modify subconscious urges.

Primitivism is a standard term in art that goes back over a century. It matches the use I ascribed it.

******* For this thread, presenting a hard-won heart's treasure would defeat the point of it being an invitation for people to post their own take on antirational fiction, rather than about converting them to mine. That some people are treating it as that, or as a philosophical assault rather than a chill game, isn't my fault. So I do think that was the right way in this case. Beyond that, that's just the heuristic I used. And it intentionally delegates compositional technique to subconscious irretrievability for a post like this. If you think you can conjure a better delirium with more deliberation, try it, and if you succeed, that's good.

I do think editing is often overrated. Too much metacognition can also become paralyzing, which the type of writing you describe could counteract. Both of those are a topic in themselves, though.

As I mention below, it's noticeably different from random words, so there's some degree of quality going on. Whether there are better techniques for doing this type of thing waits on someone to prove it.

Sorry to be kind of vague. Just ask if you want elaboration.

Both are a little too chaotic for me though. I think to produce the right effect, it has to stay close enough to coherence that you try to make sense of it, rather than immediately dismissing it as nonsense. But if it then rewards scrutiny with making more sense than it seemed to, that's even more substantial.

** Your writing is pretty good.

Trouble is... For neurotypical-esque people, rational thought (even on the level of just “common-sense skepticism”) works markedly better.

Actually, the most important part of "getting shit done" seems to be being able to overcome executive dysfunction: procrastination, bad habits, etc.

So, if you want to write fiction that goes against the classical paragdime of Rational Fiction (understand rules of magic, snap universe in half over knee) you might write something about a main character who Gets Shit Done™.

Write someone who has a superhuman work ethic, incredible introspection, and lots of “skillpower”^{1}. Such a person could, with relatively little epistemological prowess get a lot of shit done, though, say, politics.

So... In essence... Write (the musical depiction of) Alexander Hamilton.
