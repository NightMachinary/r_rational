Hi! I really like this subreddit and people here, so I'm thinking - maybe it's a good idea to create our own community website?

We could start with a forum and maybe community blog/wiki, and see where it goes from there.

Do you like this idea?

What would you like to see in our website?

Here's what I have in mind(just some ideas to discuss, not necessary to have all of that in the beginning):

- Community blog or wiki with articles on rationalist fiction (any suggestions on how you would prefer it to be organized? MediaWiki is an option, but since there's a lot of technical people here we could use github and a static website generator, that could be more convenient)
- Collection of resources for writers
- Book suggestions and discussions
- Competitions - we could have a weekly writing prompt and write short stories on that topic
- Book Club for group reading - every month we could have a "theme" with 1-2 books, read and discuss them together.
- Sharing your own rational fanfics/stories and getting feedback
- Work and Progress and Brainstorming - discussing the stories you are currently writing, getting advice and ideas

What do you think? Would you like it to exist? What else would you like to see there?


** Well, that sort of thing is what I've always thought this subreddit was for.

How about, before we split the community even further, we just try some of these fun new ideas here? The mods are very open to suggestion.

*** Hmm... I thought that a website could actually help to /grow/ the community.

It could gather all the information and resources in one place, to make it more available for new members, also it could have features reddit doesn't. For example it seems that for discussions something like [[http://www.discourse.org][discourse]] forum would be very fun and convenient, and blog/wiki would help us organize all the info we already have =)

**** The mods could activate the wiki for this subreddit.

The community is not big enough that Discourse would be worthwhile compared to reddit comments. It also adds an additional barrier, because it is another account.

** By the way, here's some thoughts on what kind of articles we could have on our wiki/blog:

- What is rational/rationalist fiction? Definition, tropes, etc.
- Best rational fiction books/stories/fanfics. What do you read once you've finished HPMOR and want more awesomeness?
- Rational nonfiction to read - nonfiction books people here might be interested in.
- Rational writer's resources(collection of books/tutorials that will help us to learn how to write like EY, everything in one place)
- Collection of the coolest fiction/fanfics written by people in our community
- Rational/transhumanist/etc blogs to follow, articles to read, etc
- List of books mentioned in HPMOR

Feel free to suggest what else you would like to read about =)

Reddit works great for these use cases.

That would be nice, there apart from EY's tumblr there is not much available. Hey, [[/u/alexanderwales]] would you start [[http://alexanderwales.com/][blogging]] again?

** I like the ideas, though I think some of them would fit fine here on the subreddit, and the various writing subreddits have many useful resources too. I'm writing a Fantasy book series (Almost done with book 1), but while I itch to get feedback on some ideas I am hesitant to share too much lest it become world building by committee, and book 1 is most certainly is not rationalist, though it hopefully lays the foundation for a series that gradually becomes it.
