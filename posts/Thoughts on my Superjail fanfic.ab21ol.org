** I wrote something for you a month or two ago, and this might as well be a nice place to post it.

#+begin_quote
  i'm being strangled by a stereotypical nerd's thighs when, on the edge of consciousness, I hear a voice call out to me

  "use what you have learned" it whispers to me

  "but... no! I can't! there's no plausible biochemical pathway" i would say if I wasn't being strangled, but it hears me anyway

  "have faith" it says and fades away

  i know what I have to do. i reach around for a glass of water and toss it on the stereotypical nerd. his skin begins to swell as boils and hives raise on it. he claws at the water futilely and loses his grip on me. i crawl away to safety

** Points for dedication. It's not rational fiction, though.
