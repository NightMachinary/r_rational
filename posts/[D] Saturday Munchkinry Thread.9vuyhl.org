Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Reverse munchkin:

Your opponent can paralyze you (and anyone around you) by saying a word (you don't know which word, and it doesn't matter whether or not you hear it, so long as you're within their line of sight and earshot). While you're paralyzed, your opponent can look through your memories and delete whichever ones they want. You don't know what your opponent looks like, or whether there might be more than one of them. You're ignorant of whatever other abilities they might possess.

Your opponent doesn't appear to want to hurt you, which would presumably be trivial for them. Instead, your opponent wants to remove all knowledge of them from your mind and erase all physical evidence of themselves from the world.

You learned all of this five minutes ago.

1. How do you prevent your mind from being erased in the future?
2. Failing that, how do you hide evidence for your future mind-erased self?
3. How do you defeat your opponent, assuming that they have no other abilities than those listed above?
4. The above, but you don't think you have more than a half hour before your opponent comes back.

*** Does the opponent know I know? If not, is the danger just based on them routinely polling the memories of passerby to find someone who knows the secret?

If they don't want to hurt me, and aren't actively hunting me, then honestly, I have things I need to do. I don't have time to battle an antimemetic psychic monster. I'll instead try to use my memories to communicate cooperation.

I'll write a message in big bold letters, read it multiple times outloud, memorize it, whatever makes the memory obvious to the opponent when they're sifting through my mind. Then I'll shred and burn the message so the opponent doesn't feel the need to break into my house. I'll also take a short nap before and after doing this whole thing so that if the memory gets erased, I won't notice.

If the opponent happens to read my mind, the message will state that I don't intend to take any action to spread information about the opponent, and ask them to please just remove the directly relevant memories. If I really really want to keep my memories, then the message could also contain an offer to act as an informant. Ask them to leave a method of contact, and in exchange for avoiding mind-wipe, I can alert them of anyone talking about men-in-black or shadowy beings or whatever. Maybe they'd be willing to tolerate a small compliant leak to decrease the risk of noncompliant leaks.

If I know they are actively malicious and need to stop them, things become more difficult.

What does line-of-sight mean? I'm guessing walls block it. But what about a full body jumpsuit and veil. Is the shielding from mind-control based on thickness? Opacity? Whatever the details are, if I know of a way to walk around safely without getting hit by mind-wammies, I'm going to share that information with everyone I know.

If I'm a powerful individual, I could try to lay a trap. Gather a huge crowd of people, have a bunch of snipers that can see the crowd but are out of earshot. Have a bunch of armed guards hidden in the shadows wearing protective equipment. Then have an unprotected individual announce to the crowd everything we know about the opponent. Either they do nothing and an uncontrollably secrecy breach occurs, or they strike and make themself vulnerable.

*** Well, 3 seems rather obvious. Some variation on delivering excessive amount of death from outside of your hearing range, such as traps with explosives, rockets with explosives, bombs with explosives, long-ranged sniper rifles, etc. Specific weapon would depend on the specifics of the setting, obviously, and resources you have at hand. Ideally, you'd do this while they sleep or are otherwise distracted, so as to minimise the chance of them dodging the attack, finding you and turning you into a vegetable.

4 seems somewhat irrelevant, as we don't yet have any information that would depend on time, and any strategies we could propose would either be too general or would depend on more than just time(see above). As for 2, that depends on how the mind reading works. Do they get your sensory stream? Your sensory stream + your internal monologue? Your internal monologue + translation of that monologue? Do they need to concentrate to read and understand the memories? If so, can they read 1 minute of memories in 1 minute of time, or is it faster? If faster, how much faster? When they read memories, how effective is their comprehension of those memories?

If they get your memory stream, but no translation, then it could be avoided by, for example, thinking in a language your opponent doesn't know, and then somehow convincing them you weren't thinking about them. This is for future encounters, as we can assume they would remove your entire memory stream for the last several hours just to be sure. To send information about this first encounter to your future self, obvious strategy is to write a message to yourself, hide it in a place where you would check, and then erase your own memory of writing the message, if you can edit your own memories.

*** u/CouteauBleu:
#+begin_quote
  How do you prevent your mind from being erased in the future?

How motivated is my opponent to hide its existence?

Because if it's ready to kill me to hide its presence, I'm kind of screwed. It can paralyze me with a thought, and presumably slit my throat or something similar. Unless my opponent is a ghost which can't affect the physical world, in which case I'll just send an email to myself.

How much evidence do I have of the opponent's existence? If it's sufficient to be delivered to the authorities, I'll do that and let them deal with the problem. If it's not, again, I'm kind of screwed.

I guess the spirit of the question is that I should find some way to send the information that will automatically be sent back to me, and can't be canceled by the ghost mind-reading my password or erasing the memories of the people I told the secret to... If I only have 30 minutes, I could send a PM to MagicWeasel and hope that my opponent either can't use GeoIp or isn't able to travel to Australia before /she/ manages to spread the information however she can.

*** This is exactly the dilemma faced by the police constable in /Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty/, when she realises that Death Eaters are going around, killing people and wiping memories. Her method of defeating the wizardly /Obliviate/ spells involved a series of hidden messages to herself, reminding her of the problem in question...

Following on that basis; my memories are not safe. I must rely on external information sources which cannot be easily deleted - things like a server designed to regularly email me a given text file, or a lawyer told to hold an envelope until I /don't/ call every week and then send it to me, that sort of thing. (Ideally things that can't be taken down by anyone else, no matter how many passwords they may have).

As to the specific questions:

#+begin_quote
  How do you prevent your mind from being erased in the future?
#+end_quote

As long as I am in line-of-sight and earshot of them I'm vulnerable. The solution, then, must take one of two forms - either I must never be in line-of-sight and earshot, or it must never be safe to paralyse me.

The first option involves me becoming a hermit, perhaps even going to the International Space Station to make sure no-one can get at me.

The second option is to ensure that I am /always/ visible to a lot of people at a remote location; such as by having my entire life broadcast as a TV show. Since the Adversaries don't (and can't) know when anyone is watching the TV show, they don't dare paralyse me (because any watchers will immediately know that Something Is Up).

#+begin_quote
  Failing that, how do you hide evidence for your future mind-erased self?
#+end_quote

Any and every way I can. Sticky notes under my breakfast table. Replace the music on my music player with voice recordings of me saying "Alright, listen up, this is what's going on..." Leave a letter with a lawyer with instructions to send me a copy any time I haven't called them within the last eight days (then call them once a week as long as I remember). Leave a letter with another lawyer with instructions not to send the letter at all until I either stop paying a (small) weekly fee or ask for it - and then set up with my bank to pay the weekly fee automatically. (If I can't remember what I'm paying that fee for, you can /bet/ I'm going to show up to get to the bottom of that).

#+begin_quote
  How do you defeat your opponent, assuming that they have no other abilities than those listed above?
#+end_quote

That depends on exactly what my long-term aims are. If by 'defeat them' you mean 'prevent them from remaining hidden in the long term', then I create a wide-spread piece of fiction including people with /their exact powers/ as a major plot point - along with instructions for how to defeat those powers. Some people will follow the strategies given, and eventually they will become well-known...

#+begin_quote
  The above, but you don't think you have more than a half hour before your opponent comes back.
#+end_quote

This depends a /lot/ on what I have on me. I need to send out a message informing of their nature; I need to do so in such a way that the message cannot be easily stopped or intercepted. Options include:

- Write the message down and sneak it into something that will be delivered out of the area
- Carve it into a piece of fruit and throw it out the window
- Send out an email to anyone and everyone I can think of, and post the info publicly on reddit or similar
- Use a sharp knife to cut a message into my trousers (the Adversaries might take my shirt and make me forget they did it, but I'll notice if I'm suddenly pants-free or if I'm abruptly wearing pants that I've never owned before)
- Or, better yet, carve a word or two into the soles of my shoes (I don't own many shoes, so I /will/ notice if they're missing)

**** It is distinctly different from the Obliviate spell because, in this situation, the psychic can see your memories as well. So they'll know every countermeasure you put in place to remind yourself and systematically destroy it. If they can't destroy it, then they may decide to change their mind and kill you anyways to prevent the spread.

*** So, I may or may not be doomed, and whilst the entity seems benign right now the existential threat it poses is clear. I must get the information out in a way that can't be revoked. Luckily the Internet is ideal for this.

First I buy some server space from a company with lots of locations. Probably Google. If you want to destroy the server you'd have to destroy a majority of Google's infrastructure, and subsequently everyone's memory of how big Google is. This requires the editing of billions of memories simultaneously (or a mass extinction).

So now I have safe server space. I write all of the information I know on it. I then create a worm(hah) as best as I'm able to spread the information. Let's ignore for now that this is an international crime. Worms are tricky to detect and this one doesn't have to be fast acting. It should probably spread via random emails and dodge Google addresses so they don't detect it.

Finally for good measure I encrypt the server with RSA and a random hash. Something that couldn't be guessed in the lifetime of the sun.

The end effect of all this is that there will be a worm out there that, even if neutralised, will likely be retained for study at the least. Plus hopefully the text would attain big enough viral status to propogate through other means.

It is likely people won't believe the text with the paucity of evidence I have, but at the least it will make overt actions by the entity very obvious. This will persuade it to either lie low or kill everyone.

I'm gambling that the entity doesn't want to kill everyone. I'd point out that doing nothing is the same gamble but it's not reassuring.

So that's my proposal, defeat the antimeme with a meme. It's convenient that the entity is so limited and can't grow exponentially like a virus can.

P. S Edit, I love your work!

*** 1) Don't give them reason to suspect that you know of their existence. Failing that, don't let them know where you are.

Also, if we're gonna rules-lawyer this point, wear clothes over your entire body and you're technically not in line of sight. Also, since earshot is dependent on ambient sound, play very loud noise.

Alternatively, upload evidence of it to the internet with a script that will distribute it unless you periodically give it an all clear from your fingerprint enabled phone. Have a friend change the password for you so that you can only get into the phone with your fingerprint. Leave your phone with a different friend. The being will know if they don't set you free they set themselves back, and from there you can escape.

2) Tell everyone you can think of, upload it to the internet, distribute it as much as possible. It can only delete one person's memories at a time as far as we know, so an exponential rate of increase in those who know it will far outpace a linear rate of deletion. It'll cycle back around to you eventually.

3) lure them to a wide open space with a single building (e.g. a farmhouse). Get some friends, get some guns, and get some loud music. Fill it with lead before it gets within earshot (again, assuming earshot is dependent on ambient sound).

4) Flee, leaving an obvious clue to a secondary where you're going next. Call your friends as you leave, and have them prepare the scenario outlined above. Have one of them leave directions to the farmhouse and then leave as you drive directly there. The being will find the directions; but since your friend is gone that will be their only lead on you. Now it has to come to you, and we're back to #3.
