Rational fiction is described as fiction that has a world with consistent rules and characters that behave consistently and logically.

*But that's the definition of good writing in Realism fiction; the world and the characters in it* */are supposed to be consistent/*

*Clarification*: */(I'm talking about Realism fiction in which the author is intentionally trying to create a consistent plot and consistent characters). I'm not talking about Magical Realism in which the author intentionally creates inconsistency./*

Another issue with Rational fiction is the idea that in order for a character to be rational they are */supposed/* to be both logical thinking and consistent with their characterization.

The problems is most characters let alone most human beings aren't necessarily highly logical in their behavior. *People are emotional and have flaws which cause them to behave illogically. So it's entirely possible for a character to behave illogically and still be consistent with their own characterization.*

Take a story like A Game of Thrones; Ned Stark behaves irrationally, but he's clearly intelligent and behaves consistently with his character flaws. In one sense he's */rational/* in that he's consistent with his characterization, but on the other hand he's /irrational/ in that doesn't make logical decisions.

So I don't think Rational fiction exists in any meaningful way. However, you can describe a character as being a hyper-rationalist; ie. they heavily rely on logic over emotion.

HPMOR is a well-written story about a hyper-rational character. But there's no such thing as "Rational fiction".

*I do think Rationalist fiction exists though, ie. fiction that focuses heavily on a character's thinking processes and using inductive logic. I think Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, Metropolitan Man, HPMOR would fall under that category. In fact most of the stories that are labelled as Rational Fiction are actually just Rationalist Fiction.*

*So I think it makes sense to get rid of Rational Fiction as a genre because it tends to be overly general and replace it with Rationalist Fiction which focuses on the transparency of character's motivations and decisions.*

#+end_quote

This is a false claim. There is very good writing out there that purposely bucks this style. Magical realism springs to mind; the inconsistency of the world and characters is key.

Or heck, even Harry Potter, where the rules of the world seem to change constantly (which is why HPMOR, one of the definitive pieces of rational fiction, was made in the first place). The inconsistency doesn't stop millions of fans from loving the original series, nor does it stop them from thinking it's good writing.

I'm not talking about the opposite of rational fiction. I'm countering your claim that good writing is defined by having a consistent world and characters. That is not the definition of good writing, because there's plenty of writing people consider good without having this.

#+begin_quote
  By good writing, I mean writing that is well-executed on a technical level, not simply an entertaining story.
#+end_quote

If the author purposely creates an inconsistent setting or characters, then it can still be well-executed on a technical level and considered good writing. As mentioned, magical realism is an example of this. I'm a big fan of /Cien AÃ±os De Soledad/ (my username is based off one of the main characters), but the way you've defined "good writing" would not cover it, despite the novel having won tons of awards for, y'know, good writing.

My point is that while you might enjoy a consistent world and characters, you don't need them to have something be "good writing." Rational fiction has these, but it has other features as well - again, see the sidebar and the definition and examples there. Good writing is not the same thing as having a consistent world/characters, and having a consistent world/characters is not the only thing included in rational fiction. Saying rational fiction is just good writing isn't accurate.

***** I meant good writing in the context that the author is /intentionally/ trying to write a story without plot holes or inconsistency. So I'm talking about good writing in the context of Realism as opposed to Magical Realism.

In other words, I'm saying that Rational fiction is just a label for technically well-written Realism fiction.

If the author is intentionally attempting to create inconsistency as a literary technique, that's a different issue.

I do think Rationalist fiction exists though, ie. fiction that focuses heavily on a character's thinking processes and using inductive logic. I think Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, Metropolitan Man, HPMOR would fall under that category.

That very particular type of good writing is rational fiction. But in general, /"good writing" just means something people enjoy reading/, and consistently logical writing is just one type of it, for particular readers.

Consistent plot with no holes = rational fiction, but

Not all good writing is (Consistent plot with no holes)

and not all (Consistent plot with no holes) is good writing.

Consistent plot with no holes is something that appeals to a certain demographic of people who like to over-analyse fiction, and consume content cerebrally not strictly emotionally. Since the same people are usually rationality-adjacent, we call it "rational fiction".

Now, it is important not to confuse rational and RATIONALIST fiction, because these two things are not the same. 99% of rational fiction is not rationalist, and a fair bit of rationalist fiction is not rational (inconsistent characterization subservient to rationalist monologues ).

** Following the same logic: there are no movies about WW2, only action movies featuring the military.

You are confusing writing style with.. Genre, I think? What you are describing is in other terms an "organic story". The characters act and develop in a self consisting way without being forced by the author or the plot to take an action they would not to otherwise. Game of thrones is a good example of this, like you said.

Rational fiction is basically just fiction with a heavy focus on smart characters making smart decisions, written in an organic way.

** If we just called this subreddit 'good fiction' then where would we get? Good is too easily confused with popular and I'm sure people have entire arguments on this very topic.

A lot of people are more interested in emotions and relationships as opposed to hard, logical coherent plots, intelligent characters, strategic situations and worldbuilding. Or they might just prefer quality of prose to plot. Rational fiction is like a 1960s era interceptor jet: primary emphasis on speed as opposed to agility, range, avionics, payload... There are a lot of things that make good fighter jets good and just like with literature we're primarily interested in one.

*** A fiction qualifying as rational depends on how transparent the chain of causal events throughout the story is to the reader? In other words, a reader should be able to clearly see how each event in the plot and character's decision making logically interconnects?

My issue is the way that most of these rational fictions create this transparency for the reader is through expressing the thoughts of the characters (usually the main character) and the inductive reasoning the characters use. In that sense I think the genre of Rationalist Fiction does exist.

***** My issue is that there are lots of stories that would qualify as rational because it passes the standard on the specific quality metric, but people wouldn't see it as rational on this subreddit in a genre-sense.

Because what they're really *focusing on is rationalist fiction, not rational. So in cases where rational fiction* */looks/* *like a genre (or qualifies in a genre-sense as opposed to a standard-sense), it's really rationalist fiction that they're thinking of.*

Therefore it feels unnecessary to label the stories here as rational and just label it as rationalist, because calling them rational is redundant and a bit arbitrary.

I guess the question I have is what's a story that qualifies as rational in a genre sense, but doesn't qualify as rationalist in a genre sense? Cause I'm not aware of any like that. Since in order for something to qualify as rational in a genre-sense there has to be transparency in the character's thoughts and reasoning process, which end up making it into a rationalist fiction.

I disagree, in the Monday rec threads, people very often distinguish the two: rational means internally consistent, rationalist means smart MC's. This is clear and people use it as such, there is very little fiction which is rationalist, but much more which is rational.

I see you specified "genre sense", not sure what exactly you mean by that, "genre sense" of rational fiction is just that its internal consistency is unusually high, it does not require anything that rationalist fiction does (even if it often helps or does contain it).

** My take, reposted from an [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e25rbdl/][earlier thread]]:

#+begin_quote
  Rational fiction rewards [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding][gears]]-seeking.

  By gears-seeking, I mean a stance to reading which is essentially the opposite of suspension of disbelief.

  Suspension of disbelief involves accepting something as a brute fact, not trying to understand how it fits into a broader framework, not asking why, and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8w95xIdH4o&t=26s][not dwelling on it]] (as that would interfere with enjoying the story). A gears-seeking reader is doing the opposite of this: looking for the underlying processes behind what's happening, taking each thing that happens as [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wyyfFfaRar2jEdeQK/entangled-truths-contagious-lies][deeply entangled]] with the rest of the world, and being curious about the nature of the coherent world in which these events are taking place. They are letting their world-modeling skills loose on this fictional world.

  One place to see obvious symptoms of this approach is with fictional worlds that fall apart when modeled. Gears-seeking readers will notice plot holes, idiot balls, and similar, including deep flaws as well as nitpicks. Sometimes this leads to attempts to rationalize/retcon the world by devising their own set of underlying processes in which events much like the ones in the original story do fit together coherently. Rational fiction which is intended for gears-seeking readers typically strives for internal consistency, where the world runs on systematic "laws of physics" (even if they involve "magic"), the characters do things which make sense to them at the time, and the society is what you'd get from a whole bunch of these beings with their physics and technologies.

  But internal consistency is not enough; rational fiction also *rewards* gears-seeking. The story is written so that gears-seeking leads to deeper understanding and appreciation of the story. For example, often a character's success depends on figuring out more about how the world works and scheming about how they can use these raw materials to accomplish what they want. If the story provides the reader with enough information about the world, then the story is calling on them to join in on seeking gears and scheming. (One of the main ways that a story fails to be "rational" is by not giving the reader enough information to seek gears; instead it's just one thing after another. The author may have a coherent world in mind, but the reader can't see enough of it to let their mind loose on the world.)

  This is a main reason why rational fiction is often set in a magical world and alien society. Internally consistent realistic stories can just use the actual world as background; they [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml][don't require world-modeling]] from the author or the reader. Whereas an internally consistent fantasy world can easily call forth efforts to understand the gears behind the laws of magic, how the society ended up as it did, and what awesome opportunities might exist for a person in that world.

  Much of [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][EY's writing guide]] can be thought of as "how to write stories for gears-seeking readers."

I agree that /rationalist/ fiction is a legitimate genre in that there's a heavy emphasis on a character's thinking processes and use of inductive logic. This inductive logic is usually displayed while the character goes about exploring the world and making sense of it; ie. the scheming and gear-seeking.

I think Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, Metropolitan Man, HPMOR would fall under that category. In fact most of the stories that are labelled as Rational Fiction are actually just Rationalist Fiction.

But the other qualities of Rational Fiction like consistent characterization and plot-building are too overly general to deserve its own genre.

Rationalist fiction as a genre covers all of the stories that involve characters scheming and gear-seeking.

**** I wasn't trying to distinguish rational vs. rationalist fiction in my old comment. To take a stab at it:

Coherent fiction is set in a world that makes sense.

Rational fiction is the subset of coherent fiction that rewards the reader for actively trying to make sense of the world.

Rationalist fiction has at least one "rationalist" character whose thinking the reader can watch, where that character's thinking meets the criteria for coherent & rational fiction (their thinking processes make sense, and the reader is rewarded for trying to make sense of them).

This is false. Characters only need to be consistent for it to be rational fiction. An emotional character is perfectly fine.

The thing we hate is when characters do out-of character things for the sake of the plot. An emotional character might do it because an exaggerated emotion. a cold calculator might do it because they somehow guess the right answer out of all the possibilities, despite it not making sense. Both are very common, and equally despised.

** I largely agree; other than in the unique cases that are unrealistic on purpose, internal consistency is just good writing, but I disagree that the label does not have merit.

Internal consistency (or rationality, how realistic it is w/e) is one of the multiple measures of what makes a story good along with plot, pacing, characters, and whatever other metrics affect an individual's enjoyment of a story. These are always:

1. Subjective and
2. Often on a scale, where the bar for an experience to be enjoyable for each is also completely subjective along with the point where no further enjoyment is gained with an increase in the specific metric.

In the case for internal consistency, most people's "bar" on how internally consistent a story needs to be before they start getting turned off by it is (in this community's perspective) fairly low. "rational fiction" is just fiction who's internal consistency meter is much higher than the norm, specifically designed for people who are sensitive to this metric. - You are arguing that rational fiction = good writing, I am arguing that internal consistency is a single metric out of many to judge good writing and rational fiction = good writing in this one specific metric only, which basically IS the definition.

^That is basically my argument, but to expand a bit more: a good metaphor for this is movie quality; yes, 1020p is just better than 720p, but for some people, the difference between the two does not affect their enjoyment of the movie. Rational fiction would be the equivalent of 1280p movies, specifically for people who are super sensitive to that measure of quality, and needs a separate label rather than just "good movies" because this sensitivity is *unique.*

As a side note as well: Individuals who are sensitive to this tend to also share other subjective traits, which makes us (I guess) tend to enjoy similar things and a separate label useful for this reason as well.

*** *Yes, I agree.* I think Rational Fiction is just a term for describing a sufficient threshold that a story has to meet in terms of plot and character consistency before being considered "Rational".

I do think Rationalist fiction exists though, ie. fiction that focuses heavily on a character's thinking processes and using inductive logic. I think Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, Metropolitan Man, HPMOR would fall under that category. In fact most of the stories that are labelled as Rational Fiction are actually just Rationalist Fiction.

So I think it makes sense to get rid of Rational Fiction as a genre because it tends to be overly general and replace it with Rationalist Fiction which focuses on the transparency of character's motivations and decisions.

I disagree with this: the designation of rational and rational*ist* is clear, understood and used correctly. The fictions you described *are* described as rationalist as well as rational. There are fictions like Beware Of Chicken, Cinnamon bun etc which I would call rational but not rationalist, and fiction like delve, a budding scientist in a fantasy world, etc which I would call rationalist but not rational.

These definitions are clear: rationalist is a genre, rational is a threshold on the bar of internal consistency, but because this is so unique often looks and acts like a genre. This is how the term is used on the sub and does not cause confusion. There is no point changing the word "rational fiction" to "how internally consistent a story is" because it is already defined and understood as that. And as I think you agree, we can't change the word to "good fiction" because this is false, its good fiction judged by one of the many metrics excluding all the exceptions, which is what we define as "rational fiction" already.

Rationalist fiction isn't a subcategory of rational fiction, because rational fiction isn't a category to begin with but a threshold of internal consistency.

** This is stupid. Good writing can't be nearly so neatly summed up, and rationality is not at all a component of lots of works, prime examples being many surrealist or poetic works, or any work not centered on character. There are many things that make a work "good" (ignoring the whole ass issue that is assuming there is such a thing as objective goodness). Rational fiction (which exists more as a community than as a genre) is fiction that focuses on one aspect over others, not because it necessarily produces the best work, but because you get different, interesting work.

Here's an interesting metaphor: when one is trying to learn chess, one has this vague sort of goal of "playing well" in the sense of trying to make good moves. A beginner, however, really doesn't know what sort of moves that consists of, and they're essentially playing randomly. One thing that a beginner might try is to replace that goal of "playing well" with a different goal, like, say, "move my pieces near the enemy king", or "have my pieces targetting the most possible squares" which is adjacent, but easier to define. This is a useful learning exercise, and creates chess games (or stories, unwrapping the metaphor) that you haven't seen before, that are both interesting in their own right, and teach you about grander chess.

And finally: if rational fiction were "just good writing", why are there stories that people here like that don't get recommended? If you asked the majority of people here for their favourite books, many would give answers that wouldn't get posted here. The two off the top of my head definitely do not fit the mark.

In very oversimplified terms, rational fiction promotes Enlightenment subjects like bayesian logic, the usefulness of AI, and the effects of hard magic systems on a world, while most fiction focuses on Romanticist values (the amount of books about technology being bad, things being suddenly overcome through deux ex machinas the protagonists "earned" through morality, and things just happening solely for the sake of message is very high).

An author is perfectly alright if they decide to cut out the scene that rationalizes a villain's motivation, and instead let the audience imagine one purely from genre tropes. They might weigh the pros and cons, and decide that giving the reader that extra bit of information dilutes the rest of the story, or that they can better allocate the word count on other aspects of the central characters' journey.

Making a deliberate and informed trade-off there is /Good Writing/, even if they choose to eschew a more Rational story in the process.

** One of the hallmarks of rational fiction is that the world does /not/ treat the characters as particularly special. Coincidences are /not/ particularly slanted in their favour.

This is not true, in fiction as a whole. The Protagonist has his own sort of not-exactly-magic; /he's/ the one who solves the insoluble riddle that has stymied the greatest minds of a thousand generations (despite the fact that the average reader has an even chance of solving it himself). The Protagonist is the only one who can defeat the near-undefeatable Antagonist - often through simply happening to be in the right place at the right time. When the Protagonist meets a little old lady and helps her, she turns out to be a powerful fae princess - or the Queen of a nearby kingdom in disguise - or to be able to talk to animals - or similar. The Protagonist is the one who finds the lost superweapon and manages, however unlikely, to activate it /seconds/ before the closely-pursuing Antagonist arrives; the Protagonist is the one who tries a risky maneuvre to escape and comes out of it unharmed; the Protagonist is the one who, when facing sure and certain death, just happens to find at the last second an ancient and powerful teleportation device.

None of the above is rational. None of the above is necessarily poor writing (like anything else, it /can/ be handled poorly). But it is all over Fiction, as a whole. So it makes sense to have a name for stories that at least attempt to resolve the above...
