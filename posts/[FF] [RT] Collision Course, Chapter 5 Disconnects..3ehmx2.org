** This chapter seems to have been less exuberantly received here than the previous one. Any feedback?

*** Well it's sort of a roundup chapter isn't it? It's entirely necessary and it needs to be there to bridge the gap to whatever they plan to do next and beef up the characterisation a bit. Hell knows if you skip chapters like this bad things happen but that doesn't make them the most interesting. I did still enjoy it.

It's like a structural supports in a building: necessary to keep the thing from falling over but people spend more time admiring the fa√ßade.

I wouldn't worry about it much.

**** Huh. It's funny, because this is actually my favorite chapter so far.

***** I liked it! It's a bit more relaxed and builds up the relationships between characters. Some of my favourite parts of the Culture novels were "just" people hanging out.

***** On a related note if you want feedback and discussion FF.net isn't the best place. I've had better results from spacebattles where people can have a decent argument about the points involved, and recently people made some fascinating points on the similarities between konoha and the cold way in terms of national assets as well as chakra and computer programming as a thing a person can do that makes them more awesome but few people do.

Reddit's pretty good for it as well. I like using all of them at once personally.

*** I like it! The listing of Jenny's upgrades was amusingly varied, and a great note of the fallacy of "too smart".

I promise to post more feedback for the next chapter ;)

** I'm enjoying it, even though it's a bit of a lull in the story.
