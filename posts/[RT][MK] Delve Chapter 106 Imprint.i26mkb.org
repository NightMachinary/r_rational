*** I think it's more that she implanted a copy of her mind to pilot Lavarro "in person" so to speak. Lavarro still exists but is being suppressed more strongly. Once Lavarro's mental immune system has had enough time to work on the problem the parasite personality will likely disintegrate.

**** The question is if the Warden will allow that to happen. She could have Lavarro travel to Watch territory to be apprehended more permanently, or just have her kill herself. I doubt she would willingly let Lavarro go free after everything.

** Bit disappointed after finally getting some action last week, but it was interesting to see Wardens point of view. Wonder what she's going to do with Lavarro.

I'm gonna be upset if the next chapter starts with Rain waking up from the stone. Hoping for some actual progress on his soul stuff there.

**** Thank you and everyone here so far for spoiler-ing these revelations. I really enjoy lurking here to see people's takes on the chapter, and while I've seen a ton of spoiler tags, no one's ruined anything for me yet.

Out of the next few chapters, maybe half of them progress the story.

I was under the impression that she's just going to walk Lavarro's body down to ... I am blanking on the name of the Watch city, V something?

*** No, it's been known for a while. We even saw the meeting where the Guild, the Warden and the DKE, discussed what to do about it. Among other things, Lavarro was expelled from the Guild.
