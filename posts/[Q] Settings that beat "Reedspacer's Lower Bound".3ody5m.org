#+begin_quote
  if your grand vision of the future isn't at /least/ as much fun as a volcano lair with catpersons of the appropriate gender, you should just go with that instead.
#+end_quote

How many existing fictional settings do you know that /are/ more fun to live in than that?


** Let's be fair: how many Utopias are basically volcano lairs populated by cat people, just with a different color scheme?

I ... am having a hard time thinking of examples of Utopias, for some reason. I think that is a really bad sign.

So, uh, James Cameron's Avatar. Basically a volcano lair full of cat people. Except instead of a volcano lair, it's the Temple of Gaea, because I am having a hard time determining the value in living in a volcano for more than a weekend. Also I don't remember the name of the planet in Avatar, because I already told you Pacman is apparently in my brain, eating my memories. [edit: Pandora! Right after I posted!]

Star Trek! Like spaceships? Like exploring new worlds? Because it's got the cat people covered. In the future, space is a volcano full of cats.

I tried to explain how Heaven and Disneyland are basically volcano lairs full of cat people, maybe even more literally than the other two, but I'm feeling less sane by the word and decided to cut it.

Not really. Most half-decent even-halfway eutopias I can think of simply aren't grouped as utopias. Nobody who made them was trying to write a utopia story, and to call them such would insult them. They're extremely nice places to live /precisely because/ they were meant to provide /backgrounds/ for the positive and interesting lives of their characters.

To give an example, it was HPMoR that noted Rowling's wizarding world to be a "zeroth world country" in which most major material discomforts were so thoroughly abolished as to be beneath notice.

To give a further example, the world of /Slayers/ features various wars between gods and demons and all kinds of "not-so-utopian" worldbuilding details, but actually, on a daily basis, appears to have a high standard of living /plus/ magic /plus/ various forms of sophisticated fun available via Zany Schemes and Simple Plans for all kinds of advancement. It has enough room that the main character of the series eventually grows to be able to control spells which summon the power of their Chaotic Neutral creatress goddess, the Lord of Nightmares.

Nobody has to call it "eutopia", but you'd still actually want to live there.

**** I /think/ it was a commentary on Orwell that made a distinction for me: utopia (or distopia) is generally a political message, whereas eutopia is more focussed on measurable hedons than ideology.

I don't say "utilons" because I see it referring more to what /should/ be good rather than that-thing-that-hedons-measure, and it tangles politics back in. After all, it's very easy to say that the political and legal structure of a eutopia is ideal, and then it's just another utopia...

** Well, Star Trek has catgirl-lairs with the Holodecks, plus you get to explore space. Which happens to also resemble a volcano lair, and be populated by people who look suspiciously like catgirls. Hmm.

Life in the Culture looks a lot like Reedspacer's Lower, I guess. I mean, the catgirls are mostly other bored people, and you have to ask a Mind for a volcano lair, but it's basically the same. But you die after a while, and there's other depressing stuff around... probably doesn't pass it.

1. You don't need to die after a while. You can uplift into higher dimensions, upload into a heaven, or simply live forever. It's mildly frowned upon (it's an "unusual life choice") but nobody forces you to die at 300 or 400 or whenever they normally decide to drop.

2. Reedspacer's Lower Bound doesn't imply there isn't depressing stuff outside the volcano lair.

I'll vote for Banks "Culture", or Greg Egan's "Permutation City", though I still haven't figured out what's so great about pretending to be a "Chinese Room" AI. Peer's final embrace of Solipsist Nation principles is pretty awesome.

Charlie Stross's "Accelerando" universe has people being pretty much whatever they want in as many instances as they want.

Linda Nagata's universe has potential. Try "Vast".

Varley's Ophiuchi Hotline universe is pretty much a blast, though his reboot decades later nerfed the shit out of it.

Of course, if you're sentient and catgirls aren't, being in a catgirl's position means that you would no longer be you. But actual loss of sentience is not needed for you to no longer be you--there are differences between you and even sentient catgirls, after all.

This sounds like a strengthening of Rawls and his Veil of Ignorance that captures what's basically good about his form of constructivism while ignoring the liberal baggage about "plans of life" and "procedural justice" that he draped it in.

For instance, it lets us conveniently and easily say, "[[/u/ToaKraka]] is literally a self-admitted sociopath, but it's still /irrational/ for him to support turning society into a dictatorship ruled by an evil overlord, because it's outrageously improbable that he would actually wind up in the advantaged position. Maximizing his own (sociopathic) interests actually involves building the kind of society that's robust against forms of power, manipulation, and domination to which he can't cheaply avoid falling victim, and which also robustly supplies him with other people's social cooperation when he needs it."

On the other hand, saying "that society has a 100 to 1 ratio of trees to humans, so if you live in that society you'll probably be a tree" is nonsense, because we're not going to be making trees from existing people.

In order to be able to say "if the catgirls are sentient, you would probably be one of the catgirls" it would have to be true that

1. nonsentient catgirls /would not be/ made from existing people, but
2. sentient catgirls /would be/ made from existing people.
