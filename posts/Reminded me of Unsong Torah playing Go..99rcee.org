** Seeing this here kind of made me excited!

The only problem is this is a really bad go game; it would be a lot cooler if you could somehow encode text into a go kifu that actually made sense.

*** If any encoding of the Torah that's not so ad-hoc it basically has nothing to do with the original information turned out to be a sensible Go kifu, I'd start reconsidering my views on the principles governing the Universe...

*** Given an alphabet of N characters, you could take the top-N AlphaGo plays at every turn, and choose which one to take based on the next character you see.

** I don't really have an opinion either way, but I would expect this kind of post on a friday thread rather than as a main post. What do you guys reckon? [Just want to open a discussion]

*** Yeah, I'm not sure if the same color moves are passes or just a glitch. I have no idea what they used to encode this.
