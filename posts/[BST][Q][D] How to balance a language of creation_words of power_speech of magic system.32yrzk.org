Hello, I've been having a thought jostle around in my head for a while now that there might be a really interesting story in magic systems that work off literal words of power, sentences etc.

I always love spells that work off of the statements of the words in the spell. "No Living Man May Hinder Me" is a favorite of mine.

But if there is a language of magic that got me thinking what's it like if your native speech is literally the words of power that can shape the firmament of reality?

And if that's one language how do other beings deal with that being part of the world?

It seems like this could rapidly spiral away and get out of hand so I was curious what various people's thoughts are on keeping the flavor of saying "That house is on fire" and so it happens because everything said in the speech is true.

And actually have a world where individuals can be rational and the power acceleration is not too insane.


** My first thought is that if you want to make an actual language like that, you're going to have to kneecap it a whole lot so that it's not broken right out the gate. I don't mean kneecapping the ability to impose words on reality, I mean making changes to the language itself so that you can limit how it expresses itself.

Múra-Pirahã is an indigenous language from Brazil. If you believe all the claims about it:

- There are no words for numbers, and only two words for quantity which correspond to "a few" and "many".
- There are no words for color, only words for "light" and "dark".
- There is no distinction between singular and plural.
- It's impossible to be ambiguous about how you came by information. You can't say "Betty shots herself in the head", you have to say something like "I see Betty shots herself in the head" or "Someone tells me Betty shots herself in the head" or "I deduce that Betty shot herself in the head".
- No recursive sentences.

Anyway, this is a stripped down language - about as stripped down as anyone has ever found. You'd want to make your magic language into something like that, lacking a number of words that would break the magic wide open and accelerate it into being nonsensical. You can add in some other things like the Hopi language's (supposed) lack of a past or present tense.

That's just a first stab at how you'd have to constrain it if you wanted a good story. You might try a different tack, like having an unknown language that gets discovered slowly by the protagonist and delivers creeping power in that way, but I don't think that you'll get much mileage out of simply having a language that absolutely enforces its truth on reality.

*** Paring down does seem like it could help a lot, and would even give a good reason for why learning some other language is valuable. But at the same time quite possibly very confusing if your used to speaking in words of power.

Another thing that I thought would be useful is the whole 'unintended interpretation' rule that seems to always plague prophetic statements of immortality. In other words the language is not necessarily solidly concrete as you would expect and so it has a lot open to interpretation and thus the precision is not really there to control results unless you construct a kind of epic poem that has to layer the more noisy possibilities up over one another until you can get something that consistently does what you want.

**** Make it a pure language, fully developed. But the power comes from your soul, or your life. Complexities add cost, and such you can say the word "fire" and cause a fire, but with little control over where. The house is on fire. Would light every part of the house on fire at the same time. If you use up too much power then you die, and the words only come true based on how much power you had. It would only be taught to people old enough to deal with that, and it would teach people to be very careful about their words, maybe to the point where noone says a sentence without practicing it several times and studying it for an hour or two.

So in Muran, you can't actually say that. You can say "dogs are dangerous", but you can't have a sentence nested within another sentence like that. English can do this to arbitrary degrees - "Jane thought Fred said Mary had proven dogs are dangerous."

Edit: I should note that this, like a number of features of Piraha, is incredibly contentious among linguists. There are only three hundred or so people who speak Piraha, and only a very small handful of academics who study it.

**** Just to add to this discussion, my cognitive science teacher told his class that ambiguity is an inherent feature in all languages, because to be precise requires including so much information that a random sentence starts to look like a lawyer's contract. Therefore, languages evolved to take the advantage of background information two speakers with a common language have to minimize the amount of necessary information. Any language without ambiguity would be more like a programming language instead of a natural language.

TL;DR - Ambiguity allows us to say only the needed information for quick communication (1 sentence vs. five paragraphs) and the listener resolves the ambiguity with common background knowledge. Any language without ambiguity is not a natural language.

The simpler more vague a statement is the less functionally powerful it is.

There are still some linguistic mechanisms that will be needed to likely keep it from being to potent but it has a kind of elegance to it .

** Make it a self-resolving paradox. A sort of living, quickfire, self-made prophecy system with an X factor. The use of it would be intuitive, but hard to study by those not initiated in the codex. Those who use it pull remembered words into weird phrases, with odd translations given after the fact that hint at a communications system made by beings not at all human. A dead language now spoken best by those people with a certain skill or talent, invoking impossible-seeming "magic" or altering probability, but only allowing one to speak in that language the literal truth of reality as it is and will be.

Not everyone can say everything that is true, as they'll screw up the syntax or maybe just not have the intuitive grasp of the language to even say if the coffee in their cup is hot when it clearly seems to be. It is truly "magic" in this way, and hard (though not impossible) to experiment with so casually. Sometimes, the language itself seems capricious, almost as if it actively resists those most interested in scientific poking. The language seems to "like" some people more than others, too, and different people find it easier to use in different ways.

The point is, you can't just try to say things all day to see if they're true. The statements just eventually all stall out, even things clearly true, your tongue unable to form the syllables. And if you try to say something that isn't true and can't seem to be made true by your abilities, and you really force it, you'll not just stall, you'll outright fail to say it properly, the words forming a garbled mess of noise. And then you'll die.

And then what the dead idiot tried to say still either is or is not, does or doesn't happen. Hard to say what a failed phrase even does in that case. Maybe a determined mind giving up their life for an impossibility sometimes works. Maybe it would have happened anyway or was already true, but they just got the mystical grammar subtly wrong while stubbornly forcing it. Or the "living" but unchangeable language itself really hated that person. Or they accidentally said one of the rumored "death phrases" that just burn out your brain.

Point is, unless you unironically prefer Romeo and Juliet as a model for your relationship, don't scream out in Enochian (or whatever) with all your heart that "she is still alive!" the moment your girlfriend /seems/ to bite it, eh?

--------------

Functionally, this would be a language that is literally proscriptive over reality, and paradoxically by reality as well. You can only say true things and cast true spells. Say, "fire hits them." Very rarely, or with a very skilled mystical grammatician, that might mean a fireball comes from your hands, flies across the room, and hits someone that you indicated with your gesture.

More often, it means someone gets mad at you casting at them, rushes you, but then stumbles and falls head first into the fireplace. Did you get the object and subject backward? Not clear. It doesn't happen the same way every time, and the variation isn't your intent or pronunciation but what is possible for the speaker's context and some unknown but rather limiting X factor that might be the will of a sentient magical system. No bringing down the moon, for example. Trying too hard will just get you fatally tongue-tied.

--------------

This makes for two interesting types of "mages":

1. Those who can get proactive future results by seeming random chance but do much bettering at finding truth results on present or past subjects. After long research and study of a subject or situation, they'll try to say it is a certain way and it usually will be. Did they determine this through logic or magic? Hard to tell. But their results are the truest things possible. Big effects stall more often than not for them.
2. Those who can get "supernatural" results that seem to scoff at physics, but usually with more unpredictable and chaotic effects. Often, even small and simple phrases stall on them. They have trouble with introspective types of use of language, and work better at causing things to happen externally and going forward.

A big plot hook is figuring out who is which, and why some people sometimes swap from one type to the other.

And, of course, someone will say something that seems impossible or like it would be a really Bad Thing without thinking and without seeming effort. So were they describing some impossible future that would have happened anyway? Did they cause the Bad Thing by saying what they did? Good plot hooks abound.

--------------

To make things balanced instead of out of control, you can't answer complicated questions with a "yes" or "no" and thereby resolve deeply nested queries, nor can you guess at things that might be possible by trying to say lots of things that might be true. That's a good way to trip into a nosebleedy early grave. You can say something like, "what is written here is true." But it doesn't always work, so you'll get a lot of false negatives. And the more you try to do at once, with books or stacks of notes, generally the more likely it will stall on you. And for some reason, the word for "truth" is more fluid in magical tongue than even in English.

It should also be obvious that no modern technical words exist, and borrow words do jack shit. And maybe the language doesn't include the concept of null or empty sets or zero, either. That should cover most magic exploits for knowledge about P vs NP, magical guessers, genie computers, and such.

I'd also suggest making saying negatives or exclusions completely impossible. So you couldn't say, "No Living Man," or "Only Women," but if you could manage to say, "I *Can* Hinder John," you'll get a shot at doing just that without an Evil Genie effect of all people named John somehow being affected. Usually, most of the time. Magic isn't malicious, but it is exact and dangerous to depend on. "I am proof against all blades," might make shaving rough and still do nothing against a punch dagger, for example.

And remember, no negatives. So you'll have to make statements about returning to previous states, not undoing or negating something. Tricky, and sometimes not very exact.

On the other hand, no extra effects occur, like with malicious genies. You get exactly what is described, if you get anything at all. If you say "I find 10 coins in this box," they won't each be the size of a house and fall from the sky, crushing you and the just opened box. A coin is as your understanding of the language makes it, as are the other concepts. You don't, perhaps /can't/ use magic language words you don't understand rather well. And you don't get that sort of thing that wrong. It is more like a computer program in that way. Which just defines how dangerous it is, if you think about it.

Oh, and no human genders, gendered nouns, or gendered pronouns. Just to make targeted casting and friend-foe identification in the field lots of fun. Emotions work really well, though. And there seem to be three gender-like concepts that don't map to humans or anything else truthfully /at all/, and thus are very hard to talk about comparatively in a language with no negatives. One of them seems to involve larva, a word like "host", and not in a way related to the other two unknowable genders. Few spend much time in ancient language gender studies without going mad, or at least totally off stuffed bell peppers for some reason.

Make all adjectives really weird sounding, and positive remember, and all nouns sound sort of off when written out for the reader in English. Like, a person might be intuitively described in the heat of battle as a "desperate land-pig friend with long whiskers". And yes, they have a mustache, but they aren't fat or otherwise pig-like to anyone else. Not even the caster, after they've had time to consider it. Odd.

--------------

As for the world? Depends on how common everything is, and how well known. Some ideas.

- People will claim things are magically true that aren't, because only those who both know the magical language and hear it spoken in person will know it was a true phrase being said and that later claims are accurate.

  - Thus, "the king is evil" won't be something everyone will automatically know and trust to be true.
  - But every one of his Dukes might pay to have this and other things found out.
  - Expect secrets to be easier to keep than in some magical systems. Rich people will have just as easy a time finding things out, but specific people (think, Snowden) might leak certain secrets in ways that people will believe.

- Gagging all prisoners seems a reasonable precaution, but is really, really dangerous to do on an unconscious and unsupervised person. People die in real life from this, and they won't be able to eat, so it makes mass imprisonment hard.

  - Magical and corporal punishment will be used a lot (think, at best, cutting out tongues) and capital punishment would be more common than long prison sentences, for this and other reasons.
  - It also makes legal defenses really hard for people who can't write, as no one will allow a prisoner to speak. Escape will be easy for those skilled and quick-witted enough who can still say magical words.

- Certain things will be considered unspeakable, at least in magical language and in public.

  - Expect free speech rights to be more like gun control, with even normal speech more carefully controlled or in-your-face protected.
  - Religions based around language might be common, even non-magical ones.
  - Speaking magical words at all might be seen as basically assault, and anyone doing so in public arrested quickly. Certain phrases will definitely be considered attempted murder.

- Tech is likely to be swiftly accelerating, through a living magic language might have a vested interest in not allowing too much investigative use of magic on research.

  - This could actually retard technology, if everyone looks to a magical solution first instead of a technological one.

I really like the more inherent poetry that seems to be suggested by your paradox loopiness.

I'm thinking maybe people have a kind of 'sense in their mouth' or 'in their mind' of when their approaching a statement that will be dangerous or kill them. Also the removal of negation is really a fun culling of language flexibility that I find interesting and it does resolve a lot of things potentially.

The whimsy of the magic is quite nice and I think you catch onto a really useful thing which is having proper nouns be really sparse and you have to sort of assemble a description instead to target things.

And importantly, people the gods /really like/ might not have to ask in a dead language with correct grammar to get a result - plain english works, if there's good reason. And sometimes they get proactive interventions, wanted or not...

That could be interesting, if it was literally impossible to speak a lie and attempting it altered reality to match what you said.

Some restrictions I'd apply:

- Altering anything takes energy of some sort, altering too much is dangerous.
- People don't use past tense. Altering history takes more energy than they can use, so mistakes are dangerous
- future tense is discouraged. You never know when the energy drain from the statement will trigger (eg: "the house will burn down" could trigger at any time before you die or the house is destroyed by other means)
- declarative sentences only. "Burn down the house" can't be said in the language, only something like "I want something to burn down the house" (and if you didn't want it before, you do now).

** Since no one's mentioned it yet, I'll throw the /Inheritance/ cycle's magic system out there.

- You do magic by essentially telling magic/the world "throw this rock over there", in the language of magic.
- The magic does, in some sense, read your mind; you can /say/ "throw rock", and the magic will read your mind to figure out which rock you meant and where you want it thrown.
- If you don't know how to phrase something in the language of magic, you can't do it.
- Doing something with magic takes as much energy as doing it via normal means. Overexerting yourself /can/ kill you.
- The energy cost also scales up as you go further away. I assume the author put this in mostly for balance reasons.
- You don't do magic accidentally, so /just/ saying "set the door on fire" won't set any doors on fire unless you actively 'tap' your magic. This is something you train.
- The language of magic is a plain old (/actually/ old) language, though it's quite complicated.
- It is impossible to lie using the language of magic. If you try, you just won't be able to say it.

There's more to it, but that's pretty major spoilers, so I'll put it in a [[http://pastebin.com/vCrznGeb][pastebin]].

Anyone can learn magic, though most people have a very little energy available.

There's also mental magic, which is rather similar to how Legilimency and Occlumency are described in HPMOR. Any person can learn defense (on a basic level, focusing very hard on a brick wall will do), and I don't quite remember for offense. Battles between mages often turn into quite literal mindgames, because just killing your opponent (by popping a vein or pinching a tiny nerve) is actually quite easy, and MAD is not hard to achieve that way.

It's been a while since I read the books and I'm rather tired, so I may have missed something. Feel free to point out any mistakes.

** Eragon's elves have something like this. They're living in a post-scarcity society, albeit one that's isolated and slowly stagnating.

One way to constrain it would be to affect the culture - to prevent contradictions, there's an inborn power hierarchy - Jill's True statement has a rank of 4318, so if she contradicts Jack, whose rank is 4367, her words are implicitly more True by virtue of her birth, and so her statement persists. The /other/ way to do would be to make contradictions incredibly dangerous - if Jill says, "That house will always be on fire", and Jack says "That house is not and never will be on fire", the house is both on fire and not on fire. The chain reaction consumes the lifeforce of both invocators and populates the house with Contradictory Flame, which both burns and does not burn down the house. The house is both burnt down and not burnt down, so now it's a Contradictory Zone and liable to drive you insane if you stare at it too long.

** Things to read:

1. The /Young Wizards/ series.
2. Anything by David Eddings.

In the Young Wizards books, anyone can learn the Speech. Wizards are granted Enacture by various Powers. The Speech is simply an utterly unambiguous language that was used to describe the universe into existence. Anyone can use it, including to make untrue statements. Enacture allows you to repeat the 'description becomes truth' trick /at a cost/. There are aspects of True Names, more complete descriptions are better, a wizard lying every (in any language) is /very unwise/, etc. Higher Powers are a core part of the setting, both the benevolent, the unsafe (all of them, really), and That One we don't refer to. Every culture has a story about it, though.

David Eddings has written the same story a few times now, and it's almost reverse-fanfic where it gets better each time. /Eragon/'s magic system is a transparent ripoff of this, just as it uses Pern's dragons and LotR's setting. Magic allows you to do things, but the cost is energy required to do it without magic. Draw on too much, and you die.

General principles:

- Native speakers will have a reputation for being incredibly twisty. They're not being sneaky - you just get very very good at omission and meaninglessly precise and qualified statements.
- Things get a lot easier when you can avoid any statements that have an effect on the universe.
- It's better to have it rely on the power and knowledge of the speaker than a cosmic listner/atlantean magic engine/etc. Consider: "Every human is happy". Does it work correctly, work incorrectly, throw an error, or do nothing? What about "This sentence has the best possible effect"?

You also want to be very precise in definitions. Does =that house is on fire=

- Set the house on fire? This would typically require an imperative phrase...
- No-op, because it isn't?
- Never get spoken, unless you believe it to be true?
- Never get spoken, unless it /is/ true?

Get around the munchkins by having something ironic preempt false statements. After the first few dozen scientists have premonitions of DOOM//do not mess with Truth//heart attacks/labs explode/etc trying to say variations on "$hypothesis is true"... 1.5 bits per human life could deliver some interesting info, but it's not trivial to use.

*** The twisty speaking nature of a native speaker I had not fully thought of but that actually makes a lot of sense, I had been naively assuming they would have trouble understanding bold faced lies and deception. But that combined with them speaking around things in minutia and almost labyrinthine statements is hilarious. They seem sneaky but they actually have difficulty recognizing a liar till they have had some time dealing with none-native speakers.

** One of the magic systems in my novel works like this, but it's very heavily restricted. Some of these points are spoilerish for [[http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Andrew-Rowe-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/][Forging Divinity]], so if you're reading that, you may want to avoid reading too much of the stuff below.

Most of these points have been covered to some extent, but as a game designer, I like to think in bullet points. Maybe some of the ones below will be useful to you. =D

- Vocabulary. In a world where this is possible, it's possible specific words may not be taught to people because of the power they hold. Other words may be well-known, but illegal to use.

- Syntax. It's possible that the language only functions if words are used in a specific order, or that they have different functions based on how they are used within a statement.

- The burden of complexity. A system with a lot of hard rules for syntax and restricted word usage is going to be a lot more difficult to optimize. This makes it that much cooler when the protagonists figure out ways to do it anyway, imo. =D

- Cultural restrictions. I covered this briefly when talking about laws or "secret words", but there are all sorts of reasons why people might not use specific types of magic for cultural reasons. Religion and other superstitions, for example, might make the culture believe there's a reason you shouldn't use specific words, sentences, etc. Even if there aren't explicit laws, there could be organizations that attempt to stop the use of specific types of magic.

- A power source. Where does the magic come from? For example, in [[#s][Forging Divinity]]

- Costs. This is simple enough - what's the cost of using magic? Do people have mana pools? Do different words have different costs?

- Limitations on combinations of factors. For example, even if a word for "time" exists, maybe it's impossible to combine it in any way that would allow for time travel. This may be because there's a source of magic that doesn't allow certain hard rules to be broken, other more powerful effects are in place that prevent specific types of magic from being used, etc.

Edit: As an extra note, in case you weren't already aware, there's a [[/r/magicbuilding]]. You might want to check them out! =D

** I'm reminded of "True Name" based systems, where to command a thing you have to know its secret name, and learning those names is a long and arduous task (because, for example, you can't just command /The Ocean/ with a single name, and must instead learn the individual True Names for every distinguishable body of water... your power thereby growing as a function of how many names you know).

More generally, making it somehow difficult or time-consuming to learn the language of power, perhaps to the extent where a lifetime of study/practice will still leave you only knowing a small and specialised subset, would be one way to keep a lid on the power level (and create different 'flavours' of mage depending on what they focussed on learning)

** You might set it up so that the language only takes effect when you /fully/ describe the phenomenon, and this is often hard to do. So you can't just say "That house is on fire", because the language slices reality in non-human patterns, and therefore has no concept of 'house'. Similarly, it can't condense the idea of the house burning into the simple phrase 'on fire'. Instead, you have to deliver a long-winded statement that precisely selects the chunk of reality that is burning, what exactly burning means for the various materials, maybe put some constraints on it about how the system evolves over time. And getting any of these things wrong causes the effect to fail.

So basically it becomes really hard to speak the language precisely without being close to omniscient. As a result, the only 'spells' that work are long chants with very clearly defined effects. The caster has to memorize the whole thing, and learn various mental tricks for making systematic changes. For example, you learn a fireball spell, and then you need to learn various tricks for telling it to go in a specific direction, possibly involving pulling out a compass or a sextant or something, and then adjusting your speech accordingly.

...I just realized that my whole post is simply reinventing Rick Cook's /Wizardry/ series, where a programmer finds himself in such a world and writes an interpreter (based on Forth, of all languages) to help him do spells that no one imagined possible. Maybe you should check that out instead.

** People have mentioned a lot of possible solutions, so I'll throw a different one that I think might be a fun twist: the evil djinn trope. Basically the intentions of the caster do not play into it and whatever loopholes the magic caster leaves in his spoken spell have a very good chance of going against them in some way.

So in your example, No living man may hinder him, but a female or an inanimate object will likely lead to a major problem in the near future - the writing would be fun in that the reader could look at the spell someone cast and try to predict what ways it might go wrong for the caster. Saying "that house is on fire" may simply set a tiny fire that barely does anything and poses no danger to the house, or turn the entire foundation and yard into a sea of fire that the house floats on. And so on. So casting magic becomes an incredibly dangerous thing that is done in emergencies or under very, very careful consideration of possible outcomes.

NO.

You do NOT want a toddler learning this as their first language, reshaping reality in nonsensical ways, getting whatever they want just by saying it, and unmaking its parents the first time they tell it "no".

The language of magic must not be the first language for any person. No one may learn the language of magic before reaching a certain level of maturity, and the ability to form phonemes is not a sufficient lower bound.
