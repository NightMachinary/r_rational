Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have been offered Power by the muse of genre TV. You can pick any power-set that would be narratively coherent for the main character of a genre show. You cant pick an existing one - you have to make one up, but it needs to be something someone would actually make 6 seasons and a movie for.

Limits:

a: "Cost of SFX": If your powerset would be expensive to film, you cant use it very much. Minutes a week.

b: "Too OP, nerf": If your powers dissolve plots you will find they mysteriously malfunction every other week.

Plot: No matter what you do, you will get in trouble every tuesday. This is not the muse creating trouble, she is merely steering you into trouble that already exists. - If there is a human trafficking ring within 300 miles of you, /you will/ get kidnapped by them sooner rather than later. Pick a vacation spot, you will by coincidence happen upon a nefarious plot to launder cartel money.

Random boons :

"I can totally afford this loft on a PI salary". Economics can go take a hike - you cant throw money at plot to make it go away, but on the other hand, your bank account mysteriously always has enough cash in it for a nice place, a fast car and eating out every evening.

"Everyone on TV is attractive". What is says on the tin. You gain fitness without ever working out, your hair is always stylish, or roguishly messy in a way other people have to pay 200 dollars at the barber for.

What powers do you pick to survive this? And no, you cant say no. That just gets you plot without powers.

*** The easy answer here would seem to be to pick a power that wouldn't be OP for a character on genre TV to have because they would use it in a really stupid way or have moral compunctions about fully utilizing it.

The most obvious example of this then would be high end psychic powers, since they are absurdly versatile and their full mind control abilities basically never get used by heroes with them. So since the muse only steers you into /preexisting/ conflicts, you can "win" by just taking control of the world and creating a utopia. Plus even if the powers "OP rating" is based on how you use them /rather/ than how most protagonists would use them. You can still win by taking control of the world (and rewriting people's minds so they are loyal even without direct mind control) within a week.

Another obvious exploit would be something like AGI, absurdly advanced nanotech or genetics tech. All of those could easily gain cement control of the world within a week. Of course Veedrac already mentioned FAI but I would obviously point out that there's nothing in the actual original comment to indicate that would fail, you need to make a lot of assumptions beyond what in that comment to get the kinds of results talked about in the rest of that comment chain.

I would also point out preemptively that creating FAI is not really beyond the realm of a genre TV character (friendly human level AI is super common therein) all you need to do from there is get the FAI to use it's super fast genius mind to do recursive self improvement.

*** My first thought is to go for the ability to see twenty-four hours into the future, but in such a way that the vision can be changed - that is, the ability shows me what would have happened had I not used the ability. Dead easy SFX cost, and I get forewarning about disaster(s).

The second power I'd ask for is the ability to see what people are thinking - in effect, read-only psychic powers, which only work either when I want them two or when Plot needs them to work. Again, easy on the SFX, and tends to lead to more Plot rather than less.

Between them, these powers will tend to give me useful information about what's going on - so I can make informed decisions about how to handle my Tuesday Troubles.

I also intend to keep the local police on speed-dial, and make sure that there is at least one person who will call for a rescue for me if I don't check in every two or three hours on a Tuesday. This won't dissolve plots /entirely/, but it will help me avoid certain uncomfortable situations.

*** the power to grant powers to others. The amount of powers to give is only limited by the amount of drawbacks also given. The person who receives the powers has to consider the drawback to be at least half as bad for themselves as they like the power. They cannot change their mindset so they dont care about the drawbacks or the power s without loosing the powers.

now I grant people I trust powers that will keep me and others alive and well. powers like healing, rejuvenation, resurrection,clairvoyance. And occasionally give other people powers that I would consider useful. Occasionally people with powers would turn on me or others, and maybe become long time opponents I have to face for an entire year.

** You are a god. Your power is unchallengeable, your might undefeatable. Well it was. You are a god of the void. Before you created the world, you were omnipotent, but now ... well there is much you are incapable of without destroying the universe. In fact you possess power mostly over the soul within your creation as it bears the touch of the void to permit creativity. You are still all knowing about basic details about the universe but free will prevents you from knowing everything. Through you have a pretty good guess. Your powers permit you to link you anyone who requests help from a outside entity, especially you. This link lets you grant inner strength and guilt their conscience. However you cannot pass on knowledge as the link is too imprecise. Someone could potentially have you guide their hand and then apply statistical analysis to the results but that's not really very practical. As a extension of this, You can freely talk to designated prophets who require a strong desire to receive guidance and a certain mindset. they come along every few generations and while you may not talk to them, you can't just randomly choose anyone. This is merely talking to the prophet and you cannot control them. You may instruct them to write you a holy book but for instance you cannot tell them to write down the equations for a theory of everything as it would require to many mathematical symbols and even writing that down would be beyond a lay persons grasp. Unless they are a physicist. Specifically to a prophet you may pass any information that would be understandable by the prophet. You can also decide where soul go after death. Now under these constraints how would you become worshiped by people worldwide and help people thrive. Note: This was conceived of by considering the solution to the problem of evil that God is not omnipotent. The thing is it's possible to have a being worthy of being a god who is far from omnipotent . Further Note: Human beings make things up. Other religions do exist, but have no basis in truth. You may answer prayers from followers of other religions but it will make it hard to get worshiped. Further Further Note: Your holy book can be corrupted and you can do nothing except tell a prophet to fix it.

Edit Simplified version with no story details

You are God

You created the universe

You wish to be worshiped by and help the people of the universe

You possess the following basic powers:

1: You possess knowledge of all the facts of creation but free will can still trip you up ie If someone plots a murder, you know but whether they will go through with it is only a guess.

2: You may answer prayers of any religion by granting inner strength or guiding the hand of the individual praying to you. This cannot pass knowledge on, except maybe by statistical analysis.

3: A prophet comes along every few generations and you may freely talk to them. You may pass any information you wish onto them, but if it's beyond their understanding, it will not mean anything. For instance, to write down the theory of everything it beyond the average person as its written in the language of very complicated maths.

Other religions exist but are made up by humans with no basis in fact

Your holy book can be corrupted. The only thing you can do about this is send a prophet to correct it.

Does that fix your complain. I have never used paragraphs particularly well

*** You have two main objectives.

One, you need people to recognize your true prophet from false ones. Presumably when you say 'void' this includes space, so you would simply move the stars to spell their name. Depending what you can do with souls, then it might be in your interest to boost your prophet in whichever way you can, of course with the threat of taking their power away if they misbehave.

If that doesn't work you feed your prophet a bunch of information he couldn't possibly have, such as historical knowledge that can be verified. If THAT doesn't work you'll have to start a new religion, starting by having your prophet recruit from vulnerable people, such as people who recently lost a loved one or who are having an existential crisis.

Two, you want to increase the number of prophets. Through your now recognized prophet you change your religion, such that it has 'that certain mindset' and 'seeking guidance from the divine' as the foremost virtues. Further you establish a weekly school session in which your prophet +indoctrinates+ teaches the younger crowd how to exhibit those two virtues.

Once you have found the right way of cultivating that particular mindset everything afterwards will be childs play. You want at least three prophets per generation. If anyone are threatening your religion you can just destroy them with the most recent technology, which you prophets know because you know.

If you're having trouble communicating specific technical things to your prophets you send them off to grad school with the money they earn from the lottery/stocks/who wants to be a bilionnaire.

**** Correction to a point you seem to have misunderstood.

The Void is specifically the void outside universes. It is in no way related to the void of space. That was merely a poetic reason that you could create a entire universe but cannot lift a pebble. Souls are in this case linked to the void due to the chaos free will brings. The void was based off earlier ideas I had where outside all universes is void. The void could have been anything, wanted to be everything and was thus nothing. The principle is that any conceivable system of laws require statistical tendency. In fact, that is all laws are. The void was before this and was thus capable of anything but required direction. The universes are pockets of statistical tendency. They tend to be based off the rubble of previous universes, inheriting laws, and so on. Magic, which isn't present in this universe, is basically the Gods attempting to kick-start evolution of universes by creating systems of laws that are based off differing principles and more fuzzy This has lead to things such as cannibal universes that eat the laws of physics of other universes to survive. But in any case you can manipulate the void so you may make anything you wish but once it is set you can't interfere except though cheats like souls. And now that I think of it maybe quantum mechanics. Secondly you can only grant them powers that count as granting inner strength or guiding their hand. This would include things that are basically a stronger version of the placebo effect. If that can't do it at least a little, you can't do it at all. i.e encourage study, help them get over cold, be more confidence, believe in their own abilities, things like that. Basically, your power abuses the chaos that free will brings to guide things in the direction you wish, but due to free will they have to reach out to you and you can only influence things that free will can influence.

I hope this clears things up

Another shortcut way of establishing this person as a prophet is to create waves of light in the void and send then into the universe in such a way that it looks like stars spell the name of your prophet from the perspective of earth. Or radiowaves that travel fast enough.

*** How does "free will " exatly work? Like to what extent knowing how the brain of a person works allows you to more or less know what they will do.

Like I'm not sure if there is a coherent way to do free will that's not people randomly doing things sometimes, or having a true rng in their brain that doesnt normally affect things munch but make things a bit unpredictable(but household still be able to predict most of someone's actions ,or otherwise people and society would work really differently.

But anyway you should tell your profets what you can do and what you want from humanity, no need to be deceitful or ambiguous about it, and encourage studying math and science,and to teach this kind of thing to everyone, and give them some ay of recognizing new profets(there are multiple ways to do this like giving them an encrypted message that can be decripted by a public key, and a lot of posible verification methods, you just need to find one that people can easily verify ), also there are lots of ways of protecting your messages to becoming corrupted .

You will start teaching profets progressively more complex math and science , and If you can comunicate it directly you can just send them as signals of certain concepts that are decoded as the message in some code, I'm not sure how the can't send things they won't understand rule actually works . Also you can use the code thing to send messages to people that pray to you , by sending them feedback in intervals when they pray, in a way you said to your prophet.

You can shape the beliefs of your people by encouraging the ones you approve of during prayer . Also give people an easy and short method of prayer that is easily done multiple times to maximize bandwidth . Instructions on how to get to the frame of mind to become a prophet and how to recognize one will be in all your messages. Prophets should be able to get a lot of money and Influence thanks to you which should help the cause , and of their ability of convincing people. Once people have enough tech and math you can instruct them to create better systems of transmission and verification of messages from you , especially with the help of computers.

1. Come up with one single wish that is designed to be

a) finite and stackable, something like "1 trillion dollars" or "+1,000,000 years to your or every human's standard lifespan", or "the probability of cancer occurring to each cell is multiplied by 0.000000001%" Avoid absolutes like "cancer never occurs" I don't know what would happen when you reverse that, and the math in step 2 won't necessarily work out. But if you use some ridiculously large or tiny numbers using mathematical notation you can make things effectively infinite or zero, which should be just as good.

b) Incorruptible. Use standard genie defense techniques, word everything carefully, depending on how literal this genie is. Maybe instead of wishing for money, which might hyper-inflate the economy, ask for some sort of goods that can be sold and add value to the economy.

2 . Wish for the same thing three times. So long as the reversing stacks mathematically and does cancel one of the others, you now have a normal wish that successfully got through.

** You are a vampire: you are vulnerable to sunlight (it kills you instantly) and are completely unconscious when the sun is up. This includes reflected and diffuse sunlight. You have super strength, speed, etc. You don't need to breathe. Your other vulnerabilities include silver and fire.

You have to travel across the mediterranean, and you need to take two ordinary humans with you. How do you do it?

Oh, and it's WW2 so you don't have access to modern technology and there's a small risk any boat you take will be torpedoed.

I worked out that a boat trip is going to take 10 hours+, so I figured use a fake hospital ship. My first idea was you have some humans wrap you in thick layers of bandages, wrap the Vampire-Burrito in a thick sheet of fabric, put you in a box, cover the box in fabric, and keep the box in a dark hold of the ship with an armed guard. Worst case scenario and the boat sinks (without you dying instantly: this plan is vulnerable to that), you sink to the bottom of the ocean, and you'll wake up when the sun sets and be able to break out of your coffin/burrito and get back to the surface.

Are you trying to avoid being torpedoed? 3: why do you need to get the humans across the Mediterranean? Are you running from someone? In which case you might want to consider hiding and commandeering a hospital ship in the middle of WW11 is probably not stealthy. Are only the humans running? You could just send them on alone in that case and they would be harder to find. So clearly you need to go with them. Why? Are you searching for a magical artifact that vampires can't touch but that you know the location of. Details please. In addition in the worst case scenario of your plan the humans die which constitutes a fail of the objective and has unknown consequences I don't think you should take it so lightly

You have plenty of money, but the ship was obtained through vampire connections and /should/ have gone to the war effort but didn't

#+begin_quote
  Are you trying to avoid being torpedoed?
#+end_quote

Yes, you're travelling with humans, and they don't tend to do too well with torpedoes.

#+begin_quote
  why do you need to get the humans across the Mediterranean
#+end_quote

One human is the MacGuffin; the other human is a highly-effective gun-toting bit of muscle who is coming along for bodyguard purposes, though the MacGuffin has military training

#+begin_quote
  So clearly you need to go with them. Why?
#+end_quote

The MacGuffin is flighty and unpredictable and trusts you, so you need to be around them.

#+begin_quote
  In addition in the worst case scenario of your plan the humans die which constitutes a fail of the objective and has unknown consequences I don't think you should take it so lightly
#+end_quote

Agreed; the MacGuffin is a benefit to you, but losing the MacGuffin puts you more or less back where you started. So losing the MacGuffin means you failed your mission but with no additional negative consequences.

Pretty sure you're wrong about that, the light reflecting from the moon did not go through the earth's atmosphere before reflecting back to the earth (unless during a lunar eclipse).

******** For that to work as an explanation it requires that any such "magicsphere" extend all the way to the moon, [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Earth-Moon.png?r=2][which would seem a bit excessive]]. Plus it obviously assumes that travelling just marginally farther through that field (depending on the configuration) is going to negate the harmful effects of the sun.

Much simpler would be to assume that the moon has its own intrinsic magic properties which cancel out those of the sun in the light that hits it. After all such a magic field must exist anyway given werewolves exist in this setting.

*** Based on responses to other posts, flying at night above the flight ceilings of other aircraft seems a good bet. Not many planes from WWII had pressurized cabins, and human pilots don't stay awake (hypoxia) above 39,000 ft otherwise, but that shouldn't be a problem for a vampire who can cross moving water and doesn't need to breath. I think the other two can be sleeping and put on oxygen. My brief research using the usual lazy scholarship suspects tells me you should look up the Westland Welkin for performance specs like altitude, range, and speed. I imagine the vampire connections can make that rare plane available, but the basic concepts remain regardless - you could sub in a prototype of something similar. The dicey part would be the welcome received on the descent. Enemy aircraft? AA guns? Cover of night should help, but the trio might keep a paratrooper mindset as a backup approach.

**** This response only just got into my inbox even though it's like two weeks old, but I just love the image of this 1500 year old vampire flying a plane.

Unfortunately, it's kind of a non-starter IMO: the vampire in question did not really have the time or inclination to learn how to pilot a plane before this, and a hospital ship is going to be less of a target.

I'll think about it though. You've made me realise that the vampire is probably going to /want/ to learn how to fly a plane after this since he's realised it would be a very useful skill.

*** There's a few solutions that comes to mind which depends on the specifics of my powers and on the circumstances surrounding this whole thing.

Stealth w/ humans: You and the two humans find some small ship to travel with. You stay on ship during nighttime since your superspeed and strength are your only defence against incomming torpedos. At night you go to sleep in a reinforced box that is only intended to be opened from the inside.

Less stealthy v.1: In addition to the above you dominate the crews on a number of lesser ships to tag along and act as shields for torpedoes.

Less stealthy v.2: You find the biggest, baddest warship and dominate the captain to direct their course past whichever island you wanted to go to, and proceed to jump ship when you're close.

Less stealthy v.3: Not satisfied with the a mere battleship you decide to undertake a mission to dominate all of the worldleaders. Now you are sure nobody will torpedo you. And you get a fresh supply of blood as a bonus.

**** Much like UFAI, the first step is always "take over the world, then nothing else can stop you". I love it.

Good point on the box opening from the inside. I might rewrite the passage so the vampire doesn't get wrapped in bandages; but I feel like the threat of the box being breached outweighs the thought of the box being locked from the inside. (My plan was always for him to get out of the box by breaking out of it with super strength, though, so simply closing it with a padlock and then throwing away the key would be good enough).

I'm failing to see what bandages are supposed to do that a box or a coffin(for thematics) within a box wouldn't do. If people board your ship they can easily remove bandages. If your box is hit with a torpedo, chances are the bandages will tear.

I hold my position that you would want to be able to leave the box at night. With enhanced senses, strength and speed you are the sole defence against torpedos.

Also, if the ship sinks one backup plan could be to simply drag the box by night underwater and hide in it by day. Or you could just ditch the box and dig deep enough into the ground for protection from the sun.

Edit:

I just saw that the boat trip was only supposed to take 10+ hours. Why not just travel at night and use your superhuman strength to push the boat faster.

I don't think layers and layers of bandages will tear; a box is rigid and can break easily, bandages not so much. Imagine a genie levitates the ship high up in the sky and then drops it on a hard surface; the ship would be matchsticks, the box would be broken to kindling, but the bandages would probably be intact (they're a foot thick). I think a box alone isn't prudent enough and bandages are easy to come by.

Absolutely; you'd redo the process each evening and rip yourself out of the bandages / box each sunset.

#+end_quote

True; I just looked up the hours of night at the time of year in question and we're talking just under 11 hours which is not too shabby. The problem is that in the particular story I'm writing, the vampire and his entourage arrive at the port with only a few hours until sunrise, and the port (Civitavecchia) doesn't have the best amenities for vampires because it had previously been the target of heavy bombardment (no longer, so it is safe to be there for the time being). But then I get down into the specifics of my universe and it stops being a "you're a vampire: how do you protect yourself when you need to travel during daytime" and more of a "what would you do in this specific situation that you don't have all the details of and that the OP is going to constantly rules lawyer you about", which is no fun.
