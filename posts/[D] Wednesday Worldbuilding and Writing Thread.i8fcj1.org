Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** The latest installment of the amazing [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] states

#+begin_quote
  There were a lot of components that went into any good magic system, but [X] magic had an inherent disharmony between the method of acquisition and the actual power granted. [...] the power itself could have been anything [...] and it being [X was] disconnected from whatever the magic was attempting to do or show with its acquisition method.
#+end_quote

So. We see here that a magic system has

1. A method of acquisition
2. A power granted
3. An attempt to do or show something with its method of acquisition
4. That should be connected to the power granted.

What are the other components of a good magic system, as envisioned by AlexanderWales, or envisioned by our best models of AW?

*** If you want, we did two episodes of /Rationally Writing/ about magic systems, [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-6/][part 1]] and [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-7/][part 2]], where we talk about these things. Altogether, probably not a bad way to spend an hour and a half if you want to get my thinking (about 45 minutes at double speed, which is what I crank podcasts up to unless they're exceptionally information dense). Also, this is about five years old at this point, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/2jndl2/magic_building_is_tough/cldgiez/][this comment]] on building unique magic systems is something that I mostly stand by.

Broadly speaking, my "checklist" for magic systems (not the things that they should have, but the things that you should ruminate on) is as follows:

- How do people get it?
- How do people get better at it?
- What does it do?
- What internal trade-offs does it have?
- What rules does it follow?
- What rules or trends emerge from those rules?
- What are the first order effects for society?
- What are the second order effects for society?

Once you have those questions, or as you're asking them, you need to start thinking about what role the magic system will have in ... whatever your story is. Making a /good/ magic system means making one that's either compelling on its own, or weaves itself into the story nicely, preferably both. A non-exhaustive list of things that you might want to use a magic system to accomplish:

- Something that's fun to think about, with either its internal mechanics, its mechanical implications, or its social implications
- Reveal things about how a character thinks or acts, either in opposition to the magic system, or in concordance with it
- Reveal things about how two character interact, or how a character interacts with their society, or other elements
- Reveal things about your views on society, civilization, etc.
- Provide a metaphor that underlines some lesson of the plot, element of the character, or something else
- Drive the plot (careful with this one)

I tend to take the view that the ideal work of fiction does as much as it can in as little space as possible, which means that where you can, you should use the same tools in different ways. If you're making a magic system, it should either do one thing for your book in way that really works for it, or it should do a lot of different things for you.

The general principle of connecting the method of acquisition/progress to the power granted is an emergent one: a magic system will be better able to drive home some point if those two halves are in sync with each other, saying the same thing, or taking contrasting points on the same subject, or otherwise adhering to a theme or thread of some kind. The method of acquisition can be completely different from the method of progress, which can be completely different from the practical effects ... but it will be harder for the system as a whole to find a place in a narrative, unless it's a sprawling one with many threads and many points to make.

*** One challenge I've run into writing up various magic power in Saturday Munchkinry threads is being able to give a good summary in as few sentences as possible.

Worth the Candle does a really good job at this. You can get a crude idea about most of the magics in a single sentence: Blood magic draws upon the heat and motion of the blood. Bone magic taps bones for physical and mental boosts. Gem magic converts willpower into blasts of force according to an RGB pattern and cut. Soul magic adjusts essential traits. Spirit magic adjusts ongoing mental threads/processes. Still mages halt change, primarily motion. Vibration mages add to or subtract from vibrations, primarily sound.

There are all sorts of interesting edge cases and secondary effects/applications and hidden or explicit limitations, but the basic rule is easy to explain in the text without bogging things down with pages of explanation and rules while still allowing the reader to intuitively understand the basic abilities and limitations the characters work with and predict more advanced abilities and limitations.

There are exceptions to this in WtC, but they mostly use already familiar complex ideas to explain the magic to the reader. Gold magic uses the idea of tactile telekinesis as an explanation for superman to explain the power to the reader. This explanation gives a clear mental picture and also give the reader ideas about the weakness of the power. Tattoo mages use tattoos like a DnD vancian wizard, prepping spells with exact effects and requirements ahead of time, with limited spell slots available. This sort of archetype gives the reader an idea about the trade offs of tattoo magic and how a team might utilize it. Druid magic is nature magic and the ineffable, unpredictable, unrepeatable parts of magic. Druid magic doesn't need explanation just a general trust in the capabilities and limits as conveyed by Solace. Passion mages are magic realism (and basically the Force, but Juniper never makes this comparison for some reason).

** Could we rationalize The Smurfs?

I was thinking about that the other day. My toddlers love watching SMurfs, and I noticed that their whole social system, culture and economy looks like something designed by an over-zealous social engineer.

Everything from how Smurfs come into being, to their personalities, and the way they interact seem like it was designed with the intent of a perfectly rational social determinism utopia, except Smurfs sometimes stray from the program when they act irrationally, or there is an outside-context problem like an evil Wizard or something.

** In a LitRPG setting I'm thinking about, there are several base classes that provide moderate bonuses over a wide range of possibilities. I was thinking like the original D&D classes in breadth (4 classes for fighting: cleric, fighting man, magic user, and thief). If there are similarly broad classes for other professions, what would some of those classes be? I was thinking "laborer" and "artisan" to cover professions like that, but am open to conversation or other suggestions.

*** It depends on what you want to distill classes down into, whether that's type of labor, the product of labor, or something else entirely. The broad "professions" as we know them are socially constructed, and if you want to create your own, you should feel free to do them: it would be interesting to see a society where a cook, barber, and doctor are placed into the same class, since they all deal with the physical health of a person.

If you want to be more traditional (and depending on how many divisions you want), then I think laborer and artisan are good starts, with a catch-all for service jobs (barber, butler, maid, etc.) and a catch-all for intellectual labor (accountant, quartermaster, etc.) probably also being important (though class is a social construct that will highly depend on the society that you're doing this in).

**** That's exactly right. I was thinking probably the 4 combat classes and then perhaps 8-16 non-combat classes, so that probably fits pretty well. Artisan is perhaps too broad, as both a mason, a smith, or even something like a basketweaver or potter. Artisan could theoretically cover just about anything that produces goods. In our society, that probably accounts for less than 15% of work, but in a medieval/renaissance analog, that and farmer could account for something like 95% of people.

Of course, if we take [[/u/scruiser]] 's idea, there could be only a few classes, and each may lend itself better or worse to a job. One plumber could be an artisan, another an artist, and another an intellectual, and they would all (theoretically) excel at different parts of the work.

*** Classes provide particular tools to solve problems. If you look at how people in the real world favor mindsets and approaches to solve problems. this might give you some ideas about classes.

STEM is obviously all one class with abilities related to analytical thinking and problem solving. It has the downside/stereotype of trying to apply its tool set to things outside its expertise and of ignoring the emotional side of problems. Maybe this would be an "Intellectual" class?

The softer sciences, including humanities and liberal arts not in STEM would be another class. Maybe more empathic focused abilities? Overall, maybe this class would be called "Empathic" or "Humanitarian"?

Interestingly, some profession might be able to use either of these classes but with different approaches. A STEM doctor might be good at reviewing data collected carefully and have abilities that allow such, but fail at using empathy and just listening to and trusting the patient in comparison to a humanities doctor. Of course, in this LitRPG world, you might just be better off getting a healing from a cleric.

Laborer might include everyone that does physical labor and provide abilities for increased stamina and consistency of work.

**** That's a really good point. Exactly like if a painter with an intellectual class would be more likely to produce something that is more photorealistic, while one with a humanitarian might produce something more abstract or leaning toward emotive.

** What would a society of completely deaf humans look like?

Accept the following as given:

- There are no non-deaf humans. Every human in this proposed system was born deaf, and there are no abnormal humans who were born with hearing of any kind.

- Their society has always been deaf. At no point in their known history has any member of their society been capable of hearing, nor do they recall any period in which "hearing" was an ability that any sapient being (mythical or otherwise) possessed.

- Their world is Earth-like.

** I'm just going to dump a thing in here and see what people think about it. This is not exactly a snippet, but it's from the POV of a particular character, in the sense of opinions-are-not-the-author's.

.

There are two ways to cast magic, and they both involve insanity. They have to; you can't change the world by fiat without standing in opposition to consensus reality.

The first way is a certainty so narrow-minded it does not admit the possibility of error. Children do this instinctively when they're not paying attention, and never when they are; a person of overmuch faith will do it when they are paying attention, and never otherwise.

The second way is to have a mind so wide open that it just doesn't matter. The water might be next to ice or next to steam; there are no expectations, and so nothing can be outside of them.

*** Would be interested to see how these people live their lives since both those viewpoints are by nature incredibly rigid. You can't stray away from blind faith or hapless wonder without bringing some form of consistent limits to your thinking, limits that would preclude the use of magic.
