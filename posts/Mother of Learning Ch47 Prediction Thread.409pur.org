The next chapter of Mother of Learning is scheduled to go up tomorrow (Jan 10). Anyone have any predictions for the upcoming chapter?


** I will be disappointed that the chapter is so short, and that I now have to wait another 3 weeks.

Zorian's magnitude rating will not level out at some natural maximum, but will instead keep growing indefinitely, same as Zach's did. This is foreshadowed by Zorian's comment in chapter 46 about how he is no longer sure what his Magnitude is.

Oh, if we're going to cheat: [[/u/nobody103]] will pull a Checkhov's gun out of his... hat that I had become convinced was just a throwaway line.

*** The only theory I have is that Magnitude rating is affected by the age of your physical body. As you grow older, your body can't cope/process the mana as efficiently anymore and therefore it stop growing/grow in a very insignificant amount.

Zorian body didn't grow older in the loop so therefore he can keep on growing it.

However I haven't read any talk about older people losing their mana capabilities so I'm not so sure about this theory.

*** Would that be a good thing or a bad thing? It was mentioned at some point that more power == less control.

*** Somehow I don't think it'll end up with so neat a conclusion. Arc 2 is in its death throes and I have a sneaking suspicion some horrible tragedy is about to unfold.

But then again, it was hinted that the matriarch found some depressing news about the loop...

** I'm concerned that he didn't really get clean away from the necromancer. When he triggers, it just sends his soul back to the start of the loop (or puts it on hold until the loop starts over). So the necromancer has his dead body to play with until the restart, and might be able to get some information from his dead brain and communicate it to Quatach-Ichi.

**** It's explicitly stated earlier on that Zorian's death didn't terminate the loop, that only happened when Zach died early. So it seems likely to me that it would get his soul out of the way, but leave his dead body behind. Maybe necromancers don't do brain magic.

If it /does/ break the loop early, that's going to get Zach curious.

I'm also wondering now if there's anything that Zorian can do with those switches to make him wake up at the start of the cycle instead of a few hours later, and maybe try and save the spiders.

****** His part of the soul implant is damaged. There's no reason to assume it will behave differently whether it's manually or automatically triggered.

And either way, this has the potential cause a significant change in the plot. If it ended the cycle early, Zach is going to start looking for why. If it didn't, Quatach-Ichi is going to be onto Zorian.

Edit: So, it seems you're right. At least Zorian thinks you're right...

#+begin_quote
  A possible issue was that the revert switch might affect Zach and Red Robe as well, not just him. Was their restart cut short as a consequence of his action in the previous restart? Probably. It must have been, if the switch worked like he thought it did. There was a chance they'd failed to note the abrupt end, since he'd activated the revert switch very close to the time it usually ended at anyway... but since he intended to keep using the revert switch, that wasn't going to last very long.
#+end_quote

So expect Zach to be on the alert.

** I was about to start this exact type of thread. It's amazing how the hype for each chapter seems to grow every release.

I predict that it'll get closer to the wrap up of this arc. (perhaps hinting at the big change to signify it) I /hope/ that we learn more about these soul-marker functions as well as Zorian getting some sort of power multiplier.
