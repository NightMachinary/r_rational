Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** tl;dr: Anathem is a great novel which you'll love if you're a patient reader who appreciates intelligent characters(who take no shortcuts of thought) and deep af worldbuilding, and doesn't mind (very) slow burn plots front-loaded with a lot of exposition.

The one sentence blurb of Anathem would be: a modern society turns on their smartest and most curious people(think genius level) and sequesters them all into isolated monasteries/fortresses in which they're not allowed any possessions, to procreate, or to do any science but the most abstract. Thousands of years later the book starts.

--------------

I'm going to re-iterate a recommendation for [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2845024-anathem][Anathem]] by Neal Stephenson, which I consider like a black swan in science fiction, in the sense that there is nothing out there quite like it. It's a hard SF story which is closer in feel and style to a high-fantasy, hard magic story, with an immense emphasis on ambiance and worldbuilding. Besides the setting, another focus of the story is on intelligent characters trying to solve problems and understand their world and each other through their knowledge and intellect.

The early parts of the book are somewhat reminiscent of the parts in HPMOR where Harry is figuring out magic, only without the magic.

Here's the official summary:

#+begin_quote
  Fraa Erasmas is a young avout living in the Concent of Saunt Edhar, a sanctuary for mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers, protected from the corrupting influences of the outside "saecular" world by ancient stone, honored traditions, and complex rituals. Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside---the Extramuros---for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.

  Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates---at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious "extras" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was "collected." But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.

  Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros---a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose---as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster. Suddenly burdened with a staggering responsibility, Erasmas finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of his world---as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of the planet . . . and beyond.
#+end_quote

Like before, I'll warn people that *Anathem is hard work initially,* and *not for everyone*. It starts glacially slow and for the first couple hundred pages(the book is humongous, almost 1k pages) it's almost entirely exposition, where you're slowly getting familiarized to the protagonist, the world, and most importantly, the vocabulary.

Yes, Stephenson introduces dozens of words, but it's not a made-up language like tolkien or a pidgin like Cloud Atlas(which I disliked), it's almost entirely portmanteaus and cognates of existing words, mostly english and a bit of latin(as an example: Anathem= anthem + anathema), and this is the major sticking point for most readers. From experience I would say if you find the made-up vocabulary annoying and distracting at first(i certainly did) you need give it 70-100 pages for it to feel more natural, and a bit more to get fully engaged with the plot.

The entire reason I'm writing this long-ass comment is because I think this book is really worth it, especially in the context of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s tastes, but if you don't trust the author (or the recommendation ;D) it can be hard to get over the hump to the good parts of the novel. But if you do you'll be searching for a novel like this for the rest of your life(search anathem on reddit and you'll see).

**** I re-read it recently because it's one of my favourites and was shocked once again at how good it is. I wish I hadn't waited so long, as in my experience it was even better this time.

Anathem actually reminds me a bit of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, in the sense that they're both spectacular stories which have a rough start that scares a lot of people away, and which are immensely rewarding if you get past that. Malazan is several times worse than Anathem, though, as the hump can be the entire first book rather than just a few hundred pages.

But the other part, I feel very deep empathy with.

****** Isn't it though! It's actually pretty impressive that the series has managed to garner the popularity that it has with such an obtuse start off point.

I remember it took me weeks to read the first book, and the second book wasn't much better. I think I only kept going back because of sunk cost falacy; I was young and poor and I had bought the first three books all at once.

I'm glad I did because Memories of Ice is still one of my favourite books all time. That ending...

***** I've come to think of it as the (currently) most adaptive memetic evolution of the Naruto's exam arc combined with [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop][Groundhog Day Loop]] / [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][Groundhog Peggy Sue]] trope / motif: Naruto → Chunin Exam Day → Time Braid → Mother of Learning.

1. [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Ch%C5%ABnin_Exams_(Arc)#Chapters][Naruto]] (2000--2002) --- it was a popular plot arc, but ultimately not the focus of the overall story, so the story moved on. And the amount of artificially stretched out pacing (e.g. how much Orochimaru / Sarutobi confrontation was milked) harmed its objective quality as well.
2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day][Chunin Exam Day]] (2007--2010) --- many fresh interesting ideas, but the almost-deliberately crackfic nature of the story, its [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal][Author Appeal]] contents, and lack of self-censure harmed its popularity.
3. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] (2009--2011) --- the story arcs and plot still have some unpolished edges to them; and again the author doesn't try to self-censure for the sake of increasing the story's marketability. It straight out was purged from TVTropes, partially [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent#Five_filters_of_editorial_bias][because of fear of losing advertisers.]]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/best-rated][Mother of Learning]] ([[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][2011]]--2019) --- the story's not only made into a stand-alone work by now, it's been designed to appeal to a much wider common denominator and manages this without sacrificing in quality.

I wouldn't exactly call it "good" because the pacing is truly horrendous, and the way the videogame aspects of it are formatted make it very obvious this was an author treading new ground without a good idea of what works well in litRPG fiction, but it's definitely good for a laugh, and a "historical" look at what very early litRPG fanfic was like.

**** There are two versions of the dictator's handbook. I don't remember the alternate title, but you recommended the dumbed down version. I looked at it first on accident and it was grating to read.

I disrecommend Sapiens and especially disrecommend Klein.

Klein is a personality, not a real academic. She doesn't understand economics at all. [[https://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2014/11/i-wish-this-changed-everything/][Book review that might illustrate some of her problems.]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/9i8xb1/theres_nothing_natural_about_puerto_ricos_disaster/e6ihnyk/][Heavily downvoted comment thread I once made criticizing an article of hers.]] In retrospect I wish I'd been more conciliatory, but I really dislike narratives of economic inequality that encourage unprincipled conspiratorial analysis.

Harari rarely presents evidence for his assertions and his book is more like a bedtime story than an academic text.

****** It's not that Harari is pseudoscience, it's just that you don't really learn anything reading him, or at least I didn't. He mixes arbitrary opinion with reasonable perspective with solid fact and doesn't delineate any of these from each other or explain the evidence for any of it. Many of the claims are true, but I only know that from reading other sources that are actually educational.

If someone told you the universe is made of atoms but didn't explain how we know that or what competing models have been discredited, and lapsed into poetic rhetoric when describing the consequences of atomism for our worldview, that person wouldn't be promoting pseudoscience per se but they wouldn't author any good physics books either.

Yeah, agree. Harari doesn't feel very scientific. I enjoyed Sapiens if only for a few interesting ideas (I liked his concept of 'narratives' and his depiction of culture/society as a dialectic engine constantly driven by its own contradictions), but it seems like he's more interested with fitting the facts to his very elegant theories than the other way around. Certainly I think the title of Sapiens is /way/ too ambitious and that truly believing it constitutes in any way an even marginally comprehensive account of human history would be a surefire way to being way over one's head in a thousand historical discussions.

*** Interesting list, any favorites in particular?

You might enjoy:

"Predictably Irrational" by Dan Ariely, it's an analysis of perfectly rational economic model failures, the reasons behind them, and how economically irrational behavior can be predicted.

"Guyland" by Michael Kimmel: it's a social, historical, and psychological look at the rise of "bro culture", "hookup culture", "group rape culture" and some of the current culture of modern 20 something's in the USA. It might be a kind of infohazard if you're in those groups though. I read it right before college, where I joined a fraternity, and it really helped me understand where a lot of the culture is coming from. Notably it informed me that intense hazing and a lot of awful behaviors are relatively new phenomenon which makes a big difference.

"Babies by Design" by Ronald M. Green is an ethical look at human genetic engineering. It's not much policy or execution but mostly what we should do and how to think about the issue logically.

In order of engagement: Babies by design, Guyland, then predictably irrational. I had to take notes throughout Predictably Irrational to make it more engaging for me, this improved Guyland also.

There are a few of which I'm already aware of.

For starters, I've attempted reading Worm (learned about it from [[/r/noveltranslations][r/noveltranslations]]) twice now, both tries ending around arc 12 iirc. Not sure why, I think I just got bored. I think that's post-endbringer, i remember Skidmark and the mall fight. its a big change, so maybe thats why? Idk not sure tho

I know about Mother of Learning from that subreddit as well, and I've just decided with the release of the most recent chapter that I'd like to wait until its completion to binge it all.

Also just found out about HPMoR which I plan to listen through the podcast on spotify.

*** You might try listening to it through the Worm Audiobook podcast. I think the voices and conversions are generally well done, but the forum sections don't work for me.

You also might enjoy going chapter by chapter listening/reading then listening to the "We've Got Worm" podcast, where one host is reading it for the first time while the other rereads and helps explain it. They do a good job of avoiding spoilers and try not to over predict the story. I found the two very entertaining, and just listened to them alone as a refresher for when the sequel came out.

Obviously I'm a Worm shill, but it's not to some people's taste especially now that "dark realistic superpowers" is a less novel idea. If you don't enjoy it don't try to force your way through, it's far too long for that.

"The Cambist and Lord Iron" is a good shorter read.

Everything by AlexanderWales is highly recommended, the Dark Wizard of Donkirk is a hidden gem, and I'd recommend Shadows of the Limelight last. You need to enjoy the analysis of story concepts and such to enjoy it past a certain point, which the next story does a better job easing into it in my opinion.

Worth the Candle by cthulhuraejepsen is a great story with litrpg elements. The beginning didn't hook me, but now I can't resist staying up to date on it.

The Waves Arisen by Wertifloke, and certainly not Eliezer Yudkowsky, is an excellent Naruto deconstruction. Crazy Naruto world powers treated and used rationally.

*** I think HPMOR is a definite must read (as it provides a rational take on a well known universe... it's more like an allegorical tale using your expectations of the Harry Potter lore; this provides a strong contrast to the original works and allows a better understanding of the tropes of rationalism).

Personally I would follow it with either:

- Worth the Candle: An original work based on a mashup of table top role playing games, with an "external" rational character (aka litRPG).
- Practical Guide to Evil: An original work with in-universe rationalist characters and classic fantasy tropes (e.g. rather than the conceit of HPMOR or WtC).

Well that plan's now Dead On Arrival since this story did it damn near perfectly.

I am downloading it onto the kindle app on my phone now so I can read it at work on the DL... (I'm only there another week so there's very little for me to do, maybe I'll get the kindle app on the PC if it doesn't look too book-y, but probably looks more like work than reddit does anyway so...)

*** If you like fantasy and lots of world-building, as well as clever magical solutions to problems, then check out the /Codex Alera/ series by Jim Butcher. Short summary (by me):

#+begin_quote
  A Roman legion plus camp followers stumbles into a magical world where they can control the nature spirits, or furies, leading to unnatural powers. Thousands of years later, the pseudo-Roman realm is gripped by a succession crisis. Too many plotters and too many plots all converge on the only man in the country with no furies of his own, an apprentice shepherd named Tavi.
#+end_quote

I'm trying to avoid spoiling anything, since a lot of the major components of later books in the series (there's six total) would massively ruin the earlier books. The first book, /Furies of Calderon/, is good but the other five are better.

***** [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8680.Fierce_Invalids_Home_from_Hot_Climates][Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates]] reminds me a lot of Terry Pratchett. Blurb: a wildly contrarian CIA agent is blackmailed by his grandma into taking her parrot back to the amazon rainforest.\\
Legitimately one of the funniest and weirdest books I've ever read.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7165300-the-black-prism][Lightbringer series]] is great all-around epic fantasy, with a satisfying characterizations and narrative. Blurb: A boy's village is attacked and he discovers he's a mage and the son to the most powerful man in the world.\\
In my opinion the best fantasy series of recent times, and it is confirmed to conclude with the 5th book later this year.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402093.Sh_gun][Shogun]], one of my favourite books of all time. Blurb: an english man finds himself shipwrecked in Japan in 1600, the first non-spanish or portuguese to ever land there--at a time when england is at war with both those countries. It's an amazing take on the "stranger in a strange land" trope, where the protagonist is a foreigner explores a completely alien culture he's thrust into head first.\\
Even though it's based on real historical events and people(which it renames), the book does not try in the least to be historically accurate, and even a lot details about japanese culture is BS, like when he talks about ninjas or bushido. It's a testament to how good the story and the characters are that it's a great novel regardless.

*** I always recommend Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere because it is well written fantasy with a flavor for everyone. He has an apocalypse/heist trilogy, a steampunk western buddy cop series, an epic fantasy series, and a romance for people that hate romances.

I saw that you like Discworld, have you read Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman? Douglass Adams is another classic.

Necroscope by Brian Lumley, Malazan Books of the Fallen, and Ringworld are all very good serious books.

**** I have read the mistborn trilogy. It had a strange effect on me. It has everything I thought I valued in a fantasy book: good twist full of foreshadowing, unique races, consistent and detailed magic system, cool female character. Yet it felt flat on me. The writing and characters were too flat. Hope sanderson improved...

I read Good Omens and the HItchhiker guide to the galaxy.

Read RIngworld as a kid but didn't particlary like it. Malazan books is a slog to get through according to people but i WIll try. Never heard of Necroscope, will check.

Thank you good sir.

Steampunk western buddy cop is Mistborn Era 2, epic fantasy is the Stormlight Archive, romance is Warbreaker.

He also has a thriller/horror series (Shadows of Silence in the Forests of Hell), a thriller/mystery (Sixth of Dusk), a straight up heist (The Emperor's Soul).

1. Whether it be in the Rosario world

2. Whether it is with a character having to make morally questionable choices to survive

3. The MC starts slowly down a darker moral path (doesnt have to be for survival)

Also, as always, looking for more Bloodborne stories to read. I've read Fear the Old Blood, Hunter, and Bloody Tinkers.
