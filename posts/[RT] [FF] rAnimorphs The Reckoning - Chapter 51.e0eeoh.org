** Pure monster madness. Loved every minute. Until now, there hasn't been a lot of animal-v-animal action in this fic, but it seems that this set of chapters is finally getting that all out of the system. With regards to the note about 30,000 word chapters, I say that splitting them in half is ideal - or even into thirds. A 15,000 word chapter is already a /lot/. Even 10,000 is plenty to chew on. And I like the pace of one chapter every two weeks.

So, a few blow-by-blows, or rather, aspect-by-aspects.

I really like the atmosphere of this chapter - the whole dark and misty forest setting, where things are too quiet, where monsters lurk around every corner. This gave me some of my favorite mental imagery from the fic so far. So the way I savor fics like this is that I produce and direct a wish-fulfillment HBO miniseries production in my head - and I do mean this literally, as I tend to plan out the details of the filmography and the precise script changes that would be necessary to make the translation to the screen - and this chapter gave me /plenty/ of setpieces and creature design to work with, let me tell you.

The multiple Marco perspectives: very interesting. I was expecting each successive POV Marco to die horribly until there was only one left, but there was a smaller body count than I anticipated. Well, there still is the other half of this mission to go. But if this many Marcos have made it this far, that indicates to me that the /true/ body count will start when they reach the Arn / Howlers. Really, the Ellimist / Crayak were doing the Animorphs a favor by making them go through the forest, as this has given them many powerful morphs they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.

So towards the end of the chapter, it seems like Marco's sense of being localized in one body is beginning to slip, and this is reflected in the narrative, which did get a bit confusing at times. In the section where one of the Marcos is dying, the narrator seems to switch freely from the ground to another nearby Marco. My interpretation of this was that one of the other Marcos acquired the dying Marco, morphed him right there, and absorbed his memories, giving this Marco the experience of remembering being on the verge of death and also watching himself on the verge of death. Very cool dynamic. Is there any other fiction out there that comes close to this level of weirdness?

Alright, now for That Part:

#+begin_quote
  “Shut up,” Jake whispered.  Edging closer, he leaned over and pressed their foreheads together, whispering something I couldn't hear.  Then he tilted his head, and lowered his lips to the other boy's---

  /---to mine./

  -------------------------

  “Yeah,” he said.  “It's just---first time.  You know.  Since Cassie.”

  I just barely managed to catch the question before it left my lips, stopped the words from becoming real at the last possible second.

  /Both, obviously/.
#+end_quote

Welp. Once again this fic surprises me. This is everything I've ever wanted. I've shipped these two since I was a confused gay kid reading Animorphs in middle school. But even if you're not a shipper, I think this works as a realistic and touching moment - even if Jake and Marco are just friends, I /love/ Jake's display of emotion here for his best friend. I think this might be realistic even if Jake were straight - and not bisexual as he's implied to be here - I have a vague notion that throughout history there were times and cultures where men were much more open about expressing affection for one another. It's just a human thing.

#+begin_quote
  “You, uh,” Jake said, faltering.  “You and me---”

  “To be perfectly honest, we're kind of more into Rachel these days.”

One of the things I always hated about the /Sario Rip/ books is that they never let the Animorphs /keep/ the stuff they acquired during the trips. This will not be the case in r!Animorphs---Marco now just straight-up /has/ a Tarmogoyf morph.

FWIW, my own interpretation as the author is that Jake is straight; we saw him being similarly accepting and affectionate when he realized Marco was in love with him on the mesa.

But also, I don't currently intend to confirm in-text the sexuality of any characters besides Rachel and Marco, in part because I want to leave readers to be able to make generous interpretations such as the one above. I don't think bisexual Jake is /incompatible/ with the story as written, and I'm going to try to keep it that way.

I took Jake's line to mean that he was open to relationships with guys, just that he hadn't been thinking about relationships for a while. And I took Marco's "both, obviously" as him answering an implied question in his head - that Jake is into /both/ genders, and Marco is just now seeing the signs. I was kind of surprised you would actually do that, given that in previous comments sections you said you wouldn't go further in that direction, but I guess these lines meant something else after all?

But not including that line in the text was a deliberate choice. I tried it both ways, and it felt better letting the reader use their own model of Marco to decide what he was thinking in that moment. In other words, consider my answer here omake; your version is just as valid according to me.

A possible consequence is that if some number of Marclones ever become Collaborators, that sense of self-as-values will propagate through Terra, which could have weird effects on the Unity vs. Harmony aspect of the game. Especially after Perdão goes back for the sharing.

** Alright, let's do a quick review.

#+begin_quote
  People don't understand the word ruthless. They think it means mean. Cold. Heartless. It's about being able to see that thin, bright line that leads from point A to point B---that one, narrow path that dodges all the dead ends. It's about seeing that bright, clear line, and not caring about anything but the beautiful fact that you've found the solution. Not caring about anything else but the perfection of it.
#+end_quote

Yes! The ruthlessness speech!

Easily one of the best parts of canon Animorphs, from one of the best books.

I really like this take on the speech, too. Now all we need is Marco threatening to murder Visser One and feeling conflicted about it and we'll hit peak awesomeness!

#+begin_quote
  Point B: Jake and Helium---at least---alive and well at the bottom.
#+end_quote

Gee, I'm a little worried by how the number of surviving non-suicidal Animorphs seems to be dwindling chapter by chapter.

  ‹Hedwig here,› I called out. ‹Crossing the boundary now, over.›
#+end_quote

You know, I'm realizing just now that Harry Potter references have taken the place of Star Trek references in canon. I wonder if they'll age better.

#+begin_quote
  Or like how there were no other plants in the forest at all. No bushes, no ferns, no flowers or vines. Not even any saplings or seedlings that I could see---just giant, silent pillars of wood, stretching up for what might have actually been miles.
#+end_quote

I wonder at the biological aspect of these trees. I mean, there's a reason trees in real life rarely grow the size of a skyscraper. The weight that the base of these trees have to support must be /insane/. They probably have a super-advanced internal flora keeping them together (aside from the Hork Bajirs tending to them).

#+begin_quote
  Well. Not like we were spares, exactly. Not like seven copies of one person. More like---like one person in seven bodies. Like there really was just one individual there, like there was some essential thing that was “Marco,” and instead of plugging into the rest of the universe in one spot, it was now plugging in through all seven of us. The same software, running on seven different machines.

#+end_quote

  /I can't save you, that other version of me had said. I'm sorry. If I could save you, I would. But the morphing tech doesn't do that. What it can do is give you a chance to make a difference.

As long as there's an Earth to fight for, he'll fight for it./ Those words seemed hollow, now. Cheap. Almost manipulative.
#+end_quote

Nooo, nothing manipulative about saying that to these people!

#+begin_quote
  The monster was alone, cutting sideways across the slope, moving maybe ten or twelve miles per hour. It was huge, easily twice as tall and twice as long as our current best morph, making the trees around it seem almost normal-sized. Its armor was like the result of a genetic experiment crossing an Ankylosaurus with a Stegosaurus, all thick bone with various knobs and spikes sticking out, some as big as Christmas trees. It had four massive, muscled limbs, splayed out to the side like a lizard, each ending in a giant, five-clawed foot the size of a backyard pool. And its head---

  Its head was like something out of a nightmare, all exposed bone and pulsing flesh. The whole thing was split down the center, with teeth lining the gap, as if the entire skull could yawn open like a Venus flytrap. There was also a normal set of jaws, like those you'd expect on an Earth animal, but inside of those were more jaws---an entire second set of teeth, the absolute smallest of which was at least three feet long. And there were eyes everywhere---eyes like a spider's, black and round and utterly soulless.

  I'd seen a lot of monsters over the past twelve hours. But this was the first one that looked like it might honestly have a chance against Godzilla.

Yeah. He landed on it, chilled out for a while, nothing happened. Demorphed halfway, to see if the increased weight would catch its attention; nothing happened.

What happens if you go partway into morph armor, stop before your brain copies over, and wait out the time limit? Is it possible to end up alive and "trapped" in a partial morph, and could that be a way to heal your natural body?

Another thing I've been wondering about since the canon books, is how powerful is the acquiring trance? If a monster's about to eat you, can you hold out your hands, focus on acquiring it, and have a chance to survive by putting it into trance the moment its teeth touch your skin? If someone like Cassie were infested with a hostile Yeerk, could she rebel Mr.-and-Mrs.-Chapman-in-book-2 style, take control of the morphing power just long enough to start acquiring the Yeerk in her head, and then use the (couple? few? many?) seconds the trance lingers after to go into morph armor, focusing on her brain first, and morph out from under the Yeerk?

(Not the morph armor part obviously, but 10 year old me was straight-up /angry/ that Jake didn't start acquiring the Yeerk in book 6 the second it touched his ear.)

I gotta figure out what I did with my list of r!Animorphs theories and questions I started making this time last year. This revival is seriously gonna be hard to beat as far as Christmas presents go this year.

It's literally a meme, of the sort you'd find on imgur or [[/r/teenagers][r/teenagers]]; I'm outing Marco as a /memester./ None of them as-yet have the faculty with morph alteration that Cassie exhibited; she was somewhat genetically lucky as well as having an unusually good experience set (just as none of them can quiiiiite morph-scream as good as Garrett).

#+end_quote

It all depends on which parts of you are gone; remember that morphing is only partially controllable through deliberate effort.

If you're going into your morph armor, you have the benefit of not having to deal with autoimmune rejection, which is good. But there's also the fact that your veins and arteries and capillaries and organ boundary membranes and so forth won't necessarily be exactly lined up; the morphing tech does some handwaving with force fields and nanotech to keep you alive and not in screaming pain while everything swaps out, but if you just stop halfway and wait for the battery to run out I suspect you'd have Problems.

The acquiring trance is a little more powerful in my canon than in the original books, where it didn't happen 100% of the time; in my version of things, Seerow put it in as an /absolutely necessary/ subtool for acquiring hostile animals, not to mention that it has the side effect of making scanning easier (since things are moving slower/less). It's enough to force docility and lethargy; not enough to force unconsciousness. If you've ever seen a Corgi or some other small dog just go oof after you put a thundershirt on them, that's about the level of it. Anything full-on attacking you will stop, but you won't necessarily take all of the strength out of a jaw chomp; the jaws will probably still close around you and if the monster is big enough you're still in a pretty tight situation at that point.

The problem with trying to morph out from under a Yeerk is that the morphing tech wouldn't leave it behind; you probably /could/ seize control long enough to start morphing, but you'd be sending both your own brain /and/ the controlling Yeerk into Z-space, and the emulator tech would spin up a copy of you-and-Yeerk, not just-you. I don't think you could focus subtly enough/specifically enough/give the right set of commands for it to disentangle the Yeerk from your brain physiology, especially in the middle of a mental struggle. The tech /can/ do things that subtle, but it can't do /anything/ that subtle; it's like a Mac, or a well-trained machine learning algorithm.

Still, it's probably only a slight risk, and if they're willing to sacrifice themselves anyway, it's not obvious to me that it would be a bad experiment to run. And if the current plan was "go down, then come back up", they could use this to avoid the "come back up".

  “---one who has become both twice as angry and twice as patient is not in any sense the same, and the nature of Yeerks is such that twice the flesh is twice the personality.”

than V3 is, Terra can have small sacrificial shards acquire and morph the entire coalescion, doubling the amount of co-operation and empathy Yeerk flesh available as often as it wants. The resistance could kidnap and acquire Silat hosts by being sneaky, replace their Yeerks with Terra shards, and slowly contaminate Silat with the true meaning of friendship.

Even better, one sacrificial shard of Terra could acquire the coalescion and infiltrate Silat. As soon as it hits the pool, it starts morphing into Terra, focusing on taking Silat into the morph with it. Any shards of Silat that went into the pool to investigate anything would be replaced by Terra Collaborator shards, and they would all come out reporting nothing unusual.

If the anti-morphing ray is a concern, they could take advantage of the fact that Yeerk shards are the only sentients small enough to have a morph time long enough for their construct bodies to gain and use the morphing power. Nest 160 tardigrade morphs inside each other, so that the average ~45 seconds it takes for each nested morph to emerge and start demorphing gets them through two hours in the anti-morph field without being discovered. Nested inside the 160th tardigrade morph is a full-sized, morph-capable Terra coalescion, broken into however many nested morphs are needed to get the right time limit.

*** (Not theorizing, but- This whole bit with Marco having made duplicates of himself and having a protocol for working with himself is great, and seeing the bright clear line speech made me grin.)

Alright, here's a theoretical thought; If the animorphs know the Arn are genius bioengineers, and also know they keep morphs they acquire here (or at least, have no reason to think they won't) then the most important thing for them to do is to acquire an Arn and make it back to earth. Depending on how much intervention from on high is going on and how much the Arn rely on infrastructure they couldn't build themselves, that could be the most important thing they do here.

Imagine being able to custom build morphs. The Arn can do big and stompy, could they do a full out Godzilla? The goal of the mists means they focus on the obviously scary, but could they do a bat but with cockroach survival and black mamba venom? That's just playing around with chimera, can they make a controller-sniffing dog or something that could handle hard vacuum? Can we go full Yuuzhan Vong, and then morph the results? The main limitation on a morpher is what morphs they have available, which means bioengineering has the potential to get gamebreaking.

Heck, we've already mentioned the intelligence explosion and different aliens being smarter than other aliens. The solution to the alignment problem is right here- have an Arn (or yourself, in an Arn morph) bioengineer something that is to Andalites as Andalites are to Gedd, keep it unconscious, acquire it, morph it, use that to design the next iteration. It seems like the Yeerk control mechanism can work on something smarter than you are (unless Yeerks are smarter than Andalites) so you have all the upsides of that brilliant mind yoked to the morpher's values.

Do I think that's going to happen? I dunno, but if nobody thinks of morphing an Arn and custom building stuff to morph I'll be surprised. Also, the idea of morphing a Yeerk resulting in morphing a whole pool feels like setup for someone doing that at some point, and if I had a Yeerk the size of a swimming pool I'd be curious what happened if it infested a brain the size of a lake. . .

*** Elfangor was able to say the words "Crayak" and "Ellimist" when they morphed him because, as a morph, his Andalite brain was joined with Yeerk tissue. That is or has something to do with the special Andalite-Yeerk superbond the avatar confirmed, and it has to do at least partly with being able to access knowledge that E and C have hidden.

The Yeerk-Andalite superbond is part of the next stage of the game, which is why certain thoughts and ideas are locked off from both species until after they've joined together. One of the things at stake in this stage is whether that bond will be dominated by a single United Visser 3 mind controlling millions of bodies, or a Harmony of Helium-like cooperating systems.

Chapter 50:

  The creature chuckled, an unnervingly human sound. “You misunderstand,” it said. “Who am I speaking to right now---Aximili, or Perdão? It's not a question of black or white, good guys or bad guys, two distinct sets of pieces. *All of the pieces are gray. All belong equally to both players*, you no less than I.”
#+end_quote

Interlude 13:

#+begin_quote
  But in the end, the bait had simply been too tempting to resist. The reunification of nearly all of the *adversary's scattered pieces*---the Chee and the Animorphs and the new splinter coalescion---not to mention the further momentum toward cooperative symbiosis---
#+end_quote

So is this an inconsistency or something actually significant? Was Crayak (I assume) just referring to them as the adversary's pieces only because that was true at the time and not all the time? Or is it more like the Ellimist and Crayak have different 'playstyles' so to speak, and Ellimist sees 'all pieces belong to all players' whereas Crayak's mentality is more 'with-me-or-against-me'?

But actually the avatar is doing a bit of "fallacy of the gray" there, and in fact all of the pieces can be manipulable by both parties and yet still given pieces can be favored by one god or the other. The Animorphs are just as "touchable" by Crayak as they are by the Ellimist, but they're certainly more naturally "the Ellimist's pieces" just as the Howlers are more naturally "Crayak's."

** As promised, a longer review. Spoilers, of course.

First: I was surprised at how much progress they were able to make, when the Andalites (with much better weapons and more experienced morphers) and Yeerks (better weapons + ability to directly mind control large beasts) never made much progress into the mist. Conditional on them making it to the bottom, here are several rationalizations/explanations/possibilities, from least speculative to most:

- Better morphs, in particular the bat morph. Earth's higher biodiversity might lead to faster/smaller/stronger morphs than what the Andalites have access to. Ax stated previously that the Tardigrade and mite morphs used by the animorphs are probably smaller than anything Andalites have morphed. In this case, the /kafit/ bird was stated by Helium to be less impressive than Earth avians. It's most likely way less impressive than the bat morph used by Marco/Jake, and probably lacks echolocation (another important factor in their success). In fact, Marco 2^{27} notices that the bat morph is faster than anything in the forest. The fact that they can use the bat morph to sneak up on beasts, demorph, and acquire probably explains a lot of their success (it let them acquire both the 'goyf and the Allosaurus.) *Cons*: That being said, it's unlikely that the gorilla morphs used for combat are more impressive than the combat morphs available to the Andalites, let alone Andalite military hardware. The Andalites probably had some way of seeing through the mist using sound as well. This combined with the fact that the animorphs could acquire the Churner /without/ really using the maneuverability of the bat morph suggests that this can't be the only explanation.

- Overt divine intervention. That is, Crayak or Ellimist are intervening directly in the mist to allow them to survive. For example, they were lucky to encounter the Churner first, before the Tarmogoyf, Scorpion, or Allosaurus. It's possible that the Andalite teams immediately encountered a 'goyf or similarly fearsome creature, and got TPK'ed before "leveling up". Marco 2^{27} acquiring the 'goyf morph can be thought of a combination of divine intervention (by encountering it) and better morphs (my guess is that the bat was small enough to escape the 'goyf's attention and allow Marco to land on its back, demorph, and acquire it). *Cons*: Divine intervention explains everything sufficiently unlikely, and still leaves the question of how /exactly/ the two gods intervened.

- Better combat doctrine. Perhaps by relying primarily on morphs instead of weapons, the Animorphs didn't draw as much attention as the Andalites/Yeerks did. In addition, I could see the Andalites favoring primarily frontal attacks, or Andalite military doctrine preventing suicide acquires. *Cons*: still, Andalites are a militaristic species, and had many more attempts to try to breach the mist. Even if the animorphs lucked into better tactics than the Andalites' first attempts, surely the Andalites would've eventually figured it out?

- Andalite plague. The Arn developed a plague that wiped out half the Andalite fleet in the system. In the worst case, it might prevent Andalites from going through the forest at all. In the best case, it still greatly reduces their interest in going through the mist, as opposed to killing the Yeerk fleet and glassing the Arn civilization. *Cons*: Helium was able to be in Andalite form without obvious ill effects, so the disease is likely not present in the forest at this moment. That being said, I think a lack of interest in talking to the Arn (as opposed to killing all of them) may explain why the Andalites haven't been trying to breach the forest very hard.

*** My intention was that it was a combination of the following:

- Better morphs, indeed including the bat, which I wanted to showcase as the "keystone" of a strategy, since we don't have the storyline from canon where the bat is how they get into a high-tech facility to steal the Chee chip. Things would have gone much worse without the bat.

- Different morphing /philosophy./ Note that the Andalites have only had morphing power for a couple more years than the humans, and also use it much less centrally; to them, it's mostly something used for infiltration and espionage rather than for overpowering the enemy. It would not occur to many non-Alloran Andalites, for instance, to even /try/ working their way up the chain, acquiring larger and larger monsters one by one. A squad of Andalites would be much more likely to go forward in their own bodies, attempting to simply shoot down the monsters, until eventually they made so much noise that they attracted a critical mass and were slaughtered. They also would have been less likely to have the key insight that Marco had, to weaponize the acquiring trance; note that the Animorphs were on track to /lose/ that first big battle until the two human Marcos made the sacrifice play.

- Less intervention from the Arn. Though it's not explicitly written out in this book, the Arn here have the same sort of pseudo-control over the monsters that they had in canon; once it becomes clear that people are trying to breach the mist, the Arn crank up surveillance and orchestration of the monsters, making them more like a police force and less like a random murdercloud. In this case, there's no current active large-scale conflict, so the Arn aren't watching closely, and the Animorphs weren't making a ton of noise/disturbance, so they didn't get noticed.

Note also that the Animorphs had penetrating the mist as a /specific goal/. During the Yeerk/Andalite war, the primary valued territory was the treetop villages (and eventually, at the very end, the canyon walls). That makes it worthwhile to /try/ sneaking through the mist, along the lines of "if we can approach unnoticed, that'll give us an edge in this battle." But once you discover that there is an extremely high cost to trying to sneak through the mist, and once your first, second, and third attempts to do it differently have all met with disaster, it's reasonable for many generals to just shrug and say "that's not really part of the map of this conflict; There Be Dragons." If neither side seems to be attempting to exploit the mist territory, then there's no arms-race pressure to be the group that figures it out. Again, Alloran and similar other 99th-percentile military minds (Marco, Ender Wiggin) would've probably kept at it anyway, expecting the payoff to be worth the investment in the end, but in this case Alloran (as Esplin's slave) was on the side that was already winning, and so didn't bother.

*** Second: Kudos on using the Tarmogoyf as one of the scariest monsters in the Arn death forest. I thought it seemed out of place, but it makes sense after more reflection.

Despite playing a lot of Magic, especially Modern (and thus facing a lot of Tarmogoyfs), I never did register how large a 'goyf could be. One part of this is the [[https://external-preview.redd.it/Is_J4AfnLYwrt3Rvix3raQTkeFwFmZ03W52JY2Cbxeg.jpg?auto=webp&s=0ef45241cffe429055136cf2e36ad2f2e596b559][Future Sight art]], which makes it look much smaller than the [[https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/wallpaper/wallpaper-week-tarmogoyf-2013-06-19][Modern Masters's art]], which your 'goyf is based on.

But it makes sense, a Goyf can easily be a 6/7 in normal game play, and maxes out as a 8/9. Dragons are 5/5-7/7s, and the larger Dinosaurs are in the same range as well. From DnD and the like, dragons could easily be 25+ meters long, as are the largest dionsaurs in reality. So a monster able to win against a dragon or dinosaur through sheer brute force could easily be larger than 25 meters. The Modern Masters art makes the 'goyf look about 30-40 meters long, based on the deer. Godzilla was 50 meters tall in the original 1954 film, so a 30-40 meter long 'goyf could easily "might have a chance vs Godzilla".

Interesting, this iteration of the 'goyf was designed primarily by Ryan Berger (the artist commissioned to do the reprint Art) and not the Magic team. Here's the art description, which is vague as to the actual look of the 'goyf:

#+begin_quote
  Color: Green creature

  Location: Ancient coniferous forest, touches of snow

  Action: We see a huge pile of debris atop a hill in the forest---rich loam, broken and rusted armor pieces, and countless bones amid the black dirt. From the debris heap bursts a massive monster that feeds on death. It's yours to design, but it should have a grey-brown hide maybe mottled with green or beige, an enormous set of jaws, and huge hands that can scoop up chunks of food, living or dead.

  Focus: The ancient and terrible creature

  Mood: A devouring monstrosity

Marco, in this chapter, holds my own personal view, which has two main parts:

1) The most important defining aspect of one's identity is one's /filter-nature/ ... what experiences you value, what things you would change about the world around you, what you would create, what you would destroy---the algorithm by which you, earthworm-like, filter universe through yourself and convert it into universe-prime.

2) Anything that would filter universe in the exact same way as you /is/ you; any copy of you running on any hardware is still you; as long as at least one copy is extant and actively filtering, you're still alive. If I could, with confidence, push a button to create an exact clone of me, identical in every way except he had uninjured knees, at the cost of dropping dead, I'd do it. I imagine that /in the moment/ I'd have significantly greater hesitation than I do when it's just a thought experiment, but it's central enough to my life philosophy that I expect I'd push through anyway, lest I abandon that very philosophy.

What if I do not change anything about the world around me? If I choose to exist-just-to-exist? I'd understand if people told me "Look, son, if you don't make anything out of your life, you'd be nobody." But that's being 'nobody' in a very abstract sense. As long as I can continue to perceive things, I'd be 'somebody'. Only when I stop perceiving things, I'd be 'nobody'.

I wonder if a more literal-minded thinker like Garret would hold the opposite view? Like he would have trouble considering clones of him to be 'him' even if they all made decisions the same way, or held the same values, or did everything the way he would.

Another thing: what experiences I value and what I would choose to create or destroy, these things can change over time, right? It's the reason why people can say "I was a different person back then." But you're not really a different person, except in a very abstract metaphorical sense. You're still the same person. It doesn't mean that if your values change, you are no longer 'you' does it?

In hindsight, I think it was dealt with a little in that V3 chapter, but I'm not entirely sure... But I wonder if V3 is also pursuing first-person immortality?

  I wonder if a more literal-minded thinker like Garret would hold the opposite view? Like he would have trouble considering clones of him to be 'him' even if they all made decisions the same way, or held the same values, or did everything the way he would.
#+end_quote

Garrett's already on record in this fic trying to convince Tobias to do morph-death-regeneration in order to fix his amputated hand. He's also on record thinking it would be /much/ better if both he and Tobias had multiple redundant clones.

Even if you're not changing the world around you, you're exercising preferences within it; the planet Thanos chose to retire on tells us a lot about what Thanos thinks is beautiful and rejuvenating, and if he had chosen a different world he would've been meaningfully a different person.

#+begin_quote
  Another thing: what experiences I value and what I would choose to create or destroy, these things can change over time, right? It's the reason why people can say "I was a different person back then." But you're not really a different person, except in a very abstract metaphorical sense. You're still the same person. It doesn't mean that if your values change, you are no longer 'you' does it?
#+end_quote

Personally, I am /horrified/ by people saying 'eh, I was a different person back then;' it seems akin to self-murder or personality erasure; if your future self is one day going to dismiss your present self utterly with a casual wave, then how can you even "know who you are" in any significant or enduring sense?

I note that if you enjoy questions like this, you should look forward to the Rachel chapter, upcoming in four weeks, with some amount of excitement. In particular, there's discussion of the distinction between identifying with your "sculpture" (the personality traits you currently exhibit) and identifying with your "sculptor" (the thing that decides which changes would be positive versus which changes would be negative).

You're a meaningfully different person every few years until at least your 30s, and possibly right up until forever if you live that long. You're a natural progression of who you were five years ago, but you're not the same guy. And future you is going to be a different guy all together as well.

Tom was looking for a safe place to stay with a wounded Ax and a comatose Tobias body (after Garrett stayed in morph).

Tobias woke up (naturally) and they decided to find volunteers to resurrect Marco, Jake, Rachel, and Garrett.

Marco was the first of the resurrected to wake up, and almost immediately began sneaking off with the cube to make clones. It was something he'd already considered even before the disaster, but once the line had already been crossed, he had basically no compunctions.

So the time in which clones were being made:

- Before the Jake-waking-up chapter
- During the Tobias chapter
- In the gap between the Tobias chapter and the Ax-waking-up chapter

... which is a span of something like 4-6 weeks; I don't have the timeline notes right in front of me. Enough time for him to make about 30 clones and for about a third of those to wake up.

*** 1. Morphers can acquire animals. Humans and other sapient species are not excepted. They morph specific beings, not just the species.
2. As an example: Bob acquires Alice, then morphs into her (Bob->Alice). Alice cuts her nails, becomes Alice'. Alice' acquires Bob->Alice. Alice' can now morph into Alice'->Bob->Alice, effectively regaining her lost nails. This is called "Morph Armor", where a person morphs into a past version of themself.
3. Morphing into an animal gives you their instincts/reflexes. This is implemented by copying the brain (except short-term memories), and then applying modified Yeerk tissue with a Z-space link to the morpher's emulated brain. The full brain and thus personality of that being is still there, just controlled by the Yeerk-tissue (which is controlled by the morpher). It is normally unconscious but can be "turned on" by the morpher.
4. When morphing, a morpher's original body is placed in stasis in a Z-space pocket dimension. This pocket dimension is unstable, and will collapse after ~2 hours (dependent on the mass stored in it- small beings can morph longer). When the collapse happens, the Yeerk tissue remains and the morphed entity is placed in a coma. Eventually the Yeerk tissue dies (possibly from kandrona deprivation? Lasts longer than usual since it isn't doing much) or is removed by the chee, leaving behind a clone of the morph.

Having written all this out I do wonder why a morpher can't turn on the morph's consciousness and then let the time limit expire, skipping the coma step. Presumably the Yeerk tissue automatically reverts to controlling when not being explicitly made to give the controlled being autonomy?

Jake's death: The true body was irreparably injured so Jake morphed into a morph-armor of himself and let the timer expire, leaving behind an older Jake (plus Yeerk tissue that had to be cleared)

If the kandrona deprivation hypothesis is correct than any human morphs acquired post-modification won't have the tissue degrade and thus won't leave the coma naturally.

2) when you stay past the time limit, the "real you" out in Z-space vanishes, and all that's left is the morphed body

3:The yeerk tissue is physically inside a person wearing morph armor. I thought that was just a metaphor.

4:Jake morphed into a physical copy of himself, without injuries /or the memories since his last backup/.

1. Get consent from a cancer patient. Grant the cancer patient morphing power with the device
2. Have them morph into him. Wait for the pocket dimension collapse. He now has a clone of himself in a coma.
3. Grant the coma clone morphing power with the device.
4. Eventually the clone wakes up and is now a fully autonomous morph-capable Marco-clone.

I'm quite confused by the long Marco death scene, it seems strictly better to have gone into a useful morph to get at least 2 hours of extra use out of him. My best guess for what the quote meant was that he expected this to be net distracting, because Jake would prioritise healing him later rather than the more important mission? But this doesn't feel that compelling, there ought to be a better alternative like injured Marco committing suicide at the end of the morph, or otherwise convincing Jake to give up on him.

*** "Strictly better" is such a tricky term.

Would it have been better to have an additional large and powerful body for a few more hours?

Absolutely.

I'd also expect a Marclone (of all people) to be able to function coherently for two hours even knowing that he would die at the end.

But there are a bunch of other considerations (mostly interpersonal/emotional, as you guessed) in the mix.

My read on Marco is that he's a satisficer, not an optimizer. He takes the first viable option "above the bar" ... he doesn't wait for the perfect thing unless perfection /is/ the bar.

And wounded, dying, thinking about Jake's emotional state, thinking about his /own/ state/happiness/desires, thinking about the fact that they're already arranged for the kind of death scene that we've been programmed by a thousand books and movies to expect to play out in a certain way---

If Marco were a perfect "Spock" straw rationalist, he'd shrug it off and hop back up for two more hours of duty before dying.

But he's a (brilliant, but still only) 14 year old kid, and he looked around at the rest of the clones, and it was enough for him to feel like they would make it, that his own contribution probably wouldn't make the difference between Jake living and Jake dying, and he was tired, and he was frightened, and he was trying to keep his best friend from freaking out, and he wanted a kiss before he said goodbye forever, and ultimately ...

He chose a graceful exit, over other important goals. I think this is defensible, though I agree you could argue for something more coldly utilitarian.
