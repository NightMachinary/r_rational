I'll start: anything by Mother Goose. Dead On Arrival (a classic Noir film whose protagonist is already surprisingly good at this).


** The Hitchhiker's Guide universe. Virtually everything happens "because the plot requires it" in there. There are rules, but they are definitely not sane. And you aren't statistically likely to be a hitchhiker, either -- unless the plot requires it.

*** This universe is not even particularly causal. There are events that have been changed to have never happened that still have an effect on reality (e.g. postcards of a cathedral that was never built due to time travel). If you examine the mechanics of Milliway's, there's decent evidence that you can run a successful restaurant by simply cycling through the same time period repeatedly and expect to get different customers on each repeat.

I'm frankly not even sure if it's rational to try to be rational in a universe that divorced from cause and effect and other basic assumptions we make.

**** It seems you can still predict the results of your actions to a reasonable degree in the Hitchhiker's universe. There's a wildly larger chance of some black swan event throwing you off, what with infinite improbability drives running around, but most of the time things work normally. Rationality is still optimal.

A rational fanfic in the series is still probably no good, though. Either:

- The protagonist never gets access to the weird stuff - but then, why is this set in the HG universe?
- The protagonist gets access to time travel and improbability drives - presumably they rapidly become a god.
- The protagonist and antagonist get access to this nonsense and are both rational - now we need a consistent underlying behavior for the universe so we can mediate, but we don't have one.

I guess maybe a rational protagonist with no access to time travel and such versus a less competent antagonist who does have all the causality-busters would work, but it seems like this could easily succumb to solving problems via tecnobabble.

***** Codifying the actual laws of this universe might actually be possible, too. I think the biggest step here is allowing there to be multiple kinds of time travel.

One type of time travel is to have 2D time. Nothing (or very little) naturally moves in the second time dimension, and moving through that sends you backwards in the first. (Similar things are often phrased with creating alternate universes; the need to create a universe always seemed unnecessary to me.) This lets you handle the case of the cathedral that was never built but still has postcards - any postcards in time traveling vessels at the point where the cathedral was un-built still exist.

Most series only do one kind of time travel as a way of conserving detail, but you could have the above in addition to something else, like HP:MoR style always-stable time loops. You'd have to decide whether time loops happen in 2D time or 1D time or there's both available, but all of these are comprehensible (though at this point, challenging.)

I'm not sure what kind of time travel makes Milliways work. But for the rational HG universe, all that's necessary is that you find one, and that people use it for things other than just this restaurant.

*** Now that you bring up Warhammer 40K... I think any setting in with lots of malevolent higher powers would be difficult to write rational fanfiction for, because in universe any rational character who actually started winning would get smacked down by stuff they had no way to stop, or even see coming. Additionally, settings in which all the powerful abilities damage the user's sanity/ reasoning ability because this creates a tradeoff between epistemic and instrumental rationality. So Lovecraft's stuff, played straight also meets these requirements. Old World of Darkness does to some extent too I think.

**** Lovecraft's stuff is particularly notable here because, although his works are legendary for sanity loss in characters, his protagonists tend to act in reasonable ways. Also, his higher powers are rarely actively malicious, which is something that many authors in his universe tend to forget. I've always wanted to expand on the "sane man in an insane universe" concept that he seems to be hinting at, but never have found a way I like to make it work.

I agree on the problem of malevolent higher powers in universes. Now that I think about it, it might be possible to write fiction where the rational character has to actively avoid catching their attention. That could lead to a really interesting story where the struggle is to make small changes that add up without disrupting the expected course of events enough to merit actual intervention. If it goes right, you could possibly have a story where the primary antagonist never actually does anything but still remains a massive challenge and threat, which would be interesting.

I think you might need the opposite strategy, depending on how the precognition works. If the precognition is just extreme predictive ability based on present information, yes this strategy might work. If the precognition has some supernatural mechanism, then you might need to build up all preparations under some kind of anti-precog effect and then make one giant master move to change the balance of things.

Idea for rational WH40K! A society of nulls, knowing they are immune to pskyers and warp precognition, go about setting up a master plan to disrupt the chaos gods.

In Excel Saga, it isn't clear if those people were just crazy and had weird abilities, or if the entire world worked that way. I lean towards them being the odd ones, as a normal person (the foreign worker) is initial shown to have been dragged into the craziness and then reacts as one would logically expect (i.e. horror and fear). It seems to take place in the "real world", so just do the standard /world++/ thing when dealing with the oddities.

Having another normal (rational) person interface with those weird Excel Saga people would work, as would something like a rationalHyatt dealing with being (apparently) deathly ill as well as apparently now immortal. All it would need is strong causes for everything (even if they aren't explained) and well-worked out rules, something the setting doesn't preclude.

[[http://sburbunofficial.proboards.com/thread/110/play-sburb-endgame-complete][It's been done.]] Not without pissing off everyone else in the setting (unilaterally munchkining a shared universe is not going to be well-received), but it does in fact exist.

For the record, I know of it because I was one of the people who helped establish the setting as a shared universe for fanfiction, and he walked all over the point of the thing (true, it was technically a setting about broken people becoming more broken, but it was also about emotional abuse and trauma, coping skills, and the value of establishing social connections in the face of repression, and even served as a rather effective improptu group therapy for a while). Somehow I am /still/ friends with the guy who did it (the pressure of 'belonging to the same group' is a powerful thing), although only after he grew up and realized that some stories are meant to fulfill other emotional needs and thus probably shouldn't be munchkinned - at least, not within earshot of the creators.

*** I'd disagree. Doomed timelines seem to only occur when the Alpha timeline needs one to provide it with something, or when events occur that contradict a timeloop required for those same events to occur. There's wiggle room.

**** That's true. But then, there are many time loops that the players have little to no knowledge of that they must complete to maintain loops. For example, in the first set of acts if John hadn't wandered into the lab where he mashed some buttons to create himself and his friends, it would have doomed the timeline. And since a rational player probably wouldn't go around mashing buttons like that, you'd need to make some major changes to have a rational John.

Also, if John hadn't killed himself via denizen, Dave would have prototyped lil' Cal, which would prevent it being used to create Doc. Scratch.

Basically, loop stability relies heavily on John being an idiot.

***** You'd have to have John figure out the time loops or at least the crucial actions through all the tools available to him, as opposed to blind luck/predetermination. It'd be interesting to see that play out.

Other way around. Dave prototyped Cal, thus Dooming the timeline (since without a Cal to send back with Bro, Cal couldn't exist), while John was on his way to a long slog though the pipe, a talk with his Denizen, then a Choice that ended in his death and continued existence as opposed to erasure after four months. It's only implied otherwise early on to downplay Cal's importance.

Although I don't see why the proposed fanfic has to have a rationalist John as opposed to a rationalist anybody else, or that it can't make changes to the overall plot despite many aspects of Sburb drawing directly on the player's personality and mind set. Is there some specific definition of a Rational fanfic I've missed?

****** For your last point, I was just using John as an example of the sorts of shenanigans that changing the story could cause.

Now thinking through it, a story where the main character is trying to figure out what needs to be done to complete the time loops could work, but the plot and format would still be pretty wildly different.

In this case, dooming your timeline through naive "rationality" is two-boxing. It is rational to try to predict what timeline will end up not-doomed, and then be the you that that timeline takes as input. The whole fic could basically be called "Stress-Testing Timeless Decision Theory".

*** With a bit of imagination, a rational spinoff is most certainly possible. Let me elaborate on my ideas for a SBURB game thread which I never got around to:

- Sylladex inventory exploits. Seriously, being able to carry items without weight opens up entirely new echelons of crazy prepared.
- With a bit of ingenuity it is possible to design a system /like/ alchemization that actually is genuinely exploitable. I don't think I ever wrote mine down, but it worked on several characteristics of items like material, use, intent, durability and other abstract concepts. A ruleset can easily be made if you are willing to eschew Captchas/bit patters for the information storage.
- Set it in a novel world and have the characters be part of/involved with a plot to create SBURB in the first place.
- Make the incipisphere huge, and run off common tropes of getting pulled out of the ordinairy and into the fantastic, like Dungeon Keeper Ami does it. Actually, draw inspiration from that one a lot.
- Have the characters explore their worlds and their powers and the societies of Prospit and Derse. Plenty of room for interesting political play there.
- Make the whole world larger, disregard HS canon as you see fit. It is already a many-year trend to make novel characters and sessions, (like Altpower!Taylor fics is in worm) so create an incipisphere the size of a solar system.
- Explore the [[http://stormingtheivorytower.blogspot.dk/2014/07/hyperflexible-mythology-classpects.html][hyperflexible mythology]] and make your own set of classes and aspects.
- Fuck around with time travel, read [[http://qntm.org/excellent][this article]] and the relevant parts of HPMOR.

I could go on. My ideas for the session story I was:

- Main characters are veritable prodigies who founded SkaiaNet at a young age, after discovering the frog temple and reverse-engineering the tech within and subsequently relinquish power to boards of directors and CEO's and what not.
- They figure out that SBURB will destroy the world and tries to halt the development of it, but the board of directors want none of it, sending trained killers after them
- They sabotage what they can, and escape, subjecting themselves to mild age regression treatments, cosmetic surgery, and memory-wiping and then witness protection in order to hide, all with hypnotically induced passwords and layers of protection.
- The plot then starts when one of the main characters (an archaeologist) settles down near the now cleared out Frog Temple and finds it contains runes written in formal language describing how to create the program that is SBURB.
- At the same time the friendleader gets messages from an unknown party from the future, and her mind-blocks start unraveling. Notably, not five minutes after she decides on a time-travel password, does she receive a message coded with it. As should be the case.
- They start playing the came and the world starts ending, and it becomes apparent that it was a foregone conclusion.
- Then it turns out that the CEO of SkaiaNet who has been hunting them, is actually the time player come back from a doomed timeline that they mucked up in more ways than can be enumerated. Working from a really extensive list of things she has engineered the entire escapade, and promptly prototypes herself to become the guide for the time player. One really great twist was that the time player is non-binary and presents masculine, while the CEO presents as feminine.
- Finally getting into the incipisphere, my plot sort of ran out into extreme exploits of the system, armies of robots and the politics of Derse and Prospit and ensuring that the correct chain of events happen, the correct tech gets invented and stowed in the frog temple for SkaiaNet to harness, and ultimately they save Earth by minifying it and moving it through a portal window.

That was as far as I got. The actual society of Earth was a Sci-fi setting of some merit in itself, in the middle of an ice-age making the temperate regions all but uninhabitable, and being run on hydroponics and time-bending fields a la [[http://qntm.org/ground][The Ground Effect]]. An entire culture of post-scarcity, and the tragedy of it being snuffed out by meteors.

There is loads to be done in Homestuck. You just have to jump some bandwagons and mix it up. It will never be Homestuck fanfiction, but HS is not as character-driven a story as Worm, or Harry Potter, but it does have a hyperflexible mythology, and a set template of adventure.

Man, now I feel like writing this thing out.

How about Care Bears? I never actually saw the cartoon, but my understanding is that either you're happy or they hit you with a Happiness Beam to /make/ you happy. And I believe they have a Care Bear Stare that they use to shut down any actions they disapprove of.

It would be like living in a psych ward where they medicate and lobotomize you constantly.

***** I almost brought up Care Bears, then decided I probably shouldn't, for reasons.

In general, I wouldn't say the Care Bears are pro-wireheading; they mostly just try talk-therapy and random adventures to help people cope with situations that are almost always #firstworldproblems. They mostly save the love-beams for enemies who are actively attacking people. The real question is how their system works: they live in a cloud-city (their cousins live in a forest), with cloud and anthropomorphic star-based technology, and have an enormous measuring device that detects sad children and uses an unspecified sorting algorithm to prioritize missions. Even if we ignore the whacky magic involved, one must wonder at how they choose missions (there's probably some Effective Altruism / Consequentialism parable just waiting to be written, there).

(I don't remember the Care Bears ever having to pick a mission from a list of options. The Caring Meter clearly has the ruthless decision-making process, so the Care Bears don't have to get caught in Trolley Problems.)

*** Is it bad that I liked that song?

/Ahem/

The point of a Barney movie whose exact title I don't remember appears to have been that Barney is a sentient Green Lantern ring, and those that use his terrible power can accomplish anything they can imagine. Suffice it to say, there must be a reason we never see an evil reality-warping dinosaur running around. ... for definitions of "evil" that exclude leading children in musical numbers.

I'm imagining Barney's evil counterpart (let's call him "Fred") being gifted to a serial killer on death row, who then uses his dread power to escape and go on a rampage. However, his imagination was no match for that of the local SWAT. The US Military naturally began searching all stuffed dinosaurs for traces of this power. Barney and friends tried singing a song about love to dissuade them from taking Barney for experimentation. It worked, but ... not as intended.
