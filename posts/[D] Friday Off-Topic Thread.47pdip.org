Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

When hitting an armor plate, friction and the energy of collision can cause lead bullets to reach their relatively low melting point and go molten, turning kinetic energy into heat and splattering rather than cutting.

In addition to being less than 1/11th as dense as lead (and thus imparting less than 1/11th the kinetic energy), water is /already/ molten, and it vaporizes at a significantly lower temperature than lead melts.

Being pelted by vaporizing beads of water at somewhere less than 300 meters per second is going to be painful, but far from deadly. <fun>

Most of the time it's better for the knight (or, for that matter, the modern soldier) to be able to move unencumbered and quickly get out of the line of fire than to be wearing armor that is thick enough, dense enough, and layered enough to stop bullets.

** I just got done playing SUPERHOT and have to say that it's the most innovative shooter I've played in years.

The gimmick (and I mean that in the best possible way) is that time only moves when you move, so you're spending the vast majority of your time plotting out your moves instead of doing fast twitch actions. In many ways it's a puzzler, not a shooter.

My wife was watching me fail repeatedly at a level and said, "Why don't you cut the bullet in half with your katana?" which I then proceeded to do, and it was awesome.

**** I see you haven't actually claimed to have read the article, but you sound like you are commenting on the content, while in reality Wolfram didn't actually say what you "think [he] wrote". In the future I would warmly recommend actually reading an article, before passing judgement on what its author is saying. If the article is too long or not interesting enough for you just say so.

Not to say there nothing to criticize the post for, but over-blowing the relevancy of wormholes and exotic matter, is definitely not one of them.

Out of almost 10k words these are the only parts(around 3%) I could find,and that I can remember, touching on exotic matter and\or wormholes:

#+begin_quote
  In General Relativity, the only way to effectively go faster than light is to modify the structure of spacetime. For example, one can imagine a “wormhole” or tube that directly connects different places in space. In General Relativity there's no way to form such a wormhole if it doesn't already exist---but there's nothing to say such wormholes couldn't already have existed at the beginning of the universe. There is a problem, though, in maintaining an “open wormhole”: the curvature of spacetime at the end would tend to create gravity that would make it collapse.

  I don't know if it can be proved that there's no configuration of, say, orbiting black holes that would keep the wormhole open. One known way to keep it open is to introduce matter with special properties like negative energy density---which sounds implausible until you consider vacuum fluctuations in quantum field theory, inflationary-universe scenarios or dark-energy ideas. Introducing exotic matter makes all sorts of new solutions possible for the Einstein equations. A notable example is the Alcubierre solution, which in some sense provides a different way to traverse space at any speed, effectively by warping the space. Could there be a solution to the Einstein equations that allows something similar, without exotic matter? It hasn't been proved that it's impossible. And I suppose one could imagine some configuration of judiciously placed black holes that would make it possible.

  And even with spinning black holes and the like, I don't know of any way to achieve the analog of gravitational shielding---though this changes if one introduces exotic matter that effectively has negative mass, or if, for example, every black hole has electric charge.

Had you mentioned in your original post that the title is misleading and that you found the "BH technologies" to not be too interesting I probably wouldn't have responded to you in the first place. But your original comment suggested the article was something it most definitely isn't.

On a side note, even in the limited context of "BH technologies" wormholes and exotic matter are less then quarter of the content, and as my quote shows are not presented as a "lets use wormholes and exotic matter to go faster than light!!", but as a "the only ways to do X that I am aware of are with Y, which may be possible given theorem Z" hardly something I would describe as an attempt to hype or overuse buzzwords.

*** The president has significantly less power as head of state than it frequently appears.

There is power, as Commander-in-Chief of the military, to carry out military actions, but theoretically the congress could stop that at any time by refusing to pay for it. The president also appoints many major civil servants, again subject to congressional approval. In return, the president can veto their legislation (subject to a two-thirds majority override), and with appointments to the Justice Department the president has a good degree of control over how (and, functionally, whether) congressional laws are enforced.

If the president is only interested in sustaining the status quo, or is supported by a compliant congress, it can appear that the executive branch has a lot of power. The president makes proposals and those proposals are executed.

When a president acts in opposition to congress (not merely, as with the last few presidents, opposition to half of it) presidential power can evaporate very quickly indeed.

Additionally, there is a great deal of political capital to be gained by fighting for significant change specifically when it /can't/ be implemented. Both parties are braver about proposing and voting for legislation that would please their base but offend independents when they know the other party's president will veto it.

All the benefit of having fought the good fight, with none of the requirement to deal with legislative consequences.

President Bernie Sanders would say more things that please non-Americans than President Hillary Clinton would... and a /lot/ more such things than President Donald Trump would. Whether any of those things would lead to significant change is almost entirely in the hands of congress.

**** It is of course 100% the case that even with a 51% Democratic Congress and Senate (60% seems unlikely), Sanders stands no chance of pushing through every piece of legislation he has campaigned on. However, one of Sanders' main strengths is that he draws crowds and volunteers to a higher degree than most politicians, even than Clinton, who is still leading in the polls. If there were no Super PACs, he would be outraising her to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. A president who is good at getting normal citizens to care enough to get involved is able to apply a lot of soft pressure on individual congressmen and senators, especially when they have public opinion on their side. Plus, for all that he was Independent, he has been in congress and the senate for a long time. He and Clinton both know that game.

Ultimately, for me it boils down to: Sanders wants to make systemic changes to improve the lives of the vast majority of Americans (There is an economic argument to be had here, but it works in Europe, and I really don't like trickle down economics), and is the candidate least likely to help multinational corporations bully governments around the world. Plus, it's almost unthinkable that the Senate would refuse to confirm a Supreme Court Justice for 5/9 years, and Sanders would definitely hold out on putting forward Justices he liked. He won't get everything he wants, maybe not even the majority of what he wants, but I'd rather have a president who tried, and who made perfectly certain that the issues were at least discussed.

Now, I realize [[/r/rational]] is very unlikely to all favour Sanders, and I will certainly confine the political discussion to this comment tree, but it's Offtopic Friday, so if anyone wants to keep discussing the election or Sanders, I'd love to hear the input of people here.

**** I agree with everything you said, but I feel like I should point out that although it is theoretically possible for congress to refuse to pay for war and stop it that has never happened. The three main reasons being the President doesn't need the approval of congress to fight if it isn't a war, so he just doesn't call it such(if memory serves the US has only technically served in 6 wars). Second being that Republicans are almost always pro war anyways allowing the president to go to anyone that does anything they don't like on any pretext they can think of. Third of course is that us Americans really like spending money on our military, so the idea that republicans (hell even a democratic supermajority) seems so unlikely that it almost seems impossible.

Eliminating the $20 or so that it takes to get a state ID card is a start, but it seems virtually impossible to eliminate the hassle even if you did your best to streamline the process more than it already is. It would almost certainly require people to go to their local DMV, which disproportionately hurts poor people because they're far less likely to own a car. It also takes some non-zero amount of time, which disproportionately hurts poor people because they're more likely to work multiple jobs.

There's not really a good way to do photo ID "hassle free", at least not if you want to make it secure. And that hassle is almost always going to affect poor people, which is what Republicans want (if I'm being charitable, I would say that this is more of a lack of empathy for the poor than it is an attempt at suppression, but I don't know whether charity is warranted here).

We don't even have a national voting holiday in the United States.

******* Good point. Even here in Sweden, the most convenient way of getting a photo ID involves two trips to the nearest police station. It could certainly be made /more/ convenient though, if government /wanted/ people to have a proper ID. If you wanted to find a way to give everyone a photo ID (which you might want to do for other reasons than voting, like building sinister citizen DNA/fingerprint/photo registers or whatever), you could set it up as part of the process of registering for food stamps/graduation from high school, etc. Or just offer a $100 tax rebate for getting it done.

Of course, if you just want fewer likely Democrats to vote, understaffed DMVs with hour long lines and no national voting holiday is probably the way to go.

In smaller communities, where that person has clear, decisive impact on how we live each day (think any show with a small group of 'survivors' such as Lost or The Walking Dead), people are much more concerned with that person being capable, as well as likable.

In a situation where they feel free from worrying about how capable the person is (due to the overarching distance between the POTUS and your average citizen), they're going to stray towards the person they like more. Especially when they're not very learned, or inclined to research. Modern politics is, more often than not, a popularity contest, as far as who gets the popular vote anyway. And charismatic, well spoken and most of all /well liked/ individuals always win those.

TL;DR: When a person has little real stake in who wins a competition and/or isn't well versed on the technicalities of said competition, they're just going to vote for the guy they like.

More plausibly, I would try to find some rich patron that would be satisfied by the standard time-traveller wares: gunpowder, the printing press, basic sanitation, accounting etc. D&D magic may be superior to a lot of that tech, but (except in Eberron) it's prohibitively expensive to non-spellcasters and doesn't scale well.

** The outcome of the Iranian Elections is [[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/27/reformists-and-moderates-lead-race-in-early-election-results][looking up]]. If the reformists and moderates continue to do well, we should see big improvements. I don't have high hopes for the Assembly of Experts, but should the moderates manage to get control of that, we should see big changes in the next 20 years. Regardless, these elections vindicate Rouhani. His opponents claim that his conciliatory attitude towards the west and willingness to negotiate makes Iran weak and is unpopular with the people. It seems they have been proven wrong. With renewed support we should expect the pro-liberalization factions in Iran to have a stronger mandate going forward, and the Ayatollah will have even less grounds to restrict them.

The Assembly of Experts is the elected body that has the power to kick out the Ayatollah (leader of the theocratic branch of the Iranian government) and is in charge of selecting a new one when the current one dies or retires. Ali Khamenei, the current Ayatollah, is 76 and has cancer, which means this Assembly of Experts is probably the one that will select the next Ayatollah. A win for the non-conservative parties here could give them control of the theocratic branch of government, potentially for decades. This is important because one of the things that has slowed down the wave of liberalization going through Iran is the theocratic branch.

*** The trouble with ciphers is that it's hard to use the power of collective intelligence to work together, because there's really no incremental progress. If you try exactly the right thing, the message shifts from gibberish to perfect English all at once; if you try almost-but-not-quite the right thing, the result still looks like gibberish and there's no signal that you're on the right track. There's no ability to post, "This thought seems like a promising lead, what do other people make of it?" and have others take up the baton.

For the long cipher passage from chapter 2, I got as far as to note that the passage uses all 26 characters, has a letter frequency distribution inconsistent with English but consistent with random text, and has no strong periodic index of coincidence for any period 1--20. So that ruled out a whole bunch of common cipher types, but I didn't have any idea how to proceed from there.

The only in-text hints were Dipper's description of a right isosceles triangle and Mabel's admonishment to hold off on proposing solutions. Since I was unable to make much of the former, I instead listened to the latter.

/Edit:/ I think if I saw one or two of these things get solved in the text, that would give me a sense of where in the enormous solution space you as the author had your attention focused, and I'd have a lot more success with future ciphers.

I would just like to add on the fact that people also don't tend to see crossing out possibilities as progress. For example in a perfect collective intelligence, what you just outlined would be used as incremental progress to know what doesn't need to be repeated and to focus attention on different types of codes.

Unfortunately people see failures as wastes of time instead of progress, when in research, any experimental result is information to be used to narrow down the hypothesis space.

*** The problem is that [[/r/rational]] likes to solve whodunnit mysteries, social manipulations, or munchkining problems, but your fanfiction was the first story that I have ever seen posted here with any codes involved whatsoever. If you still want to have readers who like that sort of stuff while having rational stuff, put the codes as aside-attraction and share your story with [[/r/codes]].

TL;DR - The codes can include hints, but make the story solvable (albeit harder) without codes.

I ask because I'll often see the points fluctuate, even on posts with only maybe 8-9 voters. As an example, try hitting refresh right now and watch the numbers fluctuate. You can even try this on an old post with a low sub count

#+begin_quote
  *How is a submission's score determined?*

  A submission's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not "real" numbers, they have been "fuzzed" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are "fuzzed".
