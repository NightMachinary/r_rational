** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8753582/1/Overlady][Also available on Fanfiction.net]], but not updated as promptly with new chapters.

This is extremely an well written and amazingly funny story that deconstructs to some extent the traditional fantasy tropes. It is totally readable without knowing the Zero no Tsukaima (Familiar of Zero) or Overlord source material, but if you do know that material there's a few bonuses. It totally blows away either of it's source material. It's super well written and amazingly funny, and I love it a lot. It updated twice relatively recently, and both updates were amazing.

Ironically, much of Overlord was written by Terry Pratchett's daughter Rhianna, but Overlady is very close to Pratchett stylistically at times and has a very similar sense of humour, while the Overlord source material by-and-large does not.

*** Definitely very Pratchett-esque, and with the quality of writing required to pull it off. Been following for a while, I very much recommend it.

Not sure how rational I'd call it, but the self-referential humour that spends a lot of time mocking irrationality through obvious wrongness in thinking might just count.

**** Mmm...I wouldn't call it Rational per se, since so much of Louise's trouble stems from her inability to communicate with other people like a normal human being. Her ingrained response to stress is "EXPLOSION!".

Also, I was kind of not super thrilled that this story fails the M!Bechdel Test. I enjoy balanced casts, and insist on a damn good reason to be present if you're monogendereing the cast. It just feels like so many excellent opportunities for interaction are lost when you strip out the silly stuff men and women do together, as opposed to the shit men do with only men around and women do with only women around.

That said, the writing is excellent. EarthScorpion is very adept at the humour technique of unexpected reversals, like that scene with Cattleya and the maid. The blend of ZnT locations and the depravity of Overlord's setting results in some excellent "wtf is this how do you people live here?!?", and things are often followed through to their logical conclusion, rather then left to dangle in the plotbreeze.

I do think the story is only Excellent on the first read-through, though. Since so much of the humour is designed around surprise, you lose a good amount of impact when you know the upcoming punchline. Also, a lot of the character interactions are fueled almost entirely by chaos and inefficiency, and it can get a little tedious to read without the lubricant of constant surprise funnies.

But overall I recommend it.

Ah, but what about Kirche? She's a man. An incredibly manly one at that.
