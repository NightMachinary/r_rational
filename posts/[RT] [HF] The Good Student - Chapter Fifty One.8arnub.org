** - My best guess regarding the Librarian's identity is that she is an unpowered fork of the demon --- not directly synchronized with her, perhaps significantly diverged after decades of existence, but still a fork. Or is she part of some /other/ faction?

- Denkne was /reclaimed/, hmm. Mages are totally brainwashed demons. Or brainwashed forks of demons, like the Librarian but with more power.

- Dizzy was really interesting this chapter.

    *Dizzy:* Did it not occur to you that the person being misled here is you? <...> That this moment, where you have everything ready to complete your ‘task' is really just a pretence? Look who you have to wield as your tools. A girl not yet ready, two boys who can barely walk and talk at the same time <...> and a couple of empty vessels. What kind of fighting force is that? As much as your kind is adept at arranging for people to think they have made their own choice in getting to where you wanted them, haven't you succumbed to the same? Somewhere, there is someone placing you in this position, making you think it is all your own idea. Do you really think you have reached your desired goal with us at your back? You planned so long to get here, with us? This is your grand scheme? Where are your demons? Where is the army you raised to sweep away those who stand in your way?

  This applies to /so many/ faux-Chessmasters in so many works of fiction.

*** If by "interesting" you mean "displaying a remarkable lack of self-awareness", I'd have to agree.

Also, it seems rather likely that the demons are studying humans because they want to be able to reproduce. The Librarian and the Mages are key to that, but there's still bits we haven't seen yet.

Well, that too. It is amusing how big she speaks/thinks, and how disproportionally little of consequence she actually accomplished. Killed Denkne and minorly inconvenienced the Librarian --- I think that's all? I think Denkne was even there only to deal with meddlers such as her, so she probably didn't affect the enemy's plans at all.

Her perspective and rants are still entertaining.

Hmm, there were also speculations that they're trying to learn how to change. And, if my speculations regarding the demon --- demon-fork!Librarian divergence are correct, they're at least partially successful in that too.

Of course, the most important question is the circumstances in which they arrived in the human world. Was this an accident involving the All-Father, or a deliberate expedition, or...?

** Oh god, Simole and Dizzy together in one room. Time to get some popcorn cause the fireworks will be real.

I still think that mages and dragons are two halves of the same coin. Why does the demon think human cheated them?

I wonder how much of what we see from Dizzy is real. Did she say all those things about Nic because she wanted to manipulate the boys or was there some truth in it?

  “No,” said the Librarian. “They can only delay. And we can wait. Look.” She pointed at Simole. “In the end, they will give us what they agreed to.”
#+end_quote

Oh, so I guess the mages promised the demons to give them children, and simole was the first. I mean, the whole being able to bear children thing seem to be a major focus for them.

#+begin_quote
  “I give you permission,” said Dizzy. “No one knows what he would want better than me.”
#+end_quote

For the love of... Can someone slap this pretentious egocentric holier-than-thou asshole over here, please?

Literally the only thing she has has been shown to be good at up to this point is climbing and bossing people around. For fuck sake, even Fanny has displayed more value than her, and he is the butt monkey of the cast.
