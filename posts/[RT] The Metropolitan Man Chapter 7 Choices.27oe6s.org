** This is awesome :) I'm no Superman nerd but, while everyone complains that he's boring because he's invincible, I've always found him intriguing because of the question "what would it be like to be invulnerable, that powerful, and all-seeing, and want to do good?" So the scene with Superman wrestling with that dilemma was super awesome.

You're doing a really good job of realistically portraying a benevolent alien trying to do good, alone, without being a dictator. I can't imagine what it must be like to know, to really /know/, the suffering that goes on day to day.

I bet he'd have the biggest, most brightest, patronus :P

*** This chapter, I think, especially highlights how difficult it would be to take on the role of Superman, and keep the same morals. To contain your anger and only /arrest/ the psychopaths who kidnapped the children would take much more willpower than I believe I have.

** I'm really enjoying this story so far!

Not sure how much you care about historical accuracy, but there are a couple of anachronisms in this chapter you might want to fix if you do:\\
-The term 'genocide' wasn't coined until ~WWII.\\
-IRL, the 4th Amendment wasn't incorporated until the Warren court in the 60s (see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights][Wikipedia]]--the opening of the article, which refers to incorporation starting in the 20s, is a little misleading, because the 1920s stuff was mostly the 1st amendment).\\
-I'm assuming the use of 'existential risk' was an intentional anachronism... ;)

For the first issue, looks like it's better to use the term 'crimes against humanity,' which was used before WWI. ('Ethnic cleansing', like 'genocide,' dates from the 40s.) The second issue seems more serious, and you might be better off just not mentioning incorporation at all rather than attempting to lampshade.

*** I'm doing my best to keep historically accurate, but trying not to sweat it too much - after all, history is divergent before Superman even shows up, because it's Metropolis and Gotham City instead of New York and Chicago. (Most of the time in the DC universe those cities exist alongside New York City and Chicago, which makes even less sense).

"Existential risk" is intentional, and I'm fine with that. "Genocide" I will change over to "crimes against humanity".

Incorporation is a bit trickier. The 4th wasn't incorporated until later, but I guess my idea is that one of those two cases would be the one that incorporates (in part or in whole) the 4th Amendment, which is what is meant by "The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution has been incorporated against the states, which many see as a worrying expansion of federal power." - it's meant to say "this just now happened, and a lot of people are displeased by this because of differing opinions on the nature of the 14th Amendment". But maybe it should just be removed. It might be one of those things that is better in my head than on the page.

**** Right, I got that these were supposed to be the cases in which the 4th amendment was incorporated. The question is just whether that's something that makes sense given the time period...

#+begin_quote
  The *incorporation of the Bill of Rights* (or *incorporation* for short) is the process by which [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States][American]] courts have applied portions of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights][U.S. Bill of Rights]] to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state][states]]. Prior to 1925, the Bill of Rights was held only to apply to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States][federal government]]. Under the *incorporation doctrine*, most provisions of the Bill of Rights now also apply to the state and local governments.

  Prior to the ratification of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution][Fourteenth Amendment]] and the development of the incorporation doctrine, the Supreme Court in 1833 held in /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron_v._Baltimore][Barron v. Baltimore]]/ that the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal, but not any state governments. Even years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court in /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Cruikshank][United States v. Cruikshank]]/ (1876) still held that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution][First]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution][Second Amendment]] did not apply to state governments. However, beginning in the 1920s, a series of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States][United States Supreme Court]] decisions interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to "incorporate" most portions of the Bill of Rights, making these portions, for the first time, enforceable against the state governments.

** Another good chapter. Superman seems to be becoming unstable pretty quickly and Lex doesn't have enough information to actually hurt him yet. If Superman's rampage is confined to only criminals and people he judges to be bad then Lex might still have some time. But if Superman decides to throw an asteroid at Earth or something then they're all dead.

"early portion of the trail" should be "trial." "attempts by put" should be "attempts to put". "So call if" should be "so call it"

*** He doesn't seem about to throw an asteroid at Earth. I see him as someone desperate to do good, to ease suffering where possible, but it's not the suffering that's hurting him. He's basically been witness to every death that's happened his entire life, so it seems to be evil and injustice that pisses him off.

If I were he, I would probably have at least gone through a phase of seeking out evildoers and ripping them apart. Maybe he already did, in his teenage years, or maybe that's what he's on the verge of at the moment.

** I think you're at least as good at this rational fic business than Yudkowsky. Is your depiction of Superman influenced by Scion?

*** It's somewhat influenced by Worm, in that I've read Worm and I don't think you can read through thirty novels worth of material and then write in the same genre a few months later and not be influenced. But there's not a conscious attempt there.

In terms of the biggest influences, [[http://www.amazon.com/Its-Superman-Tom-De-Haven/dp/0811844358][It's Superman!]] is a novel I read nearly a decade ago that really stuck with me - it features a more "real" take on Superman (a realness that kind of falls apart towards the end, in my opinion) and is absolutely soaked in Depression-era atmosphere - a real character study of Superman. As soon as I'm done with this, I'll probably go back and read it again, but I'm trying to keep a purity of vision as much as I can and worry I'd start subconsciously mimicking.

There are also two depictions of Superman and Lex Luthor that I really liked, which are [[http://www.amazon.com/Luthor-Brian-Azzarello/dp/1401229301][Lex Luthor: Man of Steel]] and [[http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Red-Son-Mark-Millar/dp/1401201911/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1402448437&sr=1-3&keywords=lex+luthor+man+of+steel][Superman: Red Son]], both of which I think do a good job of depicting Lex Luthor's mindset and the terrifyingness of Superman (and both of which are standalone). The former does a good job of showing the world through Luthor's eyes, while the later features a Soviet Superman who is in direct values conflict with Lex.

I guess I think of Scion as more enigmatic, and even when you learn more about him, he still remains more or less that way. Whereas with Superman, he's essentially human - you might disagree with him, but you can still understand how a person might make those decisions. So while there's probably some influence, I see them as very different people.

Edit: Also, Scion was at least partly inspired by Superman in the first place, so there's that.
