** Yo, [[/u/nobody103]], you make this whole metric shit-ton of worldbuilding but are still unsure if you want to make an epilogue or sequel???

*** I actually make very modest amounts of worldbuilding. :) I thought I'd be far more prolific about it, to be honest, but somehow it did not work out that way.

Besides, MoL /started/ as a worldbuilding project. I always knew I wanted to release some of the worldbuilding that went into MoL. I mean, half of the work has already been done by the time I started writing. I just need to clean up my notes and add some extra material... except that is turning out to be harder than it sounds. Oh well...

***** I have zero experience with that, so I never seriously entertained the idea. I do know that some fans are tinkering with systems and running games on their own, though. No idea about the details, since I didn't look into it too closely.

****** Man, if I had more time I would definitely do one myself. A lot of the process is the worldbuilding, after all.

** I really love these worldbuilding posts. They add a lot to the immersion in the story.

It's not clear to me why having many small states would be unsustainable. Our own history has examples of both large stable empires (China) and regions with many nations. Historically Europe has nearly always had many small states. Powers trying to grab the entire continent have nearly always been unsuccessful.

It makes sense that all the powers in the region are constantly vying for dominance. But I don't see why it would be inevitable that one of them is going to succeed.

*** It's not inevitable, but it's highly likely.

First of all, the Splinter States still have memories of the Old Alliance and a lot of people feel that it's only right for the continent to be united under someone. That's something Europe didn't really have since the fall of the Roman Empire.

Secondly, a lot of the Splinter States are too small to resist their neighbors in the long term and only came into existence because the Splinter Wars shook up the political landscape so heavily - even if the disunity of the continent continues, it is likely that many regions will eventually consolidate themselves into larger, more viable political entities. Small federations and medium-sized kingdoms and such.

Finally, the powerful nations trying to unite the continent are not trying to literally integrate everything into a China-like super-state. They're trying to crush their rivals, secure their home regions and then make the other states submit as their vassals/tributaries. A lot of the states would still exist, albeit with a high degree of autonomy rather than total independence like they currently have. It's a lot like the Holy Roman Empire, only with an Emperor that is not elective and whose dictates have actual teeth. This is what the Old Alliance was, and they don't see the reason to mess with a known solution.
