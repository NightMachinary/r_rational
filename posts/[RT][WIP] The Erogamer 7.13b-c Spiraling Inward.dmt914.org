** Started this book and dropped it because it felt like it was doing nothing more than giving philosophical debates rather than moving the plot forward. However I really liked the initial concept, does it eventually get better? I made it to a point where some twins were introduced in a hotel.

**** I did not mind the philosophical debates, I actually enjoyed that aspect, but at the time I was reading the balance between real events happening and the debates wasn't what I was in the mood for. I think at the time I was looking for a stronger focus on the game aspects and got frustrated that it took awhile before new events/power ups happened. Not a problem with the book itself, just a disconnect between what I was looking for.

I always, always hate this phrasing.

LikÂ­ing is a [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eDpPnT7wdBwWPGvo5/2-place-and-1-place-words][two-place]] word.

Instead of the always near-offensive "Does it get better?" can't people ask if it gets different from the bits they personally disliked, but which lots of other people loved? You are asking this question to people who loved it, and using a phrasing that assumes it sucks. A classic "Have you stopped beating your wife, yet?"

Even a 'Does it get better in this regard?" would have been vastly preferable.

**** Sorry, didn't mean to offend. Got lazy and didn't write out my question properly. I did not think the book was bad, but you're right I should have asked "does the book move faster from a time line perspective, or is the beginning pace of the book what I can expect for what is written so far"? For me personally the balance of "thing happening" vs "react/think about/monologue feelings or thoughts about thing happening" was not what I wanted out of the story at the time.

***** I'd say the philosophy to action ratio remains constant. But also there's a manga and some genre shifts as the author diversifies in presentation.

******* Chapters 7.6 & 7.10 (the intermediate chapters are interludes with different POVs), tell a story which is half in manga form and could even be read as sort of a standalone story. (The non-manga parts tell the story from Cindy's point of view, the manga-parts have the POV of other characters)

If you want a CBZ version of the manga, you can hopefully download it here:\\
