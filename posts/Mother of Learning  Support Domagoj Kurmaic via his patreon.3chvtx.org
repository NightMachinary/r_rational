** Just saw that he has a patreon, and thought some people here might not know and be willing to support him.

I am not at all related to him nor his work.

I hope it is not against some rule of this sub, if it is, I will remove this post. :)

** Yeah. We pushed him, here in this sub, to make this. I emailed patreon to ask about some details about how their credit cards worked, others noted their happiness to support him.

I think it's a good sign of us. As we know, nothing happens solely because the plot requires it, if you want something to happen like more rational fiction you have to give it a plausible reason.

Likewise I've supported Eaglejarl in his patreon.

And am happy about the competitions and such that are running in here to encourage more writing of rationalist fiction. Archives have been created.

** I'm going to sign up for patreon since it seems like a critical mass of fiction and webcomic writers that I like seem to be using it.

However, I searched patreon last night for "rational fiction" and "rational" without results. I know alexanderwales is also on patreon, but I can't remember if there are other community members I should support. Is there a tag I should be searching for, or is it that hard to find people to give money to?

**** Yup, I'm there.

Now that it's been mentioned, I should probably include a blurb about rational fiction on that page.

** Thank you.

This prompted me to finally create a Patreon account and start supporting half-a-dozen independent creators whose work I appreciate. It feels good to follow through on a long-standing 'wish' I had been putting off.
