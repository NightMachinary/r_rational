**** Author's note at the end says he will have more opportunity for writing. I'm choosing to be optimistic and say that means a few months.

*** The plot diverges with canon after HBP. After years of war, Voldemord is dead, and so are most of Harry's friends. In despair he kills himself with the ritual, and his soul travels back in time and merges with 11-old Harry.

He immediately starts physical exercises, occlumency practises and DA in first year, defeating Quirell alone without any problems. He prevents Ginny from getting the diary, but fails. In book 2 he reveals himself to a friends. He saves Sirius from Azkaban early on. That's all I can recall.

** My bet is on that was a fake wand. What sane, paranoid NoFP!Harry would keep his real wand in an easily accessible pocket and turn his back to an enemy?

I thought they had wrist-strapped wand-holsters that turned themselves invisible, but that might have been a different fic. It's been a while since I've read this one.

*** Oh. Well, that's actually much more interesting to me as well.

Of course, I'd give it like 3 months before expecting an update.

I think I've really been spoiled by the regularity of non-HPMOR uploads here.

** Oh, good. I just re-read that fairly recently and was wondering if the author would ever finish it.

I wish fanfiction.net had an option for authors to upload an outline (or list of spoilers or some statement about where the story is going) that starts out hidden but becomes visible automatically if there are no updates for two or three years. That way, stories would at least have an ending, even if it isn't developed as well as one would like.

*** I believe it was mentioned in an author note that if the fic was actually going to be discontinued, the last chapter posted would be the outline. Runsamok has also promised to release it if something happens suddenly.
