*** Someone started the Sovereign's Gate back up again, luckily in time for the Planar Alignment, the most likely candidate would be Daimen, "Indiana Jones"ish archaeologist that he is. RR has somehow been included in the time loop, but probably doesn't have the proper Brand. (The Brand is the "soul marker", which is essentially Zach's Noveda Bloodline ability, which Zorian gained a slightly flawed copy of from the Lich's Soul/Blood Magic, which should still be good enough, since it works well enough during the loop.)

So RR's soul marker can let him loop, but Zorian thinks it might not let him leave, in which case RR has to switch the loop over to recognizing him as the true inheritor of the Brand, in which case Zorian and Zach will, in a good case, return to reality as if nothing has happened, with no experiences from the loop, or in a bad case, the loop uses their marker in a backlash to mangle their souls. Even the good case would be horrible, since Red Robe has apparently deciding to contribute to Cyoria's destruction, and if a clueless Zach and Zorian were in there, they'd certainly die.

**** What if we're getting it all wrong? What if RR is the original source, and his goal in starting up the Sovereign Gate was to become strong enough to guarantee that his attempt to release He Of The Flowing Flesh was successful?

I don't know /why/ he wants to release a Primordial, but for the purposes of this argument I'm going to assume that he's just nuts. My evidence is as follows: 1) After the first attempt, the church and the government would lock the Hole down to prevent any further attempts. Making the first attempt work is a must. 2) Limited number of shifter kids. Sure, there's plenty in the world total, but very few who are close enough to Cyoria that news of their kidnapping wouldn't reach defenders of the Primordial prison before they could get there. Proximity is important. 3) Soul Killing is impossible, but someone claims to be able to do it. That either means that the claim "Soul Killing is impossible" or "RR can do it" is false. What if the Sovereign Gate gives its user the ability to kick out people not useful to their goals? It does seem tailor-made to be the best possible training device, and kicking overwhelmingly powerful enemies which could slow your training out of your simulated training ground seems like a useful feature. RR didn't use it on Zorian or Zach because the technique he uses to do it doesn't work on people with the soul brand to prevent magic - reflecting effects from kicking out the user of the Gate.

That all seems coherent to me.

***** Interesting analysis of the soulkill technique... But it's worth remembering that Red Robe almost certainly /does not/ have the soul marker. Remember that Zorian was never able to find him using the locator spell. He somehow found a different hack that lets him act like he's looping. It's also not clear if he started before or after Zach. I suspect that he started at the same time, so he could somehow project his soul into the "In-Between" before the simulation began.

It's strongly implied that soulkilling is derived from RR's necromancy + time loop knowledge. Batak mentioned that souls can be used to produce accurate simulations -- that's likely how the time loop works. RR probably knows enough about soul magic to prevent this from happening. It's curious that he hasn't used it against Zach or Zorian, though.

Of course, there's still a lot of missing information: What happened to Zach's memories? Why is RR doing this at all? Why does RR soulkill the aranea but not even try Zach or Zorian? What the hell is the time loop for? Stupid Ghost Serpent is /not/ helpful.

Edit: We also know the that the time loop resets when Zach dies, which suggests that he's the primary source.

****** Zorian's marker is a corrupted version of Zach's. He didn't get the whole thing, just enough to make it functional. This would make it difficult for RR to track Zorian's marker, as he doesn't know what it looks like.

On the other hand, Zorian's marker comes directly from Zach's. It makes sense that he is able to track the progenitor of his marker with a marker-tracking ritual. RR has a different marker that Zorian doesn't know the composition of, so he can't track it.

With this set up, both Zorian and RR are able to track Zach, but neither can track the other, which is exactly what we observe.

*** Let's say you've invoked some strange dark ritual to give yourself a duplicate pocket universe to train yourself in. Maybe you get lonely or bored. Doesn't matter, because you're in the universe until the battery runs out. To train as hard as possible you need a powerful enemy. So you use your advanced knowledge of souls magic to mark another, so they will train along with you. But you wipe their memory of you, and set them on a path. In this case, make him play the hero and fight the invasion. That way, you can train against him by supporting the invasion.

The whole summoning is a distraction. Hell, it's possible Red Robe invoked this terrible magic to help train to defend against the summoned Terror. That's what I would do.

Honestly Red Robe might be a good guy who was confused when someone started trying to kill him and then saw those spiders definitely lied about being marked. I'll have to go back to the chapter where we meet him. Could this all be a misunderstanding, hyper-brutalism because he was training and the target would be fine?

If RR looped Zach, he is interacting with him awfully rare. I don't think Zach's intended role was a practice dummy or a companion. Unless the loop has been active for 11 lifetimes, of which Zach remembers only ~20 last years due to some mind wipe. But then RR is hundreds years old, and is basically godlike and is toying with everyone.

Another thing to consider, is that if Serpent is right, the In-Between happens on the first day of the month (when everyone goes to school), so in the real world the primordial has not been summoned. Yet. When the loop ends the Branded One(s) will live this month one more time.

It should be fine. Everything is in Unicode nowadays. It would only be slightly harder, enumerating through next page links (table of contents might be a bit harder).

After that's done, we've got each chapter as a file in LaTeX format in a subridectory. Now I include all of them into main source file, which describes the title, author and attribution, as well as page size, fonts and so on. Then I generate final PDF using =pdflatex=.

After another round of =sed= which makes e-book specific changes, I convert back into HTML using =latexml=, and then into EPUB with Calibre's command-line =ebook-convert=, which then gets converted into MOBI using Amazon's official [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211][=kindlegen=]].

** /Since many people are writing about it, I decided to answer in the first level./

I don't think there is an actual problem with having two Branded Ones. Nothing we know about the time loop suggests that having multiple time travellers is different from having only one. Perhaps having only one in all previous occurences is a matter only of:

- Convenience. If there is only one Branded One, everything he learns stays true, while if there is more than one it may not be that due to other ones influence.

- Tradition. If the loop creator's intent was to teach/enhance one person per cycle, there is little reason for that to change.

- Mechanics. If the initiation mechanism (Gate + Key) works only on one person, and sharing the Brand requires a /correctly botched specific soul magic spell/, it's no wonder that there always was only one time traveller despite the potential to loop more than one person.

- Any combination of those and anything I missed)

** Interesting.

Good news: If everything's a copy, then the normal flow of time won't be influenced even by seeming-permadeath.

Bad news: Can someone leave who hasn't entered? Do the memories and soul abilities get passed to the outside the same way they're passed to the beginning, or are Zorian and Zach going to have to mindwipe and smuggle copies of themselves into the true Branded One's mind in order to get out of there? (And there's the underlying question of what happened to Zach in the first place--a deliberate attempt to set him up as a worthy rival, a foil for testing which could never return to the normal timeline on its own?)

...unless two different groups tried to control who entered before the whole thing started, then if only one enters multiplicity after that has to be pretty much deliberate--though there's Zorian's case too, so incompetency can't be completely ruled out.

** I believe that the gate the Ghost Serpent mentions is the Sovereign Gate. And this gate sounds suspiciously like it might be the source of the timeloop, one only active every 400 years.

From chapter 33: "The Sovereign Gate is an artifact supposedly dating back from his time," Alanic said. "Like many great rulers, Shutur-Tarana has a great many fanciful stories and grandiose claims associated with him, and this particular one claims he either made or found a doorway into another world. Having found he did not age at all while on the other side, he spent '11 lifetimes' there, learning their secrets and honing his skills. Eventually, he grew homesick and decided to go back home. Once he was back in his own world, however, he found the doors forever barred to him. He stored the Sovereign Gate in his royal vault, there to wait for a worthy successor who would repeat his feat and usher the empire in a new age with the wisdom gained from the other side. Or, well, resurrect it... since it is thoroughly dead at this point."

  According to Ikosians, the world was originally a swirling, shapeless chaos, inhabited only by the 7 primordial dragons. One day, the gods descended from the higher planes of existence and killed all of them save one. This last one they refashioned into the material world that humans now inhabit, turning her body into dirt and stone, her blood into water, her breath into air and her fire into magic. The vast networks of tunnels stretching beneath the surface of the world are dragon veins, now empty of blood that had been turned into the seas but still flooded with magic emanating from the Heart of the World -- the fiery, still-beating heart of the primordial dragon that rests somewhere deep underground.

I assume since the soul-mark of the Branded getting copied onto multiple simulated souls is abnormal, all of the current time-traveleres except one will have to cease existing by the time this loop runs out of juice. So RR could be spending their time on researching how to come out as the surviving simulation --- and doesn't waste time attacking them for the same reason: it's near pointless in comparison to just hijacknig the only ticket out and letting them “die away” on their own.

Unless you're suggesting that once out of the simulation Zorian's soul will just appear in his 'real' body (which may or may not already contain a soul depending on the exact mechanics of the loop), there will probably be some issue with the gate outputting two souls in a setup configured for one.

Once again, I will point out that someone has a lot of knowledge that should have been forgotten. Based on the preparations for the invasion and the fact that the loop started in the first place, this has happened before the time loop and thus rules out the possibility that RR found the information while inside the time loop. The three possibilities are Zach (who is lying or had his mind wiped, possibily geass), RR who may well be the original branded one, and finally a third party that is backing one of the other candidates.

Zach is missing incredibly important information, or is choosing to not tell Zorian. Until Zorian manages to get in Zach's head we have no way of knowing.

** EDIT:Update to theory in comment below, explains the invasion, why he doesn't control Zach.

What time did the mercenary company drop dead? The loop could have been going on for hours by the time Zach and Zorian wake up, so it's a little suspicious RR attacked Zach right after he woke up. I'd expect him to be awake earlier, so have hours to fuck with Zachs unprotected mind, or later so Zach would be dressed by then.

I think he is using the mem packet method in Zach, because besides his Necromancy he seems like a mediocre mage. He didn't help the lich take down Zach, he needs a spell rod to cast magic missile, and was pretty pathetic at chasing down Zorian. Doesn't seem like someone who has been improving their shaping for the 200+ resets he has been aiding the invasion. He could have been someone Zach blabbed to in an early loop, and dominated him into delivering his memories each reset. Zorian wasn't present for the invasion while Zach was in a coma, so there is no knowing if RR was active.

The huge flaw in this theory is if he controls the only other time traveller, why bother setting Zach to fight the invasion? I still think his soul/shaping isn't improving with the loops.

*** RR is Zach's guardian. While pillaging House Noveda he learned how to trigger the Sovereign Bloodline. He activated the loop, then immediately takes the memory packet from Zach while he is asleep. Having the instruction manual lets him kick people out.

The purpose of the invasion is both to divert Zach and regularly coax him to a known location where he can enlist Quatach-Ichl to subdue him and update the packet. In resets Zach doesn't fight the invasion RR remembers nothing. Even if Zach bugs out for years though he maintains the memory packet at the start so he doesn't need to worry about the packet decaying.

So he only has access to his own/Zach's memories and a slight ability to plant compulsions, explaining why he hasn't been seen much now Zach is avoiding Cyoria. He only remembers the planning he does while Zach is asleep, so needs to be super cautious. In the next loops however he will have access to whatever Zorian tells him about the markers, so will be making a play to steal Zorians/Zachs.

I'm still not sure about what RR actually cares about. Outside of him wanting to keep Zorian and Zach in check, his motivations and goals are open questions.

I added to it in 52, since I think connecting the Primordial's prison pocket dimension to theirs can destabilize the loop as well, causing another restart. In fact, a successful Primordial Summoning probably causes a massive drain on the loop's maintaining energy. They should probably try to stop that from happening anymore, unless they really want to end the loop early, which might screw over Red Robe's plans, but would also screw over Zorian, and possibly even Zach, depending on the progression of RR's plans.

**** How do you think souls fit into this?

I mean, obviously, everything in the simulation has souls as usual: soul spells work. But then it was said recently that souls act as an otherwordly information storage, and also can not be destroyed.

So how does everyone who is not a looper get their soul reverted to the beginning-of-the-month state? Does the simulation just create extra bunch of souls just like it creates a whole new physical dimension? Most importantly, if yes to the previous question, then what happens to those new souls when the loop is reset and the dimension is collapsed? Do they go into the afterlife? Are they destroyed? (so it would be possible to kill a soul after all?)

Can it be that the spirit is simply wrong or lying about this one?

"Fade away into the void" is the way the spirit phrased it, so it's not exactly the same soul destruction that's said to be impossible. This alternate dimension could also be considered to be outside the purview of the gods.

****** The spirit implied that he was beaten by the Branded in the past, causing it to fall. Also, egg-smashing was involved. I guess that's one possible reason to be pissed off. On the other hand he seemed rather calm at the prospect of dying in a month.

The gods' inaction is what really bothers me here. From a perspective of any good or neutral aligned deity this repeated simulation would be considered the worst atrocity possible. It's s spiritual genocide (so, worse than physical one) that is repeated over and over and over. I can't imagine all gods turning a blind eye to it unanimously. And the gods should've been active during the 1st time loops.

As for RR his attacks don't need to affect anything in the real world. It could be just a way to add instructions to the constructor "do not replicate this and this". Simple and efficient. The only problem here is that it implies RR as the loop operator. So what purpose does Zach have in that case?

******* I don't think RR's attacks affect the real world, just this false world. When I mentioned "deleting from the master copy", I meant the original snapshot of the world that is used to create the loop each time. Incidentally, this gives RR a way into the loop without any sort of soul marker, if he just modifies/updates the state of his soul in the master copy each time. It also means that mind/soul magic wouldn't have any effect on him that would persist through the loops, Zach and Zorian would have to figure out to modify the Master Copy themselves in order to stop RR inside the loop.

And RR can have abilities/knowledge about the loop beyond Zach without being the inheritor of the Brand that Zach is. The main downside to that is that the more knowledge RR has about the Sovereign's Gate, the less options we have besides Daimen for RR.

An heretofore unknown character gaining knowledge from Zach while inside of the loop, and cementing a position for themselves in the loop and then messing with Zach's memories to erase themselves from Zach's mind is still a possibility, but it has become increasingly difficult for someone like Veyers Boranova to be RR.

I get the impression that gods in this series are pretty hands-off, and it's possible that they decided to overlook/ignore the once every 400 years event because they found the results interesting. After all, it means that every 400 years you'd get to see some sort of super archmage arise. It's not called the Sovereign's Gate for nothing, those mages probably became kings and emperors most of the time.

I think the Ghost Serpent seemed every bit as annoyed being a false transient entity in the time loop as it did about being brought down by a Branded One in the past.

If your interpretation is the correct one, though, it's interesting that area would have been targeted in two independent time loops. You would think that as this is the first time multiple Branded have coocccured, in past reset periods there would have been much less demand for the skills and knowledge that aranea can provide.

***** A discrepancy that's been bothering me, perhaps related to this, is that the stars are apparently continuing to move, inconsistent with the rest of the simulation resetting. It would be easy to just set the values for star movement back to the same place each time.

My current theory is that a "perfect" reset is neither possible nor desirable. In order for information to leave the simulation during the final month, it needs to be stored somewhere in the interim. Stars and souls are the two best candidates we have for that right now.

Someone mentioned above that planar and planetary are treated as synonymous in this story, so perhaps it is both. I'm trying to use physics concepts as springboards for understanding the possible connections between these two things--light has no mass, like souls, light travels at the speed limit c, which seems relevant to the "time" part of the phrase "time loop"--but no great insights have appeared here so far.

Does anyone remember anything else in the book so far that suggests a possible connection between stars and souls?

  Above the Hole, and presumably on the inside of it, space shuddered and writhed, distorting everything like hot summer air. Slowly, jagged black threads started rising into the air from the depths, zig-zagging through the air and occasionally forking offshoots.

  They were cracks, Zorian realized. Reality was breaking.

  Suddenly, a huge volume of space in the center of the cracks simply... caved in, creating a pitch black hole that hung in the air. Something huge and dark brown, like a hand studded with mouths and eyes, shot out of the rip in space, but Zorian didn't have time to study it much. Without any prompting from him, the marker on his soul suddenly activated and everything went black.

Point in your favor: The marker on his soul is the thing that activates after he sees the Primordial's hand.

Points in my favor: Reality was breaking apart, and reality reset when a giant hand punched a hole in the sky. Also, it's "primordial", not "primoridal", hence my victory (in spelling).

I've got a couple minor mana questions:

1. Does Zach's "232 magic missiles" comment include the efficiency gains, like Zorian's current 35, or is it as Zorian assumes, and 232 is his magnitude of magic reserves.

2. What's Zorian's current rate of mana regeneration like? I know it varies based on location (mana well existence and rank), does the rate of assimilating ambient mana also vary on based current/maximum reserves he has? For example if he's completely expended his mana and is at 0/20 or has only used a portion and is at 15/20.

2. It takes anywhere between 30 minutes and 3 hours for a mage to regenerate their mana reserves from total zero to full if ambient mana levels are sufficiently plentiful, depending on their personal skill and willingness to risk mana poisoning. This is unaffected by the size of one's mana reserves - those will higher reserves will simply regenerate more mana per minute.

Let's say he's reached 20, plus efficiency gains. So that means efficiency gives him close to double. Which suggests that Zach has reached somewhere around 150ish, plus efficiency. Putting his natural reserves a little under 40. Give or take. Somewhat less than the 60 that Zorian assumed. Still abnormally high.

Of course, the 20 figure is a guess. If we assumed that Zorian's reserves were actually, say, 16, then Zach's might be around 100, suggesting natural reserves of 25. Much closer to normal human range.

At one stage I was going to create a Reddit bot study group which once a week gave a problem or desired bot, and everyone shared how they would write it and gave feedback. Nothing ever came of the idea though.

If you're okay with it, please send me a PM.

Oh and thanks for reminding me there was a new MoL chapter. I didn't realise until I got your page.
