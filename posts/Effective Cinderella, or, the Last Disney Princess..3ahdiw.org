The fairy godmother glowed and sparkled like the sun seen through three dozen layers of faceted glass, lighting up the grass beneath her feet and the nearby tree like a church floor lit by a stained glass window.

Not even those bright flowing colors could illuminate the dull grey rags worn by the scrubbing-girl, or the streaks of ash covering her skin, but the scrubbing-girl's eyes shone in the fairy colors like golden dawn. Hope was in them, for the first time in years.

/One wish - one wish and one wish only -/

The fairy godmother was smiling brightly. "Just say the word, and I'll make you a carriage, and horses, and a coachman, and the most beautiful dress you ever saw! It'll only last until midnight," the fairy godmother winked at her, "but you can do a lot in one night, if you hurry!"

Would ANYONE really use their one wish just for that - for a dance at the ball, and a dress that only lasted until midnight -

The scrubbing-girl shut her eyes and thought. Even if the magical part of the wish couldn't last past midnight, she might wish to be transported to the place where her truest love could be found, or wish for all the justicers and every person of her city to know her father's true testament and how her stepmother had cheated it. The magical knowledge might vanish come midnight, but they'd remember /having known it/. She could wish doves to descend from heaven, fall upon her stepmother and stepsisters and pluck out their eyeballs, even if the doves were magic the wounds would stay.

The scrubbing-girl shook her head, quietly to herself. She was a good enough person not to do that, if not so good a person as to not even think it. And she wouldn't waste her one wish, they didn't /deserve/ enough power over her to have her lose her one chance.

Her father had taught her to read, before he died, and she'd read from her father's collected books, when her stepmother wasn't looking. Even the esoteric books, the dangerous ones, the tomes the Church might have burned. A fairy's power was strange and vast, but limited; a fairy wish couldn't make literally everything better, not even for a single night. There were kingdoms beyond the kingdom, and worlds beyond the world, and a fairy's wish couldn't change so much, not even temporarily. But so long as it didn't change too much at once, and didn't last too long, she could have very nearly /anything/ - briefly.

Going to the ball might not be as stupid a wish as it sounded. Fairy wishes were like that. Maybe the Prince would fall in love with her there, and stay in love even after her bright dress vanished and was replaced with rags, and then she would be a queen, together with her true love. The godmother's suggested wish might not /just/ give her a night at the ball, it could be her very own happily ever after, and then she would rule the kingdom relatively wisely and well, and many people would benefit thereby. That could be her destined story, she was probably already /part/ of that story, the fairy-tale was happening all around her. The handsome prince's ball, and the scrubbing-girl left behind.

So the question just was... was she content with that story, the one already being enacted around her, the fairy-spun tale that had given her this one fairy wish?

There was parchment in her father's study, and ink, and her father had taught her writing.

You could do a lot in just one night, if you hurried.

Cinderella opened her eyes, and within them was the fire of a thousand scrubbed-out hearths.

"I want," Cinderella said, "to change my story, to leave this life and start down another path. Fairy godmother, fairy godmother, until midnight of this night I wish to know the road I must take to find the keystone of all things, and the secret for making changes."

****** My point is, a rational story still has a thematic nature. Fairy magic will not build you a 1589 version of a supercomputer running an FAI, because that violates the theme of a fairy godmother. Evil genies have their own theme, sure, but fairy stories have specific depths as well.

You might wish "wrong" and a good fairy will still help you, but you also can't trick them into making you queen in one step. Often you won't understand the possibly ironic results and think yourself tricked at first. Even in the original, the wishes wasn't meant to be more than minor assistance for achieving something normal but beyond her reach. A bootstrapping of a wunderkind's natural growth.

Mine was a critique of both OP's story and the evil-genie humorous response that you commented on. I could have posted one level deeper, but thought yours a good point as well, and my comment a complement to it. Hope that makes sense.

** I don't quite understand what "the keystone" is supposed to be from the content of the story, so I'm worried that the Fairy Godmother would be similarly puzzled and may take it literally, i.e. "follow this yellow brick road to the Library and you can learn to be a scribe!"

I get that it is similar to the Aladdin and Princess Jasmine omake -- and perhaps it builds on top of Jasmine's last wish!

(Side note: the Jasmine and the Lamp Omake ends with "I wish for everyone's intelligence to gradually increase at a rate of 1 IQ point per year." The intent of this wish is evident to me, in terms of creating a gradual and inevitable intelligence increase for the immortal and vigorous "everyone," but IQ is based on a norm with median of 100 and a SD of +/-15... so the educator in me wants it clarified that the term IQ is meant to refer to criterion-based tests at the time of the wish rather than using the norm-referenced definition, since Jasmine is wishing for the goal posts to shift each year.)

This is a contrast to presidential and semi-oligarchical "democratic" systems, in which the misguided impulses of the population are blocked from implementation because /the vast majority/ of the population's desires are blocked from implementation, quickly degrading into /outright/ oligarchy.

In multi-party, proportional-representation parliamentary systems, elections can be high-entropy random variables, and their outcomes /actually explain substantial portions of the variance in which laws get passed/. Mixed-member systems then give many of the stability benefits of more regional systems without the drawbacks of oligarchical ones.

***** In principle, yes. In practice the one elected are the ones with enough money for advertisement, making it effectively a covert oligarchy. Though thinking about it, it would probably be more applicable in a state with way less population, like in the age the story is set in. But at the same time population would be largely more ignorant and susceptible to demagogy.

Let's face it, the best form of government possible, in principle, is enlightened absolutism, provided you can find an enlightened dictator and admittedly only working for his/her generation.

In practice, well I really don't know, but my favourite fantasy concerns a form of randomly chosen (among the whole population, with the criterion for eligibility being a decent score in a test to determine wisdom) constitutional monarch with a mandate of only a few years. And then another one. I call it Random Monarchy, and it's pretty much unfeasible.

"In principle" is nothing before "in practice", and /in practice/, mixed-member proportional parliaments and various other degrees of representative democracy are the system used in the most peaceful, prosperous, enlightened countries the world has ever known -- /despite/ the attempt by capitalism to wipe out democracy as an interference with monetizing literally everything.

Surely. But standing by my previous assertions, that's much like saying oligarchy is a very successful form of government. Which I agree upon, the ancient Greeks pulled it off incredibly well after all.

Probably better that anything else we have now, but hardly optimal. Even less optimal when you have a fairy with reality bending powers at your disposal.

By the way, an enlightened monarch is *ENLIGHTENED*, that's kind of a crucial point (and also the reason why he/she wouldn't destroy your house as an example of what happens when you don't pay your share for the Voluntary Defence Found).

** Her "solution" depends entirely on a loose interpretation of exactly what "goes away at midnight" means. Come midnight, and she could equally well find that any objects she has obtained during the wish period that she couldn't have obtained without it have vanished, she no longer even remembers how to find them, her attempts to write the knowledge down have turned into pumpkins, and she has nothing.

Also, she seems curiously reluctant to use the word "and" in her wish, which is odd since the fairy godmother already said she could grant a wish for a carriage and a dress.

(And fairy tales like this have this habit of granting good wishes for people who make humble requests and bad ones for the "greedy", which may mean that any attempt to logically decide which wish is best for her will get her in trouble just because she is using logic at all.)

*** This Cinderella's wish is morally quite sound, however, and not particularly greedy, and reasonably humble. She seeks the path to enlightenment. She seeks to make the world a better place. And furthermore she chose this wish INSTEAD of less moral choices. She's not just trying to raise her own standing in life -- if THAT'S all she wanted, she could have gone to the ball. Furthermore, the wish implies an acknowledgement that she ISN'T so clever as to be able to figure these things out on her own, but rather she wants to know what the best path for her life would be.

And this is a fairy, not a genie, so the wish will be fulfilled benevolently as it was a benevolent wish.

**** "Greedy" is in scare quotes, and "humble" probably should have been as well. The problem is that reacting to a wish by saying "I want to rationally determine how to gain more benefit from this wish than I would if I just asked for the first thing that came to my mind" is, /all by itself/, grounds for having the wish granter decide that you're being "greedy" and giving her cause to twist the wish. The fact that the fairy godmother is benevolent won't change this; benevolent fairies still punish the greedy.

What you're supposed to do when faced with a fairy godmother wish is to wish for what comes naturally, and not think it through rationally. If you are a good person, doing this will naturally lead to you blurting out a good wish, and if you're a bad person, doing this will lead to you blurting out a wish that lets the fairy see how greedy you are.

It would, itself, be a forced action, something you would only do if you believed that it would result in a better outcome. And if choosing your wish based on reasoning about improving the outcome is a reason for the fairy godmother to brand you as greedy, then someone who is contemplative by nature is caught in a no-win situation.

This, then, means that the fairy godmother considers impulsiveness to be a moral value and rationality to be a moral wrong.
