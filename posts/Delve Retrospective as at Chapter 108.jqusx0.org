I wrote this as a stream of consciousness for a Discord channel, but it quickly became too long, so I decided to post it on Reddit (and this is the most appropriate subreddit that I'm a member of). I haven't rewritten the stream of consciousness.

I'll soon catch up to the series.

I'm probably not going to join Patreon when I catch up. If I do decide to read it on a weekly basis, a monthly payment of $x to stay 8 chapters ahead feels quite excessive. Furthermore, I rarely follow serials on a week to week basis for extensive periods of time. It's very easy for me to set up a subscription and keep it maintained for months while I'm not using the service. As a value proposition, Patreon given my reading habits seems like a bad idea.

All of the above said, I'm just not as invested in the series, I don't think I'll enjoy it all that much.

The character I am/was most invested in was Lady V (for a long stretch of time after their first interaction with her, I was much more excited about the prospect of her reappearance than anything else that happened in the story).

The Watch's Ambush for her and her subsequent depression was kinda sad. Rain had been making tangible progress building a rapport with her, and she had set him up as her second in command. Rain's animosity towards Velika for the massacre while reasonable feels unfair. Velika acted only and entirely in self defense. Furthermore, she had explicitly gone out of her way to dissuade them from just such an attempt. After Westbridge's castigation, she went out of her way to subdue the Watch's combatants without killing them (in part to give them the impression that she was so far above them that resistance was futile). She reiterated this again with her challenge at the arena. Again, the message was the same (even if you all came at once, you couldn't beat me, so don't try). This was a bluff, but it was a successful one.

As a ruler, she wasn't a tyrant. The Watch themselves admitted she hadn't killed anyone. Lord Rill was in charge and had been tolerable. There was no just cause for their rebellion. As far as I can tell, the Watch only retaliated because of hurt pride.

​

Given the circumstances, her retaliation to their preemptive strike was justified. She killed all of them, but it was entirely in self defence. That she didn't go out of her way to retaliate against the Watch officers that hadn't been involved in the massacre showed admirable restraint which was progress for her. Earning Rain's animosity for justified self defence (to the extent that when she left his most salient thoughts was regret that he could do nothing about the "murder" of his friend) feels exceedingly bitter. It wasn't murder.

I really dislike the author's decision to have the Watch act so rashly on injured pride. They risked not only all their sentinels (and other participants), but all members stationed at Fel Sadanis. Velika could have retaliated to their rebellion by wiping out all their members. No one in the city would have been able to stop her, and they had no guarantee that she wouldn't. They had no guarantee of success either. They relied solely on their surprise attack. They had no recourse should it fail. If she didn't die with the first volley, everyone stationed there would be dead.

The massive potential downside to their plan was foreseeable, and the upside was limited. Again, Velika was not actively ruling, and the Rill lead administration was tolerable. Her rule hadn't yet caused the deaths of any citizen. The payoff matrix here was horribly lopsided.

The Watch acted with spectacular incompetence here, and I think it's arguably a case of idiot ball. The Watch rebelled so that the story would progress a certain way. I wish they hadn't because I liked the direction the story would have progressed then. I'm much more annoyed that the author snapped that future away than that he dumbed down the Watch for the plot.

​

But I think all of this is ignoring a much more glaring issue. I became exceptionally invested in what was ultimately a story arc character, and cared much more about the character than everything else that happened in the story. The protagonist's challenges and his growth (while nice) did not speak to me in the same way. I think this is a fail of story engagement. If I cared so much about Velika that my most salient association with the Fel Sadanis arc was annoyance at the Watch's rebellion and what it meant for her character, then it sounds like I'm reading the wrong story. Fel Sadanis was an amazing arc for Rain's character, but I cared so much less about all the growth Rain underwent during the arc. I'm aware that how I experienced the story is very different from the modal experience of most readers of the story.

I can handle stories where I don't like the main character. My favourite webcomic/manga is a story where the main character doesn't rank among my top ten (my favourite character does share some traits with Lady V). In said stories though, I usually have several other characters that I find very compelling. I think Delve is different in that I was overly attached to one character and the developments involving them left a very bitter taste in my mouth.

I mean, current Rain is a character that on priors I would expect to enjoy very much. Hacking the interface, gaining progressively finer grained control and understanding of the system, obsessive mathematical optimisation of his build, developing scripts to interact with the system and the interface, etc. are all things that I expect would speak to me.

I think Rain has sort of delivered on the promised competence porn, but rather than greatly enjoying all of these developments, I'm still left with the bitter taste. It's disconcerting.

​

The sense that I'm reading the wrong story (experiencing it markedly differently from how most would) makes me doubt the wisdom of continuing. I'm almost caught up, so I just might sunk costs it, but I'm really not sure I should. I'm worried that if I do progress I would still have the lingering bitter aftertaste over the world that wasn't. I do expect to eventually get over Fel Sadanis, and the concept of a rogue Citizen is interesting (but I expect that she would be removed from the story/it's sort of her epilogue).

​

Avoiding other spoilers, does Velika remain a relevant character post 108?


** I feel like this is missing the point that Lady V was essentially a tyrant who had seized the city and was holding them all hostage. The watch had one single chance to kill her and from their perspective, retake the city and overthrow a dictator. Sure they acted rashly, but all this talk about how Velika hadn't killed anyone misses the point that they were entirely justified in attempting to assassinate her. Their reasons for trying to kill her were arguably more valid than her self-defense, are we arguing that occupying dictators are the ones in the right when defending themselves against resistance movements?

What happened was a tragedy, but Velika was decidedly the antagonist of it. The entire thing could have been avoided if she came clean, but she couldn't because she was a dictator ruling by the equivalent of military might and she couldn't show weakness.

We as the audience know that it wouldn't have solved the main problem, but we also know that if it weren't for Rain then this entire plot by the Citizens was so stupid and reliant on a single point of failure that the entire city would have died.

The city *did* die, for all practical purposes.

Had Velika and Westbridge not invaded and put up the barrier, the Watch and the Guild could have handled the rank shift so much better. For starters, more of them would have been alive to help, and they wouldn't have been constantly drained of mana trying to charge the barrier.

Let's not sideline that point, theirs was the inciting action that caused the death of practically the entire population. Now, it would well be argued that because of the /other/ invasion force (that subsequently slipped away unscathed), they were equally screwed. But the Watch, Guild and Halgrave (sp?) could have put up a good fight for that at least.

I'd agree there. That army beat a whole strike team of citizens, Halgrave had no chance.

That said, I think from the POV of the average civilian they'd be better off under the empire. That army wouldn't kill them and might even protect them from the rank shift. Velika ignored them to sulk while the city died.

** I disagree about Velika. Firstly she was the instigator of the conflict, she invaded the city through military might and held everyone hostage. Given that the locals have a de-facto right to rebel for freedom - especially since this is a pre-modern world. Peaceful protests and referendums are not a practical option in this world.

Secondly Velika was becoming increasingly erratic and unstable in her behaviour, and this is someone who could physically kill the entire city one by one without much trouble. In addition to her decreasing stability she was on the verge of tipping into a death spiral where she terrifies people to rule through fear, then people make mistakes because they're terrified, so she kills more people to set an example, repeat until rock bottom. Remember that she was shown struggling to tell the difference between mistakes and treachery.

Given this the watch had two options: Do nothing and pray she climbs out of her funk. Take your one chance to kill her while you can. We as readers know the solution is the first one, because Rain quite quickly found a way to control the barrier and that will make Velika calm down. The watch did not. They had two high risk choices and chose.

Was there a reason to expect that killing her would help them escape? I don't think they believed that. They never attempted to get the information on how to escape from her. I am sceptical that escaping the barrier was a salient motivation.

**** There were a lot of unknown facts, and the Watch was acting on guesswork for most of their actions, but there were several things they believed to be true.

1. The barrier was under Velika's control, so if she died either the barrier would drop automatically due to the user of a System skill dying, or they could retrieve some remote for controlling it from her corpse. Obviously they were wrong about this, but it's hard to guess something like that Westbridge trapped her in Fel Sadanis with everyone else. Or even that the barrier was a Magistraal artifact which had been hidden in the city for centuries without detection.
2. If they didn't attack her as she was leaving the dungeon, they will never get any other chance to beat her. This part is true, because Velika would have sent any member of her new guards to lead any future dungeon parties. Also dungeons take a while to recover, which could have cost time the city didn't have.
3. If they didn't commit fully to attacking her, they would lose. As we saw, a near-Gold like Velika was unbeatable in a fight against multiple Silvers and hordes of Bronzes. Levels have an exponential effect on an individual's strength. So if they hadn't thrown everything they had at her, it was a guaranteed loss.
4. They would have succeeded in killing her if they committed fully to attacking her. This part was completely correct as can be seen by how Velika's leg was completely wrecked and took significant time to mend afterwards. The Watch actually attacked slightly too soon and gave Velika the ability to escape from most of the attacks by ducking back into the dungeon. If they had waited possibly a second later for her to take a few more steps away from the dungeon, then they might have won in killing her.
5. If they gave up and did nothing, the Watch would die under Velika and/or the DKE. This part is very accurate. Velika is an unpredictable individual who can and has killed people with no reason (eg. Melka). You can argue that she isn't that unstable, but from the Watch's perspective, she can't be trusted to be consistent and reliable. Furthermore, while the DKE says that they have the city's best interests in mind, they are still an invading army. Invading armies have no reason to leave the current law enforcement in place or to even release them. The Watch could expect to be executed by the DKE (the DKE could likely just claim they were "resisting" or something like that).

** An organisation that solves serious situations with martial might (or the threat of it) tries to use martial might to solve a situation. I don't think that counts as an idiot ball. People not properly adapting to facing a new threat and using outdated strategies/thinking is pretty standard, look at the responses to climate change for example.

Throw in the stress of the situation and the fear of the Watch "losing" here negatively affecting the Watch as a whole organisation as they are perceived as weaker by their enemies and there's sufficient justification for the sequence of events, even if it ain't the best path for them to take.

I could just be bias because I like the story and all though, so grains of salt and all.

Anyway I've been reading ahead, super short answer is that Rain leaves Fel Seldanis and Velika doesn't follow him.

I'm hoping there was a reason behind it that we don't know, something that the upper brass, the warden and goldplates, are privy to.

It's happened a couple of times in the past that I've been disappointed by how stupid some decisions characters make are, then later find out they had their reasons (like The Mad King's plan in Blood Song and the explanation given in the opening chapters of the sequel) so thats what I'm hoping for here.

** Rain is a weak character, the kind that is approaching for an employee in, say, the bay area, but not in the litrpg world. He is not the kind of person who has a big edge in the LitRPG power ladder. His lackadaisical ambition also hurts the story (when Rain himself hardly cares about advancing, why should we?). He is trash at game theory. He not only repeatedly admits that he is a cooperate-only bot, the one time he bluffs to not cooperate (the scene with the thieves), he immediately gets all guilty and lets the thieves just go. Frankly, this level of naivety/virtue-signaling is bad even in the most civilized subcultures on Earth, but in the novel universe? Rain should have seen a lot more bad consequences.

Rain's approach to morality is also not effective. I'm now in the middle of the Empire invasion arc, and he is continuously wasting his mental focus on trivial quibbles such as paying for food that people gifted him. There is a line that really hits it home for me:

#+begin_quote
  He looked around guiltily, conscious of the fact that breaking and entering was pretty much exactly what he'd just finished saying not to do. This is different. I'm not stealing anything, and I will pay for the damage, I swear.

  Satisfied that there were no witnesses to his unprovoked attack on the innocent door, he made his way inside.
#+end_quote

“Satisfied that there were no witnesses.” Even the canon is saying his primary moral concern is signaling.

I wonder why he didn't whine when they were stealing from the mine.

His ideals are also childish AF. “Awakening everybody” (like the ruling institutions already don't want this), “making healing free” (Presumably by slaving the medical staff, as evidenced by his reaction when Wallace refused to heal Val), ... .
