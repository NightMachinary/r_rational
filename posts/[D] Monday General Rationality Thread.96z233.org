Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I just started listening to a new podcast called "[[http://seancarroll.libsyn.com/rss][Sean Carroll's mindscape]]" it's nice to listen to and this guy talks a lot about Bayesian rationality.
