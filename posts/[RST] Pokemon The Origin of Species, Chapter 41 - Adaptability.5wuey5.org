*** I thought it was a great chapter! I'm definitely curious about how Red's psychic powers will develop, and what the endgame for that looks like, since that is something the games did not spend much time elaborating upon. I also find it very satisfying to see Blue grow as a trainer while also seeing the difficulty of his gym battles rise in roughly equal proportion. It's a great way of gradually building the world (at least as it pertains to combat and gym bureaucracy) while also emulating the difficulty curves of the games.

** Great chapter; I want to say, I really really love how you're handling Red's grief. Bravo to Red being a big enough man to go back to his therapist- a /great/ therapist, too.

The last section with Red thinking about how he's handling the Abra as a way to 'answer' the grief genuinely touched me, I'm still tearing up thinking about it. Wonderfully done. As someone who's lost a parent (and is very far away from the other) that way of projecting them into the situation and gauging their response (as a means of dealing with the overall depression) is something I do a lot, and do find it to be a positive experience- I've never seen or heard it somewhere else.

** So we finally see an evolution happening. The growth to a new size was gradual, but the change in appearance was sudden and came with a flash of light, interesting compromise. At least this way it doesn't violate conservation off energy, but there is still something odd going on.

I wonder if in this verse, pokémon that seem like a combination of two others like Mantine and Slowbro actually use two pokémon to come into being now? If so, are they still considered one pokémon afterwards?

** It means a lot to me that we're seeing Red manage his emotional well-being. The passage about going outside, how it feels both good and taxing, made me notice my appreciation for having this depiction. Like most everyday tasks, we generally skip past emotional maintenance in fiction, but as someone who has to do it all "manually" and with friends and a life partner who struggle with that stability, it means a lot to me to read a protagonist go through it in a realistic and relatable way. So thanks.

Oh, and it's also great that even though it's connected to his psychic abilities, it isn't the thing generating them or empowering them as happens so often with impaired heroes (see: Daredevil).

** Great chapter as always. A rather broad question, how long do you expect the story to be? I mean, it's already at 41 chapters and 300 000+ words. It feels like it's somewhere around half-finished based on the developments of the plot threads and such, but fanfiction is much less restricted to the normal rules of storytelling than other books. So it can go on for years and years without stopping. I mean, Red, Blue and Leaf is only at cerulean, and I don't know if you want to continue until Blue actually does become the champion (if he does) or not. So, what general timeframe are we looking at here? This is just pure curiosity though. I'll continue reading this as long as you keep updating it. And I'll probably read everything else you publish as well, supposing I am even remotely interested in the subject.

PS. Do you need a beta? I don't know how much help I would be, but I do write my own fanfic, and I think it's decently written.

*** So, my common response to this is to simply say "I'm not sure" and estimate that it will certainly be more than 100 chapters, but probably less than 150. However, we all know how optimism bias operates, and I would not be terribly surprised if, five years from now, I'm looking back and sighing at my silly past self for thinking that I could get through most of the story I have in mind in just 100 chapters.

/However./ I have been making an effort recently to step the pace up, and I think I'm getting at least a little better at it. What's also helping with that is that I've always known the early parts of the story would take longer than the later parts, because it's where details on the world and characters need the most fleshing out. Once they're established, far less time needs to be taken going over them again (if any needed to be taken at all, by some perspectives). As an example of this, there will never be another chapter on Red and the gang going shopping. That chapter is probably one of the easiest to cut, if I ever have to choose chapters to cut, but it's also one that I think did a lot in building the world and society, for those that enjoy that sort of thing.

Hope that's a satisfactory answer, and I'm glad you enjoy the story enough to keep reading it :) Who knows, maybe I'll hit it big someday and be able to quit my day job and devote myself to writing full time. That would certainly make the ~150 chapter estimate less daunting, divorced from the pace of one chapter per month @_@

PS. Thanks for the offer, but I'm okay for now! What's your fanfic about?

**** I see. There's quite a lot of content to look forward to at least. You're doing great. Your writing is supreme, your story is excellent, and those Mewtwo sections are pure gold.

I am one of those that really enjoy worldbuilding, both doing it myself and read about others who does it. Fanfiction can be really good at this, as we don't have to start from scratch. This can be both a boon and a curse, but it's what I really like about it. So, yes. I did enjoy the shopping scene. It was really interesting.

And if automation works out, then I too can start writing fanfiction full time, praising the robots that do all my work for me. Hopefully that can happen to you as well.

My own fanfic is a Naruto and Bleach crossover. I know. It's the most cliche combination imaginable (perhaps after Harry Potter and Naruto), but I really enjoy both of those series. They have their problems, but that's why I'm writing, isn't it?

The story is named Bleached Whirlpool. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11459500/1/Bleached-Whirlpool]] It's about... well, worldbuilding itself, I think. I made my own urban fantasy world and tossed the Naruto and Bleach verses into that one. I don't classify it as a rational fic, but I try my best to be as logical and consistent as I can. Because none of the main cast are particularly hardcore rationalists, quite the opposite really. People will be people, and they don't always act rationally, but the world is at least self-consistent. Or at least as self-consistent as my monkey brain can make it.

****** Yeah. I update really slowly though, so it's not really productivity as much as it is a style of writing. Naruto is good. It's not great, but certainly good. If there was any Naruto fanfic I would recommend above all others it would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][Dreaming of Sunshine]]. That one is really good. In fact, I think it's the best fanfic I have ever read (no offense to you, yours is really great as well).

I find that I really enjoy 'rationalist' fiction, but that is only a way of classifying the story. What I really enjoy is consistent worldbuilding and a logical framework for how the world works, and DoS certainly has that.

Time Braid is... well... I guess it's fine, although I have some major problems with it. I have never read Marked for Death, I'd have to look into that.

And don't really bother with what is cliche. That's just an arbitrary label anyway. Anything can be good as long as the author is good. I had a really hard time finding a pokemon fic I liked until I found yours. And now I'm more than satisfied. I thought I would have to write some myself, just to scratch the itch that is was there from this fantastic world existing with so much unfulfilled potential. Now I just enjoy the feeling of that potential being realized and knowing it was done much better than I ever could.

****** So the list of pokemon who evolve through trading sans item is as follows:

Kadabra, Haunter, Machoke, Graveler, Boldore, Gurdurr, Phantump, Pumpkaboo

Alakazam is one of the smartest Pokemon, on par with...I think a 5 yo in this universe? Let's compare that with a parrot. Parrots get pretty miserable if you don't socialize them, spend time with them, give them lots of /novelty/...well, I think that travel and lots of new experiences would encourage a Kadabra's maturation into an Alakazam. Also, note that Kadabra's dex entries say nothing about its intelligence (just power) compared to Alakazam. How does it become smart? Learning new things!

Haunter's Pokedex says that it tries to steal souls...don't think that's happening in this universe (what does Red think about souls?). Phantump and Trevenant live in lonely forests and trap visitors. Pumpkaboo "is said to carry wandering spirits to the place where they belong so they can move on" - travel requirement pretty much right here! For the others, I think they'd need a wide variety of tasty victims to be able to evolve.

Machoke...more people to fight, nuff said. Sparring the same people over and over doesn't teach you anything. Gotta be the very best!

Graveler eats rocks (preferably moss-covered). Going to new places would ensure a steady supply of a balanced diet of minerals, assuming the trainer doesn't already live on a mountain.

Boldore is a tough one. Leaks energy constantly according to the dex. Maybe poisons its own environment if it doesn't keep moving, like a fish living in a tank with poor filtration/inflow of clean water.

In conclusion, this proposed 'travel requirement' wouldn't be a hard one, but it would speed up growth and evolution of the evolve-by-trade group.

******* I thought of a number of ways to try and rationalize the trading (not just the travel requirement idea, which you expanded on wonderfully, but also things like loss of their parent-figure or forced changes in allegiance), but ultimately I just realized there were too many holes in all of them. For this one in particular, what about trades between people in the same region or location? If two people in Kanto trade haunter and graveler, they'd have no reason to evolve. It also throws into question the whole "trading with an item attached" evolution question, which clearly focuses on the item and not the trading itself.

So if I went with that, now I'd have to make up a new rule that the trade has to occur between different regions to speed up evolution, and come up with an explanation for why the process of trading matters for those that need an item. And if I'm putting in new limits or coming up with new rules to make the "Trading causes evolution" still work differently from canon anyway, then I might as well just scrap it altogether.

Maybe I'll think of something that works as a good nod to the game's rules without adopting them fully and implement it later though :)

Screw the trading with an item idea though, that's dumb. Just give the pokemon the item and wait until they figure it out imo. Maybe it wouldn't work immediately like the evo stones if you want to differentiate the two.

I see your point though, ultimately probably not worth it to keep the trading requirement nod to the games.

********** I could see more of a case for the "with item" types to evolve when stored/moved electronically while holding the item - if the code for the pokemon and for the item got scrambled together in transit.

Slight overtones of The Fly though...

*********** Yeah, the problem with that is the idea that this could happen with /anything/ the pokemon are stored with when transferred. Which is obviously problematic if an automatic process, but even if controlled again brings up more problems than it solves.

************ True, you'd need some wildly ad-hoc reasoning for why certain items essentially trigger a bug in the storage/retrieval code, and yet also that bug has a consistent and beneficial outcome.

Either that, or posit a /separate/ set of outcomes, where pokemon get horribly spliced with random items... which would probably be something of an urgent priority for them to fix

****** I use that sometimes too, but sometimes when looking over text the same word or name shows up too often and it starts to bother me, so I switch up how things or people are referred to :)

Since the sentence only has one subject besides Blue (who's clearly male) that was already referred to in the feminine, I think it's okay grammatically.

"The next gust of wind knocks the *squirtle* from *her* feet, and Blue finally points *her* dive ball forward."

(Applause is audible from the bleachers) or (Sounds of applause are audible from the bleachers). Alternatively, shift the sentence to be in active rather than passive voice. "Blue hears scattered sounds of applause from the audience" or something like that. Similarly...

Not grammatically incorrect, but there's no "they" implicated previously in the sentence or paragraph. I think you mean "...and what (his/your) options are." or "...and what the options are."

Maybe not a mistake, but Leaf was established as "her" two whole paragraphs ago, and then it talked about Red's pichu, who is also "her". I think the pronoun "lost its reference" by the time it's used here.

** Poor Red experiencing all the emotions from his dad's loss, but it's also good he's finally working through them, instead of bottling 'em up. I can see you're blending the 'carries a Pikachu about' character aspect Red and Ash are known for into it too, due to Pichu (and, once it evolves, Pikachu) being a fluffy friend he can cuddle with for comfort who's not particularly dangerous to hug.

It's really quite sweet, and a lovely idea, imo.
