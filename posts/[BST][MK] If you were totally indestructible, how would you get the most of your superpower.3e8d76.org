Inspired by [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/unbreakable-worm-au-altpower-taylor.20433/][this]] Worm fanfic.

The main character is capable of shrugging off all forms of damage, and seemingly has no metabolism - she only breathes and eats out of habit, and she's immune to diseases and sicknesses. Her body is "locked" as it was when she first got her power - she'll never lose weight or develop more muscle, and she'll never age either (which is less than optimal as she's still a teenager). Finally, her resilience means she's never uncomfortable, and thus she can zone out so effectively she might as well be hibernating.

No super-strength to accompany the durability, or anything like that. What would you do with this power?


** Nothing dramatic. Violence and danger is bad for the psyche, the only thing you've got left to damage. Physical discomfort is defined-out here, but not mental derangement. You are going to live forever, it seems, so time to get chill on a permanent basis. Maybe take some yoga classes, or just intentionally stay hopped +up+ down on drugs all the time. It isn't like they'll hurt you.

(But maybe you can't even metabolize at all anymore. Huh. I guess that means you're now breaking thermodynamics. Oops. Wonder what is supplying you with brain chemicals...now...whatever.)

On the other hand, you will have unlimited willpower and focus, as those are exhaustion of chemical processes which you have to be immune to if you never get "uncomfortable" or, as is implied, bored. You could program forever, do the dullest accounting analysis without pause or breaks--basically do the most tedious, detail-focused jobs in the world without ever having your attention lapse.

Or maybe not. It also implies you might be permanently unable to experience any "negative" emotions or even physical sensations, which has disastrous results for a human mind. No pain isn't a big deal, but no boredom, or mental or physical discomfort resulting in novelty seeking behaviors, means you'll quickly get non-human thought processes. Completing goals is still feel-good, but not completing them doesn't make you angsty or uncomfortable.

Standing around doing nothing might be relatively the same to you as doing anything else short of something on the level of eating chocolate cake and having sex (assuming no drugs with painful side-effects work on you at all anymore). In fact, without any of the downsides, you'll likely drift slowly into a maximum chocolate-cake-and-sex lifestyle. Sex, then chocolate cake during the refractory period. Rinse-off (or not, it isn't uncomfortable after all) and repeat.

--------------

But let's assume that's not the case, and your brain and internal goal systems aren't fucked badly by this change.

You can ignore the [[http://i.imgur.com/lp3SQ82.jpg][Cyborg Limb Limit]], so you can simply use your body as an unbendable element in lever operations, regardless of your personal physical strength. Exo-suits mean your physical body doesn't matter, strength wise, so you have super strength whenever you want by just strapping on enough hydraulics.

Your body is a miracle material, so I'm sure some enterprising mechanical engineer could work something lucritive out. Maybe a machine that has high operational value that can be a lot smaller by simply jamming you inside at a critical stress juncture, thus saving on reinforcement costs. Just make sure you keep it secret from any other power-gamers, otherwise you will be a very unactualized part of an infinite energy device very quickly.

--------------

Otherwise, do whatever. Just stay out of mines and arctic areas, and never get in an orbital craft. You can be a bum if you want and still live on the nicest beaches in the world. You can take a decade to write that novel you always wanted time to work on, or just scrape up some money to put into long-term investments and wait in a quiet forest for a hundred years. Or a thousand.

No reason to risk damaging your mind by trying to fight crime or do anything dangerous. If you understand your situation correctly, you will know you currently represent more potential future experiences than the rest of humanity's history and (likely) future combined. You are going to outlive /galaxies/, so take this initial time to really perfect a mellow outlook. Sooner or later, you'll almost certainly have to jump-start civilization again (human or otherwise), but for now build good mental habits that will help in your coming immortality.

*** To me, it really sounds like this setup requires that the mind be no longer an electrochemical process of an organic brain, but rather to be recreated as some sort of em, perhaps running on whatever substrate now encompasses your body, or perhaps running outside our /metric universe/† altogether, with the results injected in. The body is now effectively something like a "game avatar" for the mind, being piloted by wire.

As such, I'd expect that none of the things about brain chemicals apply any more, since the brain is no longer chemical. But /equivalent processes/ might have been created as part of the "hypervisor drivers" of whatever's simulating the mind---algorithmic processes that obey rules that determine that certain stimuli over extended periods will make you bored, etc.

Basically, I would imagine that whatever features a cybernetics engineer would need to hack into the hypervisor software to make an uploaded brain remain human over time, would be there; and anything /not/ meeting that criterion (like, say, stomach cramps) would be simply left unimplemented.

#+end_quote

Hmm... can you not treat an immovable object as identical to an object which is inexorably moving in circles, simply by changing your frame of reference?

(For example, if it's immobile relative to /earth/, from the perspective of the sun it's always spinning in circles...)

I think either you /can/ get free energy out of this, or you can't and by corollary we /also/ proved that you can't get free energy out of unstoppable objects at constant velocity (assuming Newtonian and disregarding gravity for now), which is interesting in and of itself.

My intuition is says it's probably the latter (so if you change your frame of reference to the sun, you can use the circularly-moving rod to make other objects spin in the exact same type of circle - but that's not free energy because /eventually/ the whole universe will be spinning in that exact circle, as if someone were stirring it. In effect, it's non-renewable kinetic energy - you can only harness the motion of objects that are moving relative to the rod. Which is not exciting, since we can harness kinetic energy between objects moving relative to each other anyways, but if we have Earth as reference frame then i think we at least delay heat death by a fair amount as we anchor the stars and other massive objects one by one to keep the turbine powered by our spinning rod in place?)

Edit: Relevant: [[https://xkcd.com/162/]] and I just realized that I've accidentally derived "conservation of (angular and linear) momentum", which is apparently a thing... so yeah, I feel silly. The immovable rod gives us energy we would not otherwise have had access to, by allowing us to violate conservation of momentum each time it interacts with a moving object (and extracting more than would otherwise be possible from harvesting kinetic energy alone), but not easy infinite energy.

Edit 2: But see this: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3e8d76/bstmk_if_you_were_totally_indestructible_how/ctdk97j]]

****** Yes, if you have /two/ rods with differing (linear or angular) velocity, you get infinite energy.

But if you only have one, or if you have multiple but they all have identical linear/angular velocities at all times, then you can't. The only thing you /can/ do is bring the rest of the universe closer to the same velocity as your rods, and harness non-renewable energy out of that.

(And in the D&D case, I assume even if there is more than one, they'd all be anchored to the earth and therefore be identical, so no dice. But if you, say, got an Earthen rod and a Martian rod, then....)

Edit: but see this caveat - I suspect there's something I've misunderstood about rotating reference frames.

**** Generating energy with an immovable rod is trivial. Activate it in a room that happens to be spinning, such that the rod is spinning end-over-end. (The D&D rules allow such rods to work on planets, so rotating reference frames obviously aren't forbidden.) The rod has a changing quadrupole moment and will [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Sources_of_gravitational_waves][therefore]] radiate gravitational waves, which carry energy - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bead_argument][thanks, Feynman]].

Could conservation of energy prevent this? I don't think so. Consider what happens if your rotating room is at the exact center of a rotating sphere of matter. Such a sphere would not radiate gravitational waves, so it'll rotate forever. If the immovable (with respect to the room/cavern) rod attempted to slow down to conserve energy, it would no longer be rotating with the sphere.

(I don't know enough GR to say what happens to a rotating rod of ordinary matter. It has to radiate, and I think the back-reaction is what will slow its rotation in free space.)

***** Consider that perhaps it four-dimensionally locks to the nearest mass of sufficient size. In effect, it becomes part of the mass-sphere (or the planet). It remains immovable with respect to the locked mass, but if you apply a force from outside the lock system, it will affect all of the mass normally.

Given that it presumably locks to the planet most of the time, this doesn't come up much. However, if you locked it to (say) a sphere of suitable mass, you could use a crane to pick up the rod - and the sphere would come with it. No energy output needed.

**** That's an interesting puzzle. I think it's quite likely impossible, but I have one I have one plausible looking setup which I haven't properly disproved so I guess I'll post it anyway.

Given objects with masses 1, 2 and 3 (these masses in particular might not be right, but that's the ordering, and the hypothesis is that there's some values that would):

1. Start in the state: 1------32
2. Launch object 2 away from 1, and lock 2 once you're in the state: 1-----3---2
3. Gravity will eventually turn this into (you can extract some energy here as well): 1--------32
4. Then unlock 2, and extract the energy from it falling to 132 which looks like it should be less than the energy to reset it to 1------32 plus the delta between what you use in the launch and what you can recover in step 3.

It should be relatively easy to prove whether that works and whether it's possible at all with gravity by actually doing the math, which I might do eventually but don't feel like right now.

***** Where are you abusing the unphysical immovable/incompressible/indestructible property? What you're talking about sounds like it could be accomplished with masses on a frictionless ordinary rod, with pins to lock masses in place. This obviously conserves energy.

If you want a magical effect (violating conservation of energy) you need to actually exploit a magical property. Similarly, it takes about five seconds to look at hoax nonsense like the "EMDrive" and conclude that nothing about bouncing photons around in a box (thoroughly mundane) can lead to the magical effect of violating conservation of momentum.

**** That said, an object with a magically fixed velocity which is not anchored to the earth cannot follow the Earth perfectly, because the /earth/ does not have fixed velocity. So I think you could write a physics-consistent story about a society which harnessed the kinetic energy out of the movement of the Earth itself - with possible plot twists involving risks of throwing the earth off course and into the sun...

Of course, if it's truly "anchored" to the earth, infinite energy is available once we can move the planet. Or failing that, if the Rod only follows the /celestially predicted/ orbit given no human interference, there may or may not be room for interesting stuff involving the forces which adjust the course, since those would involve /non/-constant magical acceleration.

**** One point that I'm a little confused on is whether or not an unalterable angular velocity will give you an infinite supply of linear acceleration in any arbitrary direction. Might you not get infinite energy that way? My intuition keeps flipping between yes and no... a constant /acceleration/ means infinite energy, after all, but I'm having difficulty reconciling that with the notion of arbitrary reference frames.

So yeah, this might all be totally wrong and maybe it's an energy free for all afterall. That's what I get for not taking physics classes past high school :( although we're still strictly Newtonian so I /should/ be able to resolve this with only what I know now. It seems I've been nerd sniped and have other work to do, so I'll leave this up for now and let's see if anyone can clear it up before I think about it more... and if we can't, we can always recruit [[/r/physics]]

*** Stable things are stable because they have low energy - to destroy or deform a solid object, you need to put more energy into it until it can overcome the bonds keeping its atoms in place. An unstable object - like a radioactive material - is unstable because it can lose its extra energy and become something more stable.

Indestructible things are as stable as it's possible to be (maybe a little more than that). You get energy by /creating/ indestructible things, not by destroying them.

***** Hmm... presumably this power lets you reposition your body in any "normal" way. You can move your muscles etc. but it wouldn't let you dislocate your shoulder or allow your muscles to rip. So If I were to clench my arm to my chest at full strength, and someone were to pull it away with great strength, my power would allow that to happen, it simply would not allow the muscles to tear or the arm to come off etc.

So, given that alongside my further understanding of the mechanics of the lower esophageal sphincter, I believe you are correct. We would need some other, perhaps technological means to contain the micro-sun at the two available exit points, but it may still be more efficient that an entirely mundane containment method.

** Along the same lines as the rest of the responses I'd look towards something dangerous as well, but rather than simple emergency response (admittedly I'd probably be involved in that on and off as well) I would help in hostage situations, warzones, and other high-pressure situations. Bomb threats and whatnot would be good as well. The size issue in being a teenage girl would stifle some of the possibilities, but I could rescue children from situations and use my indestructable body as a human shield without putting myself at risk.\\
For an explosive situation I would see if it's possible for me to bodily produce a seal around the given explosive. It's easy to consider protecting people from explosions with my body but if there's not a solid seal it could still produce an unsafe situation for those around me. Regardless of the physical capability of doing so, it would still be easy enough to walk the bomb away to a safer situation.

Considering the overwhelming number of landmines still placed in wartime countries it would also make sense for me to run around and try to set them off. Protecting a dog, kid, or woman from potentially blowing themselves up while they attempt to survive in a ravaged area would be a positive use of the power. Considering my status as a teenaged girl in the situation I believe I would find it fun as well getting thrown around by explosions without any possibility of bodily harm.

And, if at some point I have gained enough reputation to get my way onto a space voyage I would set records for space walking time without space suit (rather easy considering). I could also use my status to get into showdowns with famous MMA fighters and boxers and whatnot where they could attempt to beat me up in front of thousands of screaming fans. That would likely get old in a bit but I'm sure I could get enough money from that and the advertising deals that would come with it to finance my ability to get involved in more of the activities mentioned earlier.

I'm not sure how rational this all sounds, but I think it sounds like a pretty good use of my capabilities in the situation.

** Your stomach is a nigh-indestructible container, so you can use it as a strongbox, or containment for deadly materials. Your lungs are also available storage space if you don't need to speak, as are your... other bodily cavities.

You could of course use any of these cavities to turn omnidirectional explosive blasts into shaped charges.

Swallow a couple dozen kilograms of enriched uranium, hold an iron sphere in your mouth, and fire projectiles at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbbob#Propulsion_of_steel_plate_cap][66 kilometers per second]]. Or faster probably...

** Depending on how it works it might let you break through things. Your body is entirely impervious to damage, so what happens when you try to jam your pinky into a brick wall with all your strength? Your pinky certainly won't break, so if you anchor yourself sufficiently well that you can't get pushed back then you should break through.

I have a nagging doubt my physics is off.

  Yesterday's experiment was a precise duplicate of the infamous teleportation test in August 2005, which was originally intended to exchange the positions of two tiny spheres of boron placed just a few feet apart. That experiment instead resulted in physicist Dr Anne Poole being teleported into a local coal seam. She was stumbled upon by a mining crew 18 months later, having inexplicably survived her ordeal, for reasons which have left both doctors and scientists baffled. Dr Poole no longer requires food, water or air to survive, but is being treated for severe psychological damage resulting from her long-term sensory deprivation.
