** u/ArgentStonecutter:

  because this was Hogwarts, and it was entirely possible to actually get /lost/ in the library between the entrance and this far back.

Of /course/ the Hogwarts library connects to the Unseen University library.

** Is there a reason this links to Chapter 26 of a 50-chapter fic? Are we intended to start reading there?

*** Oh. That's where I was when I decided this was good enough to link. I forgot to link to the beginning of the story.

Start from the beginning.

**** I did, and have now read the first 11 chapters--and wow, this is really very good. I'm not sure I would call it rational, but the author has got characterization /down/. There doesn't seem to be any kind of coherent plot yet, and I'm not sure if one will develop, but it works very well as a series of set pieces. Particular highlights are the outstanding monologue by Lily Potter, nailing a Dumbledore who is neither crazy nor evil, and, especially, the Sorting. Actually going through every single student is a ballsy move, but the author managed to pull it off, and that's pretty cool.

** This was really fun, starting from all of the bits involving Percy Weasley. A few plot points were a bit too contrived, but in general this does a bang up job of solving problems using uncommon sense and keeping it interesting.
