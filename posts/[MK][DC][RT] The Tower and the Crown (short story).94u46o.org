**** It's a reference to [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][/Marked for Death/]], a rational /Naruto/ quest. Kagome is a character from it, a ninja with a penchant for solving every problem with massive quantities of explosives.

** Bad hackers climb the tower to get the crown.

Good hackers knock the entire tower over to get the crown.

Great hackers kidnap the clever princess after she figures out how to get the crown

*** More darkly, if the crown can only change hands after the death of the previous owner, I suppose they could just kill the queen and duplicate her method. The crown better involve some pretty sweet powers to make up for possibly incentivizing people to murder you. All the more so once the tower challenge is no longer difficult.

Presumably the crown carries /some/ power which somehow results in people listening to your governing decisions one way or another. Otherwise no one would care who had the crown. But the protagonist better be reasonably powerful if she's going to blithely wave the crown at Baldie and Beardie like that.

Presumably it is anti-inductive. It's created by gods: they will get rid of this exploit in next version, by e. g. turning towers into dungeons.

Perhaps gods smite everyone who doesn't (excepting some "legal" methods of assassination such as poisoning?).

***** Poisoning doesn't have to be an exception maybe its just that the idiot king forgot to make poisoning magicaly illegal .
