** Aeria is a vast and strange world, islands of stone and earth float ponderously through unending skies. In anticipation of the release of my first novel, I will be publicly releasing a series of short stories providing more background information on Aeria and its inhabitants. If you're interested in beta reading the actual novel, send me a PM, otherwise, I hope you enjoy my writing.

*** Do you have a list of people who you'll notify of the novel's release? If so, can you put me on it, so I can (likely) buy it when the time comes? I've so rarely seen stories take place on floating land masses and the fact that you're confident enough to post the story to this subreddit is good enough for me to give it a try at the very least.

**** Heh, I'll probably advertise the release of it here if the mods let me, but it might be a year or two before it hits the shelves, publishing is a long hard road. That's part of the reason for posting Tales From Aeria, because the world was just too awesome and deep for me to want to wait that long to share it.

** Looks interesting! It'll take some time and development before I really get into it but a conflict is already set up.
