I would very much like to see this story continued, for those of you who may have missed the author released lots of information regarding the rest of the story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/97cyvw/aeromancer_info_released/][here]].


** I'd like to see it, but realistically speaking, probably nobody (and I don't mean the author of Mother of Learning).

If someone does, I think they should depart from the author's plans. I think a lot of them weren't very good, to be frank.

*** to be fair, it's the execution that matters the most. the magic itself was the most cliche you can have (element based system) but it was done in a way that got me liking it.

** It's /extremely/ rare for anyone to pick up an orphaned work and finish it (or even continue it without finishing it). Most of the people who have the chops to do it have their own stuff they'd rather write, and there are all kinds of headaches that come from filling in for the other person, even if you do have a detailed plan in place.

*** "Extremely rare" doesn't feel like it conveys how much that doesn't happen. It's theoretically possible, but I've never, ever, ever seen it happen or heard of it happening (except in traditional publishing after an author died).

**** The only time I've seen it happen was with [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8220/mythrans-master-of-all-continued][Master of All]] where the original author posted about 70,000 words or 16 chapters and then someone else decided to continue it to completion for another 2 million words or 794 chapters.

****** Eeh...it started out really well with Ren developing his crafting class and getting by with his abilities in crafting instead of fighting like the other players, but then it starts to go downhill after a while.

First is the massive harem where every girl he meets falls in love with him because he's such a competent individual, tragic figure, or too cute to resist. Second is when he starts being able to beat fighters with a crafting class which ignores the original starting premise. Third is the behavior of the gaming company where they are too eager to help Ren with all possible 'issues' in the game which is so unrealistic for me that it's SOD-breaking. Finally Ren doesn't really face any truly difficult challenges after the starting chapters and falls into the classic issue of an OP protagonist being kinda boring to read about. Stop when you read up to chapter 19 or 20. The first arc was the best part of the story for me.

I mainly included it because despite all of the above issues, the story is fairly popular on royalroad and it's an excellent example of a story that was abandoned and later completed by a totally different author.

****** It is one of the most painful books that I ever enjoyed. The only book I dropped after reading to the 100th chapter too.

Not only is it a Harem it is also Smut. The gratuitous sex scenes do not have ANY story related factor in their existence. He has bunches of orgies with game characters and his nurses because of his big penis. The nurses are so pre-occupied with his big penis they forget that they have a legal obligation to not have sex with the patient.

But this IS a case where one author took over from another and "finished" the story.

** There is another option. Somehow convince the author to start writing again, and rescue(?) him from his cult.

** To be honest its quite sad that the author stopped writing, but i think its not a good idea to have someone else continue ... its not going to be the same , the worldbuilding was still not really complete nor anything else , hoping for the original author to return is definitly the best bet even if its highly unlikely.

And to some extend the story is done ... Seti wanted to be a mancer and be part of their world and now he is ... everything else can stay open and unfinished ... but the story as such got at least a soft ending.
