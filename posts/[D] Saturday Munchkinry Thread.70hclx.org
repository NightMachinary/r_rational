Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** So [[https://i.redd.it/j57xp9icu9mz.png][this]] was just posted in another sub.

Not as solitary a munchkin tool as others but still interesting to see how one would peg powers in terms of expense and trade, especially in a free market where everyone has the same information as you.

What would be "must gets"? And how small does your portfolio have to be to be useful?

*** The best powers are of course, the powers that let you choose powers.

So number #1 Power:

- Wish: wish for all powers
- Power of Your Choice: choose Wish

If you can't have above:

- Rewind Time
- Single-Save-Point Rewind
- Redo Past Minute

The reason is because these powers will allow you to choose whichever powers you desire. Because you have the ability to rewind time, you can simply roll for powers, and if you don't like the results, rewind time back and reroll.

Possible substitutes for one of the above:

- Second Chances: If this let's you reroll.
- Curse with Unluckiness: If this lets you make an enemy, curse them with unluckniess, then roll for the rest of your powers. Since they are your enemy, it would be very unlucky for them if you get the powers you want, so this would give you the powers you want.

After that, you want to have the powers that are actually useful for your goals. Again, number #1 Power:

- Wish: wish for your goal to be fulfilled
- Power of Your Choice: choose Wish

Honestly Wish is just broken, along with all powers that would help you choose Wish.

**** The next tier of powers are defensive ones. After all, having powers doesn't mean anything if you're too dead/incapacitated to use them.

Among the remaining powers, the most powerful one seems to be:

- Invulnerability: of course. Invulnerable = not vulnerable. You can't be hurt in any way whatsoever. No surprise attacks, no starvation, even if you get sucked into a black hole or the universe runs out of energy you're still okay.

Next are the powers that give partial invulnerability:

- Immortality: A step down from invulnerability. You can't die, but you can still be incapacitated. You could put into eternal sleep, or tortured so badly that you can't think and can't use your powers, or succumb to diseases that rob you of all your mental/physical functions, while your power still keeps you technically alive.

- Swift Justice: This is actually an extremely powerful defensive ability, because it makes you immune to all intentional harm. If anyone so much as tries to hurt you, they are met with swift justice for "attempted (crime)" or "conspiracy to (crime)", which should incapacitate them before you are even harmed. This won't save you from unintended harm though. Manslaughter might arrest the people responsible, but only after you're already hurt. It also won't do anything against non-living sources of harm, like natural disasters and disease and the heat death of the universe.

Then the powers that aren't very good, but still somewhat ok for defense:

- Freeze Time Everywhere / Self Intangibility / Barrier Sphere: As long as these powers are active, you can't be hurt by other people/objects since they are all frozen / intangible / blocked by the barrier. The problem is, you can probably still starve to death, so you need to deactivate now and then, leaving you vulnerable during these times.
- Advance Warning / See Possible Futures: Let's you detect danger so you can avoid them. Doesn't help if those dangers are unavoidable though, which many of them will be. Also very restrictive since you would constantly be forced to take actions to avoid danger.
- Blameshifting: A much, much weaker version of Swift Justice, makes anyone that wants to harm you choose to harm someone else instead. The problem is, you could still get hit by collateral damage.
- Possess Body: Somewhat like Blameshifting, but you need to choose people carefully since they may have their own enemies.

And then, because it would be incredibly boring to be the only one left alive when the universe ends, you need a power to combat the heat death of the universe. (Or *Power Sharing* to keep other people alive.) Ideally, you want a power that generates as much energy as possible, so pick one of the following:

- Conjure any existing item: Conjure mass fast.
- Nearby-item replication: Replicate mass fast.
- Transmute Elements: Transmute nuclear waste back into uranium/plutonium, allowing you to reuse them in nuclear power plants. You may need some of the above defensive abilities to handle nuclear waste though.
- Chain Lightning: Directly create electricity. This is better than Lightning strike, which wouldn't work if you aren't on Earth (or within some atmosphere.)
- Element Bending / Telekinesis: This should allow you to spin turbines for energy.

***** I don't think swift justice would make you immune to all intentional harm, just from illegal harm. If the government decides to come after you, or declares you a wanted criminal, or you leave its jurisdiction and are in the territory of a different government with different laws or no government at all, then attacking you would no longer be illegal. These are all unlikely to occur if you're just being an ordinary citizen, but if you're a dude with super powers and people know about it then they become more likely.

I guess the question here is, what is the "justice" in "swift justice" referring to? Some moral concept of justice? Or a country's specific laws? Both of these are actually really exploitable.

If it is some moral concept of justice, then it would make you immune to all intentional harm. If it's a country specific justice... what happens if the country passes new laws? If you could somehow bribe the government officials into passing arbitrary laws, then "Swift Justice" would become really powerful really fast.

******* In the case where it's some moral concept, and we assume it's some fixed set of values that most people consider reasonable, I wouldn't call that "exploitable" because it's just powerful and you don't really need to do anything to cause it to be powerful. I think it would still have some limitations; if it considers self-defense to be justifiable then people who you attack first would be able to attack you back. Or if you commit a crime it might allow violence in order to bring you to justice (would it trigger against you yourself in order to accomplish swift justice if you do something wrong?) It'd still be powerful assuming you aren't evil.

The legal one would be exploitable as you describe.

** Nobody's posted yet? I'll put something down!

Let's make the weakest version of werewolves I can*, and see how people can munchkin it:

- The "werewolf" part is just turning into a big wolf. You're not the size of a bear or anything and you don't have like impressive gnashing fangs or healing or anything.

- One advantage of being a wolf: your wolf body is perfectly healthy so e.g. if you're wheelchair bound your wolf body can walk, if you've got dementia your wolf body is lucid. (I am /not sure/ what this would mean for a human with OCD, schizophrenia, Deafness or autism, especially since with the latter two many people with these conditions don't consider them to be a lacking but just part of normal human variation and fiercely object to attempts to treat them)

- You can't control it and it is not related to the moon, though you change every 3-6 weeks

- You're a wolf for 3-5 days, not just at night

- You can predict it somewhat because it happens on a somewhat predictable cycle, usually you can predict the day you transform but you can't get it down to the hour or anything (so you can't use the power to be The Best Magician by timing your transformation)

- You can't talk or have psychic powers when you're in wolf form or anything, you are just a wolf with a human mind (but you could easily communicate with an alphabet mat or similar)

- When you're a human you have slightly improved sense of taste/smell and you can identify other werewolves by their smell (this only happens after you know you're a werewolf and thus know that "weird smell A" is "werewolf smell")

- Werewolfness is genetic and activated randomly during your life (as in, one day without warning you'll start going through the regular werewolf cycle of changes - though in some cases the regular transformations stop only to start again), though you can force a genetic werewolf to start changing every few weeks by biting them

- Werewolfness doesn't really run in families because it's super rare: rate is about 3 in 100,000

- Standard urban fantasy setting (Present Day and the world looks normal but there are secretly vampires, centaurs, etc all around the place)

What happens with the foetus during the transformation? Will the prospective mother have a human foetus in her wolf womb, and vice versa? Will the transformation pause, i.e. you remain whatever you're pregnant with until birth? Will your body abort every pregnancy as soon as you transform?

As a follow up, if there are anti-transformation methods like the supposed pregnancy in wolf worm, does your sentience degrade (meaning, mind is a plaything of the body the longer time they differ)? Are there anti-transformation methods, and which direction do they work?

****** Definitely world-building not munchkin questions, unless you're planning on doing some sort of werewolf abortion for profit :)

There's no anti-transformation methods: you are either in "wolf cycle" (turn into wolf every few weeks) or out of "wolf cycle" (don't turn into a wolf, ever, until wolf cycle is entered).

There are ways to put yourself into wolf cycle, and ways to take you out of it, but they tend to be very demanding of time and mental/physical energy. Most werewolves enter wolf cycle and then stay there because leaving wolf cycle is virtually impossible due to the amount of effort required. Most reliable way to enter wolf cycle is to be bitten by a werewolf (in human or wolf form), and this is irreversable.

RE pregnancy: transformation keeps your human body in hammerspace effectively (happens using 4D), so the womb with baby and all would probably be in suspended animation. I assume this might result in your gestation taking a bit longer than normal depending on how much of the pregnancy you spend in wolf form, but it probably wouldn't add more than an extra month so wouldn't be something that doctors would find too weird.

Wolf gestation is about two months so assuming 10 transformations a year of 3 days each, you're looking at 2 years of calendar time to give birth to a litter of pups.

Mind the plaything of the body: I want the "human mind" to have ultimate control, and the "wolf brain" is just a shell that is used as a conduit to that human mind. But this conflicts with my idea that e.g. dementia is cured while you are in wolf form. So there's probably a more complicated relationship at work.

*** As far as the wolf body being healthy, does this mean wounds are not preserved when you transform? Ie, if you get stabbed with a knife as a human, then transform to a wolf, the wolf doesn't have a stab wound. Then does the wound return when you turn back into a human as if no time has passed? Otherwise this would be free healing like in Animorphs. Similarly, if you get stabbed as a wolf then transform is your human form stab-free? And several weeks later when you transform again do you get a new healthy wolf body or would it still have the stab wound?

Assuming you don't have free healing to your human body, the only advantage I can see from this is the ability to commit crimes without being caught. If, for some reason, you wanted to kill someone, you could track his movements, find a time/place where he's going to be relatively isolated and lines up with your wolf time, and then go kill him as a wolf. Forensics will find a dead body with wolf bites and if there are witnesses they'll report that a wolf killed him. There will likely be a search for a rogue wolf, but there won't be a murder investigation and if you've prepared right you can hide until you're a human again and nobody will know (except potentially people who know about werewolves).

I don't think you could make a habit of it, and I'm not sure it's particularly profitable. If you hired out as an assassin you'd have to prove you're a werewolf (or claim to have a trained wolf) in order to verify the kill, which would make you potentially traceable by or through your client. You could also try other crimes such as burglary as a wolf, but that's going to be harder and raise a lot more suspicions.

It would come as if no time has passed. Even if it was an Animorphs-like healing factor, the slight randomness means you can't depend on it to get you out of a sticky situation.

Wolf body would have the stab wound, nice and fresh.

(Due to the way transformation works - through the two bodies being linked via the 4th dimension and basically the transformation "forcing" the wolf/human body to move "up"/"down" relative to 3D space - the human body is linked to the wolf body. This means that the human body is effectively in suspended animation, and so is the wolf body when it is not "visible".)

Other thought was that that the 4D space the human/wolf protrudes into when it's not "visible" allows the body to heal in the meantime, die of blood loss, etc, but then by the time you've been a werewolf for 20 years your wolf body should be decrepit and aged rather than young and feisty, so suspended animation is probably better.

********** Hmm. If we go into the real nuts and bolts of the world, since everything ultimately runs on atlantean nanites and 4D physics/geometry, werewolves are probably the result of something useful/intentional "going buggy" and resulting in these semi-predictable transformation cycles happening. (Probably the original intent was to allow transformation at-will, I guess).

So the human side would be fully human (except for the nanites, which /somehow/ don't show up on blood tests?), wolf side would likely be a "3D printed wolf body", so would have wolf-ish DNA.

I can't imagine transformation cycles being "activated" for at least 2 or 3 years after birth, so there's time for the wolf body to be created (at the very least, a pup for a 4 year old to transform into - though that would break the "doesn't age" thing, but then again, assuming the nanites are constantly working on the wolf body, you probably have something more like an animorphs-style ageless wolf).

The wolf copy would require the afflicted person to eat enough food to create it, but depending on the lower bound for wolf cycle age (I'd want it to be like 12 or so), getting the raw material to make that wouldn't be too bad. Though if that wolf was put in a very accurate calorie measuring room it might give bad results - but people would assume a poorly sealed room or something before they'd assume that the human was able to spirit away mass by eating it.

If it's nanites, then they don't need to take all of the mass for the wolf side from his body. A lot of it can be taken from the atmosphere - at least those parts made of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, which is most of it. (Not that that's likely to make too much difference in his daily life).

It's also quite possible that the nanites are working exactly as designed... but in the intervening millennia, everyone's simply forgotten how to trigger the intentional change, which is supposed to involve saying a complex phrase while standing in a certain unlikely posture.

The other stuff is good food for thought. Need to figure out what my wolf story is going to be /about/, but that's high level "how do I write?" level stuff.

Yeah, it's where we run into trouble, even with the vet thing. Fiona at least is a lawyer who works alone and not currently in wolf cycle mode besides; Zach will be in wolf cycle mode the whole time so he's going to need an appropriately flexible job.

(When I call in sick I do it via email, so Zach could probably do that with a suitably modified keyboard/mouse).

That was one of the things I thought of for him, but I'm not sure he'd be good at it. Zach is full of sunshine and rainbows, comes across as naive (but isn't overly), and is probably autistic to some degree. His character has always been about being aloof, isolated, and misunderstood so that's where I kind of want to go with him.

The vet thing worked because it was him relating with animals "instead of" people.

Data analyst (aka generic computer desk job) might be a good choice for him, but I /do/ like interesting professions.

Home-schooled. Self-employed. Lives alone, owns his own house (and has replaced all the taps with paw-friendly ones). Once a month, buys a few days' supply of dried meat or other foods that don't require cooking. The neighbours think he has a dog, but no-one's ever caught more than a glimpse of it (though fur can occasionally be seen on his carpet).

Has a dog collar (with tag) in his closet, to prevent embarrassing incidents like that time he was found (human-shaped and naked) in the dog pound. (He may have charges of beastiality on his record as a result, and if so, he /really/ doesn't want people finding out and so will try to avoid anything that involves a background check - and if anyone does find out, he'll immediately claim that it was all a stupid misunderstanding, but has trouble explaining exactly what he was doing in the dog pound without any clothes).

Hmmm... he could also be a motivational speaker, or any other job that works mostly by appointment. He just has to avoid scheduling appointments at certain times.

He'd probably have a little snout cover made that has a small point at the end that can be used to hunt and peck on the keyboard. Or perhaps something for the paws, but I think canines are far more dexterous with their snouts so it'd probably be the ways to go.

#+end_quote

I like quite a lot of this, though some of the details will require localisation (e.g. home-schooling is apparently a thing where I'm from but I've never heard of anyone ever actually doing it; a house generally costs 10-15 years salary, etc). But the broad strokes are great!

Then /again/, he could be an orphan (gogo tragic backstory?) and have inherited his parents' fully paid off house. More outsider stuff: he had to fend for himself pretty young (say he had a single mother and then when Zach is age 14 she gets a chronic illness - MS or ALS or something - and he spends a lot of his time caring for her, and she dies when he's 18 or 19). Just when everything finally starts getting OK for him again, BAM, he starts transforming into a wolf every few months and he realises that he's never going to be anything approaching normal.

It is important to me that the character have an affinity for animals, but it might be more interesting if he had pet birds, big aviary, etc rather than the more traditional "werewolves have an affinity for dogs and then it all makes sense hurr hurr". Then again, adopting some big grey dogs would give him good cover.

I might think more through this nascent idea you gave me about his Sick Mother. Perhaps he's a charity worker? A recent survivor winner was a homeless shelter manager by occupation, and something like that could work well: if he founded the organisation, he could just piss off for a few days at a time. And the homeless are pretty misunderstood.

Hmmm. I have a friend who used to be a drug and alcohol abuse counselor at a prison. I might go ask what sort of prison adjacent jobs there are. Zach seems like the sort of person who might be a good parole officer, "person who educates prisoners in life skills", etc. (Actually I think my cousin works educating prisoners.... so yep... Zach is probably involved with prison somehow, and THAT is how Our Heroes have links to the underworld, and probably Fiona could have set him up there).

Actually I think some of our local prisons have programmes where they teach prisoners how to train dogs and stuff. That'd be right up Zach's alley.

Thanks so much for your comments! You give me such breakthroughs somehow :)

Yeah, I suppose it depends. Our dog has a thing called a "cleverpet" which is a console that dispenses food when pads are pressed. She prefers to use her nose instead of her paw by a large margin and is more accurate with her nose. But dogs can be trained to be accurate with paws, so perhaps it would be more intuitive for a human to use paws.

Not really. You can't get one bedrooms unless they're apartments, and I'd think someone with a wolf-transforming-at-random condition would need more privacy than that. [[https://reiwa.com.au/9-88-the-ramble-booragoon-3971218/][Here's an example]] of a two bedroom place for sale at the moment - which, you're right, comes out to 8 years salary.

Hmmm. He'd probably smell different, but I'd imagine the dogs would get used to it. He probably rehabilitates and rehomes dogs on his property, so he might have quite a few. He'd have everything set on automatic feeders so an ill-timed change doesn't screw everything up, though.

I had a long chat session with Former Prison Worker Friend and got a bunch of useful information. Resettlement Officers basically run programmes to help prisoners have life skills, organise things with other organisations ("field trips", training, etc), give job related counselling, etc. In small prisons (like Wooroloo Prison Farm, where he works), Resettlement Officers basically do a bit of everything and are kind of jacks of all trades. So he'd be able to run a "give prisoners dogs to train and look after" programme no sweat. The job also runs like a pretty normal government job here, so you get a decent number of days off (and the ability to "buy" more, so Zach would do that if the allotted 20 per year doesn't cover all his changes), plus good sick leave and other benefits. Otherwise it's a pretty standard 8-4 sort of job.

His stories about the prison system also gave me a lot of little hooks - although Zach won't be required to dress to more than basic professional standards, guards tend to look down on people who don't "shine their shoes and iron every crease", so his green hair and nose ring would probably not make him a fan. Prisoners really rely on routine so Zach taking frequent days off, even if they're scheduled in advance, would piss them off. It's hard to get anything done in a prison because everything is so regimentally scheduled: you have to have the prisons out at a certain time for counts, they get a 15 minute smoke break, etc, so a 2 hour class really only gives you 80 minutes of usable time. Not sure how Zach would feel about that: he's very positive and full of energy so I'm not sure whether he'd be more "I am making a difference in the system, yay!" or if he'd be more "i hate this system i can't make a difference". I think the former because he's so optimistic...

(Now I'm wondering if Zach would get a note from a werewolf psychiatrist/doctor saying he has a condition that means he needs regular days off. I have a friend who is a psychiatrist, I should ask him if there's a condition that could work. Otherwise, a world like ours but with werewolves would probably have a fake mental illness requiring days of isolation that was invented for the purpose of concealing werewolves...)

*** Uhm, well, you have the powers of a wolf, plus intelligence. Uber Canine unit is the obvious application of that. If there is no masquerade, I would expect this to be the standard career path - Hire a round dozen weres, and their cycles have sufficiently little overlap that a nation of a few million can reliably always have a shifted were on duty. Wolves have even /better/ senses of smell than bloodhounds, so that is worth the investment in tracking down explosives, people and drugs. Off-cycle, well, you are being paid anyway, so congratulations, have a job as a regular police officer.

With a masquerade, oh boy are we looking at a challenge now. You cannot keep a regular job. Employers will not be happy with that cycle of unavailability with no plausible reason. You cant even call in sick! So, self-employment is the only game in town. If you want your condition to be an asset, bountyhunter and a co-conspirator is the best bet. Or less legally, tracking down drug operations and robbing them blind.

I don't know about everyone else but when I am sick and need to take work off, I send my employer an email. I could see a werewolf being prepared for this with some sort of thing they can wear on their snout/foot to give them a stylus-sized protuberance for pressing keyboard or phone buttons, and a couple of email templates ("Dear $NAME, unfortunately I am unwell and won't be at work today, from $NAME" is literally what every sickness email I send ever says...)

** You have three save points. Upon death, or falling into an incapacitated state from which you will not recover at all or will not recover within a year, you are immediately taken to a spot to reload.

You can overwrite these save points at any point during your run, like a video game file. However, going back to an earlier save voids any later saves. Go back two weeks and your save last week is dead.

How do you distribute your saves? One weekly one you can easily reload to. Multiple monthly ones?

One rolling save at the start of the year, and one at the start of the week.

- I can have up to three concurrent save points running, or can make up to three over the course of my lifetime?
- I remember the abandoned timeline?
- Is my body reset, or will I accumulate exhaustion? (In other words, will repeating the same day multiple times lead to sleep deprivation, or will exhaustion start with the level I was at at the time of the safe point?

With hindsight of my current me, I'd have set a safe point at the beginning of every class, at every morning, and once a week during my school life, probably, and I'd repeat lessons I don't get the first time around, but in general have every lesson at least twice.
