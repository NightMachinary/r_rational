** I have a theory, though no particular evidence to back it up, that posting updates in the evening will reduce your overall exposure as compared to posting in the afternoon. With fewer people on fimfiction looking through recent updates late at night, you may end up buried before prospective new readers can find you.

I just thought I'd share. Obviously the chapter is super great. Spotted a typo:

"Twilight tries to scan for blood her memories of the gallop back to town hall, but it's a technicolor blur."

*** The best time to post anything to reddit is during the work week, ideally Monday or Tuesday, at around 9AM EST. It's been discussed quite often on [[/r/TheoryOfReddit]]. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/16wcft/data_some_analyses_of_last_weeks_frontpage/][Here's some analysis]] from three years ago, but I'm fairly sure that it hasn't changed since then. Or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3ncx88/how_to_analyze_every_reddit_submission_and/][this one]].

**** As Calamitizer mentioned, posts on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] tend to stay up a while, so it's no special concern here - though it would certainly help for [[/r/mylittlepony][r/mylittlepony]]. I was referring to fimfiction itself, the site the fic is hosted on, where stories tend to only get attention for a few hours after updating. In that case, I suspect there are more people reading in the late afternoon, though as I mentioned that's only speculation.

Also: OMG /alexanderwales is talking to me/.

*** I don't think that's a typo, but it's an unclear sentence. She's scanning her memories to see if there was any blood, indicating an injured pony.

**** I think it would be a typo, since it's missing an "in" before "her memories"

**** You're right, it's not a typo, just a nonstandardly phrased sentence. Scan-for-blood is the verb phrase. Still, three people commented on it, so yeah, oops. I edited it. Thanks!

*** Mm, you're probably right. I can see a good amount of stats, but not actually what percentage of readers come internally from FIMFiction, so I kinda forget it happens. [[/r/rational]] is small enough that my updates kick around on the front page for a while regardless of post time (and [[/r/mylittlepony]] doesn't care about my story yet =[) but yeah, maybe my FIMF readership could benefit.

Oh, and that sentence wasn't a typo, but it was still a poor choice. Thanks for the feedback!

**** You're probably getting more traffic from fimfiction than you realize. Shears has been up since November 18, so about two months, in which time it's had 884 visitors. I don't know what the baseline is, but I started a fic on the 5th of January, and it's had 100 visitors. Views increase exponentially, so adjusting for how long it's been up, that's 300-600. If we pretend for a moment that people on fimfiction are equally likely to click on either (which isn't really a reasonable assumption but whatever) that puts your fimfiction traffic at anywhere from a third to two thirds of the total.
