Disclaimer: I'm a noob at fiction and not much of a writer in general.

​

I am writing a side story to my main Ouroboros story (not linking because I'm not satisfied with what I have so far and would rewrite it in the near future). It is meant to serve as a standalone short story, but would be canon to Ouroboros. The side story would have four parts, and so far I'm done with part 1: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/15kDA1fMKbMQpB2UfuM-M27R2m9kOkGlrxmtgpgYjkKc/edit?usp=sharing]].

​

I'd appreciate if you comment, critique, review, flame, bash, etc. Any and all feedback is welcome. ^_^


** There are two things that make a conflict interesting: stakes, and the possibility of failure.

Writing a story where a character is playing a game of solitaire on his computer as a moment to indicate boredom, or preoccupation, or some other character beat, is fine, but I wouldn't want to write a whole story about someone playing a game of solitaire unless there was something more at stake beyond having to press F2 to start a new game if he loses.

Your story doesn't do anything to establish what's at stake in this tournament. Near the end, there's something about scrutiny, and about notoriety, for having won this round, but not much else. You don't tell us what he's had to go through to get into this tournament; you don't tell us what he stands to win if he succeeds, or lose if he fails. As such, we don't have much investment in whether he wins or loses.

As for the latter element of tension... When you showcase the main character's power, whatever tension is in the story (in spite of the stakes being unclear) is lost, as the possibility of failure is thrown out the window. Mercifully (and, honestly, thank you for this: I've read stories that go on and on in endless detail about how a character with no possibility of failure won, and won, and won), you keep the description of the second and third rounds short once it's clear that he will win. Now, maybe there's some limitation to your character's power that you haven't explained yet, but it looks like a guaranteed win against any opponent, which makes it difficult to keep tension, and therefore the reader's interest. Your character is Superman in a boxing ring against a human who has no idea what's about to hit him.

In addition, you are putting yourself at a bit of a disadvantage here, as someone posted the rock-paper-scissors manga a couple of weeks back, and that was excellent (especially in terms of what I've described your story as lacking: stakes worth playing for, and giving every character a chance to fail). Posting this now, you're kind of inviting comparison, and, because of the extremely high quality of what you're being compared to, it's not flattering for your story.

*** Reddit ate my previous in depth reply (and twice at that). T_T

​

That said I really appreciate the feedback and would try to address your concerns.

There's a cash prize, a very lucrative job offer (and the connections therein), and because the tournament would be his first debut, his public first impression. I intended to highlight the different stakes over the course of the story, but I agree that I should have made it more explicit in this part.

Yeah, there was no real possibility of the MC losing this particular match. Future matches would probably be more interesting, and there may be more tension. That said, the protag would most likely end up winning the tournament (unless I missed something when I was working out how different abilities interact), and his power would look unbeatable to the viewers.

One thing I would do for future matches is to not drag out the match any more than is necessary. Once I've explained and demonstrated the core strategy the MC is using there's really no point in going over the other three battles.

How do you suggest I create tension (or otherwise make the story more interesting/engaging) when the protag's victory is a foregone conclusion?

Oh, this doesn't hold a candle to that. It's not meant to be another reimagination of that concept. Honestly, this story started from a conversation I had when I was trying to reason around how different abilities interacted with each other (particularly time rewind and true precognition). I found Rock Paper Scissors a convenient vehicle to provide an adversarial framework for reasoning about the interactions of those abilities. Once I had sufficiently worked out how the interactions played out, I decided to write a story about it (I had already created the plot for the final battle in my discussion of said interactions).

So it's more to illustrate something about the setting I have, perhaps enlighten readers on the kinds of strategies one might pursue with timelooping (I intend to eventually turn my story into a quest once I'm done setting the world) and perhaps a little intellectual masturbation (just a little at most).

Sorry, I should have been more clear about what I meant. I don't care about what the winner gets; I care about why the character wants to get those things. Now, you might not want to tip your hand just yet about your character's full motivation for participating, but you should at least be dropping hints about which of those stakes the character /really/ cares about, and that there's a reason beyond the obvious that he wants those things.

I mean, sure, he could want the money and the job just to live on, but that's rather banal (unless you want to go into some detail illustrating his life in poverty, for the sake of pathos). He could want the money and influence to take over the world... but that's a bit cliché. You should want the reader to want your character to win (or to /not/ win; either way, there's tension), and if he's just doing this as a way to kill time on a Sunday and buy a thirty-fifth yacht, the reader probably won't care.

Going back to the manga again, it's no coincidence (narratively) that the two characters who had the most compelling reasons to win were the two who ended up in the finals. No one would have cared if the final match was between the billionaire and the Muscle Guy; their reasons for competing are boring. On the other hand, both finalists had stakes that went beyond the competition, that they cared deeply about, and that made the story mean something to the reader.

***** Aah thanks very much. I added two paragraphs that explained as much of the MC's motivations as could be sensibly conveyed in that part:

#+begin_quote
  I breathed out as I climbed onto the stage. I frowned. I shouldn't be nervous. Everything I knew about my opponent suggested that this match was mine for the taking. Even the 100 Sira* I had riding on the outcome of this match shouldn't be making me nervous. One advantage of being the underdog was that the market odds on me winning were very much in my favour (1:9) and if I had to pick between a lottery of 9:1 odds on my victory or 1:9 on my defeat, I'd almost certainly take the former. So why was I still nervous? I'd be walking out of here 900 Sira richer and advance in the tournament.

  Delphi Logistics were hosting their annual Rock, Paper, Scissors tournament, and in marked contrast to the norm for such events, Delphi's tournament was exclusively for metahumans. The grand prize of 100,000 Sira and a lucrative job offer for the winner was very tempting, but it wasn't the main reason I showed up. Delphi's status as one of the world's largest corporations by market capitalisation, and (according to my sources) their Syndicate backing were far more alluring (especially the latter). Seeking out the Syndicate was a Sisyphean task that's as likely to kill you as hired (and I'd know), this job was going to be my in.

I can think of a few ways.

First, by coming up with novel ways that the opponents could use to win. For instance, in the manga, it looks like Muscle Dude has no chance to win even a single round, but then he "throws rock" in such a way that the guy he's playing against is punched across the arena. It's cute, it's clever, it's unexpected, and it makes sense within the world. And then, with the reader off-guard and actually believing in the possibility of a Muscle victory, the inevitable conclusion that Muscle loses feels more earned.

Obviously your story can't work that way, with the contestants across the room from each other, but playing against, say, a telepath, could result in a stalemate: the telepath will win, but the MC will revert it and change his strategy, but the telepath will know the new strategy and keep winning, and it keeps getting reverted. One character or the other would have to /let/ the other win.

Another option would be to introduce a disincentive to winning. As the bookies start setting the odds in your character's favor, perhaps your character is... /gently encouraged/... to take a dive in the third round.

Or something resulting from his victory (e.g. applause becoming too loud for the arena and it collapses, killing a bunch of people) is impossible to bear, so he has to find a way to win without the bad thing occurring.

Or someone finds a way to cheat and turn off his power.

Or another character really /needs/ to win and manages to reach enough behind the asshole and gain enough of the MC's sympathy so that he actually considers losing.

The fact that the main character is predestined to win isn't a problem: no one walked into, say, /Captain America: The First Avenger/ expecting a HYDRA victory. However, the movie still works; it still has tension. Why? Because, /from the main character's perspective/, he is never guaranteed victory until the very end, and because he had to make sacrifices along the way.

You may not want to use any of the above ideas (or, at least, not without scrubbing the serial numbers off a bit), but I hope I've given you some ideas about keeping the story interesting without compromising the match-ups you've got planned.

***** Thanks. I'll look at it. Would you mind looking at the plots I have so far for the next 3 matches?
