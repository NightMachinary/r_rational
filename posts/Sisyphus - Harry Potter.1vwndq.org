** Not sure it's especially /rational/, but it's interesting and well executed.

*** Yeah. I'm sort of scraping the bottom of the barrel. There are some well received rationalfics that I don't really like. I should probably post them.

**** When a subreddit isn't super active, it's fine to post less relevant things. However, I do think you should only post the ones you like. If you decide to stop posting things like this here, please post them to [[/r/hpfanfiction]].

**** I agree that it is basically just generic HP fanfic - though it is interesting to see that esama has started posting again, as I had thought he was out for good when he deleted his fanfiction.net profile and stories.

** That is incredibly depressing. I was thinking at first it was pointing out how much of life comes down to luck, especially Harry Potters, and how many divergences there can be in ones past et cetera, but instead there are /rules/ and stuff that limit what Harry can do.

** I wonder at what point he decides to read some muggle literature, like Feynman's books, GED, Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases, Thinking and Deciding and other related material and become HJPEV the second.

** So, after rereading this again and doing some thinking about what now:

It seems that, as of life 101, he's got it figured out. Now he knows how to make it past the final battle with Voldy, what are the limits? How much further can he expand? Could he go about optimizing the world with his centuries of stored knowledge? I'd spend a few Ravenclaw lifetimes testing the absolute limits of magic, maybe seeing how it works and/or how to exploit it.

Dunno. This is a good deconstruction, but certainly not rationalist or even particularly non-Idiot-Ball. Thanks for sharing!

*** I think the point is by life 100 he doesn't care anymore. He succeeded, he beat Voldemort, he could live the rest of his life however he wanted, but he doesn't. He just goes through the motions. He gave up.
