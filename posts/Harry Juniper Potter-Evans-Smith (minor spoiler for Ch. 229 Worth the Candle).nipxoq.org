"Harry Juniper Potter-Evans-Smith. I would like to talk about the threat you made this morning", Dumbledore moved a hand through his beard as addressed the boy seated behind the desk. "You must understand that the safety of the students at Hogwarts is of paramount importance."

"I would like to talk about the bullying that happened last evening, /Professor/", there was a trace of venom in Harry's voice, "You must understand that the wellbeing of students is of paramount importance!"

"Indeed it is. But if you have any concerns, the proper way to raise an issue is to speak with a senior member of staff, who have both the authority and the experience necessary to address conflicts among the students. Vigilantism is unacceptable", the Headmaster looked at Harry with a stern expression before continuing, "And the wording of the threat is another point that concerns me."

"'Anybody that harasses a white student will face the full wrath of a Level 100 Multi-Mage'", HJ quoted himself with some satisfaction.

"I confess I am not completely fluent in the language of the youth these days, but I believe that last part to be a boast of magical strength", Dumbledore said.

"Sure", Harry decided to humour him.

"More importantly, may I ask why you chose to word your statement in a way that is meant to protect white students specifically?", the Headmaster wore a perplexed expression.

"Protecting any student is a worthwhile endeavour, wouldn't you agree?", Harry deflected.

"While I would stress, once again, that vigilantism cannot be the answer, I would of course agree that it is noble to be concerned about the welfare of your peers", Dumbledore chose his words carefully, "Still, I must come back to this point: why focus on white students? As someone who values rationality, or so I heard", he directed a meaningful look at someone behind and above the boy, even though nobody could be seen there, "would not a focus on one race at the expense of another betray a kind of irrational bias?"

It was at this point that Quirinus Quirrell burst into the room.

Dumbledore was the first to regain his composure, "Quirinus, to what do I owe the... pleasure?"

"I burst in because tensions are high", Quirrell said. "We need to air them. Better to do it now."

"Go ahead", Dumbledore said after a moment.

Quirrell spoke dispassionately, as though reading a receipt, "Harry knows why he focuses on protecting white students, which is that he personally finds it more shocking and horrible when bad things happen to white people than to black people. He recognizes this as being inherently unfair to /both/ white people and black people, but his efforts to reframe his view of the world have so far failed, and in his opinion, so long as his actions don't reflect that bias too badly, he's /not going to worry about it/. There's some unresolved guilt there though. Harry's hatred of whites--"

"Hang on a minute!", Harry interjected.

"Let me finish", Quirrell snapped, "Harry's hatred of whites cuts both ways. He views blacks as being stronger and more self-reliant than whites. He trusts blacks more to be on their own."

"Can I have a moment to defend myself?", Harry asked.

"No, I will", Quirrell said. "Generally speaking, it doesn't cause problems. It's all a product of his West Country upbringing, he understands and acknowledges that. He's killed his share of whites, not letting their race stop him."

"What?!", Dumbledore displayed an uncharacteristically pained expression, "Harry, you always stress rationality, yet..."

"It's as good a defence as I would have given", Harry gave a nod of thanks to his mentor, "Professor Quirrell is right, as usual. Seeing white people hurt makes me uncomfortable in a way black people don't, and that's at a sub-intellectual level. I don't really agree that it's a hatred of whites, but there's probably some other, more appropriate word to use."

"There is one that comes to mind", Dumbledore said.


** i feel like this is trying to satirize juniper's misogyny but it's mostly just doing so by reframing it as racism and changing the setting to kinda-hpmor for some reason, without actually changing the content, which just sorta makes it confusing? i can only see this post making sense from the position that (from a doylist perspective) you're not supposed to think juniper has an actual problem in WtC?

May I ask why you think this? If Reasonable!Dumbledore in this story is explicitly disappointed and "pained" after listening to Juniper!Harry and Valencia!Quirrel's essentially-WtC-canon arguments, how can you come to the conclusion that my message is that Juniper has no problem in WtC?

***** Juniper himself as well as Valencia (essentially a hyper-intelligent master of psychology) discuss Juniper's problem in canon. Harry and Quirrell do something similar in this parody.

Juniper having /no problem/ is just wildly inconceivable as a notion. If the general consensus of those who read my parody is that the intended message is that the original author thinks that Juniper has /no problem/, then that explains the negative reaction, because then clearly I'm a moron.

****** So, here's my read, in the interest of discourse.

I think you're calling attention to the exchange between Juniper and Valencia. By taking the exchange and making it about racism, rather than Joon's misogyny, you're intending to invoke a negative response in the reader (nobody likes racism) and get them to think about why they (presumably) didn't have such a visceral reaction to the exact same discussion when it was about gender instead of race.

My best guess at your deeper point is that we don't take misogyny as seriously as we do racism, or that we give it a pass when the allegory demonstrates we shouldn't.

On a high level, I actually agree with you, if that's your point.

There are two problems with the execution, I think.

The first is that (as another commenter mentioned) the adaptation doesn't really make sense. Interpreting protecting only white people as racism against white people (and thinking black people are stronger) is such a bizarre, rarely-encountered form of racism that it feels strange to read, in a way that detracts from the clarity.

The second is that I think the author of WtC intends for the reader to understand that Juniper is problematic in many ways and has lots of problematic views on gender and sex. The whole arc with Joon's Midwestern views on sex with Amaryllis culminated in "yeah Joon was wrong and being dumb". The parody reads like a criticism of WtC's depiction of the situation -- there's some dissonance since I as a reader think Joon's views are bad/problematic already, and I would only expect this to be written if you thought the author was endorsing Joon's point of view as good/correct.

I also don't think we're supposed to read Val's tearing into the others as her disseminating the objectively correct truth -- it reads like her speedrunning saying the most efficient things to get everyone's tensions settled enough to make it through the rest of the road to Fel Seed.

#+end_quote

Agreed. It is very bizarre. It left most readers confused.

There are two ways to resolve that confusion. Most of the audience went with the first one:

#+begin_quote
  problems with the execution ... detracts from the clarity.
#+end_quote

in other words:

1. The author of this parody is incompetent.

How can he not realize that making an analogy to some sort of rarely-encountered form of racism would be bizarre and confusing? Could he not come up with something clearer? Was that literally the best analogy he could think of?

I had expected readers to think this. But then I had expected some to keep thinking:

In fact, making an analogy to a more typical (anti-black) form of racism would have been such an obvious move, that the author had to have gone out of his way to make the analogy... somehow... weird. Which sounds less like an accidental mistake and more like an intentional choice. Which leads to the second potential way of resolving the confusion:

2. The strangeness is deliberate and integral to the point.

******** I'm going to be honest, man. I think you're getting in the way of getting your point across.

I gave you a direct explanation of the point I got from your work.

You didn't comment on my explanation, but reading between the lines I'm probably not correct about what you intended.

From the comments elsewhere in this thread, clearly what you intended isn't coming across to the readers of this subreddit. It's more likely that this is on the authorial end than on the end of so many independent (though granted like-minded) readers.

Even considering it harder, I don't really see what your intended point is/could be, unless it's something wild like "treating racism as exactly analagous, this argument seems crazy; this isn't how racism looks. Therefore, Val's argument was crazy, this isn't how misogyny looks. Therefore Joon wasn't actually misogynist."

(That's unlikely, of course, since your Dumbledore is disappointed and thinks your Harry is racist.)

I don't think you're a moron or incompetent, I just think you executed this poorly if your goal was reader comprehension. There's a distinction there that I think is pretty important.

You're apparently unwilling to comment on what the point of the story is, in spite of all this.

I would urge you to reconsider -- right now we've got a story that's confusing readers. Discussing your intent and how it might be possible to execute better will lead to better reader comprehension and gives you the opportunity to potentially improve as a writer.

Then why haven't you clarified it?

Since the comment I'm replying to and quoting from, there's been another comment that also misunderstands your point, and instead of replying to that with an explanation, you posted more hints trying to get people to tease out the intended message, rather than just coming out and expressing the point you're trying to make.

I get that you're trying to express your point in a way that you think is clever. However, you've already acknowledged that you've failed at that, and we all know what [[https://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/06/16/the-failure-state-of-clever][the failure mode of clever]] is.

Edit to add: To be clear, as I don't want my own cleverness to count against me, I'm not calling you an asshole. What I'm saying is that however much better you think your point will be received due to your cleverness (if compared to the same point, plainly spoken), it will be received that much *worse* by people who fail to realize its cleverness. And every time that you try to resort to cleverness rather than clarity to try to explain your point, you're only going to make your problem that much worse.

#+end_quote

At that point, you'd have to do one of two things. You'd either have to re-evaluate how self-evident your point really is (as any good rationalist should do), or, as most values are derived logically from baser values (e.g. "Pain is, generally speaking, bad!" or "The well-being of the community as a whole is good!") rather than existing at the base level themselves, move to a baser level where your values agree with those of the community and argue that your point satisfies those values better than the community's.

Humans are full of contradictions, and sometimes they don't even realize it; an instance of cognitive dissonance could easily infect an entire community, even one committed to rationality. Especially if it involves a belief commonly held within a culture that the majority of the community belongs to.

On the one hand, I can see your point, given the community rule of "No discussion of U.S. politics whatsoever." On the other hand, I can't see how you would ever expect the underlying point of your story (which seems to be equating Joon's private, visceral, unthinking sexism of feeling protective towards a group *is not* a member of, with a public, premeditated act by Harry to protect only a specific race that he *is* a member of) to be discussed in such a way that it *didn't* become political once that point was teased out. You seem to be equating thought and action as equally culpable, and I'm going to end my post right here before it turns into a diatribe against the Catholic concept of sin that I was raised to believe in.

I got myself in a lose-lose situation through careless commenting (my fault).

There are three main points:

1. The OP has a message (some would disagree).\\
2. The OP reasonably effectively conveys that message (many would disagree).\\

If you grant me points 1 and 2 (even just as hypotheticals), and 3 is evident, then you see how I'm in a bind?

If I say that the message of the parody is obvious when it is not obvious to the audience, then that would unfortunately imply considering them stupid (a horrible move).

If I say that the message of the parody is a highly controversial and unspeakable new political idea, and that is why it is not obvious to the audience, then that would unfortunately imply considering myself exceptional (a horrible move).

There is no good move I can make at this point, except to consider my whole post a failure (which is what I'm doing).

** I was confused too, and here is why:

JS comes from a world where on average there is an asymetry in power between men and women. The women get the short end of the stick, so JS (a man) subconsciously sees women as 'more important to protect'.

HJPEV comes from a world where on average there is an asymetry in power between white people and black people. The black people get the short end of the stick, so HJPEV (a white person) subconsciously sees...white people as 'more important to protect'?

That is where my brain goes 'what?'

I admit that my first uncharitable assumption was that the author was trying to misrepresent what was shown in WtC, and send a weird anti-antisexism message.

I hope it helps.

** I see what you're trying to do but it doesn't really work. I guess because racism is fundamentally different from misogyny, specifically in a way that's highlighted here.

In the real world, racism that consists of only protecting whites (pretty much THE racism that exists) is racism in favour of whites, white pride or whatever, which is disgusting. So this idea elicits a strong emotional response, at least from me. But somehow, in your parody, this is racism AGAINST whites. It's weird.

Also, I don't remember the original text, but Harry Juniper's actions are definitely being strongly affected by his "racism" here.

At it's very basic sexism considers a necessary and familiar part of our society inferior and often revolves around "protecting" them by taking their rights away or returning to "traditional" hierarchies.

Both have elements of both of course, but the weight is often different.
