Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Superheroes are great, and therapy is important. But how often would a superhero be able to go to therapy?

Like, in a world where superheroes are a known and established phenomena, I imagine that the Justice League or Avengers could routinely hire therapists for superheroes in uniform, with appointments paid for by Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark.

But what about worlds where superpowers and the like are virtually unknown, and/or characters that haven't "put on the cape" yet and are trying to keep their powers on the down-low? If they had significant emotional or interpersonal problems, would therapy be justified given the (perceived) risks of:

A) Being insufficiently honest to make effective progress, B) Coming across as highly delusional, C) Saying too much and accidentally outing themselves and others?

*** If the character is willing to be open with the therapist about having powers, the therapist's willingness to believe probably depends on the type of superpower. If it's something that is demonstrable to the therapist, like Minerva McGonagall's ability to turn into a cat, then belief is easy. If it's internal, like many sensory powers, it may not be easy to demonstrate to the therapist, and would be riskier.

**** True, that definitely removes or alleviates concern (B), appearing delusional.

That opens the question, however, of whether that willful exposure is itself a worthwhile risk. In a scenario where the would-be patient wants to remain unknown, I think they would need good reason to trust that "doctor-patient confidentiality" will hold up, airtight, even after the therapist witnesses something completely beyond their prior model of reality (say... an Outside-Context Problem).

****** Duty to report if you are a danger to yourself or others. They don't report someone for being a black belt in lethal martial arts, for having a concealed carry permit, or for having extensive knowledge and practice in the fields of microbiology.

That said, a groundbreaking discovery like the existence of supernatural phenomena might be more important to any given therapist than his professional ethics, so there is always a significant risk if you're someone who can be forced to reveal your powers by a third party. If you can use your powers at will and otherwise appear completely human even under inspection you can always show off only once, when the therapist isn't prepared to secretly record and then trust that the therapist won't be believed without proof anymore than they would have believed them.

***** Yes I'd even go so far as to say every Yamada scene is probably paid by the protectorate.

Yes, I think your primary challenge in therapy by non public capes will come down to trust on a couple of topics: does the cape disclose illegal acts (Vigantilism), does the hero lie and talk around what they are doing, does the hero disclose powers?

If the cape is in an organization with security cleared therapists (The laundry Files) this can be hand waved away and be part of the banality of a story or express the constant psychological cost. I remember reading a passage in the laundry files where a very capable post-doc occultist described their routine for crying between meetings and then getting back on with their day and I don't think anything else quite drove the psychological cost.

If the cape does talk about what they do, with or without powers. They have to be careful, have leverage, or they may run afoul of the therapists responsibility to report someone who is an active threat to others. . . Figuring out what you can and can't say to a therapist, and what a trained observer of how people works get's out of a cape is a potential font of repeated converational tension.

** Just saw The Last Action Hero movie, and it was pretty great. I loved the self referential humor and the writing is really clever and ahead of its time. A lot of jokes felt like something Dan Harmon would write in Community or Rick and Morty. The movie really went all out with its premise (Arnold meeting real life Arnold) and I the move made some rational smart choices - like the villain Charles Dance planning to release villains from other movies. His motivation is very clear - that the real world is the only world where the bad guys can win. And the kid makes rational decisions and observations of what would happen in a real movie

It's a great concept and a lot of potential with that universe in general.

Gold Digger is a slightly-ecchi, somewhat-more-superpowered comic version of Indiana Jones. Array can create multiple bodies of herself, with the minor side-effect that when she dismisses them, she ends up with an extra persona inside her head.

Kumo Desu Ga Nani Ka, aka "I'm a spider, so what?" started as a webnovel, then became a manga, and is now also an anime - each has gotten to a different depth into the plot, and there are a few other tweaks between versions. There's also a silly spinoff manga, "Daily Life of the Four Spider Sisters", in which her mental selves wake up one day in separate bodies, instead of doing the other bizarre things they do in the main story.

Also, I seem to have forgotten to mention; the 90's CGI cartoon I was referring to is called "Reboot".

***** inoreader doesn't require a fee, for starters. The absurdly cheap lowest premium subscription is something like $10/year during the black friday sale.

I don't remember why I left feedly anymore, it was IDK 3+ years ago. I do remember they had some sort of new shitty feature, reduced the amount of free feeds you could subscribe to, or something like that. Whatever it was it broke my workflow enough that I looked for an alternative (or maybe it was a redesign). I can't recall what it was, my use case is pretty typical (I have a lot of feeds, but I don't think an absurd number).

I'm not a salesperson for inoreader so I'm not going to try and recommend the features or whatever. But yeah, I do still really like it.

Switching is virtually frictionless because you can export and import subscriptions, too, so you could just give it a try.

I do prefer paying for online services than having "free" services, in general. (Though I don't have reddit premium so go figure, but in my defense it costs a fortune for what you get). I feel the adification of the internet has made things a lot worse. We have tracking cookies, we have autoplaying videos, etc and we accept them as normal and lovely but paying $10/year for an app you use every day is horrifically expensive when I spend $20 a month having coffee once a week.

For example, I remember on a podcast subreddit someone said I must be crazy rich or bad with money if I spend $20 on patreon subscriptions for ad-free versions of podcasts. But $20 a month on cafe coffee is considered relatively frugal. It blows my mind that we've been culturally "taught" that digital services are "free" and that we don't think that we are the products being sold, we accept it blindly and it means that now if I want to play a game on my phone 95% of the best ones have interstitial ads or gems I can buy or shit like that when what I want to do is pay $5 at the start and have the full game.

*** Depends on how the precog works.

1) Precog through extrapolating from the real world. Precog is surprised and massively confused by looper. His power may or may not recalibrate as the loop runs its course. Looper can defeat him by following original actions and then ambushing precog out of nowhere.

2) Precog knows the future by fiat, but works on linear time only, the loop superceding him. At the start of the loop suddenly all of his predictions change in an unprecedented way. He can see the whole loop, but isn't necessarily aware that it is a loop, so will not hold back. Looper has to use the loop to learn about precog and then defeat him at a start of a loop where precog is most vulnerable and unprepared. This splits into two depending on the precog's spacial awareness.

2a) Precog is aware of his own future and the looper can keep away to confuse him or keep him in the dark.

2b) Precog knows stuff that's happening in the world even if it's unrelated to him, to varying amounts of resolution. At it's most extreme he will immediately know the cause of his sudden change of visions, because at the precise moment it happens there is only one variable behaving differently.

3) Precog is aware of the loop, but still limited by it. Essentially his power works the same as in 2, but instead of seeing some parallel post-loop timeline that will never actually happen in each loop and be fooled by it, he sees his visions cut off at the end of the loop, or some other crazy and unprecedented thing. He might be more prepared for shenanigans and, depending on setting and intelligence, be able to deduce the fact that he is in a loop more frequently and act accordingly (by holding back in timelines that remain within the loop). This one also has the same sections a and b as the previous one.

4) Precog works on overtime. He might or might not know the content of the whole loop sequence itself, but knows everything about the current instance, the fact that he is in a loop and, most importantly, the end results of the last loop and all its consequences. He will fiddle his thumbs during the loop, maybe amuse himself with cryptic communications towards the looper. In the last loop he will do what most benefits him. The looper is as screwed and outmatched as if he weren't a looper at all. Maybe the existence of a loop centered around the looper was all part of the precog's master plan in the first place.

5) Precog knows everything, including the results and consequences of him knowing everything. The universe is deterministic. Nothing matters. There wasn't really ever a fight to begin with.

I think 2 or 3 would make for the most interesting stories for a true contest. That said, given infinite determination and mental endurance the looper will always find the path to victory, if such a path is physically possible.

*** Looping basically allows you to act with precognition, so I would think it would largely depend on how well you can replicate your actions and their consequences. If it's similar to the Groundhog Day loop in that events will proceed down their original path unless severely disrupted, then the looper has basically an eternity to figure out exactly how to get around the precognition. If events proceed chaotically, with events sensitive to even small changes in the initial conditions, then the precog would have an strong advantage in knowing how things are about to happen, where the looper has to guess what happens next. based on previous iterations of the loop.
