** Ah, the interestingly mysterious section is over, and now we begin the dramatically weird section.

Really, the beginning was so fun, I'm sad to leave it :)

Mmmmmaybe? There'll be some mysteries left, for now---___ is not going to explain everything.

But I'll agree that the progression was pretty fast. That is, perhaps, the drawback of the accelerated update schedule. These to chapters might have deserved separate weeks; I'll rethink this for the next week.

I'll admit that both The Northern Caves and the only work of mine that was previously posted here ([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9829580/chapters/22071191][On the Continuity of Consciousness]]) share that narrative structure. Which one tipped you off? :)

**** (Seeing this, I've now finished reading The Northern Caves (the fiction about the fictional book, not the fictional book itself) in one sitting; it was quite interesting, reminding me strongly of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slouching_Towards_Bedlam][Slouching Towards Bedlam]], except with [[#s][]]. Perhaps because of the association, perhaps because of the rather grand language used by the report's author at the start, I found myself anticipating an ending larger in scale than what actually occurred. ([[#s][]]) The concept of the books themselves was very nice, looking back at them and understanding the life experience that they were trying to communicate.)

(It has also been fun to think about the ambiguity of whether [[#s][]].)

(I also find myself wondering about [[#s][]].)

** Some explanations and further notes:

Given the conversation at the end of Chapter 5, I want to note that I finished The Library Unpublished months ago. I had no idea this chapter would coincide with this particular Biweekly Challenge :)

An explanation regarding the author's note at the beginning of Chapter 6 might be necessary. The mentioned "kudos" are ao3's version of "likes", which can be given even without an ao3 account. They tend to increase a story's visibility on ao3 and are a nice way to show an author your support. (Wink wink, nudge nudge.)

For those of you who are WMGing really hard right now: the nested story in Chapter 6 ends at the first horizontal rule, and as soon as the chatlog begins, we are reading The Library Unpublished again.

Lastly, for those who'd like to know where all the fictional works come from: /Aloof Antares/ is mentioned in the manga Akumetsu, in which a teenager dresses up as a superhero and murders corrupt politicians. (It's about as edgy as it sounds, and not very deep.)

Thank you for reading.
