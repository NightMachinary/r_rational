Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I'm trying to make an exhaustive list of ways that someone pathologically afraid of death in the Harry Potter universe might seek their own immortality. Here's what I have so far:

Horcrux

Portrait

Ghost

Diary (traditional, nonenchanted)

Children

Sperm Bank/DNA preservation

Memories of living human beings

Preserved Pensieve memories

Personality overwrites

Clones

Historical impact

Monuments

Contributions to knowledge

Mentoring

Spiritual afterlife/heaven

Caches/time capsules

Time travel

Quantum Immortality

Alternate universes

Deadman's switch if certain unacceptable conditions are met

I'd like to imagine a Voldemort who sticks his fingers in as many pies as possible in order to maximize his impact on the world and make it impossible for himself to be eradicated. Imagine a version of Visser Three from r!Animorphs who's much more vulnerable and so unconcerned with value drift relative to the much more likely prospect of annihilation. Basically take Voldemort's sole defining character trait and turn it up to 11,000, then give him competent opponents and watch what happens. Imagine a Voldemort who murders infants to make redundant Horcruxes, then writes about it in his memoirs, and then goes and gets baptized by the Pope "just in case". The convergence of all these different strategies seems like it'd be really interesting to explore. Which combinations would be optimal? Which would have hidden drawbacks? What else could be added to this list?

*** You left off the philosopher's stone, which is one of the better options if you can get ahold of it. Also unicorn's blood, though we don't have enough details on the side-effects to judge properly.

For the most part, a lot of these depend on specific mechanics that we don't know, so their strength would be up the the whim of a fanfic author. For example: Personality overwrites. Does a spell or ritual or potion or some combination thereof exist that lets you swap bodies with someone while maintaining your mental "self" despite the changed brain structure (or changes it to match your original structure). If so then this would allow you to achieve eternal youth, if not then it wouldn't. Can you transfigure someone's brain into a copy of your own? Or otherwise create a perfect clone of yourself? If so then cloning would be useful, if not then it wouldn't. J.K. Rowling didn't say whether you can or can't, so we don't know.

An important detail we're missing is the effects of the Horcrux. It supposedly splits your soul, but what does that mean? Does it alter your personality? Kill part of your "self"? Do you lose some of your memories, desires, or emotions in the process? If so then it might not be worth doing and maybe you want to rely on the philosopher's stone, or maybe it's worth doing once but doing 7 times turns you into an evil psychopath and doing 20 times turns you into a gibbering imbecile who can't even cast spells anymore, or maybe you can cast it infinitely many times. The specifics determine whether you want to cast it 0 times, or 1 time which you hide extremely well like at the bottom of the ocean or flung into space, or do one at every opportunity and make horcruxes out of random pebbles.

The only things we actually know work in the universe that have people actually use them to obtain immortality are Horcruxes and the Philosopher's Stone, so I'm going to recommend doing both of those, and doing them more cleverly.

*** Have you read HPMoR? Because the that fanfic does play with a few of these (though it has to retcon some things like the way time travel works in canon which is super broken).

It's not. Well... maybe not. I'm not accusing JKR of doing anything brilliant or anything, but there are possible head-cannons that make it work.

******* Yea. There's some debate over how much control authors have (and/or /should/ have) over the canon of "their worlds", especially in regards to incorporating works by other authors.

But in this case, the characters, story, and general plot logic of Cursed Child are so horribly inconsistent (both with itself, and with the rest of the HP series), that I personally can't accept it as canonical and still enjoy the overall series, no matter what Rowling says.

Never read it; and nobody I've spoken to seems to accept it as canon.

*** I feel like a large portion of your list would not be considered immortality by (canon or HPMOR) Voldemort. He is not interested in living forever through his legacy, he wants to live forever by not dying.

I would also not consider clones, quantum immortality and immortality by anthropic principle to be valid ways to preserve my identity, but that obviously depends on your definition of identity and we don't know enough about Voldemort to know what he would think on the topic.

Given that, and provided that getting the philosopher stone is not an option (if it is, that is obviously priority #1), I would start figuring out the exact details of (in this order) horcruxes, unicorn blood, /magical/ diaries, ghosts and paintings to see if any of them provide a useful method for life extension. In a pinch you could see if hacking a pensieve allows you to upload your entire consciousness (instead of just your memories), but even if that works it seems like a very limited existence.

A spiritual afterlife is an interesting one in canon HP (HPMOR Voldemort rejects it out of hand), but if it exists, it is not something that Voldemort will feel he has any control over. If everyone continues to exist after they die that's great, but that doesn't require any action on his part so it doesn't factor into his plans.
