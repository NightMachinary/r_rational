** A daring commando raid by sea monsters! Also resolves a minor sub-plot, gives some background, and finally answers the eternal question 'Why Tokyo?'

*** Hey man, I like your story, and appreciate you bringing it to my attention.

I can't seem to find a table of contents page though. Is there any way you could add one of those, with links to each update in a big list?
