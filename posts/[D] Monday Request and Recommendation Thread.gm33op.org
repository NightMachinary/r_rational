Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Some recommendations:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31919/muds-mission][Mud's Mission]]: I very nearly posted this as a top level recommendation, but due to the weird way that RR works it's actually better to do that on Wednesday or so once the story's released to Trending. Suffice it to say that if you're on this subreddit and you're not allergic to litrpgs you'll probably enjoy it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30380/jayke-cipher][Jayke Cipher]]: another entry in the "litrpg protagonists with unlikely names" genre. Not quite top level post material, but the main character is fairly rational. Does a little bit of the "programming is magic" thing, but I'd like more.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27456/castle-kingside][Castle Kingside]]: I've recommended this before but it just came back from hiatus (maybe). Uplift Isekai, starts out super grimdark but mellows out a little bit.

**** That's true at first, but IMO the MC's poor choices mostly come from the fact that he's in an entirely outside context situation - not only is he in a magical world, he's also /destitute/.

I think the second of these two problems is actually the harder one for the MC to overcome. He starts acting like a storybook thief / beggar, largely because he has no other idea what else he could do. It goes poorly for him.

The parts this subreddit is interested in don't really kick in until the end of the first arc, when the MC has some resources and is more able to act in the middle/upper class professional milieu that he's accustomed to.

But then he chose acceleration over deceleration because "acceleration is better" and, no, slowing down let's you gain/regain control which he's been lacking for 25 chapters, especially since we just saw that he can affect others and his surroundings with the spell. Guess we never got to hear what gets accelerated or accelerated so maybe the spell will still turn out to be worth something.

*** Didn't think Jayke Cipher was very good, within about 3 chapters he's given 3 of the most OP powers ever. So the author either needs to escalate a massive amount or just make him dumb to introduce any tension into the story.

Also the writing seems off to me and reminds me of other bad litrpgs I've read.

*** Thanks for the recommendations. I am reading Jayke Cipher first and while I enjoy the story I do have some complaints.

I find that the protag makes awfully suboptimal decisions. He doesn't write down his code on paper. He doesn't try to store information from his code anywhere. He doesn't use his safehaven properly as a portable hole. He doesn't use that his shields can affect him including giving him flight, cushioning his falls, shoving him inside his safehaven in a pitch, and so forth. He doesn't make any code-analysing code for debugging.

It bugs me that the Coterie supposedly is the peak of arcane research but they don't test on anything related to arcane research during their testing process.

It's also a little unclear to me why the protag keep putting himself in life threatening battles. Even buying that getting into the Coteria is worth the level of risk, there is no obvious reason why he needs to do it now instead of training and examining his code magic until he's actually competent. This is someone who bunkered down for years to avoid the monsters outside.

** The final season of Netflix's [[https://www.netflix.com/title/80179762][She-Ra: Princess of Power]] dropped a few days ago and now that it's complete I would definitely recommend it. It does a fantastic job of developing the characters, in particular the main protagonist and antagonist have a very complicated relationship that I thought was handled really well.

Characters do make stupid decisions on occasion, but it usually feels like an understandable expression of their past experiences/traumas, rather than that they are given the idiot ball for no reason other than to move the plot forward. I'd also say the ending was very satisfying, albeit a bit rushed, in that I think they would have done well with twice as many episodes. On a genre level, they have some interesting twists on common tropes that I found fresh. The world also is a fun mix of magic and technology which blend reasonably well.

All that said, it is a children's show, so the power of friendship is definitely the name of the game. If you've enjoyed other high quality children's shows like Steven Universe, Avatar, My Little Pony, etc. you might enjoy this one as well. If you do decide to watch it, don't google it because there's fairly big spoilers for the final season everywhere right now.

She-Ra has legit friendship magic and somewhat nebulous magical rules.

Avatar does not have friendship magic beyond following a group of kids who trust one another.

Both are kids shows, and do focus on the characters quite Abit more than typical, enough so that you by halfway through the show can guess fairly correctly what someone is going to do.

She-Ra is good, and it ties up it's relationships nicely. I just feel like it's more a 'kids' show when compared to Avatar which is only really kiddy in season 1. Even if both shows avoid blood / gore and the like.

Might be nostalgia goggles, can't really look back on She-Ra yet. Just finished that.

Avatar doesn't have too much friendship magic I remember, but it definitely has some very glaring, fatal plot holes; The two I remember being that the Avatar beats the bad guy AFTER their plan succeeds (which we are told is impossible in the whole series), and that the Avatar's super mode (shining blue thingy) works exactly the way the author needs it and is inconsistent with the plot's description of it.

The low end budget for producing a rational webserial is the only the used time whereas practically every other medium has a high production cost, and while making a story rational by filling in naturally occuring secondary effects from the world and having the characters be consistent has some cost it's not even clear if it would increase the audience.

** I'd like to recommend what I consider the most interesting and clever isekai series I know of. It's called [[https://kitsu.io/anime/juuni-kokuki][12 Kingdoms]], and it's about a woman who suddenly finds out that she was actually the ruler of one of the 12 kingdoms in the other world! She decides to follow the tall attractive guy into the portal, but trips and lands several kingdoms away from her own, having to struggle to eventually make her way towards it. It's rational in the sense that Madoka is rational: it carefully maintains internal consistency, and presents realistic consequences and implications for events, while giving different "ideologies" charitable depictions.

Beyond just being a well-paced and interesting take on the genre, it also:

1. Features likable, humble, and/or interesting main characters.
2. Elaborates on a rich and interesting world.
3. Carefully avoids contrivances to solve plot points.
4. Has the protagonist be rewarded for acting rationally.
5. Has no infuriating tension caused by immature main characters.

Unfortunately, it ends very suddenly and unsatisfyingly, and the plots following the coronation are significantly less interesting, but I still found it greatly enjoyable. The show is currently available on Crunchyroll, although watching anime through alternate means is generally accepted within the community.

** Request: a story that would start (or at least largely take part) in a dynamic similar to the one /Worth the Candle/ will presumably end with.

I want to see a human who has just freshly attained godly power---the protagonist---enter into conflicts with the incumbent Literal Gods of the setting, over the protagonist's attempts to fix the Crapsack World they grew up in, and now rule over.

Sort of like where /Practical Guide To Evil/ arrived at with international geopolitics, but one level higher up, with a lot of True Dweomers and Chosen Paladins being flung around on all sides.

Or, sort of like the third book of the /Crystal/ trilogy, but with the other AI goal-agents being /conservative/ to change (wanting to keep the Crapsack World exactly the way it is, because they /already/ remade it the way they like it a long time ago, resulting in it being what it is now), rather than actively working to make the world fall apart in different ways.

Hopefully as well, the protagonist would have human friends from back when they were human, that they would still rely on and talk to even after becoming a Literal God.

*** I don't know if it's "smart"-ness so much as it is a well-developed sense of empathy. It's kinda like Archchancellor Ridcully vs Granny Weatherwax from Discworld (which happened in /Equal Rites/ IIRC) - Ridcully is canonically very smart, probably smarter than Weatherwax, but he doesn't understand /people/ to the same degree.

I feel like it takes quite a bit of mental yoga to be able to distance yourself from yourself to the point where you can write a self-insert story where, in a very real sense, your SI is not the main character.

Also now that I think of it Companion Chronicles really reminds me of Blade Runner: 2049, another story where the protagonist is not the MC. Especially since "empathy" is one of the thru-line themes of Blade Runner in general.

There was this one ASOIAF SI where the SI takes over the body and memories of Robert Baratheon after he first sits on the throne, and while he could still be considered the main character of the story, what makes ot interesting is that je is never the viewpoint character.

*** For me the what makes the story special is that it's a well done metaanalysis of a genre written such that the characters have depth and relatability, and the protagonist is competent and makes believable errors, while retaining the genre's strength (which in the case of jumpchains to me is progression fantasy, seeing settings and people we know, and solving issues of that universe).

*** Brandon Sanderson is an intelligent author that can actually pull off plot twists, with fair who done it, that intelligent people can't tell from a mile away. His books start slow though.

​

Book of the Ancestors, trilogy is very good. Very far future universe is dying, very few stars left and of those most are old, humans regressed to a middle ages tech. The author is intelligent similar to Brandon, but his other books are very edgy and your mileage may vary with them. Thankfully he puts it on the table right away, so if it isn't your thing you can drop it without wasting time.

​

Other than that, they are hard to find, their distribution follows general IQ distribution and you'd have more luck in other genres like non fiction and scifi.

The MCs ability was the most unusual though : whatever his opponent thinks his ability is. So the MC had to use his brain alot in order to use his power properly. It reminded me of Stands in JoJo and their weird powers.

** I started reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/framework-monsters-legends][Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends]] a while back, and I'm surprised at how competent it is. It's a litrpg/xianxia story with multiple main characters, with proper character development and pretty decent characters overall. The premise is that the system apocalypse happens on Earth, 10 years after which the most powerful 10,000 people are teleported to the Infinite Realms, which is literally an infinite plane (think minecraft). There's much more but it's all explained pretty well in the story. The story starts off with two main characters, Ryun and Zach, who are the two (2) survivors of their Earth (there are multiple).

What I liked about this story is that the power system is very consistent, and the worldbuilding has been thoughtful so far. The characters aren't cardboard cutouts and actually have motivations and personalities. I was a big fan of how one antagonist solved his problems in the end of Ryun's arc, which made sense given his motivations. While the main characters start off OP, it's evident once they arrive on the infinite realms that they're still basically ants compared to the truly powerful people. Overall it's pretty competent, and I recommend.

#+begin_quote
  My favorite Jaune as an MC RWBY fic and one of my favorite romance fanfictions in existence. It doesn't fit the definition of RomCom, but it is a romance story with comedy. It does a great job at providing fun humor while also including well written serious moments. Takes place over a single night and the author does a great job at following beat style romance formula to create an enjoyable flow. No real RWBY knowledge required to enjoy.

  Written by one of my favorite Naruto authors, Written in Reverse is a time travel Naruto fanfic that has a fun twist. It's slice of lifey and a bit unique, but the quality is quite solid and is on the whole fairly entertaining. (The story has a !fem Sasuke if that's a dealbreaker.)

  A very wholesome and happyish rendition of how Minato and Kushina met and became a couple. The author's ability to bring to life Minato and Kushina is commendable. The dynamic and story here is my headcanon about how Konoha and Naruto's parents were like before Naruto was born.

This story is a well put together crossover of How to Train Your Dragon and Frozen. It gets somewhat frustrating/slow at parts, but overall worth a read to the end.

  This is a great fic. The author keeps the story tight and cuts out any fluff. The only real problem the premise is annoying the actual realism of how premise came to be in story is fairly farfetched, but the rest is is fantastic.

  The Fem TR might be a dealbreaker, but I implore you to give this story a chance. Set in a world where TR was a woman, this story is romance between the diary spirit fem TR and HP where they're both the same age, 16. The story focuses on the relationship between the newly, created/born diary TR and a more callous/older Harry Potter. Short and sweet.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote
  I've never watched all the Star Wars movies. I mention this because I recommend this fanfiction without a super fleshed out headcanon of Star Wars. I only know about the prequels through memes and reading the wikis. I'm not sure how well this story depicts the Star Wars universe/characters.

  What I do remember is that is this story was quite enjoyable when I read it two years ago. It makes Anakin's craziness into an interesting, unique plot point. It's not slice of life as the others, but I remember finding the story engaging and well written. (Emphasis on Anakin is crazy, so the resulting romance isn't "normal" by any means.)

#+begin_quote
  Hyouka is my second favorite anime of all time so I'm a bit biased here, but I find this story to be beautiful. It does justice to the characters and their personalities. The story is my headcanon of what happens after their high school life comes to a close. Very poignant and just heartwarming.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6604037/1/Precocious-Crush][Precocious Crush]] - Kick Ass - Long (drags on), but that preteen angst is inspired. Doubles as a kind-of sequel.

If you have non fanfiction recommendations I'd love to hear those. Slice of life romance books are a weird niche that I'm sure exists, but I don't know where they are outside of fanfiction. Books in the romance genre tend to be more drama filled with frustrating cliches and characters acting extremely realistically irrational. Slice of life stories on the other hand tend to avoid romance on the whole.

***** Mmm, original slice of life fantasy romance? That's a hard ask. I've got a soft spot for some classics (Jane Eyre, Jane Austen, Gone With the Wind) but I rarely read the romance genre. Most of the memorable romances for me don't revolve strictly around romance, and they hit different spots (not in everyone's comfort zone).

*Books:*

Farseer trilogy

Stardust by Neil Garman (movie as well for the Hollywood take, it's pretty good - might as well include The Princess Bride pair too)

The Lions of Al-Rassan

Kushiel's Dart series

stuff by Lois McMaster Bujold

The Books of Babel series

The Witcher book series / Kingkiller Chronicles (both are hard maybes)

--------------

*For Japanese mediums:*

Solanin (manga)

14-sai no Koi (Love at Fourteen) (manga)

Spice & Wolf (light novels)

Anything by Mitsuru Adachi is the definition of slice of life-y romance (manga) - H2 and Cross Game are probably my top 2

A few Ghibli/Miyazaki films have a low tone romance (Howl's, Kiki, Whisper of the Heart)

However, there are some lengthy chapters where you have to deal with boring, unreasonable, whiny, or downright annoying perspectives. Sometimes it is a good character in a bad scene, and sometimes it is a bad character. A common flaw between Mistborn, Reckoners, and the Stormlight Archives.

Any multi-perspective story will have viewpoints that the reader enjoys more, and viewpoints that the reader enjoys less. I would say Sanderson does it better than GRR Martin, for instance.

The mechanics of how ajin's work are very consistent and are explored pretty throughly. You have a few less-than-rational characters but they still act as you would expect a real person would. the main character is a rationalist and is pretty much always acting in his own self-interest, and when he isn't he is still acting in a way that furthers his values. I think that it's the most rational manga I've read.

Another comedic take on the genre is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master Template A]], about someone getting reincarnated into a doomed "young master" role rather than a heroic protagonist.

** Just caught up with the Art of the Adept series that starts with [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51279226-the-choice-of-magic][The Choice of Magic]]. The premise is that, in a high fantasy setting, a magical shortcut has made wizards forget the real ins and outs of doing magic. The MC is trained in the older magic, and is set against the king, who benefits from the magical shortcut being the primary way magic is done.

The author is a mediocre writer who has ground out enough fantasy novels at this point that this series is actually pretty decent. The magic system is hard, the main character is effective but set against strong foes, and his powerups come from training, research, crafting, and alliances, which make them feel earned.

Anyway, this isn't Joe Abercrombie, but given the preference for web fiction around here, this sub might enjoy it more than more literary fantasy novels. Give it a shot.

(4.5 stars and ~150 full text reviews, I'd personally give this a 3.5 or so but I tend to be harsh) The main character is kind of awkwardly principled, but once you accept that he's going to take disproportionate risks to save lives (admittedly, perhaps, not the most rational long-term calculation), most of his decision-making process makes sense. Perhaps the biggest lapse is in the first book, where he goes off to fight in a war, but, eh, a 16 year old in a medieval setting probably would do that, and when he does stupid things there are usually consequences. If I had to offer a more serious critique of the book, it would be in the prose...some of the exchanges, especially when the characters are joking, are pretty stilted. But people around here tend to be critical of plot and not of prose, your comment being a pretty strong example. :)

The MC does plenty of suicidal things, he does it so often I lost count, and 90% of the time he's saved at the last minute by a demi god that's somehow his aunt, grandpa or grandma (I know they aren't actually related btw).

And you can imagine that an athropogenic principle is in place...if the character dies, you're not reading about them. But even given those justifications, he's still pretty suicidal. Still, I'd actually suggest this series is a cut or two above what usually gets recommended here.

Seems pretty tautological to say read critical reviews to get critical reviews, and there seems no reason to privilege them without a preexisting opinion about the book. If one went and read Goodreads reviews as you recommended, they'd largely or even overwhelmingly see positive reviews. Honestly, you see more poor reviews of Worth the Candle on sites where it is posted that allow comments, or, say, literary classics on Goodreads, so I wouldn't credit reviews except as judged holistically and in a broader context of who is attracted to posting on a specific book. In general, I'd say gesturing toward Goodreads reviews is pretty low value compared to articulating an opinion yourself, which can, at least, start an interesting back-and-forth.

Pushing back on your strong reaction had little to do with anti-recommending the book, which is fine---it's pretty mediocre unless the premise appeals to you---but the language chosen.

I find that generally you need to read a mix of positive and negative reviews to get a more complete picture of the quality of the work, specially when they are not purposely ordered or positioned.

Controversially, imho the classics don't tend to hold up. They were great works at the time they were written, and serve as a foundation to our modern arts but in and of themselves they aren't incredible compared to what we have today, imho.

On that MC though, Will, god I find it very hard to come up with a word that expresses how stupid he gets in service of the plot. It's just too much, he crashes a royal wedding where the guards are prepared for him ffs, it's suicidal to a point he actually dies and needs to be revived by a demi god.

I can't count how many times thought: Stop this MC, go home it takes only 30 mins and nobody can track you, read your master's books, learn some spells, get prepared first. Don't spit on the kings face when you only know one spell, stop this murder hobo crap.

Leave this country, go somewhere safe you can cross the continent in 6h, do a training montage, build yourself up before you do this. It's not as if there was any reason to rush, he had plenty of opportunity to train or prepare, but no he needs to pick fights and cause trouble non stop for no reason other than plot.

For instance, this may be controversial, but Brandon Sanderson is better than Tolkien in pretty much every aspect, imho. Not necessarily because his brain is exceptionally large, but because he's standing and building on the shoulders of giants like Tolkien and others that came after him.

Also authors from earlier times tend to have very harmful worldviews like racism, sexism, homophobia etc. I don't judge their inherent characters on their views because of the times they lived in, but at the same time I'd be hard pressed to read a modern writer with those opinions, and I don't think it's fair for them to get an exemption from that just because they lived earlier.

********** Seems likely that we value different things in our literature. Tolkein has an incredible knowledge of actual folklore and linguistics, if you're familiar with those traditions what he's created is shockingly rich, and he's a miles better prose stylist than Sanderson, who can at best be described as workmanlike. Tolkein would have been notable just for his scholarship even if he'd never written a word of fiction, his essay on Beowulf is commonly assigned. I think even Sanderson wouldn't agree that he's better than Tolkein, that seems like a difficult assertion to support, but I can certainly understand preferring him to Tolkein if you have certain tastes.

I think you're right that lit tech (for lack of a better term) does improve over time, for a certain value of improve. What the past has to compensate is an extremely beneficial form of survivorship bias. If people are still reading something from a long time ago, there's a reason, and there's something in it to be appreciated. That doesn't mean you'll appreciate it, but it does mean there's something there. Fully appreciating a lot of period literature often asks for some background or experience in reading similar works, and that's a big up-front cost that many are not willing to pay. I doubt many on this sub enjoy, for example, Pride and Prejudice, but it's essentially a perfect novel. What this sub has built as a framework, and what it enjoys, is pretty orthogonal to what makes it perfect, and rich, and valuable.

There's a two cultures thing (C.P. Snowe) going on here. I'm stuck in two worlds, a humanist tradition and a technical tradition (I'm a humanist and also a programmer). My humanist friends and colleagues, reading the stuff enjoyed here, would think it was unadulterated trash. My programmer friends and colleagues, or many here, think that the broader literary tradition is posturing, or irrelevant. I can model both internally, which makes a lot of situations painful if I'm wearing the wrong hat. The humanists feel awkwardly limited in many contexts, and you all feel awkwardly limited in others. I kind of want to smack you all with the humanist mackerel, and crack the humanists over the head with the slender wand of technical understanding. But, though I could not and will not give up either tradition, being steeped in both is hard enough that I don't really wish it on anyone. IN genral, as people age, they tend to get a little more into the humanist frame of mind, so maybe this will be a thing for some of you. Or not.

That's where I'm coming from, anyway.

Obviously he wouldn't it, he'd be mocked if he did even if he was objectively correct. Even an interesting discussion about it can't usually be had, If only both had been contemporaries. But then people would just cop out with 'you can't objectively evaluate art or assign it higher comparative value to it' or some variation of the cliche that artists and critics often use to avoid objectivity.

One of the things I'm most grateful for in our western culture is our reduced levels of ancestor worship, which is one of the behaviors likely explain our tendency of overvaluing older artists over new ones.

This ancestor worship has, imho, very little value of any kind to individuals or society in general.

Can you tell how religious that sounds? Likely there's not 'something' or 'anything' there. But just this assertion is extremely controversial and hard to be made, because the idea you hold can't be criticized. This is, imho, the reason why this tendency continues.

You can't argue against the idea, because the general response is "then you're wrong / ignorant / blind, hmph, you uncultured swine" or some variation of it and so the flawed worldview continues and is never dispelled.

It's a bad idea, that can't be killed or argued against, that serves little purpose other than employing literature teachers and justifying the actions of the unlucky people that were caught by it.

This entire tendency is uncomfortably similar to religion and likely survives with similar tactics. Evolutionary psychology, and many flawed heuristics and biases probably underline this behavior, but I'd need an entire article to properly articulate the idea without people being able to poke holes into it.

There's also not only a much larger number of people alive today, but also a higher rate of education, and knowledge. Which statistically almost guarantees that the best artists we have today are better than most that came before. There's more people in china than native english speakers, statistically all things being equal, there's likely better literature being produced and consumed in china, india, and the rest of the world than what we ever going to be exposed to..

PS. These old artists we're talking about held a myriad of very offensive and unacceptable ideas and views. People that if were alive with the same opinions today would be worst than most neonazis. It makes very little sense to worship, venerate or to put them in any sort of pedestal. We can and should appreciate their contributions, innovations, history, and work but that's about it.

And, when thinking that way, the most sensible thing to do is judge literature relative to the moral norms of its time, just as we judge present literature by the moral norms of the present. In fact, I'd say this is one of the main advantages of literature from the past---it contextualizes social trends and fashions, and gives you the occasional glimpse of how posterity might see us, based on how we read posterity.

I think you're reading what I'm saying as "stuff from the past is good." Really, that's not the case. Most stuff from the past is crap, and we've rightly forgotten about it. If there's nothing to regard in literature from the past, people don't read it or remember it. And there's a lot of past literature, and little time to read and study it, so the standards are pretty high. Really, my statements are more about the contemporaneous filtering process working on a huge corpus then they are about past literature as a whole. I think you didn't really address this point, or misconstrued it as just thinking that stuff from the past is great, which is a strawman, and obviously untrue.

If anything, there's a huge bias toward the present in the present. People consume enormous amounts of news, almost all of which is euphemera and won't be revisited. 95% of the bestsellers of this year will be forgotten in ten years. Creators have to churn out constant new content or be cast aside by algorithms and a public hungry for the new. Reading stuff from the past is uncomfortable, and that's partly why it's valuable.

************* Let me start by saying I don't disagree with any of the statements you've made there. You seem to have assumed I was talking more generally, when I was arguing against the argument or idea I presume you hold.

​

My main starting points were, my perception that you overvalue Tolkien, with one of the main reasons being, from what I can tell, the fact that he is from a historical time and therefore has some prestige current authors still don't.

​

Second as you got more broad in your comment with historical literature and the perception of a non measurable characteristic some of them have that inherently puts them into a higher quality tier than things of equal or superior qualities we currently have.

​

I addressed this idea broadly, and argued against the idea itself rather than the people that hold it. Addressed how the idea propagates, it's utility or lack thereof and the methods it defends itself with.

​

Then I expressed concerns over the solipsism english literature scholars tends to have. And gave evidence against it.

​

Lastly, I gave a nominal argument against consumption of content made by people that think or thought black people are inferior, or women are only fit to breed in a more concise less explicit manner.

​

The main thing I was interested in following up on, that I thought up after commenting was: Did you notice that you had no points in favor of Tolkien vs Sanderson other than better prose and other slightly notable traits that are not necessarily related to his literary work ?

​

That's interesting to me, you seem 100% sure Tolkien is inherently better, but the best points you can come up with is his prose, knowledge, and the tendency of some of his tangential work to be assigned to students, which only happens because he's now a historical figure.

​

On that note though, I find english prose lacking in general because I see it as a semi creole language. Which after some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English_creole_hypothesis][googling]] seems to be a discussed hypothesis among linguists, I doubt many english linguists like the idea though given the implications. It's one of the main reasons most foreign works don't translate well into english the language is too streamlined.

​

The only other point I'd like to make in response is, personally I tend not to read new releases. I find it more productive to wait 3-5 years, so the actually interesting, relevant and useful content can be filtered out.

************** All right, though the general case seems the interesting branch of the conversation here. I don't think I have the elevated opinion of Tolkein that your'e assuming I do. There are plenty of contemporaneous writers who could go toe-to-toe with Tolkein, though perhaps not along the extremely specific dimension along which he's hyperdeveloped. Confining myself to science fiction and fantasy, LeGuin is a better prose stylist, Bakker wrestles with bigger ideas, and Delangy engages pretty damn powerfully the issues of identity that you brought up in your post. It's a little pointless to compare writers directly in general terms, but there are few areas where Tolkein couldn't be matched up to a contemporary writer and come off the worse.

Tolkein gets to be remembered because he made an extremely credible case that the embarrassing parts of stories, the parts the facy pants you dislike so much in the literary establishment like so much, are critical and important. He makes that case explicitily in Beowulf: the Monsters and the Critics, and LoTR extends that case by creating something that has the weight of that tradition, gives it the cast of what was going on at the time (WWII), and making it all work. The fact that LoTR is legible at all, in the sense of the culture making heads or tails of it, is genius. That kind of work leaves a mark, one way or another, if you remotely know what you're doing, you have to deal with that tradition...reject, embrace, extend, condemn, whatever. So Tolkein isn't just a writer in isolation, partly you read him because writers working in that tradition that come after are responding to him, and knowing what they're responding to enriches the whole enterprise of reading fantasy, and to a lesser extent some other contemporary genres. But you also read it at least int he case of Tolkein, because iit really holds up The struggle with the ring, the pastoral vs. industrial setting, the memorable and now archetypical characters (Frodo, Gandalf, Gollum, maybe Aragorn/ Boromir), that stuff speaks to people and speaks about things that matter and will continue to matter.

Sanderson is just not that. He doesn't even stack up to his contemporaries, and if you think he does, you might be missing out on some really good fantasy. Abercrombie writes more memorable characters. Rowling writes really tight, Wodehouse-esque plots. Erikson does better worldbuilding. (Sanderson doesn't really do history or anthropology, and it makes elements in his words feel shallow.) Kay writes stuff that coheres around strong themes. Almost all of these people (maybe not Erikson...) write better prose. Sanderson does excel at crating a system, sticking to it, and playing it out in the plot, and I like that, but he'd need to shore up in many areas to go toe to toe with his contemporaries, let alone Tolkein, who broke all this ground in the first place.

It doesn't really matter for any of this, but Tolkein doesn't really have a ton of cachet in academic literary studies, though that may or may not be changing. He still has reputation as a medievalist. I'd recommend the essay I mentioned above, you can read it here, if you take a notion, though it seems fairly likely you'd hate it. :) But he's actually making a case against the snobby readings you dislike.

*************** I don't know where I stated I dislike 'fancy pants' literature, for you to repeatedly imply that I do. Personally I'm neutral towards literature in general, although I do prefer non fiction, what I'm criticizing is it's tendency of overvaluing past authors over better or equal current ones.

​

I've read most of those authors, Sanderson and Tolkien are just what came to mind at the time and became the subject of the discussion. I may be elevating Sanderson because the last book of his I read was fantastic and fresh on my mind, you could be doing the opposite though.

​

Tolkien is and will continue to be overrated in scifi fantasy circles, imho. Your points failed to convince me, because they were mostly unrelated to his works but focused on influence and other factors that don't correlate with their quality.

******* Haven't read the series in question, but generally speaking, while hard magic system, progression, research, etc. /are/ common aspects of fiction that this sub tends to enjoy, idiot ball carrying, plot armor, and deus ex machina are literally antithetical to rational fiction. Avoiding those things is the entire point. Those other things are nice, they make it easier to avoid the bad habits by having strict rules and allowing the reader, if sufficiently careful and motivated, to predict the kinds of solutions the MC might employ. But they are absolutely secondary to having a character who makes decisions that make sense with who they all (this DOES NOT always mean smart decisions), as opposed to decisions that are just to further the plot, that solutions should not appear out of thin air, etc.

******** It's not even a hard magical system, the limitation is spells use mana, but the MC doesn't care about it because he can just absorb mana from the environment passively to a degree so high it makes him almost immune to hostile magic.

​

It's not brandon sanderson, that has rules or anything. It's just generic magic where mana has a different name and spells can do basically anything with enough mana. It's more structured than lower quality stuff, where magic is often the deus ex machina, but it's not a 'hard magic system', maybe medium, but not hard.

******** Sure. But this thread isn't specially for rational fiction, but for things this sub might enjoy. If i'd posted this book as a top-level, the pushback would seem to be highly warranted. If this thread were only rational fiction, it would be quite short, and likely the same few items every time.
