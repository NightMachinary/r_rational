** I'm trying to figure out how the hell Harry does anything from here.

I mean, I assume Quirrelmort makes sure that the wizard side wins the Muggle War through use of some plot or another, but everything is occurring on a level that seems much above that which Harry is capable of operating on without Quirrel's help, as he had in Azkaban or some of his other escapades.

Many of his already revealed powers have either been rendered obsolete, or eclipsed by other things, and everything has escalated incredibly quickly to the point where he either needs a lot more information and power, really fast, or he's going to become functionally irrelevant.

Which ones are you thinking of? Partial transfiguration is still useful. Destroying / controlling dementors is becoming less useful by the moment. His various tech tricks (batteries for breaking shield walls, armor for blocking stunners, skateboards, etc) are still useful although less so against adult wizards with real power and Apparate ability.

(Not being snarky here; honest question.)

**** Dementors/Patronus, though the instant communication is useful, it's actually objectively worse then muggle communication because of the limits on transmitters. Partial transfiguration is at best a 'personal scale' power, without any current uses on the larger scales. None of his other tricks would work on competent mages (which seems to be, at the least, what he has to compete with now for effectiveness).

I think the main problem is that the conflict levelled up, but Harry hasn't (yet) - his powers are still 'strong' in the context of schoolyard fights, not world wars.
