** Which is interesting because I'm halfway through the next chapter.

I'll take the opportunity to ask for some reactions and comments on the story so far. I have my own complaints with some problems related to pacing, structure and flow, mostly caused by a lack of planning and forethought on my part, but does anyone else have anything to say about what aspects and parts of the story work for them and what don't?

I'll try to put some more thought into the next arc as well as come up with a more consistent and slower update schedule. Twilight still has a lot to learn.

*** I don't really have the time ATM to make a thorough review beyond the usual "Awesome, thanks for the past and future of this fic".

One thing I'd like to say is that you should seriously consider making the latest chapter the official last one of the fic, with the next part either the epilogue or the first chapter of the sequel, rather than extending on into a second arc of the first fic. There's quite a few readers who prefer reading completed fics, mainly due to the prevelance of dead fics.

Other than that, there's plenty of room to see side-stories featuring a pair of the post-test ponies, put into a situation where their respective tests are at odds with each other, especially considering that's the next major step in becoming more rational, learning to balance the different lessons rather than treating one of them as more important than the rest.

And by side-stories, you mean the slice of life episodes from Season 1, which were all /exactly like that/.

***** Yup.

You saw through my cunning plan to get more fics which taste like the early seasons.

****** Since those are the ones in which the main characters got continuously driven out of their minds and into the realms of screaming madness, I'm pretty cool with this.

**** I have been wondering myself whether to continue with a single story or divide the different arcs into separate fics. One the one hand, it makes for shorter, more complete experience. On the other hand, switching costs. So not sure yet.

The ponies will be learning economics, not rationality specifically, although the question of rational behavior is certainly a part of economics and one Twilight rant about at some point.

*** As someone without a background in economics, I would appreciate annotations going into more detail about how the tests relate to principles of economics. That or just a list of relevant keywords readers could search for. I had a general idea of what you were going for with each chapter, but I was curious to get a deeper understanding.

**** There wasn't much economics presented in those chapters, which weren't themselves very well thought-out. Perhaps I should have had Twilight go on a monologue about how when ponies can create trust they can find ways to achieve their goals simultaneously, or how misinformation can break down cooperation. On the other hand, boring. Tough balance to strike, probably didn't find the optimal point.

*** I do like the snark about how Twilight's kinda evil for being an economist. It speaks to the part of me who has received Pavlovian training from Tyler Cowen and Robin Hanson that when someone calls himself an economist I should shoot to kill.

**** Where does it say that Twilight is evil for being an economist?

Anyone who has met Tyler, as I have, can attest to how kind and warm he is. It is clear from the article that he is not advocating war but presenting an argument instead about how war can force governments to make decisions that promote economic growth. Calling it evil doesn't address his empirical claim. At the same time, it is hardly sufficient to justify a war, as Tyler would be the first to tell you.

I am now torn between updating my views of Tyler Cowen, and wondering at the sheer power of ideology to make people say and believe things that are pretty blatantly evil or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Stagnation][just plain wrong]].

Well, it does portray Twilight as a little bit more of a cold, aloof official than she actually was in Season 1.

**** Yeah, thirteen-year-old me had a similar idea. When does Mr. Cowen turn 14?

I jest.
