** This "psychic" is probably Mewtwo, right? His ability to lie perfectly to Sabrina using partitions was mentioned before, as well as him interacting with a number of psychics and psychic Pokémon. The question is how did Sabrina find out? Since he is a perfect liar, Sabrina shouldn't have known this unless he told her himself.

It also makes sense that she was seeing him over the course of his life, as he developed his abilities and learned, so from her perspective previously she may have gotten fragments of deeper feelings before his shield was perfected and now she no longer does, leading her to suspect he may be perfectly shutting her out.

**** I try to imagine what I'd do if I was Sabrina, with a student possesing a unique power that might upset the social fabric of psychics.

I don't think her response matches that scenario. Why wait several months, then announce the problem to my students, including the affected student?

It's much more likely she just learned about the problem and that it isn't any of the students. It might not be Mewtwo either.

If Sabrina noticed a secret of Mewtwo's that he had kept hidden--that is, something she should know about with her powers but found out about some other way--that neatly explains her suspicion and her lack of certainty in the ability.

** Awww shit something happened with Mewtwo, the timing of the emergency and her realization of M2's deception line up too well.

The obvious guess is Mewtwo escaped, which'd explain why Sabrina's on a mission of undetermined length, but this'd be a strange priority when the superweapon's out of the cage. Perhaps Mewtwo /attempted/ escape or otherwise showed total unreliability, and Sabrina's tasked with probing M2's mind or running psychic interference or something?

(Also it's unclear why Sabrina thinks Mewtwo has some theoretical perfect shield, isn't "Mewtwo's a way stronger psychic than me" enough of an explanation?)

Yep. Mewtwo is the first and only psychic Pokémon who can both merge his mind with a human, /and/ doesn't need to obey command and has independent intelligent thoughts. So maybe the Cinnabar Lab won't expect this reversal.

  It's interesting that most of the psychics are teenagers, though
#+end_quote

Besides Rei likely being older like you pointed out, I thought Tatsumaki would be 28 like she is in OPM. She's just short.

Checking the chapter plenty of their ages were mentioned, so listing them out it's:

Daniel - 16

Tatsumaki - mid twenties (28 in OPM)

Satori Komeiji - 15

Rowan Donkerk - early twenties

Jason Grey - late teen

Rei - the "most senior student in both senses of the word" so probably over 28

Counting Red that makes 4 teenage students, and three adult students. (wait I actually don't remember if in this story trainers start their journey at 10 or older, but for some reason it's in my head that Red is 13. Is that right? which chapter was his birthday.)

We also don't know if Sabrina's students study under her forever, she could have had other students in the past who studied for a few years then went on to do something else. Daniel is the second newest student (behind Red) at one year, so everyone else has been a student for at least a year.

*** To me it seemed a lot like either; 1 that the ability to develop psychic abilities peaks at a certain point/it's easier to develop mental powers while the brain is more elastic or 2 that for the most part adults either don't have the time or are just straight up unable/unwilling to spend the amount of time doing the self development stuff. At the same time it makes a lot of sense that someone who was a functional person without needing to heavily develop their psychic abilities might just not be willing to develop a skill that potentially endangers their already functional life. Or at least so that there aren't the fear or paranoia around having someone you thought you knew turn out to be psychic after all the time that you might have known them.

​

Conversely it might be that there's a limit to how much a teacher might be able to teach a given psychic in the first place and that for the most part her former students might be given some kind of foundation and then left to self-study afterwards. meaning that while there can be older students that just as a matter of timing that most of the people that were being taught at the time that Red is were on the younger side because older people might have already had the opportunity to be taught. But who knows really.

*** Simplest answer is that, the level of proficiency required to make a comfortable living in the private sector is relatively low so most psychics old enough to be expected to support themsleves would rather just take the job babysitting corporate secrets than continue their studies. It may also be that one or both of the teacher or employer expect a level of loyalty incompatible with doing both (for example you employment contract prohibits letting another psychic into your mind where they might see the secrets you were hired to help protect, but your teacher insists the only way to learn how to resit is to practice).

** I mean on the one hand there's obviously a lot of differences in terms of the developmental history and the associated slang with it, between our timeline and the hypothetical one happening here, but man it seems like Daniel really means "normie" rather than normal, that and while there hasn't necessarily been that much evidence to suggest that being Psychic has a correlation with a mental disorder I would certainly think there might be if I knew someone that acted like he did. Especially knowing his prodigal status and potential 'genius.' Also while the rest of the chapter certainly does not suggest that it is Red that Sabrina is talking about the mention of partitions and the distancing of the internal thoughts and outer surface layer thoughts, that was definitely my first thought. But is most likely Sabrina being called in as Giovanni's resident Psychic expert.

​

But jokes aside it's nice to see them working on the ranch, it's also really cool to see the differences in approach from the other student Psychics than Red where we see them i dunno almost like a group of parkour-ers or skaters or some kind of athlete doing the thing and Red's more theory based approach. It's also an interesting way to see prejudice/racism from the group of psychics, especially given that we've previously seen the mentions of the prejudice against Dark trainers. Granted at the same time it makes a lot of sense that even surface level mind readers would be good at turning public opinion against a group that causes them disadvantages.

​

I also really enjoyed the talk between Red with/out his partition and that for the most part from the outside he's not unrecognizable and that to large degree it feels like a natural extension of the kind of, not-trouble shooting, or really rubber duckying but like a more personafied devil's advocate type thing. Not quite the whole uhh you know angel and devil on the shoulder but more of an introspective type thing around not being sure about how to deal with emotions. Like it makes sense to me that Red has that kind of grief, like a vein through his entire self from the sudden loss of his father when he was young leaving him kind of vulnerable to another shaking of that kind of situation cause it clearly pings of that deep seated pillar that he's kind of had to build around. Like both Red's have a point the more surface Red has to live in the kind of world where people die all of the time i mean we hear about another smaller even that probably has casualties in this chapter, and Green even says that she was comparatively sheltered to that exposure to death, and that Red lives in a world where everyone pretty much just keeps moving forward and that in a reductive sense that he can't really just go to pieces and not move on from his grief. Conversely suppressed Red has the very valid point that he hasn't really dealt with his grief or even his ongoing conflict with Blue and just keeps shoving them forward and its not like they're just going to solve themselves, for the most part of course i mean in my personal experience of grief i'm certainly not as debilitated as i was the day or even the half a year after but that's after like nine years and it's a different situation that someone who basically keeps re-experiencing that first i dunno day or so after the event. I mean it's not clear how much time he's spent with the partition down but it doesn't feel like weeks of time cumulatively i mean it doesn't feel like that many days of the partition being down but he does mention that when training that he would sometimes be unable to do anything but lie around afterwards so i guess over the months of training it added up. but even weeks isn't necessarrily that much time when so much of it seems to non-contiguous.

** Hmm, lots of thoughts here.

​

First off, I must be confused, like, in what way is Red's partition not already a 'perfect shield', insofar as it would cause mind reading to be wrong? That is:

​

Mind Reader: Are you planning on sitting down and crying today?

Future Red: Nope! That would be stupid and unproductive.

Mind Reader: He is telling the truth.

Future Red: Hmm, I need to relax my partition for a sec for a reason.

Past Red: Bwaaah!

​

I can think of two reasons the partition is imperfect. The first is that it can be sensed, and the second is that it only changes values, not knowledge of facts. That is, past & future Red know the same things, and also psychics can detect the partition. Presumably the 'perfect shield' that Sabrina is worried abut has fixed one or both of these flaws.

​

The other fascinating question is how Sabrina has a 70% confidence that the perfect shield exists. It's easy to imagine ways to get a 100% confidence, but 70% implies to me that something has happened that strongly implies a perfect shield, but other explanations exist. ie:

​

Psychic: Will you steal the Master Ball?

Guy: No

Psychic: Checks out

Phone: We have your loved ones!

Guy: Yoink!

​

If they don't know about the phone above this would look like perfect shield, someone concealed their evil intentions through a screen, and wouldn't have had any detectable partitions. I expect that these kinds of things are the 30% that she's leaving.

​

As far as a guess as to what is going on, Mewtwo is the obvious suspect for any psychic phenomenon. It strikes me as very interesting that they don't think of psychic pokemon as having consciousness of the same kind as people do. If that's true, and Mewtwo is a chinese room (or simply so foreign that he looks so to human psychics, since we've had chapters from his POV), he may have the 'perfect screen' kind of deal.

​

I haven't played the original game in a long time, does Mewtwo have any moves that only he has that sound basically like mind control? If so, that would be my guess, with his puppeteer power playing the part of the phone call above, which makes Sabrina worry about a perfect shield.

**** This comment made me look for myself if there were any moves I might consider "mind control" in the game.

I'm tempted to argue that Imprison and Disable is really weak mind control, but it is negative mind control rather than positive. Making people not do things instead of do them.

Instruct and Encore are more like mind control, but maybe are just brain short circuits that force you to redo previous thoughts and actions.

All these (except Imprison) seem to have a common relation in that they all rely on manipulating the targets most recent thoughts/actions. That feels like it might be meaningful... Somehow...

A lot of fairy moves are kind of mind controlly, or at the very least thought-implanting, but that feels less relevant.

**** Maybe Keiji is from Mob Psycho 100? I'm not familiar with the show, but there is a (deceased) psychic with that name in it.

If so, there is a higher-than-background chance that Sabrina's second and third die horribly.

However, Jason and Keiji aren't exactly uncommon names. These characters could easily be original. I suspect the same about Rei, despite the possible Star Wars reference.

Going further, even if the names come from famous fictional psychics I hope that they get characterizations that differ from their source material. I think uniqueness is likely. Red Verres has some things in common with Harry from HPMOR, for example, but he is definitely his own character.

** The comment about Joy only having one eye now made me wonder whether organ transplantation for Pokemon could've been possible. It took me looking into the idea to realize we don't have the technology to connect something as complicated as the optical nerve yet - kinda obvious in hindsight, since that would mean solving blindness fundamentally. (Partial transplants are possible depending on the part, and research on whole-eye transplant appears to be ongoing.) But at least, in the Pokemon world, containment technology should make most of the storage, preservation and transportation of organs much easier.

I noticed the references, but only got Tatsumaki and Satori right.

Also wanted to suggest calling Past Red "Dammed Red", drawing from the comparison Red made last chapter about how his powers work by "damming" certain parts of his neurological activity. And for the wordplay. But I guess "Dammed" Red applies more to Present Red, since he's the version that exists when the partition's up.

In particular, a plot hole during the pewter city arc that disappointed me greatly. Specifically:

-As part of the negotiations with Ranna, she must be allowed to prepare herself so no one can take advantage of her after being night shaded

-Blue is, as far as I'm aware, is dark minded and Red decides to have him escort his spinarak for the experiment.

Considering the whole point of the arc was them not getting exactly what they want on their first tries, I was fully expecting something to come out of this. Otherwise, how did a psychic prepare herself for a dark mind that have superstitions surrounding them about how unpredictable and deceitful they are based solely on how psychics can't probe thier minds at all?

**** I don't think that satisfies the problem.

A. The camera is a layer of protection that Red controls. Ranna, in the negotiations, is explicitly demanding protections she controls as she presumably doesn't want to rely on Red for her safety. This quote, "The trainer will have to subject themselves to checks I deem necessary", already heavily implies mind probing.

B. Kanto is established as the most superstitious region and Pewter City a town where religion has enough political power to hinder and meddle with scientific research and advancment. Blue himself is ashamed of his typing and keeps it secret, being revealed is likely to tarnish the oak name instead.

I personally saw three ways this could of gone

1a. She suspects foul play and accuses Red and Blue of it. The arc ends in a downer ending as they all stumble on their first obstacle of their ambitions as the angry mob runs them out of town.

1b. She sees it more as an unfortunate mistake that Red cannot control and simply refuses Blue as is. Red mcgyver's a solution to still get spinarak tested or worst case fails to complete his report.

   2.  It is revealed that psychics are ironically more tolerant of dark typing than the average kantonian and has an alternate means of protection . 
#+end_example

Blue ends up being the offended party as he is both exposed and possibly humiliated depending what the alternative protection is. Drama occurs but for the most part the story moves on that same path it currently is on.

  A. The camera is a layer of protection that Red controls. Ranna, in the negotiations, is explicitly demanding protections she controls as she presumably doesn't want to rely on Red for her safety. This quote, "The trainer will have to subject themselves to checks I deem necessary", already heavily implies mind probing.
#+end_quote

It's not, actually, it's a camera that's in her office and streams to her storage. Red collects a copy of it along with the data, but there's nothing stopping her from accessing it if someone acts against her. She could even check it daily and erase her memory of doing so; keep in mind that she's not actually unconscious from any of the attacks, just vulnerable.

#+begin_quote
  B. Kanto is established as the most superstitious region and Pewter City a town where religion has enough political power to hinder and meddle with scientific research and advancment. Blue himself is ashamed of his typing and keeps it secret, being revealed is likely to tarnish the oak name instead.
#+end_quote

It would be /incredibly/ unprofessional of her to reveal this information, both from the angle of her position and that of the agreement she made with Red. Even if she is superstitious enough to believe that the 11 year old Blue Oak is going to try and attack her just because he turns out to be Dark, the likely worst case scenario would just be to politely refuse. There's no realistic scenario I can imagine where she doesn't come out at least as tarnished as Blue by spreading rumors about him.

** Finally caught up and now I can follow the reddit posts which are far more active than the website! Yay! Patreoned too. Now I am going to go backwards through all the reddit posts, and also spam a bunch of questions here.

- Is it not definitely Mewtwo in Misty's cave? I assumed every Mewtwo chapter was in the past and Misty's chapter about the cave with her second was roughly present, meaning Sabrina was tasked by Giovanni recently to figure out his mental shielding thing since there's nothing else she can do to help him. But if it's not him in the cave, then they still have him on the island and that would make more sense on why she's bringing this up with her psychics now: because they just realized he's got a perfect mental shield.
- Vermillion's latest T3 caused about 7,000 deaths and was the lowest T3 (or lowest Stormbringer incident?) on record. So say 10k is more common, and they happen once every two years or so. That's nothing compared to cancers and heart disease. That's even less than deaths from car crashes in the US. Looking at deaths from hurricanes, it seems to match the worst of those. Catching the legendaries seems like a drop in the bucket of death causes given this perspective, given modern day people aren't particularly threatened by natural disasters.
- Red seemed to make a lot of progress on his own with his powers, but months later he's made very little. Hmm.
- Teleports: My understanding is that teleports can only move one person at a time, and can be /from/ anywhere but can only be /to/ an "outdoor" area that's predetermined except in very rare cases. Is that correct?

Nope, it's definitely not.

#+end_quote

Yep, though those diseases are not issues in the pokemon world due to their advances in medicine. Also keep in mind that the pokemon world's human population is /much/ smaller than our's... I would guesstimate it's somewhere around 1/4 as populous.

#+begin_quote
  Red seemed to make a lot of progress on his own with his powers, but months later he's made very little. Hmm.
#+end_quote

It's not months later, the timejump was ~4 weeks. His progress mostly involved getting a lot better at sensing people's emotions and thoughts with casual observation and better merging with his pokemon, as well as some more control over his partition.

#+begin_quote
  Teleports: My understanding is that teleports can only move one person at a time, and can be from anywhere but can only be to an "outdoor" area that's predetermined except in very rare cases. Is that correct?
#+end_quote

One person at a time, yes. From outdoor only, not from anywhere. To outdoor only, and it's predetermined unless you're a psychic who can fully merge with your pokemon: then it's anywhere you've been that you've set a mental anchor to with your pokemon.

**** Thank you for the quick response!

I had to madly CTRL+F through about thirty chapters (which is what I was trying to avoid by asking) before I found this from Ayane in ch43:

#+begin_quote
  “I don't recall that experiment being done. But a pokemon can *teleport from inside a building*, so surely it cannot be a case of being simply unable to pass through walls?”
#+end_quote

That's why a lot of readers thought Aiko might have survived, but you're saying Pokemon can't do that anymore. Is there a detail I'm missing?

Followup: Why make it so dark people can't teleport? If normals can do it, I'd expect dark people could too.

***** Ah thanks for catching that, I'll edit it to make it more clear: keep in mind the context of the conversation is what counts as "inside" for teleporting, like does it need all 4 walls and a roof. She was saying that pokemon can teleport "from" inside without as many restrictions as "to."

****** Why not? A normal non-psychic person just tells an Abra "Register teleport" and the Abra who has a nose and ears and knows the person there is their owner/trainer registers that location. Then later the person pulls out that Abra and gives the command "Teleport" and they both poof to the destination. If an inanimate bag can be teleported, I don't see why a dark trainer can't be teleported.

I understand that dark people and pokemon cannot have their minds read and are immune to mental attacks because their mind is like a void to pyschics in the same way you can't read the mind of a sack of rocks. But you can still telekinetically throw a rock at a dark person or pokemon in the same way you can telekinetically throw a rock at a sack of rocks. So if the Renegade on Mt. Moon could give his Abra a sack of rocks to teleport, it could probably also teleport a corpse, and that's where my confusion begins of why it can't teleport a living dark trainer. Registering and commanding the teleport doesn't require psychic powers. It's not like dark trainers are invisible to psychic pokemon; just their mind is invisible.

I'm fine with dark being a disability socially and functionally for the sake of the story. I was just surprised and confused to learn that Blue and Giovanni can't teleport, and wanted to understand the in universe reason for such.

******* Yep, I was just asking because I wanted to understand what a reader's perspective is of how the powers work :)

The teleportation itself is a use of psychic powers that encompasses the person to bring them along. An abra can teleport a bag of rocks because a bag of rocks are not immune to psychic powers. Your analogy of throwing a rock at a dark person doesn't really make sense to me, because that's an obvious case of not actually touching the dark person with the psychic powers.

It's not like if someone just throws a telekinetic punch at someone without using their psychic senses it will hit them: it was explained in Viridian Forest that as long as the dark pokemon/person is alive, their body is constantly able to negate any psychic ability. So a pokemon teleporting their trainer is pulling their trainer along with them is in fact using their powers to affect the trainer's body, which they can't do if the trainer is Dark.

Does that make sense?
