[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/09/01/chapter-7-5/]]

PB is the story of a boy in a radically unjust fantasy society who sets out from home to save his family and gets involved in a mess of skullduggery. If it's new to you--hi!--a short synopsis is [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com][here]], and the story starts [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]]. It's been going since late January and a bunch of people here seem to like it.

Thanks for reading, one and all!


** Also, since you're my largest single group of readers: is Pyrebound what people call "grimdark," and if not, is there any accurate descriptor for this type of fiction beyond possibly ratfic?

*** I would say it could fall into the category of grimdark, yea. The term comes from an way to describe the feel of a story via a coordinate plane. On one access, you have how "bad" the world is, on a scale from dark to bright. Dark means the world is, well, a pretty awful place. Things suck. Bright is more like a fairy tale; things just work out nicely for everyone. Your world definitely falls on the dark side of things.

The other axis is how much power your characters have to influence the world and events surrounding them, on a scale of grim to noble. Grim means they are acted upon more than actors, and while they obviously can make decisions those decisions are unlikely to have an significant, lasting impact without a LOT of effort, if it's even possible. Noble means that your characters have the ability to make drastic changes to the world around them, improving it as the results of their actions. So far, you seem to be on the grim side as well although we'll see what happens when the characters aren't starting from a place of total and complete ignorance.

So yeah, so far I would classify your story as grim dark.

**** Thanks! I hadn't heard of that plane before; I was told it came from the tagline for Warhammer 40K. But it's hard to get a clear definition for "grimdark" anyway, just examples, and no two people seem to agree on the examples beyond, basically, Game of Thrones.

***** I wouldn't describe either GoT or your story as grimdark, so the definition is even more vague than you're thinking. I'd generally describe something as grimdark if it never moves out of black and dark grey morality. If there are any actually good-hearted, kind people (who aren't immediately killed to laugh at how foolish they are) then I don't think something qualifies.

I'd caution against labeling your story as grimdark whether or not it fits a looser definition than I have. I would generally go into a story that labels itself grimdark with pretty low expectations if I even bother at all, and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone on that.

****** I think this story falls into grimdark, IMO. Just using the definitions above, it's definitely dark and seemingly grim. We'll still early in the story (at least IMO), so maybe Ram will be able to make some big changes for the better, but I'm somewhat doubtful of that happening.

That said, I'd agree about not labeling it as such. Grimdark definitely has negative connotations. I probably wouldn't have started reading if it'd been labeled as grimdark, and I'm quite enjoying it.

******* Current planned length for PB is 15 full chapters, so we're a bit less than halfway through at this point. But we'll see how that changes as the story is told.

********* A bit less than halfway through, I said. It's going to be more than twice as long as it is now, and that's if I stick to schedule. I expect to post the last of it the better part of a year from now!

****** Huh. I'd say ASoIaF goes out of its way to punish altruistic people, so I'd say it would fit your definition, more or less. But I have run into people talking about grimdark like it referred to things more along the lines of HP Lovecraft, hence my hesitation.

I just wonder where to shelve this thing for marketing purposes. Is there a subgenre I can call it as a shorthand? "Dark fantasy" is a thing, but doesn't seem to fit either.

******* The difference, in my mind at least, is that while characters in asoiaf aren't usually rewarded for their goodness, the narrative still depicts them as admirable and noble. It's realistic that bad things often happen to good people in a place like westeros, and that's sad. A grimdark story would be one where the narrative depicts any person trying to do good as a naive fool deserving nothing but scorn and mockery from the reader. At its core, in my mind, grimdark is an author saying that niceness is stupid and trying to do good has no value. Ned Stark is naive, yes, but we still admire him for his ideals and his honor even as we wish he had compromised them for his own sake.

I would probably classify pyrebound as low fantasy (gritty and realistic), and as swords and sandals (set in antiquity.) Fantasy subgenres are fairly vague, I feel like.

I liked the latest chapter, by the way. Thanks for writing :)

******** Thank you for reading!

See, I was digging through Wiki's list of subgenres and guessing it was high fantasy based on their criteria of "our world with magic stuff intruding" for low and "completely different world where magic stuff is normal" for high. Oh well, the vagueness of the criteria probably means not many people think about this for purposes other than arguing on the internet anyhow.

******* GoT is a bit weird. It's definitely a dark world, IMO, but it kind of straddles the line between noble and grim. A lot of good people die, yes, but so do Cersei and Walter Frey and Ramsay Bolton, and the White Walkers do get defeated.

ASoIaF might ended up being grimmer than GoT, though.

** Another great chapter. I love the character interactions and dialogue, and it is clear how much care you take with them.

I only wish we would actually get to see more of the world at large. It seems like a very interesting place.

*** The world at large is, for human purposes, mostly the Dominion. We just saw our second pyre, and number three is coming up--though as the plot unfolds, things might start moving a bit more quickly and in unexpected directions, and I'm somewhat limited by the intimacy of Ram's perspective. What were you hoping to see more of, specifically? The other races, or what? I've already substantially modified the story in response to one reader request; this thing is far from fixed in stone.

**** I love the intimacy of Ram's perspective. I don't think you should change that up in-story. I would just love to know more about the history of politics, religion, and warfare in the dominion and beyond.

MoL's author does these worldbuilding-only posts, removed from the main story. I'm not saying you should necessarily copy him or her, but it is one way to convey information to the reader without messing with the story.

***** You'll be learning a good bit about at least the first two, though it might be a while, as the story progresses. There's not a big difference between religion and politics here, and warfare I suppose ties in as well. The plan is to write appendices for the print edition I'll be publishing when it all wraps up. One doing an overview of the Dominion, and one on the Five Peoples of Ki. Maybe others, depending how much stuff I have leftover when the story's told. The print edition being a sort of alternative to setting up a Patreon, which I feel weird about.
