After interviewing Alexander Wales and Daystar Eld for The Bayesian Conspiracy podcast, I put together a [[http://ratficonline.website/][Rational Fiction Online Anthology]]. It consists of links to nine Rationalist short stories, with brief introductions explaining what aspects of Rat Fic I believe they demonstrate. Most of the recommendations were taken from this subreddit, and I think every one of them has shown up here at one point or another. And of course this is only possible due to all the discourse here about what Rational Fiction even is.

I hope some people find this cool and/or useful. :)

**** It's either the normal human desire to socialize or an extra intense desire to socialize, it wasn't clear which because the protagonist's society seems to be obsessed with ambition and economic growth so their perception of what normal human values are might not have been correctly calibrated. I lean toward saying it's the normal human desire to socialize because that would explain why outbreaks are so common, but the evidence against is that one character mentions that those of the Loom aren't zombies and "still love their daughters", indicating that those outside the Loom also feel, or believe they feel, familial love, and that the Loom is characterized as strongly memetic.

**** You have inspired me to write a post to address this question. Maybe I'm entirely off base, but I like my interpretation. Maybe you will too.

** This is a wonderful thing you have done -- the introductions are well-written in and of themselves, and I look forward to showing this to my friends!

*** Nope. That would require getting publishing rights, and authors want to be paid for those. Posting links to sites which already purchased those rights is free! :)

** Seems cool! I'll check it out, but I would love it even more if it came also in PDF or even better EPUB/MOBI format so I could read it at my leisure on a Kindle.

EDIT: ok, sorry, realised why that is a problem from a comment below, so I'll just leave this comment for the "Seems cool!" part.
