** What I don't understand is why Voldemort said out loud what had happened. Seems counterproductive and I'm not 100% convinced it isn't some kind of ploy, but maybe he was just really freaked out.

*** I am guessing either:

A) This is all still mirror-based wish fulfillment

or

B) This is all part of some deeper plan to make Harry think he "won" and has been "successful" and can thus /not rip apart the stars in their heavens/.

Even if B), the acting seems overly dramatic and the sort of thing I expect Harry to question shortly (hand back all Harry's possible tools, then violently exclaim "No if you kill me now while my back is turned I will really no-foolin' die!"? *Really?*) This inclines me towards A); It wouldn't surprise me if in an hour and a half, Harry will question his perceptions and realize he is mirror-bound specifically because of how implausible what just happened was.

**** The the thing that seems confusing to me about B): If Voldemort believes the prophecy is about Harry, then why wouldn't he just /shoot/ him? That seems like a much more reliable method.

Then again, we are talking about a villain whom, upon learning a baby was prophesied to kill him, decided to turn the baby /into a similarly intelligent copy of himself./ Perhaps Dumbledore finally drove poor Riddle insane.

*** If /I/ accidentally overwrote more than a hundred lifetimes of save files, I would be screaming and ranting far worse than Voldemort did here.

**** Really? My reaction upon experiencing extreme depths of frustration, and I am a damned hammy person, is usually to lapse into apparent calm and mutter "oy gevalt" or "oh bugger". Seeing that actually shows, for me, /more/ exasperation than screaming and ranting. Screaming and ranting shows I am still /engaged/ and have not yet started wanting to just fuck off and /not be there anymore/.

*** I don't even know what happened. Why did his horcrux fail? Because Harry exists? Because the horcrux would affect Harry too, so their magic got mixed and bad stuff happened?

edit: Was he trying to make a horcrux for Harry? Hermione?
