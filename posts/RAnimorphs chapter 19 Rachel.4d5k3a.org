** Waaait wait wait. Z-Space pockets are recursive? I feel like they shouldn't be.

EDIT: By the way, when Rachel is morphed, and her real body carries the flies, which themselves carry the other morphed bodies... do they count as additional weight her pocket carries, thus making her window shorter? Does their pocket keep collapsing when they're being morphed away?

*** I don't think they need to be recursive for this to work, that is to say, I don't think Z-space pockets need to be able to hold other pockets in turn.

It could be that the way the morphing tech works is that every time you morph, a Z-space pocket is created somewhere in Z-space and the controlling intelligence placed within it together with everything it takes with it, and a morph is generated in regular space. If someone else were to take the morph along with them into Z-space they're still taking regular matter into a new Z-space pocket, not putting a Z-space pocket inside another.

It's not recursion, it's linked lists.

***** The original bodies in Z-space are put into a kind of stasis, where they aren't effected by the passage of time. I believe this was established when the Animorphs noticed that they didn't get hungry very often when they spent a lot of time in-morph.

It's only the presence of the active link between the Yeerk tissue in the morph body and the original that allows the original's mind to keep functioning. If the link itself were placed in the same stasis by putting the morph body into Z-space, I would imagine the entire system gets put on standby. None of the signals are being received in either direction.

The originals would either go into complete stasis or would effectively be unconscious. If they do notice any passing time, it might be in a kind of complete sensory deprivation.

At some point, I'd love to read the story of the Andalite engineer who had to deal with supporting these corner cases.

** Wait I'm confused....

Why would the Yeerks have to wait until a Gedd dips their heads in the pool by chance? That's only true for the first ever Gedd, and after that the Yeerks could easily arrange among themselves to only enter the left ear and exit out the right ear. No need to wait for the Gedd to come back, just arrange to swap off hosts while a Yeerk is leaving for another Yeerk to take control through the other ear.

** (Had to revisit chapter 3 to remind myself of the tip-off.)

I think I'm missing something about the 'alphabetical order'--if I count correctly it should chronologically be A-C-J-M-R, but the fourth doesn't look like M's perspective and the fifth doesn't look like R's perspective (unless I'm misunderstanding). Another interpretation of the alphabetical order comment, plus the 'over's they're all making a point of saying leads me to expect they should be saying Aover, Cover, Jover, Mover, Rover, but they aren't--so I don't see where the order is being conveyed. <puzzlement>

Tip-off conversations: Any particular reason why they happened so chronologically close to each other?

Advice/Second opinion: Wasn't that just acquired? Why a need to ask for it again, or wouldn't it be a third opinion by that point? (Even if different due to up-to-dateness, some thoughts on the answer at that time should already have been had and witnessed..?)

Quite interested to see what happens next!

*** Asking Marco the person allows him to lie, allows him to filter info. Asking Marco the morph removes that; you get a complete picture. Maybe she wanted a perspective she's more used to, where there's a modicum of doubt.

To backup!Marco: "I did Dumb Thing. What're you going to do?"

Conclusion: It is at least safe enough for me to tell real!Marco.

To real!Marco: "Oh, you already know. Hm. Um. Well, I guess the next question then is ... what should /I/ do?"

*** Not sure what specifically you mean by perspective switching. Each chapter is entirely from a single perspective (in this case, Rachel's). At one point, she's morphed into Marco, and at another, she's in a Tidwell body with Illim in control, but at all times, she's the "I" of the chapter.

If there's a specific thing I can clear up, I'm happy to try.
