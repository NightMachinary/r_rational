edit: to clarify the title, how much better worm would be than MHA, not that worm would be better as an anime than a serial fic.

​

It's my first time through MHA, and I'm in season 3. it's not bad. It's just .... baseline hero anime with powers a weird middle-schooler would have come up with.

​

I never finished Worm to be honest, but the worldbuilding and characters are so much more compelling. I know it's been said many times before, but it would make for an incredible anime. The characters and narrative style is made for the medium. Just wish there was a way to pitch a studio on the value of it =D


** You'd need an excellent and compelling VA for Taylor, so much of the story and events are her considering her situations and "explaining" insect-sized events from a block away.

*** the writer suggested lots of split-screen scenes where you are showing her internal monologue along with the effects that are occurring. It's really commonplace in anime for characters to sit around explaining how their powers work even in the middle of the action, I don't think it would be at all out of place =)

** An adaptation of Worm would suffer from the same problem as the majority of VN and LN adaptations. Worm is carried very heavily by internal motivation and monologue, and it's not easy to show that in a visual medium, especially in a long-form medium like anime. People who don't already know what's happening )from reading the original story) are less likely to follow what's happening and why. More importantly, they're less likely to connect with the characters and understand driving motivations, just by virtue of less time with the characters and how an adaptation would need to deal with internal monologue.

Also, the manga -> anime transition is pretty smooth these days, especially in the case of MHA, because the arcs and even individual chapters are well-timed and have a good balance of internal monologue and action by virtue of the medium. For an adaptation of Worm, how would you effectively rewrite the pacing?

**** Well, lots of people have issues with the Chimera Ant arc for that reason. I've also seen lots of people hate on "Kaguya-sama wants to be confessed to" because of the voice-over - even when the over-explaining is effectively there as part of the joke. Voice overs, narrators, internal monologues in visual media are always controversial choices.

*** I feel like anime has an easier time with this than many other visual/film media precisely because internal monologue is an established trope. Characters openly describe their feelings/thoughts, flashbacks are used heavily to give background, and action is often interrupted to provide broader context. Anime viewers are already accustomed to this, so I think it would actually work better for this kind of thing than a live action movie adaptation, for instance.

Apart from that, building characters and sympathy is just part of the craft of storytelling, and can certainly happen in a visual medium.

My observation was really more noting the popularity of My Hero Academia and thinking that Worm could do that genre way, way better, simply due to the depth of the worldbuilding, more interesting powers, clever use of powers, interesting takes on villains, etc.

It would certainly be much darker than MHA, with heavier tone and themes and much more serious consequences, which personally I find more appealing anyway.

In terms of pacing, I feel like it's already set up with major arcs and beats that port fairly well. There's a steady power arc and things generally move from one conflict with a group of adversaries to the next with some exposition and relationship building in between, which is a standard structure. You can cut or shorten some of the exposition and bits that drag, but overall I don't think it's that far off.

Are there aspects that you think won't translate well in particular?

And this is why it sucks. Which implies something about Worm itself that you think it would so well translate into terrible anime storytelling.

And it could have so easily been about /Anime Batman/ and overcoming fate in the most overwrought shonen way, but it's /not/ he just gets /handed/ the Best Power and his main conflict is /not accidentally killing himself or anyone else/ with it

**** The spin-off manga, MHA: Vigilantes, is more like that - the MC has a quirk, but he's older than Deku and didn't get in as a hero, and now just acts at the edge of the law like some dude who occasionally helps. It's interesting - in some ways, better than the main manga, in fact - in that it explores more the underbelly of hero society, with all its issues and all the people who have been let down by it.

Lolwat? I disagree. Dragonball or naruto are baseline shonen. You just make up some cool superpower, invent a pretense for the villain, and call it a day after a fistfight

MHA isn't on a worm level, fair enough, and arguably it's still far from optimal.. but /you feel/ like damns were given in worldbuilding, balancing and internal consistency imo.

I mean, superheroes inherently aren't, but I cannot think to any other media that handled them as well. For once, you don't just have superman-like idiot balls, where somehow you have powers that completely annihilate the laws of physics popping out like mushrooms.. and yet the world doesn't change the slightest. Or magic that only exists when it's handy to the plot.

***** What I do not like in Midoriya motivations is that he just wants to be #1. I might as well imagine him wanting to be #1 supervillain or #1 boxer, as deep as his motivation seems to be.

I just can't stop but feel that he is insincere. His desire to save people stems not from empathy and compassion, but from Endeavor like egoism. Midoriya just happens to be a "nice guy".

Sometimes Midoriya actually does things which require deep compassion for other people. But I cannot connect those actions with his core motivation. Feels like his character does those things only for the audience to root for him, not because that's who he is.

That would be Bakugo, his long time +bully+ friend. Midoriya wants to be #1... in saving people. He doesn't want to be #1 for the sake of fame or money or getting laid. He wants to be #1 because he wants to save people, and he wants to save ALL the people EVER. It's in fact his main difference with the other candidate to becoming the Symbol of Peace, Mirio Togata - who calls himself Lemillion because "he knows he can't save everyone, but he'd settle for saving a million". Fuck that, says Midoriya, I'm going to save everyone /anyway/. He's in fact straight up reckless and self-harming in that pursuit. When they meet Eri for the first time, Mirio - who's still 100% a good guy, no question - does the pragmatic thing and pretends he's seen nothing. But Midoriya just tries to help her right there and then. If there's another anime character that gets close to that level of masochistic altruism, it's Shiro Emiya.

It's not that I don't have problems with MHA. The story would have been more interesting with a genuinely quirkless Deku. His friendship with Bakugo is frankly toxic, and in general the story seems way too keen to forgive genuinely abusive characters like him or Endeavour. And other problems I have with it are... manga spoilers, so I won't get into them now. But I never got the impression that Deku's motivation was egotistic. If anything, the guy could use some selfishness. At this rate he's going to be a fine powder of bones and pulped muscles before he ever gets to claim that title of "greatest hero".

Uh? Does him? Last time I checked the motivation was just helping others and shit.

Then being #1 kinda derives from who he admires, and what this represents, but except for being the "most useful" for the purposes above it's not really the main point.

The first episode has some highs and lows about that, anyway it quite makes you reflect on what it means to be a hero, what it means to be brave and what it means to be a fool.

Idk what egoism has to do with this.

** Definitely agree I'd love to see an animated series. Major issue through is the damn marketing and "girl show ghetto" the show runners of Young Justice, Green Lantern Animated Series and even Avatar: the Last Airbender all had their shows cancelled or severely cut down because they don't fall into the easy: is it a girl's show or a boy's show marketing dichotomy. It took the titanic success of the Harry Potter series for Marketing to even acknowledge there was such a thing as a young adult market existed, though the genre of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman][Bildungsroman]] existed for centuries. I see any Worm adaptation getting hit with this sexism full force.

On another note where did you stop in the worm story, out of curiosity? There's an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=710hM7YwMKc&list=PLkRjxdG1jzZISSFTpZmVk5WgC9oRlu14M][audiobook]] which should make things easier, as well as a Wiki but that has heavy spoilers.

*** I feel like there's a very nice contrast between the American and Japanese viewpoints on the individual's duties towards society there. In Marvel comics, registration of heroes has been a Big Deal for decades, seen as an ultimate evil, and was eventually established after a literal civil war and pushed for by a rather fascistic faction - though eventually the new order settled into something more sensible. In My Hero Academia, /of course/ heroes are licensed by the State - how else would it be? The regulation of powers is a /fait accompli/ and the series fully promotes the notion that, even with the occasional downside, it is entirely a Good Thing.

**** That's an interesting take; I hadn't thought about it that way.

I'm not very deep into comics so I don't know all of the details but I do recall not being a huge fan of that particular spin in Marvel; like I remember watching Avengers: Age of Ultron and being somewhat confused by what the big deal over the Sokovia Accords was; like of course, when titanic battles happen, collateral (cold as that sounds) is a thing and it's justified that the nations of the world would want to regulate that. The Avengers are great heroes but they are still just a group of people at the end of the day, with powers that could kill millions if abused/exercised incorrectly. And I get it was a movie, so there was limited time to explore and they needed conflict, but it still seemed off to me that said accords would cause an entire super hero battle to the point where it /permanently cripples Tony's lifelong friend/. Felt very forced, overall.
