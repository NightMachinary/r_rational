  Juniper's mistakes
#+end_quote

I felt Cat was too results orientated here. It seems as if Junipers decisions were all regarded as correct except for the inability to account for /both/ the gates failing to work and scrying to fail. Any military action to rescue the Legions was going to contain some degree of risk, the question being how likely was it that /both/ scrying and gating would simultaneously fail and were there other possible courses of action that were less costly?

I understand that Juniper was heading into an area with Named and that magic can simply fail on you for story reasons but just what odds would you expect somebody to put on scrying and gating both failing in this situation? We've seen gates used many times before, including in conflicts and with Named, have we seen them fail in this manner or similar? Have we seen a simple facet of magic be excluded before over such a vast territory?

Just because they haven't before doesn't mean they won't. It's a critical point of failure because of how important it was to the campaign. "What could go wrong?" is a question often asked but one must also be cautious of "How bad could it be?"

Also the Grey Pilgrim once messed with a Gate back when Cat dropped a lake, which took Cat and Masego out of commission for much of the battle.

With gates and scrying the Army of Callow would've been mostly successful with its objectives, and not on the brink of destruction before Cat came in to save the day.

This doesn't seem like a helpful way to assess risk. Yes, everything has to happen for the first time once, but if something has never happened before it is often a good indicator that, at the least, it's very unlikely to happen. You can't plan around even a fraction of all the possible things that have never happened before but aren't theoretically impossible. You have to look at the evidence and do your best to surmise the likely probability and as far as i can see the probability, based on what we know, seems really low that gates would be rendered useless over a vast geographic area.

****** That's the thing though, it was arguably /two/ points of failure, because with scrying my understanding is that this situation would not have been near as messy, and Juniper was not engaging in combat with Named, she was gating into a location that she suspected (correctly) to be without Named in the immediate vicinity. Yes, there were Named within a few hours march or such but that's very different to a situation where Named are there right in front of you to exude their narrativium in such a direct manner.

The other big difference being that while you might plan for a Named to impose some sort of temporary exclusionary effect in their vicinity, that is very different to a huge, permanent, area wide exclusionary effect. I suspect that Juniper could have worked around the former.

That's how risk management works. They prepare for even slim possibilities, especially those measures that would be fatal if failed in the worst case scenario. And I already mentioned the last time a Gate was messed with by a Named in the plot, so it's not improbable it'll fail to work again in a critical moment either.

Sure, time is limited and you can't plan for everything, but the whole Fae Gates thing is reliant on Cat's enduring relationship with the Fairy Courts and the Observatory needs Masego and Fae Magic to fix it if anything goes wrong, right? Neither of those are set in stone.

Cat may not have a solution either, but that doesn't mean Juniper didn't blunder by gambling on them not failing in a story where overconfident Villains/Heroes are constantly betrayed by the one thing they relied on (see: Cat on Magic Swords).

I don't think the situation with the Grey Pilgrim is very analogous. I suspect Juniper was confident her plan could survive a Named in the immediate vicinity being able to temporarily disable a gate. I wouldn't infer from that, if i were her, that Named could permanently disable gates over a huge area even when they're not physically nearby the gating point. I would update the likelihood of catastrophic gate failure, but only very slightly.

#+begin_quote

The issue here is that Cat /expects/ a solution. She acknowledges that the Legions should have been saved, so given that, she needs to provide a better solution otherwise she is just admonishing Juniper for coming up with the best possible solution to something that she expected to be done.

#+begin_quote
  the one thing they relied on
#+end_quote

In my estimation it was the failing of /both/ scrying and gating that resulted in their predicament. It is this expected planning for the simultaneous failing of both that makes Cat seem especially unreasonable to me.

It's possible to mess with Gates and with Scrying by Named power (see: Procer's use of scrying), which in this story means it's an outright eventuality especially given how reliant the Army of Callow is on those two things.

#+begin_quote
  /The issue here is that Cat expects a solution./
#+end_quote

Her solution to that was clearly "don't gate into Procer without a backup plan, especially if it means risking the destruction of Callow". Saving Grem One-Eye and remnants of Black's army is strategically important, but not as important as losing most of the Army of Callow, who they needed to help fend off the Dead King. In the context of mundane alternatives to Gating and Scrying itself, I don't think Cat needs to be the one who thinks them up. She has people for that, like Juniper, Akua, Masego etc.

I don't think it's sensible to dismiss all the reasons why the two situations are not analogous and assume exponential scaling of any ability. We're looking at

- permanent v temporary disabling

- limited to a specific gate being targeted v any gate in an entire province

- requires a Named in the immediate vicinity v no Named needed nearby

Regarding Cat's thoughts on the necessity of rescue:

#+begin_quote
  “It was necessary to evacuate the Legions of Terror,” Juniper said.

  I nodded in acknowledgement.

  “They fought at the Vales,” I said. “A debt was owed..."
#+end_quote

Now obviously this doesn't mean Cat thinks the Legions come before her army but it becomes a matter of /how much risk Cat is willing to assume/ to rescue the Legions and whether Juniper's plan assumed too much risk. As we disagree on how much risk there was we can't probably can't get much more out of this point.

#+begin_quote
  I don't think Cat needs to be the one who thinks them up. She has people for that
#+end_quote

Sure, but she has to be aware that /there is in fact a better solution/. As Cat is not yet aware of any better solutions then she can't be sure that one does in fact exist. If Cat was saying "Juniper, if this is the best solution that existed then you should have left the Legions to fend for themselves" then that's one thing but AFAICT that's not the sentiment she is expressing in this chapter.

********* I wonder if she's actually expecting a solution. But the result of the military operation was a clear failure, and was caused by totally missing 2 major problems. Both of which, as others have pointed out, have happened before in some way.

It's one thing to do it because there's no better choice. It's another to do it without even recognizing the potential costs.

That means Juniper jumped in without knowing the risks, which is a negligence she needed to be taken to task for.

  /I don't think it's sensible/
#+end_quote

We're reading a story in which narrative tropes like overconfident Villains having their magic whatever fail them at the last moment resulting at their downfall at the hands of Heroes is a common thing that happens. Cat throwing away the angel feather sword after being revived by angels shows us that this is something common enough that people plan around.

#+begin_quote
  /no Named needed nearby/
#+end_quote

I thought their failure to gate and scry now is a combination of the Tyrant's machinations and/or Hierarch being nearby? Also there's Cat losing her direct fae powerup to the Drow and Masego turning into a walking magic nuke after his dads blew themselves up, which might have resulted in some unexpected magic backlash to the Observatory.

Look, the campaign being reliant on two extremely critical points of failure with no backup plan that can reduce the severity of the risks is clearly an error. If it worked out then it's fine in the short run, but Cat being hypocritical or not in pointing out Juniper's faults here doesn't mean Juniper's not at fault.

Going back to Risk Management, failure to scry and failure to gate are catastrophic risks that are somewhat unlikely to happen both at once. Severity x Likelihood = Risk, extremely high severity combined with uncommon likelihood means risks should still be heavily managed with plenty of backup plans before they plan jumping into Procer.

#+begin_quote
  /Sure, but she has to be aware that there is in fact a better solution./
#+end_quote

Again, her solution was "not go to Procer", which is valid. Cat didn't say Grem's leftover army is worth the entire Army of Callow, and in fact she has implied it's not worth the trade before. Choosing to not save Grem isn't impossible, although it would look really bad to those at home. I'm basing this starting from her conversation with Adjutant in Chapter 19 btw:

*** There's always an issue with calculating risk with the possibility of Black Swans ^{pun not intended}. One reason they should maybe have been more wary is that they know so little about the underlying mechanics that they don't have any way to predict how likely these things are.

*** They've used gates in battle before, yeah, like when Procer invaded. If I remember correctly though, they were very careful to make sure that their plans wouldn't fall to pieces if a gate suddenly fails. They used the gates, sure, but made sure to never rely on them in crucial/plot-heavy moments. Juniper made a bold move that absolutely required the gates to work, so of course they failed. Scrying going down too was just adding insult to injury.

** One segment I think deserves more attention:

#+begin_quote
  “When the situation in Iserre is resolved,” I continued, “a tribunal of senior officers will be convened to assess whether or not the decisions you took in this campaign warrant charges of incompetence or reckless use of authority. Their verdict will decide whether or not you are demoted back to general.”

  “Understood,” the Marshal of Callow rasped.

  “Good,” I said. “I'll be perfectly clear: I have no intention of being involved with this tribunal beyond ordering it convened. This is not personal, Juniper. This isn't happening because I am angry with an old friend, or appalled by what your decisions almost led to. But if the Army of Callow is ever to be more than just my personal warband, then its members need to be accountable for what they do.”

another hint that she's tihnking more long term about Callow as a stae with institutions seperate from her own personal power. Similar to her thoughts about Abigail.
