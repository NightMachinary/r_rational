Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I've been rereading a lot of fantasy books, with supernatural societies using their abilities left and right in secret, and it got me thinking: how much mass can you create out of nothing before NASA notices their rocket equations are going wrong? I mean, it would take a lot before gravity changes noticeably, but every bit more gravity is a bit more speed needed to hit escape velocity, and that extra speed requirement /exponentially/ increases the amount of rocket fuel that is needed to push a rocket into space, if I understand rocket science correctly (I probably don't). Anyone more familiar with rocket science able to put some numbers on this?

** A few weeks ago, I posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zoo8l/d_friday_offtopic_thread/duqvy3i/][this]] in a friday thread. tl;dr it's a pitch about a setting where immortals decide to return because they find the singularity interesting. [[/u/trekie140]] posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zoo8l/d_friday_offtopic_thread/durcriq/][this]] comment about how such a setting could be used to explore some interesting philosophical topics, and [[/u/eaturbrainz]] challenged me to write using that prompt.

It didn't turn out so well, for a variety of reasons.

You accidentally wrote comedy while trying to write something philosophically serious. The basic trope to play off for drama is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment][Romanticism versus Enlightenment]] here, but you've kinda degraded both sides into parody versions of themselves: the war god who's fooled by the "supplications" of bored employees and semi-sapient AIs, and, well, bored employees forking copies of themselves to deal with boring work in a world that, according to your reader's pre-baked expectations, shouldn't have much scarcity or boring work at all.

More so, in relation to the original post: if we're talking about a world in which the reappearance of gods and magic was /jarring/, who's jarred? Samantha's not: she's /bored/. The war god is, apparently, too mentally primitive to be all that significant in the post-singularity corporate world, so where's the actual conflict? Where's the sandpaper scratching on the souls of your posthuman whatevers and AIs as they confront the profundities and ancient powers of mythology?

*** First of all, chapter 1 is perfect. Opening of Hamilton perfect. You could not have explained this premise in a better way and that last line had me hyped to see what you did next with this idea. Where you faltered is that you didn't seem to decide whether this would be a world-shaking mystery like Arrival or a anthology of short stories like old sci-fi satires.

Chapter 2 sounds like a scene from a story about first contact, but it skips over the buildup to the encounter and doesn't establish a goal the protagonist is after. The thing I was most interested in hearing about was the immortal, but you instead focus on explaining how transhumans work. The story of how Samatha was chosen to do this is a great way to present that, but there's nothing to establish why she's meeting Bob and what she wants from it. Consider opening with pulling the straw and then her going over the plan because she's anxious.

Chapter 3, on the other hand, is about how the immortals are being integrated into human society. It's definitely interesting, arguably more so than Chapter 2, but it's basically a vignette from a person's life in a strange world that we want to learn about. This is a completely different kind of story from what Chapter 2 seemed to be going for and it leaves us hanging by not exploring the consequences of the event or revealing more about the immortals.

Both ideas are great ones for stories, I had originally thought the former was the best way to go but now I think the latter might be a better choice. If you didn't have a specific theme you want to teach the audience, like Arrival did about communication, then it's fine to just present some cool ideas in short stories about this world and the people in it for us to think about.

I think you should also hammer out precisely what the immortals /do/ in this world and why. One possibility is that humanity lives in a simulation that the immortals got bored of interacting with, but have now returned to see what's new and recapture the fun they once had. It could be like a new expansion pack for an old video game, or commentary on nostalgia if you want to do that. That's just a random idea I haven't thought through the implications of, though, so you can do whatever you'd like.

*** I liked the story. I'm not sure what your reasons for struggle were, so most of this might be tangential.

The summary at the beginning read easily, especially considering it was explaining a complicated idea. It's really good. That's too bad, because I'm going to recommend you consider putting everything it explained in other parts of the story, so that the reader has to infer the setting. Trying to figure out what's going on is a natural source of enjoyment.

It struck me as weird that the supernatural beings left after agriculture but before science. That would be like leaving a baseball game after the first pitch is thrown but before it's been hit. I'm trying to think of a distraction that would cause them to leave (another sentient race that one of them uplifted when he was bored of humans?) or another justification for a mass departure. Maybe their leader said "I'm bored!" and left, and it took the rest of them a few thousand years to realize they didn't have to actually do everything the leader told them? And how did they decide to come back... maybe a few die-hard fans finally decided to let the rest know that interesting things were happening? Hmmm.

As for "thinky" stuff...

I frame a lot of things as conversations. That has the benefit of forcing complicated ideas to be explained in a conversational way--if you want to write something "thinky", you can have one character think and explain it to another. I'm imagining a new employee at the god-manipulating stock firm who has to have details of the gods explained to him. He can raise any obvious philosophical points, for his senior to explain in more detail. That's just one possibility. It's going to be a lot easier to explain things about the gods with human-to-human conversations than god-to-human conversations, or uploaded-to-god conversations.

If you have difficulty writing a natural-sounding conversation about philosophy, you might try engaging one of your friends in a conversation about philosophy and use it as material. That's worked for me.

I'm sorry I can't help more. I thought the writing was good and I'd read more stories from this setting if you chose to write them.

This analogy works from a hindsight perspective, where we can see how agriculture enabled humanity to have enough extra time and resources to develop science which lead to all sorts of interesting stuff, but to an immortal who has spent thousands of years not seeing science, how would they predict that it would become more interesting? If the immortals have traditional values such as honor and strength, then they probably enjoyed watching humans roam and hunt animals, and once they start settling down as farmers they become weaklings who sit around watching plants grow and are no longer interesting to spectate.

More like millions of years. Human beings stopped "living in trees" with Australopithecus around 3.6 million years ago. Agriculture probably started with rice, 13,500 years ago at the earliest. That's a ratio of 266. A pitch takes .4 seconds to reach the home plate: so I imagine someone watching a bunch of humans on a field for about two minutes with interest, then teleporting away the moment no humans are holding a ball. Except it's a whole stadium of watchers. The timing is unlikely, and indeed it would be weird if someone happened to leave the baseball game just before things got interesting.

** So, I had the flu this week, and I emailed my boss on Tuesday to let him know that I'd just been to the doctor and the doctor had told me to stay home the rest of the week.

He responded with the usual get well soon, and then said, "a gentle reminder" to get a medical certificate.

This shits me, because this guy is completely anal about sick leave for some weird reason (we have 12 days sick time a year FWIW). I've been working there for 7 years now and I am /intimately/ familiar with the sick leave policy because I've read the documents that outline it: so intimately familiar, that I know that due to a particular confluence of events, I /don't/ actually need a sick note for last week.

I do /have/ one though, because if you're going to the doctor anyway there's never a downside to getting a note written.

I'm like, should I sass him back when I get back to the office and be all, "Actually according to 12.4.6 of the EBA, blah blah blah" - or should I just put my damn head down and give him the sick note even though he doesn't need it?

He's asked for sick notes from coworkers that are in /unambiguously/ non-sick-note-requiring territory before, and they haven't provided them AFAIK, but my sick note situation is more ambiguous.

geez this is like the longest post ever and it's just me whining!!!!

since it's already long, sick note policy is that you need a sick note if you take three consecutive sick days. i had wednesday booked as a day off, so I only took Monday/Tuesday and Thursday as sick days, so I didn't get three consecutive /sick days/, even though I was absent from work for four consecutive days. (And you can't turn pre-booked "days off" into sick days because you were sick on them except in very specific circumstances, but I could potentially use this situation to turn my day off into a sick day, which would be niice as they come out of seperate "accounts").

*** It's a shitty move from the boss. I guess the question here is, what benefit do you get from not sending in the sick note, and what costs are associated with that, and is the benefit worth the cost?

Generally speaking, in situations like this where there is nothing directly to gain from proving to your boss that you're technically right, I keep my head down. This is not because I think my boss would take it badly, but because there's no real benefit to it, I get over the annoyance quickly, and it could have a negative impact on me.

"I've been working here for 7 years. I am well aware of the sick note requirements thankyouverymuch."

I think the ask a manager blog would tell me to phrase it like this:

"I'm confused why you're telling me that. Of course I know the corporate policy is to get a sick note after three consecutive days of leave. Did I do something to make you feel as though I don't understand the sick leave policies?"

The issue is more, my manager seems to think I don't know how to do my job: I've got emails from him where he lays out in excruciating detail each step of a process I have been doing every month for the last four years. He makes basic annotations on my reports (on printed copies in red pen because he doesn't know how to use track changes in word), with things like "are you sure this is the right thing to do?" and I just want to scream at him, "of course that's what I think, this entire 20 page report is justifying why I think it's the right thing to do, can you read the fucking report?". He's always giving me instructions as though it's my first week, and it shits me. He's apparently like that with everyone, so it's not an age or gender thing (thank god), but it still feeds my imposter syndrome.

****** Oh no, he's pretty terrible in general. Example: with my two previous managers, procurement documents were read within a business day, and within a week in exceptional circumstances. Now these same documents take three weeks to be read. And I don't mean 20 page reports: these are one, maybe two pages, and very routine.

I've complained to his manager (as has /everyone else on the team/ except for the 60 year old Sri Lankan man who dgaf). I once had a minor breakdown (crying and everything) at work over the stress I was under working with him, but that's improved a lot now I no longer sit in the desk /immediately next to him/.

Government means there's nothing that can be done in terms of getting him fired or demoted, unfortunately.

He has improved slightly in small ways when these things are brought up to /his/ manager.

I like the idea of being a little less passive-aggressive in the email. Maybe something more honest like:

"I'm confused why you're telling me that. Of course I know the corporate policy is to get a sick note after three consecutive days of leave. It makes me feel as though you don't trust my knowledge of the policy when you give me unnecessary reminders like this."

"I know you're just reminding me because you want to make sure I follow the rules, but please extend a bit more trust to me on issues like this. You may not realize how it comes off, but after seven years of working here, being reminded of things like this can feel demeaning, and I'm sure that is not your intention."

Let's do simple prioritising for now. The "fundamental question of rationality": How do I know what I know? Is there a way to determine my current level?

** I recently had occasion to roll my eyes at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index?v=a9b19216-22c3-11e7-ac72-128763c683de&v2=e55ccc9a-684b-11e7-8481-0e1e02ebdfd0][an edit]] that someone had made to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][the wiki's list of recommended stories]]:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]] (Content warning: Contains child rape, torture, mind rape)
#+end_quote

It's my opinion that either /all/ the stories on the list should have ""warnings"" or /none/ of them should. (Doesn't the list contain /several/ other stories that depict torture and mind rape in graphic terms?) However, out of an abundance of +respect+ +caution+ cowardice, I took it upon myself to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index?v=02b9f006-7b11-11e7-beac-0e38c7f6c7fa&v2=08538c00-24aa-11e8-9bf5-0e044fc19876][delete]] only the =child rape= portion of the ""warning"", since, IIRC, it's false. (On the other hand, of course, my most recent (sixth) reading of /Time Braid/ occurred /at least/ a year ago, and [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/54bz8l/q_recommendations_similar_to_mother_of_learning/d80l4s8/?context=9][I've accidentally made false claims about the story in the past]].)

*** I think this is one of the cases where idealism has to give way to pragmatism. Ideally, we wouldn't self-censor. But pragmatically, the point of a recommended reading list is to recommend works. If a reader tries to read Time Braid blind and gets majorly turned off by some of the more objectionable elements, then it's likely that they'll trust the recommendation list less, and avoid reading the other works simply because of their association with Time Braid.

The suggestion of fairness is an ideal that we should aim for, but isn't practical here. After all, to fairly add warnings to all the stories on the list, an editor would naturally have to read /all/ the stories on the list. Effectively, you would be saying that people cannot add content warnings unless they first invest hundreds of hours of time reading all the stories, even the ones they doesn't like.

Perhaps an alternative approach would work: add content warnings to all the stories, but leave them blank or with some kind of "todo" marking. That way editors who have read the stories can fill in the blanks, and blank warnings for stories would mean "unknown content" as opposed to "safe content".

*** Given you were wrong about the story in the past, and I personally am /not/ willing to read stories with children being raped in them (partially because they are /illegal/ in Australia but mostly because, gross), can we have someone verify the existence or absence of that sort of thing in the story?

***** I'm not joking, text depicting sexual actions of minors is defined as child pornography in Australia - here's a newspaper article about someone who was imprisoned for writing such stories: [[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-14/man-jailed-for-depraved-texts-about-young-children/6391718]]

If the acts you're describing happen between bodies of child age or appearance, then consensual or otherwise, they're illegal in my country. (I believe we also have laws that say that adult actresses can't depict children in pornography, for example).

I don't know if anyone's been prosecuted for /reading/ such material, but still. (And yes, I do use a VPN)

Really, what's the difference?

*This is the pot calling the kettle black, unfortunately, since I myself, to my intense annoyance, avert my eyes from reading depictions of M/M intercourse.

**This was a minor maymay a few years back: =free speech= = =muh freeze peach= = =frozen peaches=. I haven't seen anyone else use it recently, but I still like it.

It stops being a conversation only about the readers' notions about what should and should not be considered [1:] sex with minors (e.g. because of the characters' subjective ages due to the looping) and [2:] child rape (e.g. Sakura having sex with Naruto as a reward), because it is no longer implied --- in the context of the discusion --- that the placement of the warning was justified for the sake of the general audience's preferences, “common sense”, etc.

Instead, the information regarding the legal definitions of [1] and [2] are added as a factor to the discussion. So now it doesn't much matter how well someone manages to defend the position that Scene A wasn't depicting children (e.g. because Sakura was subjectively over ~100 years old by that point) or that Scene B wasn't depicting rape (e.g. because all the participating parties have been shown to give their consent) --- because in the eyes of Australian (and British, etc) law it /is/ child porn because they look like children, it /is/ child rape because children have no right to consent to sex, and possession of both entails rather severe punishments --- even if all the “children” in the “child pornography” are fictional characters.

TVTropes has outright removed that story's page from its catalogue, and with the way reddit's been developing recently, I expect the chilling effect to shatter the references to that story on this (and other) sub's wikies as well, sooner or later.

There still isn't any difference in /my reaction/, though, and that was the immediate topic.

Well, there'll always be more /USA-based/ [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Time_Braid][sites]] for hot text-based [[https://www.futanaripalace.com/][loli-on-shota action]] popping up---at least, until [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_v._Free_Speech_Coalition][/Ashcroft/ v. /Free Speech Coalition/]] gets overturned.

** Has anyone read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35018907-semiosis][Semiosis]] by Sue Burke? It's not perfectly rational, but it's a fascinating story regardless. It contains perhaps the best viewpoint description of alien thought I've ever heard, although I wonder if my perception was affected by the quality of the audiobook.
