** Since the behavior and statistical trends behind criminal activities tend to be tightly correlated with the behavior of the local law enforcement, I would first talk to the DA-friend about how he/she thinks the law enforcement can be improved and follow it up with a visit to the Arkham Madhouse to see if there has been anything odd criminal activity-wise to cause the mental illness or if it's really the other way around (or if there is no causation, only correlation).

The other two things are not what Bruce normally deals with and should be delegated to someone more competent. Crocodiles go to animal control, and 'lesser heroes' go to the lawyer firm on retainer to analyze how likely they are to help or hinder catching criminals and if there's any way to channel them into a positive direction.

** First things first: tally of skills and resources. For the time being, I'll assume metahuman combat skills and effectively unlimited funds.

Secondly, you'll want to attract as many metas as possible. Determine a plan to best attract them. Ideas:

- wanetech offering high paying jobs to metas
- pass pro-vigilantism laws in gotham

This ties in to a third point: do whatever it takes to make the gotham police force work well against non-metas, and have procedures for dealing with metas. Tl;dr make them the PRT

Plus, having Glory Girl running around gotham might actually be beneficial (crime-wise at least).

** If a priority is dealing with crime, and you have basically unlimited funds, then making crime less profitable, while simultaneously offering other avenues seems like a potentially reasonable approach.

- Investigate Criminal Enterprise revenues.\\
- If drugs, push for legalization.\\
- If extortion, push for higher police budgets, subsidize weapons for self-defense, subsidize classes in self-defense.
- If prostitution, push jail sentences/longer jail sentences for customers. Alternatively, legalize but make it government run from designated licensed locations.

Before taking any of the above paths, read any available research as to whether these things have been implemented anywhere, and if they had the intended effect.

You are a rich billionaire in a corrupt city, so effecting local politics is presumably not too difficult.

Also consider if precommittment can be used as a weapon.

- Consider ways to plausibly pre-commit to punishing certain behaviors. If every kidnapping an organization launches leads to one of their buildings getting blown up, they'll stop kidnapping people.
- Consider ways to plausibly pre-commit to punishing criminal revenues in general. If you estimate they made $100 million last year, can you plausibly do $100 million in damage to their organization? Breaking things is generally easier then creating them, so while this sounds difficult, it may not be impossible, and if it CAN be done, it would probably be the fastest path to victory. While there is the obvious destruction of property method, also consider hacking there bank accounts, conning them with a ponzi scheme, and other creative methods. If greed is their motivation, turn it against them.

Next you want to provide opportunities to would be gang-members, increasing the cost of hiring of criminal organizations.

- Negative income tax policy encourages lawful employment
- Tuition subsidies encourages post-secondary school attendance
- A startup incubator similar to y-combinator 'might' encourage entrepreneurship and job creation, although this requires further analysis. This is likely worth doing regardless as it can be self-funding, and will probably scale well with enough time.

So after getting some analysts to look at the studies on the above mentioned issues, and hiring some lobbyists to start pushing the politicians in the right direction, schedule an appointment with the district attorney.

If that is in any way proportional it won't help reduce crime done by low income populations (which is where most of the violent crime happens). It will also cost a horrendous amount to fund the richest of employees, which are arguably also those who need the incentive the least.

**** Economists have suggested a couple different implementations but the one I'd suggest here would maintain progressive taxation, such that the lowest tax bracket might be -30%, but the highest tax brackets are still positive numbers.

So high paid professions would be pretty much the same (perhaps paying slightly more), while the low income population receives more money directly back from the government. This partially offsets the phenomenon where as low income individuals make more money, they lose benefits, and so marginal increases to their income don't increase quality of life to the extent expected.

eg: -30% on the first $35k, 0% on the next 35k, 30% above 70k, and perhaps 37% above 200k

- Think back to the previous training that we have undergone: What skills do we have?

- Schedule a meeting with the district attorney.

- Request relevant information on Arkham from Lucius. We will probably not be able to give feedback yet, however, if we are able to meet with the DA.

- Request information on these imitation supermen through the available channels.

Ignore the crocodiles for now. I'm sure that it has to do with Killer Croc but that's meta-gaming; our Bruce Wayne knows nothing of KC and should be more concerned with other matters. Criminals, not wild animals. Granted, a crocodile in Gotham City is a definite oddity, but there are many explanations besides a criminal one.

  The second report from the three or so Wayne Foundation employees who take you seriously is waiting for you, along with a breakfast courtesy of Alfred; your father's old retainer and your Godfather, who is either staggeringly loyal or playing some vastly deeper game that involves managing your affairs perfectly for ten years in your absence.

  There appears to have been an uptick in mental illness in the city, especially crime-related, and the old Arkham Madhouse has come into the Foundation's hands. Lucius wants your input in determining the renovated version is effective and secure.
#+end_quote

Investigate the nature, severity, and proclivity of mental illness in Gotham. Is Arkham specifically for criminally violent offenders? What is its history? Your personal opinion won't be much use in this situation regarding security, so the quality of construction, treatment policy, and security protocols should be inspected and tested by various Wayne and Gotham inspectors. It obviously needs to be licensed to run, so the asylum itself should be dealt with through the proper channels.

#+begin_quote
  The district attorney is looking to talk to you about improving law enforcement; you remember being pretty close friends when you were younger. You're honestly not sure if it's a coincidence or Alfred's way of nudging you to get back in contact.

  Finally, there have been several “lesser” heroes reported attacking petty criminals in the wake of Superman's disappearance. A guy in medieval-style armor in Metropolis has apparently shot someone, and Gotham Police are investigating several claims that a “ghost” has sabotaged shipments in the docks.
#+end_quote

Should be left to the police to deal with until further notice. If the Wayne Foundation has a resource flow through the Gotham docks, up security personnel and protocols. Vigilantism is rife with criminal concerns itself, so if this issue grows you should support the police wholly. Any security-minding citizen should be willing to go through proper channels to contribute to the safety and well-being of Gotham.

** Go online to check the news. Make sure Alfred isn't lying to you about current events or concealing information. Similarly, phone ahead to confirm the meeting with the DA.

Is Gotham really the best place for us to live? Maybe we should go to NYC to help out in the aftermath of Superman's disappearance. Also, maybe we shouldn't even try to be a hero unless we see an existential threat. I feel like leading a 3rd world country into the modern age through money and stuff might be a more profitable avenue of helping others than fighting crime. No US city has crime worse than what can be found in the 3rd world. I guess we might have political connections here, though.

** You make inquires about Gotham University's Department of Psychology, one of the foremost psychology programs in the world. You suspect that your father's alma mater may be interested in admitting the scion of the Wayne family.

You care about the darkness in the world, your family's foundation has control of an asylum, your father was a doctor, your mother was a philanthropist, and you don't think punching darkness in the face is very effective. Why not heal the darkness?

After all, you thought you saw in one of the documents about Arkham mentions of "attempted reforms" to become a "mental health institution" as other [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunatic#Use_of_the_term_.22lunatic.22_in_legislation][lunatic asylums have recently]]. If your father was a healer of men's bodies, perhaps you could be a healer of men's minds.

((I don't know if you already have a general arc planned, but without Batman's "punch evil in the face" mentality, Bruce is pretty primed to be a psychologist. If this is set in the same timeline as Metropolitan Man, then the setting is the 1930s, and in the real world at this time, organized crime is moving away from liquor, lunatic asylums are becoming mental health facilities, and FDR's New Deals are starting to turn the Depression around. In that atmosphere, with large amounts of money, a childhood friend placed highly in the local justice system, and access to Arkham, Bruce could become quite the noted criminal psychologist.))

((Since Gotham borrows heavily from New York City, [[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/aboutus/history/index.html][Columbia University's history]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_psychology][their functional psychology program]] could be used as a template for his studies. Psychology could put him in close contact with Drs. Strange, Crane and Quinzel. Prefrontal lobotomies and electroshock therapy came into vogue in the 1940s, so a heavy focus on psychology could go rather Gothic. Using what Bruce knows at this point, it's kinda hard to dive into the more meta-game-y aspects of dealing with the vigilantees, except in eventually trying to make them not be vigilantees and actually part of the system.))

*** Global/ish/. From chapter 3:

#+begin_quote
  Superman would show up at misdemeanors in downtown Metropolis, felonies in the greater metropolitan area, and large disasters in the continental United States. Those who had done the math would point out that Superman could reach any point on the planet within an hour, but he only rarely seemed to use this ability; he went to a mine collapse in Peru, a landslide in Bangladesh, and an earthquake in China, but he seemed inconsistent in his ranging.

  He prioritized crimes against people above crimes against property. Murder and forcible rape were almost sure to bring a response, while burglaries often went unstopped. He avoided controversy and grey areas, and tended to stay away from incidents where both parties were at fault. He tended to avoid crimes committed by people in the immigrant neighborhoods, and there was some question about whether this was the result of a language barrier or because Superman harbored some ideas about class or racial purity. There were some members of the Eugenics Society of Metropolis that pointed out that Superman was white.

  Superman didn't participate in any foreign wars, despite repeated requests. There was a civil war in China, and a war between Bolivia and Paraguay in South America. Thousands died, and Superman did nothing, presumably because of his claimed neutrality. It was unknown whether Superman would side with the United States if they once again went to war. In Germany, the National Socialists had risen to power and repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, which was generally agreed to be a worrying development. When the Nazis killed eighty-three people in a political purge, there was much discussion about whether Superman's absence from Germany had been a calculated effort to avoid becoming embroiled in global politics, a tacit endorsement of their politics, or whether he simply hadn't known about it until it was too late.

#+begin_quote
  "I'm surprisingly boring," said Superman with a laugh. "I wake up at five in the morning, circle the planet once to make sure that there's not anything major happening that needs my attention, and then patrol Metropolis looking for places that I can do good."

***** He limited himself to subsonic speeds, in part because he wanted to keep from breaking windows. New York City to Chicago at the speed of sound is roughly an hour, which means that if you care about street-level crime, /most/ of it will be over with by the time you get there.

Aside from that? Superman only speaks English. That makes global work a whole lot more difficult, especially in the 1930s when mass media is much less prevalent. He also does have some anthrocentric leanings - he cares about the United States more than other places, even if he might try not to, and he has a strong connection to Metropolis, not to mention a day job that occasionally requires him to be "on call".

Everything else comes down to his moral stance of unambiguous goods and the practical aspects of trying to be a symbol.

(Though I don't think it ever made it into the fic, I had the idea that later on Superman would realize that over certain distances, it makes the most sense for him to fly upwards at subsonic speeds, move around the planet at top speed once outside of atmosphere, and then slow down again to dive back down to the planet. I sat down to work out the math on what made the most sense at what distance, but then realized that there wasn't really a place where Superman would mention that to anyone, and Superman's viewpoint sections were scrapped pretty early on.)

The big problem was that sonic boom "impact" changes depending on the aerodynamic profile of the object in question, and so far as I could find that information doesn't really exist for a person in flight. And it's also a complicated question because the speed of sound decreases as altitude decreases. Given how many variables there are, and the fact that I wasn't going to use it anyway, I settled on five minutes up, five minutes down as a good-enough guesstimate.
