** I /strongly/ recommend this series. Really well done, rational take on the Highlander universe. It doesn't mess with the underlying premises, it explores characters (canon and OC) and their interactions while being a great action / adventure / romance story.

It's a long series -- multiple novels worth, but divided up into reasonable sized chunks. There's some sex in later "episodes", but nothing terribly egregious. The one I've linked would be fine on US TV in prime time.

*** How much do you need to know about Highlander to enjoy the fanfic?

**** Not much, if anything. Still, here's a short briefing, which is basically what you'd get from the voiceover on the opening credits.

Immortals exist. They heal from anything and come back from the dead if you shoot them, but they die for real if they get their heads cut off. When that happens there's a Quickening where lightning flashes around and the winner "gets the power" of the loser, although that's never clarified. They can sense when another immortal comes, even without line of sight, but it's just "there's someone near" with no direction or exact range. Many immortals go headhunting in order to get power from killing others. Immortals can't have kids.

In addition, Connor MacLeod was the protagonist of the original movie, Duncan MacLeod was the protagonist of the TV series, and Methos is the oldest living immortal -- roughly 5,000 years old. He has a dark past that he's mostly put behind him. Mostly.

***** So there are no obvious benefits to "getting the power"? Why does anybody bother?
