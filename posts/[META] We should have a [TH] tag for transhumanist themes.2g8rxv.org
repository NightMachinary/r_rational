Two works that would be best classified as transhumanist rather than hard SF were posted within the last few days: [[https://pay.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2g6ffg/to_the_stars_puella_magica_ad_astra_hsf_magical/][To the Stars]], [[https://pay.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2g1f7m/hsfish_eclipse_phase_a_roleplaying_game_of/][Eclipse Phase]]. I am certain there are others.

These are not always rational or rationalist fiction, but the overlap in people who would enjoy them tends to be significant enough that they show up on this subreddit with some frequency anyway. Having a new tag would help tell them apart.

** How many tags do we really need? I understand the need for categorization, but I don't think we need a tag for every single thing. If it's got stuff in it to appeal to the [[/r/rational]] folks, I think it's fine here, tag or no tag.

*** Hmm. Looking at our current tag system, they seem to fall into a couple of categories:

- rational-ness of a story

- genre of a story

- I'm writing something

- other topics

To avoid tag overload, how about just removing genre tags? That still maintains the distinction between posting a finished sotry, talking about a WIP, and general discussion; and I think simplifies the system nicely. I'll do this in the morning, I think.

**** Meh. I first added the genre tags to deal with the complaining about whether fics should or shouldn't be posted, and it's seemed to deal with that quite well. But I agree that [RT] and [RST] do away with some of that - brilliant thinking with those, by the way. Huge fan of the reorganized characteristics.

Looking at the genre tags, [Mk] isn't even in the official listing, and [DC] hardly ever pops up. Those two can be lumped under "rational", anyway. And [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness][[HSF]]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson#Sanderson.27s_Laws][[HF]]] were just an experiment - for a little while, nobody posted anything here, so I decided to open it up to the Hard Fiction crowd (still underrepresented on reddit). I've been pleased to see many people posting stories with [HF] and [HSF] labels as time progressed, and I still feel like there are wealths of literature in those genres that remain untapped in this sub. I don't know how I'd feel about their exclusion.

Up to you, ultimately. We chose you carefully, so I'll leave it to your judgement. I look forward to seeing your decision.

**** Removing genre tags does help make things more straight forward. I think though it might be a good idea to make an official thread about this before implementing the change. So you get more feedback on the idea and reach a general census.

Personally, I have always found genre tags useful before diving into a read. (seraphnb) And the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=%5BDC%5D&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all&count=25&after=t3_1vy3el][DC tag for example]] allowed us to post loads of relevant interesting content. Some that we might have otherwise hesitated to post under a RT tag - RT has always been serious business :P

**** Oh, and while I'm looking at the sidebar:

- The first sentence of the first paragraph is missing the word "fiction".

- I think the explanation also negates the need for the lesswrong link on the word "rationalist".

- Wise reading was a fun idea, but despite my attempts to push it, it never took on. I think the link should stay, but doesn't deserve a whole paragraph to itself. It sort of takes away from the bit about reposting and spoilers - which come up much more frequently.

- On that note, yeah, those two tidbits should be better emphasized.

- The rational / rationalist fiction bit takes up a lot of space ... Theoretically, it could be replaced with a link to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2el9lr/on_the_distinction_between_rational_fiction_and/][your post explaining it]], but that's more of a aesthetic nitpick than a substantial one. Hardly important.

***** Mostly done. I think the changes are small enough that we don't need a plebiscite, if someone has a strong opinion we'll here it in a sub this size.

While it does take a fair bit of space, I think it's worth keeping the whole rational-and-rationalist bit there - it is after all the purpose of the sub!

** This is a good idea, Id much rather be reading a story I know that has a goal to using resources and common sense to advance human race. I learned about cryonics being applicable in real life, other TH works could teach people about thins as well.

But since were on the topic of accurate tags for books and such, wouldn't it be better to just add a simple number score when posting, something like:

RT 1 (or lowest) Book X

Where the plot is written with a little bit hindsight and occasional common sense.

and

RT 10 (top) Where the plot is based on introducing and calculating every aspect of a certain unusual object or occurrence like magic or aliens, and them the story is just natural progression of what happens next.

I mean this as means to tell apart low and high RT and RST

**** Ok no scales then, but any sort of way to determine the level of rationality lesson, rational world building or even competence porn would be great.

Example:

HPMOR: High rationality, low to medium rational world, medium competence porn, low amounts of hard science fiction.

It's been a while since I read it so this, so my estimate may be wrong.
