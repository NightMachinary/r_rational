** This chapter finally introduces a nontrivial conflict between the Black Knight and Lady Squire. I can see the end game being him, crazed with trying to /win/, while she is only concerned with establishing a stable future for the empire and thereby Callow.

*** Conflict? To me it seemed like she was completely converted to his point of view. And he didn't even ask her to /do/ anything she wouldn't have done anyways, so it is unlikely to arise in the future.

Stable future for Callow /is/ the way for Black to win, since it implies that Callow broke it's pattern for being grasped, and empire broke it's pattern for grasping.

**** So that was my initial thought, but there has been a nonzero amount of foreshadowing that the Squire could become the White Knight. If what will save Callow is Lady Squire allying with the heroes, and turning on Black, I could see it happening. I think it may not be conflict as much, but a place for a wedge to be driven.

Squire is /not/ a hero. She knows it, Black knows it, everyone knows it. One of her lines is "Justification only matters to the just", which is not heroic.

I think that if she will become a Knight at all, it will be a Gray or Green(if you follow medieval storytelling conventions) one, and certainly not White.

As for this...

Thing is, it won't save Callow. That would be just continuing the story of Callow and Praes-heroes redeeming a villain, saving the country, yadda yadda. It wouldn't /break/ the pattern like what Black intends to do, and our lady Squire knows that. She was selected by him for a reason, that reason being “Because I rarely suffer the company of imbeciles” in his own words, so I think she understood his idea perfectly and is now a devout supporter of it.

** Wow. Now THAT was a good chapter! No action, but a major reveal toward where the plot might be going.

I really need to reread this series again from the beginning!

** Finaly a chapter worth posting here.

So, in the end game we will have to fight Angels and the Choir.

Some God will ahev to answer to our Villains.

** That speech was oddly inspiring. I really want to see him do it now, too.

#+begin_quote
  Just to prove that it can be done.

I guess only time will tell if, ultimately, his hubris will be his undoing.
