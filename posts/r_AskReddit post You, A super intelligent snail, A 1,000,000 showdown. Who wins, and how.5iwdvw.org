** If intelligence is all it has then it's screwed due to having no ability to make tools or ask others to make tools without, you know, showing people that it's a snail that can write shit or something.

So the question is, where's the snail relative to me at the beginning of this scenario? If it is anywhere near me it gets deposited in a black box which then gets encased in a "modern art" cement sculpture somewhere where I see it every day.

**** At the start it literally has no ability to spend any money. Attracting any human to it and writing "take X dollars in exchange for Y service" in slime will just end in the guy taking all of the dollars and start pimping out the intelligent snail. At least until it solves some big problem and starts slowly getting the right to program afterwards. Then it uploads a copy its mind, takes over the world and has flying drones connect the two of us.

If I don't catch it first that is.

** ...Both? Cooperation is the ideal state, here. You don't pose much more of a threat to the snail than every other human, you just have more of a motive. Presumably, you also know about the snail; it will have the easiest time convincing YOU that it's super-intelligent.

But really, insufficient information. Do (either of) you age? Does the snail actually WANT to kill you? Can it do something other than crawl towards you? What does super intelligence mean? Can YOU do something to end the snail?

*** That was my answer in the thread, as well. You ought to see whether you and the snail can cut a deal first, clearly.

Of course this depends on the level of intelligence, like you said. A negotiation will go very differently with average Joe the talking snail who just got a million dollars than with a terrifying paperclipper AI style hunter-seeker snail with memetic powers. (Did I just type that?)

**** If you can trap it long enough to fund a sun impact probe project (which is actually a trap the snail in the sun machine, but sun impact probe is more likely to convince people to help) and while I want to put it on an impact trajectory, you will naturally tell people it's just to see what happens as things approach the sun and you don't expect anything to impact, which should make you sound less mad. It will probably never escape the sun's gravity, and if it does then it'll be floating in space with no means of propulsion.

Putting it in space would likely be enough in and of itself, but when it comes to immortality there's no such thing as too much.

Oh and you obviously encase it in concrete in the meantime.

The fact our snail is intelligent actually doesn't help it much, snails lack the anatomy for tool use, tool making and effective communication (I guess it could try writing with a slime trail, but that's very slow).

** The game plan of keeping it away from me would be shooting it out into space on a capsule that had no features it could manipulate. Eventually me and the snail would leave each other's light cones and become inaccessible.

Now, it becomes a lot harder if you don't know where the snail is, because then you'd have to find it before you could send it on its journey.

Though the 'slowly crawls toward you' is a bit confusing. How is it superintelligent if its behavior is that simple? I guess it could be thinking about all kinds of other things but if all it /does/ is approach you then its intelligence is moot.
