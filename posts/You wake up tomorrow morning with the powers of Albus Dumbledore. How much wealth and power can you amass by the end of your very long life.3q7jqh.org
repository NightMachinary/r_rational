** hmm... so i have a large pool of dubious magics, undefined by canon. i have magic enough to be tied for most powerful wizard in combat, and i have transfiguration. presumably, i can cast every spell in canon, or very close. If transfiguration is permanant... use that to launder gold and other, more useful, raw materials. sell them, probably on the black market at first, or other places. eventually, upgrade to making them consistently.

If transfiguration can change one chemical into another, at any time i can cause massive devastation with FOOF or other explosive chemicals, in addition to standard combat techniques, for self defence.

I suspect I'll eventually accidentally commit suicide by chemical accident, but until then... I'll make money by turning something into something else.

Imperio has potential as well, as does aparation, but most techniques aren't that useful, at least not in HP canon. Edited in new ones after a good night's sleep: Cheering charms, now that i think about it, could make a reasonably effective depression-retardant, if they don't create a dependency.

While the limitations on portkeys are unknown, these are fanon ones that sound likely- (portkeys are two way- so i could create a portkey to mars, but i'd need to send it there. portkeys can only go to a destination you can visualize accurately- so portkeys don't work unless there's a highly functional map with excessive detail- how convenient that these things might exist.)

take a career making magical paintings, and paint at least four copies of myself. test for sentience, as well as memory retention. if this is the case, see if i can make magical cameras that make fully functional paintings, capable of interacting with the outside world. (photographs are clearly inferior to paintings in harry potter canon, they cannot talk, to start with. they might pass a turing test anyways, but it needs to be checked.) If not, upload my freinds and family anyways, but wait to upload anyone else, save the most useful- i might have more important things to do then add a few centuries to someone's life, and this isn't immortality- only the lifespan of a very well cared for painting.

** 1. Make a wand with some old tree's wood and the only magical material I have access to-- my own blood, hair, etc.

It probably won't work too well, but I'm Dumbledore, so it should be more than enough for my goals.

1. Make a Horcrux (only one, so I don't get too ugly) with the death of a vile criminal. My life is vastly more important than some evil criminal's since I can fix the world's problems. Protect the Horcrux with every protection I can give it, and hide it somewhere safe.

2. Reveal myself publicly and show my abilities.

3. Use Gubraithian fire (canon charm that makes fire brun eternally, mentioned in Order of the Phoenix) to make power plants that run forever with no inputs of energy. I have now beaten entropy and heat death.

4. Funnel proceeds of the clean energy plants to foundations designed to solve the world's most pressing problems.

5. Control, through the Imperius Curse, every halfway unstable country in the world. Gradually dismantle North Korea, Iran, radical Islamist terror factions, etc.

With unlimited clean energy I'm basically as wealthy as I want to be, even without any transfiguration to make any expensive material (except Gold or food) I want, charms to increase the amount of something that I have, and charms to make materials very strong (the Unbreakable Charm has unknown limitations but presumably could make stuff like the space elevator possible without exotic materials). Those are just cherries on the top.

Basically leverage my massive economic and political power to make the world a better place.

**** Given the hilarious abilities of HP magic, even just as used in canon, as well as JK. Rowling's statements on the nature of magic (she said it is superior over mundane nature), I'm pretty confident that with HP magic and Albus's abilities, entropy and heat death will be a thing of the past.

Quick summary of everything in canon that shits all over thermodynamics:

1. The fact that magic is effortless and doesn't drain the caster in any way means that ignoring the mental fatigue that comes with concentration, magic is unlimited in how often it can be cast. Basically you don't 'run out of magic' in canon.

2. Every instance of transfiguration or conjuration, though given that conjuration is not permanent, and transfiguration is permanent, the former is more relevant.

3. Every instance of charms that make objects move on their own.

4. Reparo Charm

5. The Geminio charm as used on Hufflepuff's Cup in Bellatrix's vault makes copies of objects, though they may dissapear in some way eventually.

6. The fact that magic allows easy shrinking and enlarging of objects (AKA destorying and creating mass)

7. The many possible sources of limitless free energy in canon-- Gubraithian flames, Levitation charms, conjuring gasoline for engines, Incendio to create fire, charms to make objects move on their own, charms to create light for plants to grow from and then be burned for fuel, etc.

8. Unbreakable Charm, which can increase the strength of materials to an unknown degree-- presumably to 'unbreakable by mundane methods' levels, but we don't see these much in canon, so we don't really know.

If your argument is that the energy for magic may be coming from somewhere else-- there's no evidence for that in canon, its never mentioned.

That doesn't mean that the energy comes from nowhere. To say you've "solved" heat death, you would have to /prove that in-universe./ It doesn't even matter what canon says, because you don't know that J.K. Rowling's stories are the consistent canon that perfectly describes this hypothetical world. J.K. Rowling's stories are neither obviously consistent nor perfectly precise as descriptions of a world. The point of HPMOR is that you have to do science to magic because /what is real is not always apparent./

Relying on appearance and intuition to say things like "objects move on their own," "the only cost of magic is concentration," "Reparo reverses object-local time," "this fire burns forever, even though we have not tested that assertion and /can't/," "mass-energy is not universally conserved when transfiguring, conjuring, vanishing, replicating, shrinking, growing, etc.": /all/ of these hypotheses are entirely reliant on that which is /apparent/ being the /only/ fact of the matter.

The observations you're claiming as evidence are still consistent with a world where conservation of mass-energy and the second law of thermodynamics hold true, and there's no evidence for those principles being /violated/ in canon. You /cannot say/ that magic simply "fixes entropy" in the space of canon-consistent worlds. You can already disregard entropy as a problem without resorting to rejecting it without justification.

****** I agree with you its possible HP canon is a world where actually thermodynamics is followed. It's just so much more parsimonious to assume that what we see in canon is actually what's happening.

I can't prove HP magic overcomes entropy-- I can say pretty categorically that the magic in Harry Potter gives every appearance of disregarding physics as we know it entirely.

Why should we posit complicated hypotheses to explain the apparent violation of thermodynamics in canon as really just an elaborate technology when we can go with the perfectly reasonable explanation of "Physics as we know it in our universe is subordinate to magic in HP's universe. "

Well HPMOR suffers from the flaw that it makes Harry the only real scientist in Harry Potter world, which doesn't gel with canon. In-canon, there is an active academic community making advances in magic-- there's at least one magical scholarly journal we know of, "Transfiguration Today", that presumably is constantly advancing the field.

So I'm not sure why you're bringing it up as if it proves anything. In canon, Harry isn't interested in the academic side of magic-- so we don't see it. We do see obvious hints of a world where magic is constantly being advanced, hinting at some sort of scientific community.

#+end_quote

By what metric are you comparing them? I guarantee you it isn't math. Saying that physics is subordinate is faux simplicity; you're using associative intuition to hide the actual complexity of the hypothesis. We have two very elegant descriptions of reality in comparison, and many hypotheses that are well-supported even outside those theories, like the second law of thermodynamics and conservation of mass-energy. A world of magic does not "supersede" some "natural order," because a world of magic has magic written /into its physics./ Magic is /natural./ The unifying theory has to account for magic, and it has to account for the petabytes of physical data we've gathered.

/Apparent/ deviations from things like the second law of thermodynamics have to be explained, because without magic (and there's no way to know if the observations were actually performed /without/ magic without /developing a theory of magic!/), we have observed massive amounts of evidence for a specific set of world-states, and somehow no data for this massive expansion of configuration space, and it is very important that we /ascertain/ that magic "reverses entropy," or whatever crap you're assuming in your OP. You cannot simply say that magic disregards all of that data; you have to /verify it./ Even if you as a worldbuilder wave your wand of Authorial Fiat over the setting, you as a /character/ do not know it to be a fact, even if you assume it in the unjustified way you're claiming is justified.

#+begin_quote

Tautologically. That doesn't mean that all that is happening is seen.

And if you're bringing up academia in Harry Potter, might I point out that you can't actually conjure permanent objects or transfigure food? There is evidence in canon for magic's non-world-breaking properties!

After that, try to nudge policy in a low-conflict direction, basically. Eliminate nuclear weapon stockpiles (not in a widely advertised manner) in the hands of regimes I don't trust (i.e. pretty much every non-western ones). Get Putin to self-destruct, just in case. Possibly create a mass hallucination in two or three ISIS locations to get them to radically alter their religious beliefs towards more peaceful ends.

After that, it's nudging different government to a) get increased funding for AI research and b) pass a few legislations I like.

And once that's done, basically back to hedonism. I can get everything I want with a flick of my finger, life isn't hard.
