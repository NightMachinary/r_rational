  German potato salad, which has bacon in it
#+end_quote

/Nein!/

Okay, impromptu cooking lesson/rant here. I know that to most people, potato salad isn't the most important food on Earth, but I won't ever accept that. It's perfect in every conceivable way! The right kind of potato salad, that is.

In Germany, there are two kinds of potato salad, which makes "German potato salad" in itself an insufficient descriptor. It's even worse than that. Potato salad from Northern Germany is an /abomination/, a heresy of the utmost degree. It contains mayonnaise, for Christ's sake! (When someone offers you potato salad with mayonnaise, don't even try it. It will be bad.)^{0}

Southern potato salad, however, is the food of the gods. Cook waxy potatoes (Yukon Gold, for you Americans.^{1} My German Grandma insists on the Sieglinde variety, which have become rather rare after the patent on it expired recently) until they are just done. Use a mandoline, or a knife and a serious amount of skill, to cut the still-warm potatoes into 2-3mm thin slices. Toss with oil, vegetable broth and vinegar until a somewhat gloopy vinaigrette forms.

This is the most basic Southern German potato salad possible. An enhancement that should be considered part of the core package are raw onions, diced as finely as possible (look into rapid pickling if you fear the onions' bite, and pour the boiling vegetable broth directly over the onions before tossing the salad). Also, mustard is /remarkably/ awesome, but more than a teaspoon per two pounds of potatoes is excessive.^{2}

Once you've got the basics down, you can go wild. Add chives, pickles, dill, julienned carrots, whatever tickles your fancy (though not everything at once, please, the potatoes are too important to overshadow). Maybe even bacon, I'm not a purist. But if you take anything away from this rant, let it be that "German" potato salad shouldn't /ever/ contain mayonnaise.

Also, typo I guess, "she'd probable been clinically dead" needs to be "probably", but who cares about that when there are potato salad rants to be had!

--------------

^{0} Okay, I'd still eat it, but I'm a starving student. I once ate bread that I baked from a dough that had fermented in my fridge long enough that the yeast had produced a noticeable amount of alcohol /which had then turned to vinegar/.

^{1} Actually, more ambitious Americans should look for Fingerling Potatoes, which have a hint of sweetness to them. You probably won't find them, though. A workaround suggested by Kenji from SeriousEats is to [[http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/07/erdapfelsalat-austrian-style-potato-salad-recipe.html][store the potatoes in the fridge]] to force them to convert starches to sugar. However, if you're in a hurry, a pinch of sugar does a lot for otherwise bland potatoes.

The issue of storage is interesting in particular. If your potatoes start sprouting, don't throw them away! They lose moisture and starch to grow their tentacley appendages, which causes their flavour to be intensely concentrated. Perfect for potato salad, in which the flavour of the potatoes takes center stage!

Look, the point is that I could talk for hours about the potatoes alone, get back to the main comment.

^{2} As excessive as this rant? This rant isn't excessive at all, because I believe potato salad to be the ultimate form of potatoes. Fries? Crispy, yeah, but is their every component optimized towards full potato flavour? Fuck no. Mashed potatoes? Even the most luxurious and creamy of French Pommes Pur√©e isn't the best form of potatoes, because it's more butter than potato, and it gets better the more butter you add to it. Croquettes? You're getting closer, but Croquettes are basically breaded and fried mashed potatoes, and we've been there already. Schupfnudeln? Don't pretend you know what that is. Sure, they're awesome, but /potato salad/. Hash Browns? I think I'll stop here, it's clear that we're scraping the bottom of the barrel.^{3}

^{3} We're not. I could do Bubba's shrimp joke from /Forrest Gump/ with potatoes.

*** I don't actually use a recipe when I make it, but the recipe that I have on file calls for bacon /in part/ so that you can use bacon grease to toss rather than oil, and thinly sliced spring onions rather than raw onion (though growing up, my dad did raw onion). Other than that, white wine vinegar, salt, pepper, and a little bit of flour to thicken the "dressing" up a bit. Dad used finely-chopped parsley and other herbs from the garden, I generally don't.

I had no idea there was a distinction between Northern German and Southern German potato salad; the Northern German variety sounds so similar to the regular Americana variety of potato salad that the cleaving distinction probably wasn't that useful to middle Americans.

**** I'm glad to see that you don't put mayonnaise into your potato salad ;)

Overall your choices seem interesting (spring onions in particular are something I've already tried and can recommend). However, there are two points that puzzle me. First, doesn't bacon grease turn solid at room temperature? I would have expected that to ruin the mouthfeel. Second, adding flour to your dressing seems a bit weird. Do you cook it like a roux? If not, do you like the taste of raw flour, or what's going on here? If you toss the potatoes while warm, the starches in the potatoes should be more than enough to thicken the dressing, in my experience.

Thank you for writing, as always. Worth the Candle is awesome.

***** Yes, it's cooked like a roux. The bacon is cooked in a skillet, then that skillet is used for making the dressing. We never really eat it at room temperature, it was served as warm/hot as possible, so congealing isn't an issue. (And yes, having a "hot" side dish is somewhat inconvenient for picnics, but generally considered worth it.)

****** Okay, that explains it. Warm potato salad is great, and your particular version of it seems very interesting (though I'm a vegetarian, I might cook it for others sometime). I'd advise you to give the cold version a try as well :) The differences between hot and cold can be pretty big, flavour-wise.

**** Haha, thank you! The intent certainly was to entertain :)

If you're a first-time potato salad cook, here's some more tips:

- Don't mind the potato slices breaking, because that happens anyway while tossing them. As long as it doesn't turn into complete mush, it's fine.

- It's fine to just kinda guess, as far as the dressing goes. You'll probably need a cup of broth and quite a few tablespoons of oil and vinegar, but it's not an exact science because the potatoes can vary. It'll be fine :)

** Yup, regrowing the hand didn't fix the boneitis. Because his soul is affected, not just the bones.

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúAnyway, the idea is basically that the soul has a blueprint of the body, and the bones are the scaffolding that everything hangs off of, with their own local blueprint copies,‚Äù said Fenn. ‚ÄúHe kind of went on for a long time about whether ‚Äòscaffolding theory' or ‚Äòblueprint theory' sounded better, wanted to get my advice, that kind of thing, it was a very poor use of my time. He thinks that some healing works off what the scaffold says and some works off what the blueprint says. Like, I guess, if you had some shingles blow off your house, you'd know where you needed to put new shingles just by looking, right, because there's nowhere they could go, but if a wing of your house got wrecked by a tornado you'd have to look at the blueprint to figure out how to rebuild. Sorry, I feel like I'm making a hash of it.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúNo, you're doing fine,‚Äù I replied.

  ‚ÄúOh, good,‚Äù said Fenn. ‚ÄúBut to get at the actual question, the problem seems to be that when you drain bones, you're not affecting the scaffold, or not just, you're actually fucking with the blueprint. So your finger gets hurt and asks the nearest bone, ‚Äòhey, what should I do about this?‚Äò but that bone is basically dead and doesn't respond back, which means that the finger needs to go somewhere else and get an answer to the same question, which takes longer and maybe in the middle of this conversation things get screwed up because of the distance. That's my layman's understanding, anyway.‚Äù
#+end_quote

Looking back at it, raccoon-guy's explanation confused me because it didn't actually explain why draining bones would affect the soul.

My theory is that the magic in the bones is an /expression/ or /manifestation/ of (a part of) Juniper's soul (rather than just a /copy/ of some part of it), and draining it literally damaged his soul in some way.

I am surprised Fenn's loyalty didn't increase when she found out what Juniper did for her especially since she was shaken enough about it to share with Juniper the knowledge of why it was so significant to her beyond just the fact he saved her life. Unless if the whole thing just creeped her out and she was just being polite by explaining what it meant?

And damn how much of this is actually planned by the DM God? Joon's abilities, his levelling up and him being a suitable donor to Fenn.. It really makes you wonder how much of it is Joon being too paranoid and over thinking things, and how much of it is the DM pulling the strings on their lives. Hopefully Fenn will be alright but man this was too close for comfort.

** I don't really get how magical healing works. It is really weird that Solace was able to put back Fenn from being literally in two pieces (which is an astounding feat, operations to reconnect even a finger are incredibly complicated) but was unable to treat the blood loss problem. In the same vain, why bone magic isn't enough to treat the blood loss? If I remember correctly, bone magic enhances the body natural healing. replenishing blood is natural body function, so I would expect bone magic to work here...

In any other story, I would probably suspend my disbelief, but here, I can't help but wonder if it's all a plot by the DM... (Creating a specific situation where Joon can save Fenn's life using blood magic...)

By the way, this is a great story, and I'm quite enjoying it. Thanks for writing!

*** My guess is that the reason they don't interact has to do with the fact that they're both types of magic. From a game-mechanical perspective, blood magic costs you blood to use, and if you could circumvent that with bone magic, their synergy might be too strong.

From an in-universe perspective, creating magic from magic might be hard to do. I'm trying to think of counter-examples, but the most obvious ones are consequences of leveling up, not "normal" magic. Blood is produced by a the body as a result of its natural processes, but it's not just blood, it's also ki, or something like it. IIRC, fairies don't heal blood loss either, but that's hard to explicitly search the text for, so I might be wrong there.
